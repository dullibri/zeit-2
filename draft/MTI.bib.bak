	into temporary but tightly-focused storylines, to identify prevalent
	topics and key entities within these stories, and to reveal the temporal
	structure of stories as they evolve. We achieve this by building
	a hybrid clustering and topic model. To deal with the available wealth
	of data we build an efficient parallel inference algorithm by sequential
	Monte Carlo estimation. Time and memory costs are nearly constant
	in the length of the history, and the approach scales to hundreds
	of thousands of documents. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy
	on the publicly available TDT dataset and data of a major internet

	First, we show that augmenting benchmark autoregressive models with

	forecasts of GDP growth compared to those obtained by the benchmark
	model. Second, the accuracy of out-of-sample forecasts obtained with

	with established economic indicators in both countries, such as the
	Ifo Business Climate Index and the ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment
	for Germany, and the KOF Economic Barometer and the Purchasing Managers
	Index in manufacturing for Switzerland. Third, we show that the RWI-based
	forecasts are more accurate than the consensus forecasts (published
	by Consensus Economics Inc.) for Switzerland, whereas we reach the
	opposite conclusion for Germany. In fact, the accuracy of the consensus
	forecasts of GDP growth for Germany appears to be superior to that
	of any other indicator considered in our study. These results are
	robust to changes in estimation/forecast samples, the use of rolling
	vs expanding estimation windows, and the inclusion of a web-based

  abstract = {The news media affect consumers? perceptions of the economy through
	three channels. First, the news media convey the latest economic
	data and the opinions of professionals to consumers. Second, consumers
	receive a signal about the economy through the tone and volume of
	economic reporting. Last, the greater the volume of news about the
	economy, the greater the likelihood that consumers will update their
	expectations about the economy. We find evidence that all three of
	these channels affect consumer sentiment. We derive measures of the
	tone and volume of economic reporting, building upon the R-word index
	of The Economist. We find that there are periods when reporting on
	the economy has not been consistent with actual economic events,
	especially during the early 1990s. As a consequence, there are times
	during which consumer sentiment is driven away from what economic
	fundamentals would suggest. We also find evidence supporting that
	consumers update their expectations about the economy much more frequently
	during periods of high news coverage than in periods of low news
	coverage; high news coverage of the economy is concentrated during
	recessions and immediately after recessions, implying that ?stickiness?
	in expectations is countercyclical. Finally, because the model of
	consumer sentiment is highly nonlinear, month-tomonth changes in
	sentiment are difficult to interpret. For instance, although an increase
	in the number of articles that mention ?recession? typically is associated
	with a decline in sentiment, under certain conditions it can actually
	result in an increase in various sentiment indexes.}

	observe the results of a dynamic process spreading over the edges
	of the network. The task then is to infer the edges and the dynamics
	of the underlying network. We develop an on-line algorithm that relies
	on stochastic convex optimization to efficiently solve the dynamic

	diffusion among 3.3 million mainstream media and blog sites and experiment
	with more than 179 million different pieces of information spreading
	over the network in a one year period. We study the evolution of
	information pathways in the online media space and find interesting

	stable across time than for on-going news events. Clusters of news

	of news on business cycles. Using a VAR approach, we find evidence

	Furthermore, we test whether news on aggregate developments affect

	information is more likely to be picked up by all media than sector-specific
	information, these news are also more likely to be transmitted to
	all firms, whereas sector-specific news are only transmitted to those
	firms that happen to consume the specific report. Veldkamp and Wolfers
	(2006) show that such an effect could explain one of the puzzles
	in the business cycle literature, namely the excess comovement of
	output across sectors as compared to lower comovement of total factor
	productivity (TFP) across sectors. Our findings suggest that aggregate
	news indeed affect firms expectations more than sector-specific news.
	We conclude that strategic information complementarities could be
	an important explanation for actual business cycle comovements.},

  abstract = {Many approaches to automatic sentiment analysis begin with a large
	lexicon of words marked with their prior polarity (also called semantic
	orientation). However, the contextual polarity of the phrase in which
	a particular instance of a word appears may be quite different from
	the word?s prior polarity. Positive words are used in phrases expressing
	negative sentiments, or vice versa. Also, quite often words that
	are positive or negative out of context are neutral in context, meaning
	they are not even being used to express a sentiment. The goal of
	this work is to automatically distinguish between prior and contextual
	polarity, with a focus on understanding which features are important
	for this task. Because an important aspect of the problem is identifying
	when polar terms are being used in neutral contexts, features for
	distinguishing between neutral and polar instances are evaluated,
	as well as features for distinguishing between positive and negative
	contextual polarity. The evaluation includes assessing the performance
	of features across multiple machine learning algorithms. For all
	learning algorithms except one, the combination of all features together
	gives the best performance. Another facet of the evaluation considers
	how the presence of neutral instances affects the performance of
	features for distinguishing between positive and negative polarity.
	These experiments show that the presence of neutral instances greatly
	degrades the performance of these features, and that perhaps the
	best way to improve performance across all polarity classes is to
	improve the system?s ability to identify when an instance is neutral.},

	and management of data, there are only a few software packages that
	apply natural language processing to identify semantic concepts such
	as issue categories or political statements by actors. Although these
	procedures usually allow efficient data collection, most have difficulty
	in achieving sufficient accuracy because of the high complexity and
	mutual relationships of the variables used in the social sciences.
	To address these flaws, we suggest a (semi-) automatic annotation
	approach that implements an innovative coding method (Core Sentence
	Analysis) by computational linguistic techniques (mainly entity recognition,
	concept identification, and dependency parsing). Although such computational
	linguistic tools have been readily available for quite a long time,
	social scientists have made astonishingly little use of them. The
	principal aim of this article is to gather data on party-issue relationships
	from newspaper articles. In the first stage, we try to recognize
	relations between parties and issues with a fully automated system.
	This recognition is extensively tested against manually annotated
	data of the coverage in the boulevard newspaper Blick of the Swiss
	national parliamentary elections of 2003 and 2007. In the second
	stage, we discuss possibilities for extending our approach, such
	as by enriching these relations with directional measures indicating
	their polarity.}},

	The authors first build gazetteers (reference databases) on the actors
	and issues and then apply CSA which reduces the sentences to its
	basic elements like lemmas (base form of inflected verbs). Then,
	named entity recognition is applied whereby the gazetteer is related
	to the text taking care of anaphoras (pronouns and noun phrases).
	As anaphora resultion is still not exact, the pronouns are only resolved
	to the respective actor, if the former occurs in the preceeding sentence.
	Issues are usually identified with the help of further keywords.
	Then, the syntatic analysis is applied using Constraint Dependency
	Grammar Parser CDG in order to make out dependencies. However, long
	sentences will take several minutes to be parsed. Therefore, the
	time limit is set to 90 seconds to identify the structure. Parsers
	in the best of all cases would identify core sentences such as actor/predicate/issue.
	In order to check there results the authors rely on the annotations
	of two different coders. The automated results may then be checked
	against this gold standard using the recall (the share of true positives
	to the sum of true positives and false positives always with respect
	to the gold standard), the precision (true positives as a ratio of
	true positives and false positives), and the harmonic mean of the
	former giving the F-score. The two different coders are checked against
	each other, as well. The applied recognition methods are all actors
	and issues in one article (alI), actors and issues within three sentences
	(+-1), and actors and issues in one sentence (sentence). Improvements
	on these approaches are attach issues only to the nearest actor limited
	to the preceding, the same and the following article. Furthermore,
	the subjekt filter is employed where either the actor or the issue
	must occur as part of a subject dependency. Finally, the most complicated
	approach relies on the minimal dependencies path identified by the
	parser (parse tree distance).},
