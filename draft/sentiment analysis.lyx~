\begin_layout Subsection
Automatic sentiment indexes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We downloaded 15,447 articles of the economics section of the weekly newspaper
 
\shape italic
Die Zeit
\shape default
 that have been published between 2000:1 and 2014:03 from its publically
 available online archive.
 Of these we identified 958 articles concerned with inflation, that is,
 articles that contain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Inflation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or synoyms.
 We extract the sentiment of news articles using a lexicon based algorithm
 in the line of Taboada (2011).
 The software for the implementation is the qdap package (see Rinker, 2013)
 in the open Software project R (see R Core Team, 2013).
 Each article is attributed a sentiment value, 
\begin_inset Formula $ArticleValue$
\end_inset

, defined as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
ArticleValue=\frac{\Sigma_{j}^{N}wordvalue_{j}\times n_{j}}{N},
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $wordvalue_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the sentiment value attributed to word 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,...,N$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the number of words of the respective article.
 The value is based on the lexicon SentimentWortschatz (see Remus et al.,
 2010), or SentiWS for short.
 It is a publicly available German-language resource for sentiment analysis.
 It contains positive and negative sentiment bearing words weighted within
 the interval of [-1; 1] plus their part of speech tag (adjective, adverbs,
 nouns, and verbs), and if applicable, their inflections.
 The version employed here (SentiWS v1.8b) contains 1,650 negative and 1,818
 positive words, which, together with their inflections, sum up to 16,406
 positive and 16,328 negative, respectively.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In SentiWS there are words that have different parts of speach and can thus
 have different word values, correspondingly.
 However, tagging of parts of speach automatically is very time consuming
 and still very inaccurate.
 As an alternative, we make use of the fact that in German, nouns always
 have upper-case letters which can be exploited to easily identify them
 in a text.
 In contrast to sentiment analysis for English we do not convert upper-case
 letters to lower-cases letters.
 Thus, this leads to small error, as lower-case at the beginnig of a sentence
 will not be correctly identified.
 However, this leaves only a small fraction of about 100 (lowercase) words
 that can not be attributed a unique value.
 Thus, are dropped from the lexicon prior to the analysis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, the value found in the lexicon is refined in the following way.
 If negators like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nicht
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (no)
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For example, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is negative.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 are found in the proximity (4 words before and 2 words after the word)
 and if the number of negators is odd the polarity of a word is inverted.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two indexes are computed as the monthly averages of 
\shape italic
ArticleValue, Zeit, based on all articles, Zeit Inflation that is on the
 articles concerned with inflation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, using the online news archive Genios covering all major German
 newspapers, we construct a simple word count index (Genios) of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Inflation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and its synonyms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Human sentiment indexes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Media Tenor International employs human analysts to rate news in TV and
 print media (see Table ????) among others according to the time reference,
 the polarity (positive, negative, neutral) and to categories.
 Here, we use a total of 51,304 economic news items from 2000:01 to 2014:03
 to compute the 15 indexes.
 The first group of variables is based on all items (
\shape italic
All
\shape default
), items refering to the 
\shape italic
Present
\shape default
, and 
\shape italic
Future
\shape default
, items related the exchange rate, monetary policy, and interest rates (
\shape italic
Monetary
\shape default
), 
\shape italic
Inflation
\shape default
, 
\shape italic
Taxation
\shape default
, the business cycle (
\shape italic
Cycle
\shape default
), the labor market (
\shape italic
Labor
\shape default
), and the government budget (
\shape italic
Budget
\shape default
).
 Those indexes are computed as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
B_{it}=\frac{A_{it}^{+}-A_{it}^{-}}{A_{it}^{+}+A_{it}^{-}+A_{it}^{0}}\times100,\label{eq:mti indexes}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{it}$
\end_inset

 is the positive (+), negative (-) or neutral (0) rating of item 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 A second group of variables is the same as employed by Lamla ???? and is
 based on subcategories of 
\shape italic
Inflation.
 
\shape default
As there are comparatively few items (1195) available, they are mere word
 counts.
 
\family roman
\series medium
\shape up
\size normal
\emph off
\bar no
\strikeout off
\uuline off
\uwave off
\noun off
\color none
Volume is the number of all items, 
Falling, Rising, and Notrend comprise
 the items refering to falling and rising inflation and to items, where
 not trend is indicated, respectively.
Goodrising, 
Badrising, and 
Otherrising
 refer to items about rising inflation that have been rated positively,
 negatively, and that are neutral.
 Table ??? in the supplement presents descriptive statistics and Figure
 ??? plots the indexes of all media indexes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Non-media indicators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a reference, we include the comprehensive set of early indicators compiled
 by Drechsel ???.
 Here, as the major advantage of media data is that they are unrevised and
 timely, we use a realtime version of the data.
 This means, that we use the data only as they would have been available
 at the moment in time forecasts are made.
 For an overview of the variables see Table ??? in the supplement.
