\begin_layout Section
Empirical set-up
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic empirical set-up for individual models is adapted from DS2010.
 It explicitly addresses the ragged-edged problem.
 However, we employ real-time data.
 The latter is particularly important during recession periods as revisions
 tend to be stronger in such situations.

\begin_layout Standard
The estimation equation is given as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
Y_{t+h}^{h}=\alpha+\sum_{i=l}^{p}\beta_{i}Y_{t-i}+\sum_{j=k}^{q}\gamma_{j}X_{t-j}+\epsilon_{t+h}^{h}\label{eq:individual models}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{t+h}^{h}$
\end_inset

 is the annualized growth rate of industrial production over the next 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 month, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{t+h}=1200/h\times\ln(IP_{t}/IP_{t-h})$
\end_inset

.
 The growth rate of industrial production in levels, 
\begin_inset Formula $IP_{t}$
\end_inset

, is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{t}=\Delta\ln IP_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{t}$
\end_inset

 is a candidate predictor, 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{t+h}^{h}$
\end_inset

 is an error term and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 are regression coefficients.
 The timely availability can be taken account of by 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 German industrial production is available only with a time lag of 
\begin_inset Formula $l=3$
\end_inset

 month.
 The publication lag of the candidate regressors differ from 
\begin_inset Formula $k=0$
\end_inset

, mostly for financial and media data, up to 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

 month.
 The lag length is optimized using the Akaike information criterion.
 First, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is estimated.
 Then, holding 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 fixed, 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is estimated.

\begin_layout Standard
Forecasts for 1 to 12 month horizons are computed in a pseudo-out-of-sample
 set-up:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The forecasts are based on the information set available to a forecaster
 at the forecast origin, that is, the moment in time, the forecasts are
 made.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The first forecast origin is 2005:12, the last one is 2014:11 for h=1, respectiv
ely 2013:11 for h=12.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The estimations are based on a rolling window of 60 month.
 Employing rolling windows increases adaptability to shocks see ??.
 Furthermore, it is required for the Hansen test (?auch white).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each forecast origin, the lag-length are optimized and the model is up-dated.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{t}$
\end_inset

 is the realization of the target variable and 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{y}_{i,t}$
\end_inset

 is the value forecasted by model 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 Usually, the forecast performance of alternative models is compared using
 the mean squared forecast error (MSFE) defined as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
MSFE_{i}=\frac{\Sigma_{t=T_{1}}^{T_{2}}(e_{i,t})^{2}}{T_{2}-T_{1}+1},
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{1}$
\end_inset

 is the first and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{2}$
\end_inset

 the last period that is forecasted.
 However, by making use of squared forecast errors the 
\begin_inset Formula $MSFE_{i}$
\end_inset

 tends to overly emphasize differences between models.
 Thus, we will concentrate on the root mean squared forecast error, 
\begin_inset Formula $RMSFE_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 For pairwise comparisons we employ the Theil's U defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
TU_{i}=\frac{RMSFE_{i}}{RMSFE_{0}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

indicating the relative Performance of model 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 with respect to a benchmark model 
\begin_inset Formula $i=0$
\end_inset

.
 A positive value implies that the indicator model is less accurate than
 the benchmark whereas a negative value implies that it is more accurate
 than the benchmark.
 In line with the literature our benchmark model is the autoregressive (AR)
 model.
 It is defined as in Equation

Pairwise Tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the aim of analyzing whether the pairwise differences in forecast performan
ce are statistically significant we employ the test proposed by

\end_inset

.
 However, the former nests the latter.
 Under the null that the parsimonious model generates the data, the larger
 model thus introduces noise into its forecasts by estimating parameters
 whose population values are zero.
 Therefore, the mean squared prediction error (MSFE) from the parsimonious
 is expected to be smaller than that of the larger model.
 Hence we employ the statistic proposed by , it allows a general parametric
 specification for the parsimonious model.
 In order to test the null hypothesis that the squared forecast errors of
 the baseline model are significantly smaller than those of the larger model
 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, they augment the loss differences, 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{d}_{i,t+h}=\widehat{e}_{0,t+h}^{h}{}^{2}-\widehat{e}_{i,t+h}^{h}{}^{2}$
\end_inset

 with the adjustment term 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{a}_{i,t+h}=(\widehat{Y}_{0,t+h}^{h}-\widehat{Y}_{i,t+h|t}^{h})^{2}$
\end_inset

 giving:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\widehat{f}_{i,t+h}=\widehat{d}_{i,t+h}+\widehat{a}_{i,t+h}.\label{eq:cw series}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In turn, 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{f}_{t+h}$
\end_inset

 is regressed on a constant.
 If the resulting t-statistic for a zero coefficient exceeds 
\begin_inset Formula $+1.282$
\end_inset

 for one sided ten percent level test or 
\begin_inset Formula $+1.645$
\end_inset

 for a one sided five percent level test, the null is rejected.
 For autocorrelated forecast errors they suggest an autocorrelation consistent
 standard error.

Joint Tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When testing pairwise if indicator augmented models outperform the baseline
 AR, dominance may be signaled merly by chance.
 Thus, in order to test whether a particular forecasting procedure is outperform
ed by alternative forecasts the reality check for data snooping

 is applied.
 It has been developed for comparing multiple forecasting models to a baseline
 model simultaneously whith the null hypothesis that the baseline model
 is not inferior to any of its rivals.
 The null is given as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
H_{0}: & E(d_{i,t+h})\leq0 & \forall i=1,...,m.\label{eq:spa}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is rejected when at least one of the rivals yields significantly better
 forecasts.
 the expected loss differential can be consistently estimated using the
 sample mean 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{d}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 White proposes the sample mean statistic
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
RC=\max_{k}P^{1/2}\overline{d}_{i}.
