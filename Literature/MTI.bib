  Abstract                 = {News clustering, categorization and analysis are key components
of any news portal. They require algorithms capable of
dealing with dynamic data to cluster, interpret and to temporally
aggregate news articles. These three tasks are often
solved separately. In this paper we present a unified framework
to group incoming news articles into temporary but
tightly-focused storylines, to identify prevalent topics and
key entities within these stories, and to reveal the temporal
structure of stories as they evolve. We achieve this by building
a hybrid clustering and topic model. To deal with the
available wealth of data we build an efficient parallel inference
algorithm by sequential Monte Carlo estimation. Time
and memory costs are nearly constant in the length of the
history, and the approach scales to hundreds of thousands
of documents. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy
on the publicly available TDT dataset and data of a major
internet news site.},

This paper demonstrates the efficacy of the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) and the Purchasing Manager Indices (PMI) in anticipating US real economic activity. We conduct a fully-fledged real-time out-ofsample forecasting exercise linking these surveys to US GDP and industrial production growth over a long sample period. We find that both indicators convey valuable information for assessing current economic conditions. The SPF clearly outperforms the PMI in forecasting GDP growth, while it performs quite poorly in anticipating industrial production growth. Combining the information included in both surveys further improves the accuracy of both, the PMI and the SPF-based forecast. JEL Classification: E37, E47, C22, C53},

This paper explores whether observing Internet browsing habits can inform practitioners about real-time aggregate consumer behavior in an emerging market. Using data on Google search queries, we introduce a simple index of interest in automobile purchases in Chile and test whether it improves the fit and efficiency of nowcasting models for automobile sales. We also examine to what extent our index helps us identify turning points in sales data. Despite relatively low rates of Internet usage among the population, we find that models incorporating our Google Trends Automotive Index outperform benchmark specifications in both in-sample and outof- sample nowcasts while providing substantial gains in information delivery times.},

  Abstract                 = {Economists have long emphasized the importance of expectations in determining macroeconomic outcomes. Yet there has been almost no recent effort to model actual empirical expectations data; instead, macroeconomists usually simply assume that expectations are "rational." This paper shows that while empirical household expectations are not rational in the usual sense, expectational dynamics are well captured by a model in which households' views derive from news reports of the views of professional forecasters, which in turn may be rational. The model's estimates imply that people only occasionally pay attention to news reports; this inattention generates "stickyness" in aggregate expectations, with important macroeconomic consequences.},

the business cycle dynamics in these two countries. Our main ndings are the following. First,
we show that augmenting benchmark autoregressive models with the RWI generally leads to improvement
in accuracy of one-step ahead forecasts of GDP growth compared to those obtained
by the benchmark model. Second, the accuracy of out-of-sample forecasts obtained with models
augmented with the RWI is comparable to that of models augmented with established economic
indicators in both countries, such as the Ifo Business Climate Index and the ZEW Indicator
of Economic Sentiment for Germany, and the KOF Economic Barometer and the Purchasing
Managers Index in manufacturing for Switzerland. Third, we show that the RWI-based forecasts
are more accurate than the consensus forecasts (published by Consensus Economics Inc.) for
Switzerland, whereas we reach the opposite conclusion for Germany. In fact, the accuracy of
the consensus forecasts of GDP growth for Germany appears to be superior to that of any other
indicator considered in our study. These results are robust to changes in estimation/forecast
samples, the use of rolling vs expanding estimation windows, and the inclusion of a web-based
recession indicator extracted from Google Trends into a set of the competing models.},

  Abstract                 = {The news media affect consumers? perceptions of the economy through three channels. First, the
news media convey the latest economic data and the opinions of professionals to consumers. Second,
consumers receive a signal about the economy through the tone and volume of economic reporting.
Last, the greater the volume of news about the economy, the greater the likelihood that consumers
will update their expectations about the economy. We find evidence that all three of these channels
affect consumer sentiment. We derive measures of the tone and volume of economic reporting,
building upon the R-word index of The Economist. We find that there are periods when reporting on
the economy has not been consistent with actual economic events, especially during the early 1990s.
As a consequence, there are times during which consumer sentiment is driven away from what
economic fundamentals would suggest. We also find evidence supporting that consumers update
their expectations about the economy much more frequently during periods of high news coverage
than in periods of low news coverage; high news coverage of the economy is concentrated during
recessions and immediately after recessions, implying that ?stickiness? in expectations is
countercyclical. Finally, because the model of consumer sentiment is highly nonlinear, month-tomonth
changes in sentiment are difficult to interpret. For instance, although an increase in the
number of articles that mention ?recession? typically is associated with a decline in sentiment, under
certain conditions it can actually result in an increase in various sentiment indexes.}

We find that the effectiveness of communication is not independent from the decision-making process. The paper shows that the Federal Reserve has been pursuing a highly individualistic communication strategy amid a collegial approach to decision making, while the Bank of England is using a collegial communication strategy and highly individualistic decision making. The European Central Bank (ECB) has chosen a collegial approach both in its communication and in its decision making. Assessing these strategies, we find that predictability of policy decisions and the responsiveness of financial markets to communication are equally good for the Federal Reserve and the ECB. This suggests that there may not be a single best approach to designing a central bank communication strategy.},

are all instances of stochastic processes that occur over the edges
of an underlying network. Many times networks over which contagions
spread are unobserved, and such networks are often dynamic
and change over time. In this paper, we investigate the
problem of inferring dynamic networks based on information diffusion
data. We assume there is an unobserved dynamic network
that changes over time, while we observe the results of a dynamic
process spreading over the edges of the network. The task then is
to infer the edges and the dynamics of the underlying network.
We develop an on-line algorithm that relies on stochastic convex
optimization to efficiently solve the dynamic network inference
problem. We apply our algorithm to information diffusion among
3.3 million mainstream media and blog sites and experiment with
more than 179 million different pieces of information spreading
over the network in a one year period. We study the evolution of
information pathways in the online media space and find interesting
insights. Information pathways for general recurrent topics are
more stable across time than for on-going news events. Clusters
of news media sites and blogs often emerge and vanish in matter of
days for on-going news events. Major social movements and events
involving civil population, such as the Libyan?s civil war or Syria?s
uprise, lead to an increased amount of information pathways among
blogs as well as in the overall increase in the network centrality of
blogs and social media sites.},

The forecasting performance of the Google Inflation Search Index (GISI) is assessed relative to 37 other indicators of inflation expectations ? 36 survey measures and the TIPS spread. For decades, the academic literature has focused on three measures of inflation expectations: the Livingston Survey, Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Michigan Survey. While useful in developing models of forecasting inflation, these low frequency measures appear anachronistic in the modern era of higher frequency and real-time data. I demonstrate that higher frequency measures tend to outperform lower frequency measures in tests of accuracy, predictive power, and rationality. Furthermore, Granger Causality tests indicate that the GISI metadata indicator anticipates the inflation rate by 12 months, and out-of-sample forecasts show that the GISI has the lowest forecast error of all the inflation expectations indicators tested},

The model-derived recession probabilities of CCI an CLI capture the turning points of the ECRI's and OECD's reference cycles much better than the dynamic single-factor model with Markov switching.},

In addition to them, we have constructed a diffusion index based on the principal component analysis and including 145 component series that reflect all the facets of German economy. We use the post-unification data which cover years from 1991 through 2004. Using a battery of statistical tests we detect a structural break in the growth rates that occurs in the first half of 2001. Our results suggest that the forecasting ability of the leading indicators has been rather good in the pre-break period with our diffusion index showing the superior forecasting accuracy but the forecasting performance of all alternative indicators has significantly deteriorated in the post-break period, i.e. in 2001-2004. None of the leading indicator models was able to predict and accommodate the structural break in the growth rates of the time series under scrutiny. This finding confirms the widespread impression among the practitioners that the state of German economy in the recent years became much more difficult to forecast.},

cycles. Using a VAR approach, we find evidence that news influence expectations and hereby
drive business cycles. Furthermore, we test whether news on aggregate developments affect
firms decisions more than sector-specific news. Given that aggregate information is more
likely to be picked up by all media than sector-specific information, these news are also more
likely to be transmitted to all firms, whereas sector-specific news are only transmitted to those
firms that happen to consume the specific report. Veldkamp and Wolfers (2006) show that
such an effect could explain one of the puzzles in the business cycle literature, namely the
excess comovement of output across sectors as compared to lower comovement of total factor
productivity (TFP) across sectors. Our findings suggest that aggregate news indeed affect
firms expectations more than sector-specific news. We conclude that strategic information
complementarities could be an important explanation for actual business cycle comovements.},

  Abstract                 = {An important part of our information-gathering behavior has always been to find out what other people think. With the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people now can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object.

This survey covers techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking systems. Our focus is on methods that seek to address the new challenges raised by sentiment-aware applications, as compared to those that are already present in more traditional fact-based analysis. We include material on summarization of evaluative text and on broader issues regarding privacy, manipulation, and economic impact that the development of opinion-oriented information-access services gives rise to. To facilitate future work, a discussion of available resources, benchmark datasets, and evaluation campaigns is also provided.},

The results show that in almost all conducted in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting experiments the Google indicator outperforms the survey-based indicators.

Using monthly U.S. data and a structural vector-autoregression, I find that (1) sentiment is affected by news shocks, (2) after filtering out effects of news shocks, shocks to sentiment still have positive effects on consumer spending, and (3) news shocks influence both spending and unemployment in significant, though transitory ways. These results are consistent with other evidence of a role of non-fundamental factors in aggregate fluctuations.

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a novel dataset with a news sentiment index that was constructed from a selection of over
300,000 newspaper articles from five of the top ten U.S. newspapers by circulation. By constructing ARMA
models, we show that news and consumer sentiment, when combined with other macroeconomic variables,
achieve statistically significant results to explain changes in private consumption. We make three distinct
findings with respect to sentiment in consumption behavior models: first, both consumer and news sentiment
add explanatory power and statistical significance to conventional consumer behavior models. Second,
consumer sentiment, measured by the University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment, adds more
explanatory power and statistical significance than news sentiment when tested individually. Third, news
sentiment is able to determine the signs of all coefficients in the model correctly, whereas consumer sentiment
does not. In general, we conclude that news sentiment is a useful variable to add in consumer behavior
models, especially when coupled with consumer sentiment and other macroeconomic variables. Tested individually,
news sentiment is as good a proxy as personal income for explaining private consumption growth
when tested individually.},

controlled stimulus material. The lack of arousal ratings, however, necessitated a revised version of the BAWL.
We therefore present the BAWL?R, which is the first list that not only contains a large set of psycholinguistic
indexes known to influence word processing, but also features ratings regarding emotional arousal, in addition
to emotional valence and imageability. The BAWL?R is intended to help researchers create stimulus material for
a wide range of experiments dealing with the affective processing of German verbal material.},

  Abstract                 = {Many approaches to automatic sentiment analysis begin with a large lexicon of words marked with their prior polarity (also called semantic orientation). However, the contextual polarity of the phrase in which a particular instance of a word appears may be quite different from the word?s prior polarity. Positive words are used in phrases expressing negative sentiments, or vice versa. Also, quite often words that are positive or negative out of context are neutral in context, meaning they are not even being used to express a sentiment. The goal of this work is to automatically distinguish between prior and contextual polarity, with a focus on understanding which features are important for this task. Because an important aspect of the problem is identifying when polar terms are being used in neutral contexts, features for distinguishing between neutral and polar instances are evaluated, as well as features for distinguishing between positive and negative contextual polarity. The evaluation includes assessing the performance of features across multiple machine learning algorithms. For all learning algorithms except one, the combination of all features together gives the best performance. Another facet of the evaluation considers how the presence of neutral instances affects the performance of features for distinguishing between positive and negative polarity. These experiments show that the presence of neutral instances greatly degrades the performance of these features, and that perhaps the best way to improve performance across all polarity classes is to improve the system?s ability to identify when an instance is neutral.},

  Abstract                 = {{ABSTRACT Among the many applications in social science for the entry and management of data, there are only a few software packages that apply natural language processing to identify semantic concepts such as issue categories or political statements by actors. Although these procedures usually allow efficient data collection, most have difficulty in achieving sufficient accuracy because of the high complexity and mutual relationships of the variables used in the social sciences. To address these flaws, we suggest a (semi-) automatic annotation approach that implements an innovative coding method (Core Sentence Analysis) by computational linguistic techniques (mainly entity recognition, concept identification, and dependency parsing). Although such computational linguistic tools have been readily available for quite a long time, social scientists have made astonishingly little use of them. The principal aim of this article is to gather data on party-issue relationships from newspaper articles. In the first stage, we try to recognize relations between parties and issues with a fully automated system. This recognition is extensively tested against manually annotated data of the coverage in the boulevard newspaper Blick of the Swiss national parliamentary elections of 2003 and 2007. In the second stage, we discuss possibilities for extending our approach, such as by enriching these relations with directional measures indicating their polarity.}},

The authors first build gazetteers (reference databases) on the actors and issues and then apply CSA which reduces the sentences to its basic elements like lemmas (base form of inflected verbs). Then, named entity recognition is applied whereby the gazetteer is related to the text taking care of anaphoras (pronouns and noun phrases). As anaphora resultion is still not exact, the pronouns are only resolved to the respective actor, if the former occurs in the preceeding sentence. Issues are usually identified with the help of further keywords. Then, the syntatic analysis is applied using Constraint Dependency Grammar Parser CDG in order to make out dependencies. However, long sentences will take several minutes to be parsed. Therefore, the time limit is set to 90 seconds to identify the structure. Parsers in the best of all cases would identify core sentences such as actor/predicate/issue. In order to check there results the authors rely on the annotations of two different coders. The automated results may then be checked against this gold standard using the recall (the share of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives always with respect to the gold standard), the precision (true positives as a ratio of true positives and false positives), and the harmonic mean of the former giving the F-score. The two different coders are checked against each other, as well. The applied recognition methods are all actors and issues in one article (alI), actors and issues within three sentences (+-1), and actors and issues in one sentence (sentence). Improvements on these approaches are attach issues only to the nearest actor limited to the preceding, the same and the following article. Furthermore, the subjekt filter is employed where either the actor or the issue must occur as part of a subject dependency. Finally, the most complicated approach relies on the minimal dependencies path identified by the parser (parse tree distance).},
