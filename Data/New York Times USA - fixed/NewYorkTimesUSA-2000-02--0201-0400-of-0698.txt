HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
Hall for Midsize Exhibits Is Planned for Pier 94

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
A new exhibition hall called the Unconvention Center, one mile north of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and about one-third its size, is being planned for Pier 94 by the Giuliani administration and private developers.
At a cost of $50 million, the 750-foot-long pier shed would be renovated and the one-story head house, which runs from 52nd Street to 54th Street, would be replaced by a structure of two or three stories. Once laden with Cunard Line cargo, Pier 94 was more recently used as a parking garage. 
 The Unconvention Center would be T-shaped, its long stem over the Hudson River, with three exhibition areas on the main floor for midsize trade shows, which typically draw 5,000 to 10,000 visitors. In the head house, at the top of the T, would be a ballroom and meeting rooms for corporate events, as well as a cafe.
"These trade shows are a big job generator," said Michael G. Carey, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which is negotiating the deal with the development team, Unconvention Center Inc., headed by Elyse N. Kroll, a trade show producer.
Mr. Carey said the Unconvention Center and the Javits Center would be "complementary, because they go to different constituents."
Gerald T. McQueen, the president and chief executive of the Javits Center, said, "New York needs all the trade show space it can find, so we are not opposed to efforts to increase exhibit area.
"The Javits Center's success is a prime example of the tremendous need for its own expansion," Mr. McQueen said. "Currently we are turning away almost as much business as we're able to accommodate."
Neighbors have some concerns, said John Doswell, co-chairman of the waterfront committee of Community Board 4 in Clinton. They will be looking closely at how much of Pier 94 would be open to the public, how the center would relate to the future Clinton Cove Park nearby and how traffic generated by trade shows -- trucks, vans, taxis, limousines, buses -- would affect the overall Hudson River Park.
Issues of traffic and park design will be resolved in the course of hearings and review leading to a vote in the City Council, said Joseph B. Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission and a board member of the Hudson River Park Trust.
"One of the goals of the park is to bring people to the waterfront, to make the Hudson River an integral part of the life of the city," Mr. Rose said. "This project will do that in a felicitous way."
The development group at Pier 94 is led by Ms. Kroll, president of both the Unconvention Center Inc. and of E.N.K. International, a producer of trade shows for the fashion industry.
As business travel and tourism increased in recent years, Ms. Kroll said, hotels were less eager to set aside entire floors for exhibitors. "There was no place to grow," she said. "That's why we needed to create new space."
Her search took her to Pier 94, which New York City opened in 1964 as a freight terminal for Cunard.
Inside is an astonishing and almost column-free expanse of 175,000 square feet -- four whole acres.
Ms. Kroll can still recall her reaction when she was shown the space two years ago by Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine: "Oh, my God."
E.N.K. has leased Pier 94 from the city since summer 1998, using it for its own shows or subleasing it. More than 15 exhibitions have been held there, including the New York International Gift Fair.
As a tenant, Ms. Kroll said, E.N.K. has spent more than $3 million to comply with building codes and improve aesthetics. It insulated the pier shed by covering the roll-down gates that line both sides, installed duct work for air conditioning and heating, built bathrooms and waterproofed the roof.
"They have had a good run on Pier 94 on an interim basis," Mr. Carey said, "and we have every confidence that they'll have great success on a more permanent basis."
Unconvention Center Inc. would lease Pier 94 for 49 years. The city expects to receive rent, to share in the revenue and to receive money from the developers toward the long-term maintenance of the pier. The exact terms are still being negotiated, both sides said.
Construction is to begin early in 2001 and take about a year, said Paul Travis, a managing partner in Washington Square Partners, the real estate advisers to the Unconvention Center. He said the project would be financed by $40 million in borrowing and $10 million in equity.
Construction would add about 100,000 square feet of floor space to the pier, bringing it to 270,000 square feet, but that is still well below the maximum allowed by zoning rules, Mr. Travis said.
The center is being designed by the Atlanta firm Thompson, Ventulett, Stainback & Associates, whose other projects have included the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia, incorporating the historic Reading Terminal train shed.
A preliminary sketch shows a bowed roof on the new head house, an esplanade, arched fanlight windows and twin towers at the end of the pier. "The intent is to animate the building in a way that's more festive and inviting," said H. Preston Crum, a senior principal in the architectural firm.

HEADLINE: Clinton Aides Push Budget to Congress

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Clinton administration officials fanned out across Capitol Hill today to sell the merits of the president's budget plan, but found no takers among the Republican majority in Congress.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers told the Senate Finance Committee that President Clinton's plan to eliminate the part of the national debt held by the public would be like a tax cut for most people because it would push interest rates lower. 
 Jack Lew, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said Congress should adopt a restrained estimate of future budget surpluses, as Mr. Clinton has. To construct a surplus estimate just to allow for the bigger tax cut that Republicans want, he told the House Budget Committee, would risk a return to deficits and imperil efforts to assure Social Security's solvency.
Other administration officials, including Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Defense Secretary William S. Cohen, also appeared before Congressional committees.
But Republicans said Mr. Clinton's budget called for too much spending and too little in tax cuts and missed an opportunity to use the surplus to overhaul Social Security.
And they said they planned to press ahead with a tax and spending plan of their own, starting with a vote in the House on Thursday on a tax cut for married couples.

HEADLINE: Aetna Reports 20% Increase in Income

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Aetna Inc., the nation's biggest health insurer, said yesterday that its operating income rose 20 percent in the fourth quarter. But Wall Street analysts said the underlying numbers were disappointing, reflecting deterioration in Aetna's core health business and losses overseas.
The Cigna Corporation, the No. 3 managed health care insurer, said operating income rose 31 percent to $296 million, or $1.66 a share, in the quarter, far exceeding the $1.38 expected by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
 On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Aetna shares plummeted $9.75, or 17 percent, to $46. Most managed care stocks also dropped. Cigna shares declined $1.50, to $74.75.
Richard L. Huber, chairman and chief executive of Aetna, stressed the positive: a greater-than-anticipated 3.1 percent increase, to 15.9 million members, of the Aetna U.S. Healthcare health maintenance organizations, not counting 5.1 million customers of the recently acquired Prudential Healthcare unit.
He said the Prudential unit "met our expectations." Projected annual losses at Prudential declined $50 million in the quarter, to $150 million, the company said. Aetna said the Prudential loss would fall $100 million further late this year and disappear in early 2001.
But most analysts were concerned about medical costs, led by prescription drugs and hospital stays, which appeared to be overrunning rate increases. They saw the cost increases as a warning of continuing uncertainty about Aetna's ability to turn Prudential around. Losses at Prudential have been softened by fees and other payments to Aetna that end Jan. 1, 2001.
"The fear on Wall Street is that Prudential will hurt them in 10 months" when those payments end, said Todd Richter, a health care analyst at Banc of America Securities.
Aetna said rising medical costs absorbed 83.1 percent of revenue at the Aetna U.S. Healthcare H.M.O.'s in the quarter, up from 82.6 percent in the period a year earlier. When Prudential H.M.O.'s were added, the combined cost ratio rose to 84.8 percent.
Costs at Medicare H.M.O.'s rose even faster, to 95.3 percent compared with 92.6 in the 1998 quarter.
The increases included "higher-than-anticipated medical costs" in the preceding quarter, which emerged in the final quarter, Aetna said.
Lori M. Price, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, said Aetna had been "underestimating its medical costs for the past few quarters." She added, "Part of what we're seeing is a catch-up from past underestimates."
Robert Hoehn, an analyst at ING Barings, said that raised an issue that had plagued a number of health insurance mergers: "the degree of integration of information systems" of the merging companies and "the ability to process medical claims."
Roberta Goodman, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, added that the "most important increase was in hospital costs," especially for Medicare patients.
Joyce Oberdorf, a spokeswoman for Aetna, said premiums were raised 10 percent in January, a month when most big employers renew contracts. But analysts said the increase was only 6 percent or 7 percent after employers trimmed their coverage to hold down their own costs. The underlying costs of medical care, meanwhile, are also rising by 6 percent to 7 percent, said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
Aetna said profits from operations were $173 million, or $1.18 a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with $144.4 million, or 91 cents a share. Earnings included $33 million from the sale of securities owned by a Brazilian affiliate.
Earnings in Brazil were weak, Mr. Huber acknowledged, reflecting a recession there and price controls, which Aetna said were temporary.
The Aetna U.S. Healthcare operating earnings, before Year 2000 costs, were $127.1 million, up from $112.9 million in the 1998 quarter. Earnings from overseas units that sell health and life insurance and other products were $52.7 million, including the $33 million one-time gain in Brazil.
Cigna said its H.M.O. earnings rose 31 percent to $118 million in the quarter. Non-H.M.O. health insurance gained 10 percent to $113 million. "It was clearly an excellent quarter," said Mr. Abramowitz at Bernstein. Wendell Potter, a spokesman for Cigna, noted that share repurchases had added to the $1.66 earnings a share.

Markets Stage Broad Rally On Strength of Labor Data

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices staged a broad advance yesterday after a government report indicated the economy could continue to expand without an appreciable increase in inflation.
Technology stocks were particularly strong, and the Nasdaq composite index rose to its third consecutive record. But the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which so far this year have been struggling, registered solid gains. And the Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks rose to a record. 
 The gains came on heavy volume.
A billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange. At 1.94 billion shares, the Nasdaq stock market had its second-busiest day ever.
All of these gains were set in motion by the Labor Department, which early yesterday issued a report showing that worker productivity rose faster than expected in the fourth quarter while labor costs fell for a second quarter.
"The calculus is pretty straightforward," said Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers. "As productivity accelerates, the need for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates becomes less and less."
Led by stocks like Microsoft, Immunex and Qualcomm, the Nasdaq composite index jumped 105.73, a gain of 2.5 percent, to 4,427.50. It was the seventh consecutive gain for the index, and the first time it has closed above 4,400.
The Dow gained 51.81, an increase of 0.5 percent, to 10,957.60. Interest-rate sensitive financial stocks like J. P. Morgan and retailers like Wal-Mart Stores helped to pull the Dow higher.
Big gains in technology names like Yahoo and EMC pushed the S.& P. 500 up 17.51, or 1.2 percent, to 1,441.75. And the Russell 2000, which like the Nasdaq is moving on strength in technology and biotechnology stocks, closed at 537.49, a gain of 5.10, or 1 percent.
"There are lots of people who are seeing technology as the instrument for growth," said Steve Witt, a managing director at Firsthand Funds in San Jose, Calif., a mutual fund that invests exclusively in technology issues. "As long as technology is perceived that way, I don't think this is going to stop. The majority of these companies have reported phenomenal earnings numbers."
Cisco Systems became the latest technology company to issue a strong earnings report.
After the close, the company, the biggest maker of Internet equipment, reported earnings that were better than consensus estimates. It also announced a 2-for-1 stock split.
Cisco, which has risen sharply in the last week, fell 3/8, to 12413/16 during regular trading. But the stock jumped after the announcement, and traded as high as 131 5/8 in after-hours trading.
Microsoft, another technology bellwether, had a good day. The stock gained 35/16 , to 10915/16 . And I.B.M., another Dow component, climbed 4 5/8, to 118 5/8.
Among retailing stocks, Wal-Mart rose 2 5/8, to 59 1/4, after an analyst at Lehman Brothers raised his price target on the shares to 100.
With the exception of some big insurance companies, financial service stocks did well.
J. P. Morgan gained 5/8, to 119 1/2. American Express was up 9/16 , to 163. Citigroup rose 1 5/8, to 55 3/4. And Merrill Lynch closed at 971/16 , up 5 1/2.
But it was a bad day for the beleaguered tobacco companies.
Allegations in a lawsuit that the companies conspired to fix cigarette prices sent the stocks lower.
Philip Morris fell 11/16 , to 19 1/2, a record low. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco declined 3/8, to 18 1/4. And British American Tobacco, a holding company for Brown & Williamson, fell 3/4, to 8 1/2.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Treasuries Rise Sharply
 (By Bloomberg News) -- Treasury bond prices rose yesterday as a government report suggested productivity gains and falling labor costs are helping hold back inflation, even with unemployment at a three-decade low.
Bonds extended gains after a Treasury note auction met with slack demand, prompting some investors to sell shorter-maturity government debt and pile into the better-performing bond, as they have been doing since late January, traders said.
The productivity and wage reports "are really good numbers for the bond market," said Patrick Kennedy, who helps manage at Pitcairn Trust Company in Jenkintown, Pa.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 113/32 , to 9819/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.23 percent from 6.34 percent on Monday.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of five-year notes:

Price: 96.505
High Yield: 6.741%

U.S. Productivity Soared 5% in Second Half of 1999
The efficiency of American workers surged in the last six months of 1999, the Labor Department reported. With these final numbers, the 1990's entered the books as the decade that produced the greatest improvement in productivity since the golden 1990's.
Analysts said the report showed that the economy would keep growing strongly with low inflation, perhaps convincing the Federal Reserve to moderate future interest rate increases. Page A1.

HEADLINE: New Chinese Guided-Missile Ship Heightens Tension

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH 

 BODY:
China's first Russian-built guided-missile destroyer is expected to arrive in the East China Sea as early as this week, enhancing Beijing's ability to threaten American aircraft carriers in any future encounters over Taiwan.
Within weeks of the Sovremenny-class destroyer's arrival, Russia is expected to deliver the ship's most formidable weapon, Sunburn antiship missiles specifically designed to penetrate American carrier battle group defenses. The Russian version of the sea-skimming supersonic missile can carry nuclear or conventional warheads. 
 Conventions to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, as well as Russia's own strategic interests, make it unlikely that the missiles will be delivered with nuclear warheads. But Russia could provide, or China could develop, technology that would enable the missiles to deliver a Chinese nuclear warhead.
The ship, expected to join China's East Sea Fleet based in Ningbo, will arrive at a time of heightened tension in the narrow strait separating the mainland from Taiwan, which Beijing has long considered a breakaway province. Taiwan holds presidential elections next month and during the last elections, in 1996, Beijing fired missiles into the sea near the island. The United States responded by sending two aircraft carrier groups to the area, infuriating Beijing and embarrassing its military leaders.
Even with conventional warheads, China's new missile-armed destroyer, together with four recently purchased Kilo-class submarines from Russia, will raise the threshold for any future American intervention in the region, military analysts say.
"These two systems, in particular, are ones that give us pause and make us realize that we are in fact going in harm's way," said Eric McVadon, a retired rear admiral who was a defense and naval attache in Beijing and is now a consultant on East Asian security affairs. "That's something the Chinese didn't possess before."
China has built its own guided-missile destroyers, but they are considered less threatening than the Sunburn-equipped destroyers from Russia. China purchased two of the Russian ships last year -- the second is expected later this year -- and is believed to be negotiating the purchase of at least two more.
"This is a generational leap for China into a much more advanced type of surface weaponry," said James Lilley, a former American ambassador to China and now a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research in Washington.
Official American reaction to the ship's arrival has been muted.
"The U.S. military is adequately prepared" to deal with any threat posed by the destroyers, a Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Cdr. Terry Southerland, said this week. He said there has been no decision on Taiwan's request to buy American Aegis destroyers to counter the Chinese purchases. Military analysts say it could take China years of training before its navy can handle such a sophisticated ship in an actual conflict.
China "is trying to make us sweat," one analyst said, "but one ship does not a Navy make."
Congress is considering expanded military ties with Taiwan. Last week the House passed the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, which would increase coordination between United States and Taiwan forces and provide more American training of Taiwan's military officers. The Senate has yet to vote on the bill, which the Clinton Administration has threatened to veto if it does pass.
American military technology could find and sink the new Chinese destroyers in a matter of hours of any conflict. But the presence of the ships and their missiles in the Taiwan Theater complicates the calculus of cross-straits relations, the most volatile flashpoint in East Asia.
Ever since the Chinese Nationalist Army retreated to Taiwan in 1949, Beijing has threatened to occupy the island by force if its government declares independence from the mainland. Tensions increased last summer after Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui, declared that talks between his government and the mainland government should be on a "state-to-state basis," affording Taipei diplomatic parity with Beijing.
So far China has lacked the ability to carry out its threat of invasion -- dubbed by skeptics "the million-man swim" -- largely because of Taiwan's superior air force and the backing of the United States Seventh Fleet. Instead, Beijing has elected to threaten and intimidate Taipei with a formidable and steadily increasing arsenal of short-range ballistic missiles such as those used in 1996.
Under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, the United States is obligated to help Taiwan defend itself from a mainland attack -- although in a 1982 joint communique with Beijing, Washington pledged not to increase the quantity or quality of arms sold to Taiwan.
The commitment to Taiwan's defense was reinforced last year when a senior State Department official told a group of Chinese businessmen that a mainland attack on Taiwan would be "disastrous for U.S.-China relations, and could, no doubt, pit us in an actual war." Those comments were intended as a warning to Beijing, American officials say.
But China's new destroyers and their Sunburn missiles, with a range of up to 65 miles, will alter the equation. The United States Navy currently has limited defense against the missile, which Russia designed in the 1980's to sink Arleigh Burke-class Aegis destroyers guarding American carrier groups or to hit the carriers themselves. The radar-guided missiles can deliver a 200-kiloton nuclear warhead to a target beyond the horizon in about two minutes. Even one of its conventional warheads could sink a cruiser or disable a carrier, depending on where it hits, military analysts say.
China's purchase of the destroyer and its missiles is part of an emerging pattern of procurement in the wake of warming relations with Russia. With the United States and much of Europe refusing to supply China with advanced weapons, Russia and Israel have been the country's primary options. Israel has helped China with the avionics for a fighter aircraft it is developing. But Russia, with a sophisticated arsenal and weakened economy, has been a more willing supplier.
Russia has sold China four quiet Kilo-class submarines, which carry "wake-homing" torpedoes designed to detonate beneath a ship's keel. The torpedoes are difficult to detect because they approach the ship from the rear where their sound is masked by the noise of the ship's propellers. And Russia is helping China assemble Russian Sukhoi Su-27 fighters.
Many American politicians, military officials and analysts deride these purchases, saying China is assembling a "junkyard army," cobbled piecemeal from outdated, castoff weaponry that poses little threat to the United States or its allies. Many of the weapons systems China has purchased require extensive training and sophisticated electronics and software to be used effectively. The People's Liberation Army has not demonstrated prowess in mastering such technology.
But other American analysts see a sinister logic to the procurement program, suggesting that the weapons purchases meet specific tactical needs within broader strategic goals -- the ability to challenge American dominance in the Taiwan Strait, for example, or to protect its claims in the resource-rich South China Sea. Some warn further that the incremental arms buildup represents the early stages of a broader armament intended to prepare China for potential conflict with the United States or to allow the country to eventually supplant the United States as the leading military power in the Asia-Pacific region.
China says it has no interest in projecting military force beyond its borders, arguing that it wants to maintain regional stability and focus on its own economic development. It could take decades to develop the integrated armed forces necessary to challenge American dominance in the region.
But Beijing considers Taiwan a domestic, not regional, issue.
"The trick," said Mr. McVadon, the former military attache, "is to find a way to preserve U.S. interests in Asia and yet accommodate China as an emerging military and economic power in the region and the world."

HEADLINE: U.S. PRODUCTIVITY ROSE AT 5% RATE IN 2ND HALF OF '99

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
The efficiency of American workers surged in the last six months of 1999, the Labor Department reported yesterday. With these final numbers, the 1990's entered the books as the decade that produced the greatest improvement in productivity since the golden 1960's.
Productivity, an arcane statistic, nevertheless explains -- more than any other single statistic -- how the economy can grow as strongly as it has the last four years without generating more inflation. Workers, in effect, are producing much more without having to be paid more, and that takes pressure off corporate America to raise prices. 
 "This kind of data keeps alive the expectation that the economy will keep growing strongly with low inflation and that means the Federal Reserve will not have to end the expansion," said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, chief economist at the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup.
Almost all of the improvement came in the last four years, when computers became much faster and the Internet expanded rapidly, suggesting to some economists that the new technologies played a significant role in lifting labor productivity. Others insist that technology has made only a small contribution.
Investors in stocks, perhaps reassured that the expansion has more running room, pushed up share prices after the Labor Department announced that productivity rose at an annual rate of 5 percent in both the third and fourth quarters. The Nasdaq market, where most of the Internet companies are listed, jumped 105.73 points, to 4,427.50, another record, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.81, to 10,957.60.
Interest rates also eased off in bond market trading, one interpretation being that the Federal Reserve -- while still committed to one or two more small rate increases similar to the quarter-point increase last week -- will not raise interest rates enough to so discourage spending that the expansion is brought to an end. At nearly nine years, it is the longest in the nation's history.
Productivity rises when a worker produces more goods or services in an hour on the job than he did in the prior year. A phone operator who handled 100 toll calls in 1998, for example, handled 103 in 1999. This extra revenue can be used to raise profits or the wages paid to the operator, or both profits and wages. In any case, customer tolls do not have to rise to cover the extra outlay.
Starting in the early 1970's, the productivity growth rate fell sharply, averaging no more than 1.5 percent a year until 1995, a sea change from the 1960's when the average was a spectacular 2.9 percent a year. Productivity no longer made possible the improvement in wages, and living standards, that had benefited so many Americans in the 1960's. And to compensate, millions of people worked longer hours or at more than one job to keep from falling behind.
But starting in late 1995, productivity surged. The growth rate jumped to 2.6 percent annually, on average, pulling up the performance for the entire decade to 2 percent a year.
The latest numbers reinforced this improvement. Productivity in the fourth quarter rose at an unusually strong annual rate of 5 percent, the Labor Department said. An earlier third-quarter estimate was revised to 5 percent from 4.9 percent, and thanks to the last six months, the growth rate for all four quarters of the last year of the century averaged 2.9 percent, the highest for any year in the 1990's expect 1992, when there was a momentary jump.
Does that mean that the productivity drought that has afflicted the United States since the early 1970's is now over? Has a New Economy arisen, one in which faster computers, the Internet and the new high-speed communications networks have resulted in sustained improvement in labor productivity?
Some economists argue that this is the case. But others note that the rise in productivity coincided with a jump in economic growth as a run-of-the-mill economic expansion suddenly turned into a boom in late 1995. While technology plays a role, they say, the booming economy is the main cause of the rising productivity growth rate, which will taper off once the economy inevitably slows or falls into recession.
"We are not going to know how much is due to strong economic growth and how much to the new technologies until the current business cycle runs its full length," said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, who gives most of the credit to technology. "We are seeing things in this cycle that are unprecedented. Productivity is accelerating late in the expansion, when it should be easing off. That is because of the new technologies."
Others argue that productivity surges when economic growth surges, whether that strong growth comes early or late in an expansion. During the 1980's, for example, the strongest growth came early in the expansion, the usual pattern, and the productivity growth rate, in response, rose at an annual rate of 2.7 percent from 1982 through 1986 -- virtually the same performance as the late 1990's -- only to taper off as the economy grew more slowly in the last years of the 1980's expansion.
"Productivity is very sensitive to growth," said Robert Gordon, a Northwestern University economist. "When the economy is growing above normal, the output of a worker also jumps. That is because companies, faced with a growing demand for their products and services, find ways to squeeze more output from their employees. And when the economy slows, the same workers find themselves producing less."
Manufacturing has been an enormous factor in the latest surge in productivity, rising at an annual rate of 10.7 percent in the fourth quarter, and 6.4 percent for all of 1999, the best performance since 1971. Nearly half the latest improvement came in the manufacture of computers and other electronic gear. Citing this bias, Mr. Gordon argues that productivity in manufacturing is narrowly focused, while Mr. Steinberg sees in the same data a much broader improvement. That is a result of new technology, he said, and of the strong rise in capital investment.
Whatever the final outcome of this debate, the productivity report yesterday had buried in it more evidence that labor costs are rising rather mildly, even if the productivity growth rate might justify bigger raises. Unit labor costs in the fourth quarter fell 1 percent, which means that the cost of producing a particular piece of merchandise fell.
That is a result of two factors. The total output of goods and services rose faster than the total hours needed to produce them, the Labor Department said, and compensation costs -- wages, bonuses, benefits and stock options -- rose at an annual rate of 4 percent, down from 4.7 percent in the third quarter and 4.8 percent in the second quarter.

HEADLINE: At Least One Yankee Team Gets Its Wish

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Giuliani administration is nearing completion of a deal to construct what would be the country's most expensive minor league baseball stadium, a $71 million complex near the Staten Island ferry terminal that would be built entirely with taxpayer money.
Under the terms of the 20-year agreement, the Staten Island Yankees, which play at the lowest level of the legendary Yankees farm system, would pay a modest rent and control the stadium year-round. The team, which plays 38 home games a year, would not have to pay any money for construction and would reap half of any advertising revenue and 70 percent of the revenues from any events booked into the stadium during the 327 days annually that the Yankees did not play there. 
 The stadium would be the first new professional ballpark in the city since Shea Stadium opened in 1964.
The Giuliani administration and the Staten Island borough president, Guy V. Molinari, hailed the project as a boon to the neglected area surrounding St. George Station, where the ballpark would be built along Richmond Terrace at Wall Street on a gravel and mud parking lot northwest of the Staten Island ferry terminal. The city would have the right to use the stadium for about 30 public events.
"We see it as the key component in the revitalization of the St. George neighborhood," Michael G. Carey, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said yesterday. "These things are very popular, affordable family entertainment."
Mr. Carey said the negotiations with the Staten Island Yankees should be completed by Friday. The 6,500-seat stadium, which has already been approved by the City Council, would include 21 luxury boxes, a restaurant, a clubhouse, an arcade and a novelty store.
Many cities have proved willing to provide enormous subsidies to lure professional teams, but the cost of the project for a team in the Class A New York-Penn League is extraordinary, said Robert Baade, an expert in the economics of professional sports. The estimated price tag is well above that for the $34 million minor league stadium that opened last year in Newark, and the $18 million stadium in Fishkill, N.Y., that is home to the Yankees' Penn League rival, the Hudson Valley Renegades. Leases for those stadiums have revenue-sharing similar to what is planned for Staten Island.
Since major league clubs cut their financing for farm clubs in the early 1990's, minor league teams have increasingly moved to those cities willing to build new ballparks. At the same time, minor league baseball has drawn new fans, because of relatively low ticket prices, intimate settings and the chance to talk to the players from the stands.
Some local officials and analysts say the project represents another gift from Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to a borough that provided the margin of victory in his 1993 race against David N. Dinkins.
"Just because baseball is played on a diamond it doesn't mean you have to build a jewel box," said John Sabini, a councilman from Queens. "A lot of people stand to benefit from this and all of them are close to the mayor. One gets the feeling that this is part of a larger deal with the Steinbrenner family."
In separate projects for the borough, the city is also rebuilding the decrepit Staten Island ferry terminal, whose cost has swelled to more than $80 million from $20 million. It is also subsidizing construction of the nearby National Lighthouse Museum and a new home for the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences. Mr. Giuliani has also promised to close the Fresh Kills landfill by 2002, a pledge that helped secure the loyalty of Staten island voters.
Mr. Molinari said, "I don't see this as reparations for the landfill so much as the city of New York getting something wonderful." .
But economists questioned whether there would be any economic benefit from a minor league team that plays only 38 home games a year. They said the deal could set a pattern for large public subsidies at a time when the Giuliani administration is pressing to build a $30 million minor league stadium for the Mets in Brooklyn, as well as major league stadiums for both the Yankees and Mets, and possibly the New York Jets. The total cost to taxpayers could exceed $2 billion if all the plans come to fruition. But the stadiums, critics argue, provide mostly seasonal jobs and redistribute money spent on entertainment, rather than generate additional spending.
"It's all about serving the interests of the private sector through public subsidies," said Mr. Baade, a professor of economics at Lake Forest College. "We're not talking about an industry that's large enough to have an impact on an economy as large and diverse as New York's."
The project has wide political support on Staten Island, although some residents are concerned about potential traffic tie-ups when commuters pour off the ferry and head for their cars at the same time baseball fans are trying to get into the parking lots.
During the City Council hearing last December, Jerome X. O'Donovan, a local councilman who favored an alternative location on Staten Island, pushed for more community-based events at the stadium and additional parking, while complaining about how the project's cost had soared well beyond Mayor Giuliani's original $20 million estimate. Such cost overruns have often afflicted stadium projects.
The Giuliani administration and Mr. Molinari prefer to put the stadium cost at $29.5 million, not $71 million. "The other costs are not the true costs of constructing the stadium," Mr. Molinari said, "but infrastructure improvements that must be made whether or not there's a stadium."
But the city's figure does not include the $12.75 million cost of buying the land on which the stadium would be built. Nor does it include what developers call the soft costs of construction: architectural, engineering and construction management fees totaling $10.95 million. Mr. Carey said some of the architectural costs are attributable to other aspects of the project, like shoring up the bulkhead for the esplanade to the stadium.
In any event, the costs total $71 million when the environmental cleanup, landscaping, parking lot construction and a $6.75 million esplanade are added into the budget. The money would come from taxes raised during the course of the project.
The city has already spent $5 million to build a temporary ball field for the team at the College of Staten Island. The team, which moved to Staten Island last year from Watertown, N.Y., drew a sellout crowd of 4,500 to the season opener in June and an average of 3,183 fans a game, mostly from Staten Island, over the season. The team is owned by the Getzler family and members of the Steinbrenner family, who also have a stake in the major league team.
Josh Getzler, the club's chief operating officer, disputed criticism that the Yankees were getting a sweetheart lease: "The reality of the situation is that it's probably the most substantial lease of any minor league affiliate in terms of the amount of money going back to government."
If all goes well, Mr. Getzler said, the city could get as much as $1 million a year in rent and fees. City officials estimated the stadium would generate $175 million in economic activity in the life of the lease.
The team would have the option of walking away from the lease if it failed to make a profit for three consecutive years.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE ISSUES;
McCain, Sure on Military Issues, Is Less Certain on Domestic Ones

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
It was telling to hear John McCain proclaim his impatience with President Clinton's last State of the Union address.
"A two-hour marathon," Mr. McCain said dismissively, promising reporters that should he be elected president he would keep the ritual address to Congress to a crisp 15 minutes. 
 "I think what you should do is give a vision for America," he said, "not give a laundry list that looks like a Chinese menu with one from column A and one from column B."
"I know he likes that," he said of the president, "because he's a policy wonk." Mr. McCain by contrast is not a policy wonk, at least when it comes to domestic issues.
While the Arizona senator can speak in great detail about unneeded weapons systems or his theories of containing rogue state dictators, he seems less fluent on the issues that were not his Senate specialties -- like health care or the environment or education.
Just a few months ago, Mr. McCain sometimes used the words Medicare and Medicaid interchangeably, mixing up the federal health insurance programs for the elderly and for the poor. He has since stopped.
And it is instructive that his pledge to audiences that he would never be guided by opinion polls but would always act "on principle" applies only to national security matters. On domestic affairs, Mr. McCain says it would be helpful to use polls to find out what Americans want.
In fact, despite Mr. McCain's reliably conservative voting record in his 17 years in Congress and his image as a reformer, his ideas on domestic matters sometimes seem far from fixed or fully developed. Although he has declared war on pork barrel spending and continues to call for an overhaul of the system of unlimited donations to political parties, he has yet to explain fully how his vision of conservative reform would translate into a comprehensive domestic agenda.
In some ways, Mr. McCain seems caught between his desire to help people solve big problems and his natural instinct as a conservative Republican to find small-government solutions. Occasionally when voters ask him about difficult social problems, he pledges to gather "the best minds in America" to work toward answers. And while Mr. McCain calls himself a "proud conservative," he sometimes agrees with questioners that various federal programs need more money.
At other moments, Mr. McCain almost plays down the importance of domestic matters when he says he is "fully prepared to lead" because of his experience in the military and his expertise in national security affairs.
The difference in Mr. McCain's command of foreign policy and domestic policy shows on his free-wheeling campaign bus, where reporters can question him all day long. He assesses world leaders and European defense capabilities with gusto. But he was far less animated last month when reporters pressed him at great length on whether he would stick to his vow against Internet taxation if recession ever loomed or if so much commerce moved to the Internet that states started seeing a decline in sales tax revenue.
"It will be a permanent ban on Internet taxation," Mr. McCain finally said, when questions continued even after he said that Internet commerce was expanding the economy, not cutting into other sales. "I cannot elaborate," he said several times in order to cut off the conversation.
On another day he became impatient when quizzed closely over when he views an issue as a state matter and when he sees it as a federal concern. "We're getting into the rarified atmosphere here of the academic Talmudian aspects of the role of the federal government," he said as reporters pressed him on federalism. "I like to deal on the level of the problems today."
And while he considers the lack of universal health care coverage a pressing social problem, he shies away from a big government solution, instead proposing tax-free savings accounts to help some people buy insurance and expansion of a current program to insure children. He also says general tax cuts would help people buy insurance.
"I think every American should have access to health insurance," he says. "I can't force every American to take it."
So far, this has mattered little in an insurgent campaign run on a blend of character, biography and reform. "What's driven the McCain candidacy thus far is his story, his personality, not his issue positions," said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster unaffiliated with any presidential campaign.
In fact, voters virtually never point to any specific issue when asked why they like him. Katie Koenen, 18, who waited until 3 a.m. for Mr. McCain to arrive for a rally in South Carolina after winning the New Hampshire primary proclaimed him "more upfront" than Gov. George W. Bush.
Margaret Avery, a retired bookkeeper who went to one of Mr. McCain's New Hampshire town hall meetings, said simply, "I think he's truthful."
Audiences even seem appreciative when Mr. McCain admits he has some learning to do. "I don't claim to you to be an expert on this issue," he told a group of young people demanding a solution to global warming at one of his town hall meetings. He promised he would gather experts to study the problem.
Whether this will all catch up to him is an open question. Mr. Bush is beginning to point to his record as a governor to draw distinctions with Mr. McCain.
"I stand before you as a governor who led my state to managed-care reform," Mr. Bush said today in Delaware. "Some people in Washington say we can't get anything done because of all the lobbyists and special interests," he said, in a reference to Mr. McCain. "That's somebody who doesn't understand how to lead."
Supporters of the governor like Ralph Reed also note that Mr. McCain has never unveiled a comprehensive education plan the way Mr. Bush has. Mr. McCain had an education speech scheduled before the New Hampshire primary but canceled it rather than shift the focus in New Hampshire away from the tax cutting and Social Security debate.
He advocates a test of school vouchers paid for by closing corporate subsidies. And he speaks generally of giving merit pay to teachers based on student performance. Mr. McCain has put forward plans for Social Security, tax cuts, health care and the environment but even as he has done so, he has been hazy on the fine points of his own proposals.
Should Mr. McCain become the Republican nominee, he will face Democrats who are already researching his voting record in order to paint him as a Gingrich-style Republican out of step with mainstream values.
He embraced the Contract With America and voted with his party on the budget and tax cut proposals of 1995 that would have made $270 billion in savings in Medicare while granting $245 billion in tax cuts. Democrats are also poised to run against his anti-abortion votes and his votes against gun control.
Yet for now Mr. McCain has managed to transcend ideology and appeal to voters across a broad spectrum in part because his battle against special interests does not fall neatly along the right-left divide. Conservatives and liberals alike can warm to his promises to take government "out of the hands of the special interests and the big money and give it back to you."
Even on the polarizing social issue of abortion, Mr. McCain constantly points to his anti-abortion votes in Congress. Yet at the same time, his comments suggesting that he would let his daughter decide whether to have an abortion have created the impression among people on both sides of the question that he is not committed to the cause. He later said that he had misspoken.
He tells audiences, "Everyone -- pro-life or pro-choice -- has the same goal, which is to eliminate abortion." He also says that he would not use abortion as a litmus test in picking Supreme Court nominees, but would look instead for judges who are strict interpreters of the Constitution.
He told reporters last month, "I don't think that anybody in my personal opinion, who can say they adhere to the Constitution would have rendered the Roe v. Wade decision." But he also said he would consider judges as nominees not on one decision but on their "overall philosophy." He noted for example that he continued to admire Antonin Scalia even though he had dissented from a recent decision upholding limits on campaign contributions.
What adds to the enigma of Mr. McCain is that he sometimes seems to be embarking on a new intellectual journey along the campaign trail.
After years of voting for Republican tax cuts, Mr. McCain broke with his party's supply-siders in this campaign and advocated that the federal surplus be used for modest tax cuts and for shoring up Social Security. He likes to point out that virtually no one at his town hall meetings asks for a tax cut. And in New Hampshire at least, the primary results suggest he had a better grasp of public sentiment than Mr. Bush.
When voters in New Hampshire spoke of elderly relatives who could not afford prescription drugs, he came up with a federal-state block grant program to help the older people pay for drugs.
Mr. McCain likes to say that his many town hall meetings and inquisitive audiences have helped him. "I am a better candidate," he said one night, summing up his 114 town hall meetings in New Hampshire.

Can He Carry Vote As Well as a Tune?
VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE was saying, "The occasion is piled high with difficulty," adding, "We must rise with the occasion." Another campaign speech? No, those were the words of Abraham Lincoln, and Mr. Gore was the celebrity narrator on the podium Monday night for Aaron Copland's "Lincoln Portrait," in Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center. Cued by LEON BOTSTEIN, conductor of the American Symphony Orchestra, Mr. Gore was the draw at a fund-raising event for charities including the Harlem School of the Arts, Bard College and the New York Housing Authority Symphony Orchestra. After three standing ovations, the audience joined the vice president in a revival-meeting rendition of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic." 
 "I made sure my microphone wasn't on" during the singing, the vice president said in a private moment of candor at the post-performance reception. "I'm not a bad singer, but I'm not ready for Lincoln Center!"
 
A Veteran's Strut
At OZWALD BOATENG'S men's fashion show at the Metropolitan Pavilion the other night, after a parade of suits and shirts in iridescent blues, purples and oranges passed along the catwalk, the last model in the spotlight, wearing a comparatively staid, black suit, received the loudest ovation. Maybe it was the exaggerated walk, part Mick Jagger, part Naomi Campbell. But more likely, it was the fashion crowd, which included the actress ANGIE HARMON, acknowledging LAURENCE FISHBURNE'S first strut down a runway.
"I used my veteran walk," Mr. Fishburne said after the show, where the actors BILLY ZANE and STEPHEN BALDWIN also modeled Mr. Boateng's suits.
"Veteran walk of which war?" someone asked.
"Veteran of my craft, of the stage," Mr. Fishburne said with a laugh. "To me, this is another stage to perform on."
But he's not just a suit-and-tie guy. "I've always loved the rags that Stevie wore," said Mr. Fishburne, referring to Stevie Van Zandt, Bruce Springsteen's guitarist, and his custom-made bandannas. "So I had someone make up a bunch for me."
 
But Is It a Crime Or a Misdemeanor?
WOODY ALLEN'S on-screen personas include hypochondriac, sports reporter and human chameleon, but the filmmaker turned up at City Hall yesterday afternoon playing a neighborhood advocate.
At a hearing held by the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission, Mr. Allen stepped up to a lectern to testify against a developer's plans to put up a 17-story apartment building on the northeast corner of Madison Avenue and 91st Street, a block away from the building Mr. Allen recently moved into.
In the self-deprecating style shared by many of his film characters, Mr. Allen noted that he had a losing record when battling on behalf of the community, and joked that local property values had declined since he moved to Carnegie Hill last year. The area, which stretches from 86th to 96th Streets between Fifth and Lexington Avenues, is often depicted in his films, including the one he distributed yesterday to the commission's members: a three-minute video he made.
Since much of the area is designated a historic district, plans for new buildings must be approved by the landmarks commission.
Approving the 17-story building, said Mr. Allen, would be "an egregious mistake" because it is too tall for the neighborhood.
"It's the wrong building for that site," he said. "This is a beautiful, beautiful, small, human-scale neighborhood, and to suddenly come into it and throw up a 17-story building seems, you know, like an obvious, obvious, awful thing to do."
Earlier in the hearing, architects for the project contended that the plans had already been revised to incorporate the neighborhood's style.
But Mr. Allen recalled "an old joke" about a man drowning a hundred feet from shore who is thrown a 50-foot rope by people claiming that they are "meeting him halfway." GLENN COLLINS with Joe Brescia and Corey Kilgannon

HEADLINE: Fashionably Early: New York Starts Buzzing Before Dusk

BYLINE: By RICK MARIN 

 BODY:
THE early-bird special. Is there a more mocked and maligned dining ritual? Who eats before 8 o'clock? It's so Boca Raton, so AARP, so tacky as to be ripe for reinvention as New York's next big dining trend -- as long as everyone agrees to call it something else.
Pretheater, prix fixe and "sunset menu" are the preferred euphemisms for cut-rate dinner specials between 5 and 7 p.m. The concept has trickled up from the all-you-can-eat buffets that service Florida's gerontocracy to Manhattan's whitest tablecloths. 
 Restaurants that once might have shunned such vulgarity now have early-bird specials. Three courses for $46 at La Caravelle. Half-price sushi at March. Pretheater prix fixes extend well beyond the theater district, from Avenue uptown at 85th Street down to Phebe's, on the Bowery, and sunset menus are promised in establishments where sun seldom shines (like the subterranean Vice Versa in Midtown).
Even buzzing places of the moment seem eager to make arriving early seem less unfashionable.
Metrazur, in Grand Central Terminal, throws in a free miniature "suitcase" with its pretheater meal, filled with cookies to munch on during intermission and a $3 MetroCard for the commute to Broadway. Pastis does its desperate would-be patrons the favor of accepting reservations at 6 o'clock. Windows on the World's Greatest Bar on Earth even has a romantic 5:30 seating for Valentine's Day. Kudos to the smooth operator who can sell his date on that timing.
To see how New York's chronic late birds were reacting to these efforts to get them to migrate to the early hours, I tried a week's worth of pre-emptive dining, from 3:30 -- yes, 3:30 -- to 7, but only at places offering the equivalent of early-bird bargains. A few times, I was even able to persuade people to go with me.
I like to think I was early on the early-bird trend. I was trained that you ate 6:30, and in the company of Walter Cronkite. In adulthood, I was ridiculed for espousing the upsides of early dining. Faster service. They're never out of the special entree. Finish at 8 and the whole evening stretches before you: see a movie, read a book, shop. Burn calories!
After years of abuse, vindication was mine one evening last summer on Long Island. Four of us went to the Palm in East Hampton at 5 o'clock -- the only time we could get a reservation. We got there in broad daylight, and as we were walking in, who was walking out? Ron Silver! He must have gotten there at 4. I vowed to go on an early dining crusade.
The first night out on my early-bird experiment, I needed somewhere I could do dinner and make a 6 p.m. movie at the Sony Lincoln Square. Conveniently situated, for my purposes, on the corner of Columbus Avenue and 85th Street, Avenue offers a $20 pretheater prix fixe from 5 to 6:30, with a decent selection of appetizers, entrees and desserts (coffee included). I roped in a colleague, who seemed excited by the novelty of the early dinner experience, and the promise of making the movie afterward. Arriving just before 5, we were the first people there. And for the next hour, we were the only people there. The woman nibbling alone at a table by the bar turned out to be a waitress.
One advantage of the 5 or 6 p.m. dinner preached to me by a couple of restaurateurs is better service. The waiters are fresh, not yet beaten down by demanding patrons. Our waiter at Avenue was, for the most part, attentive, though not all that attentive considering he had no other customers. I had to wave him down at least once and remind him we had a movie to catch. Getting out in time meant either coffee or dessert, but not both. We passed on the banana gateau and, just as we were leaving, another couple arrived.
"Welcome to my dining room," the woman bellowed to no one in particular. Then, still standing, her coat still on: "How are the veal chops? Tender?"
Now, we were getting some of that wacky early-bird ambience! Just as we made it out the door at 5:50. Enough time to make the movie, walk out after 20 minutes, go to Cafe Luxembourg for a drink, then Coco Opera for another drink. Then go home and read.
How often can you cram that much action into one evening?
Like Avenue, Vice Versa also offers a pretheater prix fixe. Which makes sense because there are actually Broadway theaters in its immediate vicinity. It's a 5 to 7 p.m. deal. Two of us showed up just past 6 on a Thursday night, with a third on the way. For $29.50, the choices are two appetizers, two mains, two desserts, and tea or coffee. A la carte, a $40 meal. One of the owners, Daniele Kucera, told me, when I called him a few days earlier, that about half of the 60 customers he serves in those two hours go for the prix fixe.
"It's mostly an older crowd," he said. I wondered if the older diners would be satisfied with the binary choices on the menu.
"They are picky," Mr. Kucera said. "They can be asking for this and that. I'm trying to be flexible, but you can't put the homemade pasta on there because it's a lot of work."
While we were there, it was a demographic cross section. A middle-aged couple. A young woman waiting for her date, who then showed up. In a corner booth, a grande dame, who never took off her fur hat, sat with a gentleman of similar vintage. No children, though.
Like almost every other place I checked out, Vice Versa was stroller-free. The only stroller I saw was at Artie's, the big new delicatessen on Broadway at 82nd Street, where I ate my 3:30 dinner two tables away from a new mother and her well-behaved baby daughter. The mother was enough of a regular to know about Artie's early-bird special -- free soup and rugelach for the price of an entree. (Not listed on the menu; it's a word-of-mouth thing.)
At Vice Versa, the middle-age couple, Sal and Janet Mannuccia, from Wilton, Conn., said they usually ate at 8 o'clock at home, but got here at 5:30 because they had theater tickets.
"That leaves plenty of time for dinner," Mr. Mannuccia, a high-school physics teacher, said. As a regular eating time, though, he said, 5:30 is "just too early." They ordered a la carte.
As a test, I asked if I could have the lemon mousse instead of the chocolate one on the prix fixe menu.
"You can do that," the waiter said. "No problem."
Being demanding is a key part of the early-bird ethic. Accept no soup that is not filled to the brim! I resolved to be more demanding on my solo excursion to Acacia, the brasserie that opened last May a block from Bloomingdale's.
Three different salads were on the two-course, $15.50 "sunset menu," but not the one I wanted: baby frisee aux lardons with a poached egg on top. The menu said "No substitutions" -- unless the diner was willing to pay any difference. I asked if I could make one, without paying extra.
"Non," the waiter said.
I agreed to pay. Sitting in the amber glow of the ostrich-egg light fixtures, how could I not ask for the specialite de la maison? Could I substitute the 10-ounce hanger steak, listed with a $5 surcharge, for the $12.50 ostrich burger?
"Non."
I felt like Steve Martin in "L.A. Story," when Patrick Stewart, playing a French-accented maitre d'hotel, tells him, "You cannot have zee duck!"
I looked the waiter in the eye: "I'm not really having the sunset menu, am I?"
"Non," he said again. "You are not having it at all."
Why do I get the feeling that waiters don't love the early-birders? Maybe because, as Gabriel Aiello, a co-owner of Gabriel's, told me, they are by definition not big spenders. That's why he doesn't solicit their business. "They're kicking the tires," Mr. Aiello said. "They're ordering water."
But the food at Acacia was delicious, and I got through two newspapers. A little lonely when I got there, it was about a third full by 7. The real action was at the bar. Overheard early-bird dialogue isn't the bad Noel Coward knock-off stuff you hear later on. At Artie's Delicatessen, for instance, I heard, from a woman to her dining companion, "You wanna take that home?" At the otherwise understated Acacia, it was "Another tequila shot!"
Philippe Feret, the chef and owner of Acacia and of Brasserie Julien, farther uptown, said his sunset menus attracts mostly regulars, a lot of them on their way to one of the three movie theaters around the corner. "More than ever, people are looking for special deals," he said.
All the new money around is starting to act like old money: cheap.
After dinner, inspired by all the money I had saved, I walked through the Bloomingdale's shirt department, trying to spend it.
The economics of the early-bird offering, for a higher-end place, are hard to work out. The kitchen is up and running, the waiters standing around rehearsing their lines. As David Cunningham, the chef at the Lenox Room, said of his Monday-to-Saturday, 5:30 to 6:30, $25 menu: "We're open. We have the staff there and we have the food there." Jimmy Bradley, the chef and a co-owner of Red Cat, in Chelsea, said "There's no way to make money off it." His $20 prix fixe, Monday to Friday from 5:30 to 6:30, has drawn in "dribs and drabs," he said, adding, "Some people are like, 'Wow, that's a crazy value' or 'Wow, that's really cheap!' "
For Mr. Feret, who also does a two-course $9.95 lunch, it's a loss leader. "We really just want to be known," he said.
Hotels led the way in what is referred to in the trade as "downtime food service," said Michael Batterberry, the co-author with his wife, Ariane, of "On the Town in New York" (Routledge, 1999).
"People consider it their birthright to eat what they want when they want," he said. "And there has been a continuing erosion of former meal hours."
Upscale steakhouses contributed to the erosion over the last decade, he said, feeding hungry bond traders their protein slabs in time for the 8:02 Metro-North to Greenwich. Last month, to accommodate customer demand, Oceana moved the start time of its $65 prix fixe on Saturdays to 5, from 5:30.
"The early bird suggests people who might not make it to nightfall," Mr. Batterberry said. "It has the aura of the excessively elderly." But hip foreign foods like tapas and sushi can get people used to dining after work without feeling like grandparents.
It is not, apparently, the key to longevity. Sadly, the idea that eating early is also a dietary boon is merely a pleasant theory. While there have been no studies on the early bird per se, in the October 1998 issue of the University of California's Berkeley Wellness Letter, a reader asked if eating late was more likely to cause weight gain.
The answer: "Over the years many experiments have shown that the time of day you eat has no connection with weight gain."
It's a good thing, because the only problem with early-bird dining is, like your grandparents used to say about Chinese food, three hours later, you're hungry again.

HEADLINE: Disguising the Sting of Higher Rates

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
JEFFREY NEWHOUSE, a tax lawyer with a lot of Wall Street clients, is basking in the New Mexico sun, dreaming of the Colonial-style four-bedroom house that, even in the snow, is rising on four and a half acres of woods in Killingworth, Conn.
And he is pleased -- some might even say smug -- about the deal he made through a broker for his mortgage with the Bank of America. 
 In one of the many arrangements being offered by lenders now, Mr. Newhouse, 44, got what he considers the best of both worlds of mortgage financing: he got to lock in the rate before it went even higher, and in the unlikely case the rates go down, he got the option to reduce the rate when he actually closes on the house.
As the Federal Reserve keeps raising the rates -- last week's quarter percent was the fourth such rise since June -- banks across the country are coming up with gimmicks to disguise the higher rates; in this case, taking the borrower's mind off how much the rates have gone up in the last year, while making clients feel lucky that they aren't even higher (a neat trick). The practice offers peace of mind in a volatile market.
Besides loans like the one Mr. Newhouse is taking out, called a "lock in, float down" loan, banks are also luring less affluent, first-time buyers, with 40-year mortgages instead of the more conventional 30-year mortgages. Monthly payments will be slightly lower, but the buyer will pay tens of thousands of dollars more over the course of the loan, mortgage brokers say.
"Everyone's selling the same lousy rates, so every bank is offering some 'product enhancements,' " said Melissa Cohn, the president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, one of New York City's biggest residential mortgage brokers. "That won't make the rates any lower, but it can make the payments lower."
No matter how many bonuses and incentives they advertise, banks are offering rates that are a lot higher than they were a year ago. Last February, a conventional 30-year-fixed mortgage could be snagged for 6.78 percent. This week, the average rate is 8.25 percent. On a $200,000 mortgage, that means $201 a month more to pay.
"Taken together with the rising cost of houses, that really blows the payments out of the water," said Martin Sasbon, a group vice president at the EAB Mortgage Company, a division of the bank.
But interestingly enough, the payments for a 40-year loan aren't that much lower, and the total amount one ends up paying is higher.
For a $200,000 loan, the borrower would end up paying back $540,720 with a 30-year loan, versus $685,440 with a 40-year loan.
And the difference in monthly payments? With the 30-year loan, they are $1,502 a month, and with the 40-year loan, they are only . . . $1,428 a month!
So who takes the 40-year loans?
"People at the two extremes: the first-time home buyers who want a little more purchasing power and, at the upper end, the big players with jumbo mortgages who are just looking for increased cash flow," Mr. Sasbon said.
Anyone getting a mortgage these days might be concerned about rates heading upward. It takes a minimum of about two months to buy a co-op or condominium, assuming the most straightforward transaction, from signing to closing; almost all mortgage institutions offer the borrower the option of choosing the rate either on signing or at closing time.
Now, many banks will commit to a current interest rate for up to a year. Mortgage brokers say that most of the borrowers who take advantage of these really long lock-in times are waiting for their new condominium to be built on Third Avenue or for their new mini-palazzo to be built in the suburbs.
Rajat Gupta, a finance manager with a Westchester chemical company, thinks the mortgage that he and his wife, Vanita, a financial analyst, got for their new $425,000 house in White Plains is terrific. Mr. Gupta said he first scanned the Internet for the lowest mortgage rates before he went to a mortgage broker.
Then he accepted a deal that protects him from the stormy rate seas until his family's four-bedroom Georgian-style house is finished, which it won't be until next November. He locked in a 7.87 percent rate.
But he had to pay $600 to the bank for the privilege.
He says he could make back that $600 in two months, if the rates go up one percentage point. "It's a great deal," he said.
And there are more deals being offered by lenders. Negative-amortization loans are back, after a few blissful years of not seeing ads for artificially low rates like "3 1/2 percent for the first 60 days!" For some borrowers, such a deal "takes the sting out" of the first few months of payments, Ms. Cohn, the mortgage broker, said. But the sting returns: buyers usually end up paying more over the course of these loans.
While many lenders promote the new products as an opportunity for borrowers, Ms. Cohn, who negotiates them every day, remains dubious, especially about the benefits for newcomers to the housing market.
"It's a lose-lose situation for the buyer in the long run," she said.
 
What Not to Do
LIKE so much in life, a lot of the mortgage deals these days could be defined as "Pay now, or pay more later." So check the fine print.
With the so-called negative-amortization mortgage, which offers an introductory rate lower than the average, the borrower actually winds up paying more.
"In the long term, you're actually accruing that difference," said Melissa Cohn, the president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company. "You're paying the interest on the unpaid interest."
The same principle applies to the lower payments for 40-year mortgages: you will pay a lot more, a lot longer, for monthly payments that are only slightly lower.
To Ms. Cohn, which loan you pick depends on your goal. "If you have a cash-flow problem," she said, "you'll be forced to pick the lower rate." That way, you will get the lowest possible monthly payment, but you will have to pay it for a decade longer. (You might also choose one of those options if you are going to keep the apartment or house for only a year or two.)
Another tip: Look for mortgage deals without prepayment penalties. If you find a lower rate later, you want to be sure you can get out of your existing mortgage without a fee. If you are buying a condominium and want to refinance your mortgage, you might have to pay the mortgage recording tax twice, which would add one and three-quarter points to the deal.
"That could certainly wipe out your reason for refinancing," Ms. Cohn said. TRACIE ROZHON

HEADLINE: For Sale: Everything but the Props

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 9

 BODY:
There are times confronting a sherbet-green entryway in a house for sale or a globe light fixture from the "Brady Bunch" era -- when Ken Fulk thinks of himself as a pair of glasses, correcting people's vision.
"You don't want to walk into a house and say, 'Oh my God, the carpet,' " said Mr. Fulk, 34, one of a growing band of decorators specializing in the fine art of "staging" or "propping" houses for sale, a phenomenon that has reached epic proportions. "My job is to help create a frenzy." 
 Here in the nation's most expensive real estate market, where it is not uncommon to have 15 buyers in a bidding war, staging -- also called house-dressing or "fluffing" -- is rapidly becoming the norm. Eager to get top dollar, homeowners are paying $2,000 to $10,000 to have humdrum rooms transformed into scrumptious interiors. To professional stagers like Mr. Fulk, who has a retinue of haulers, painters, floor and tile refinishers and carpet layers at the ready, falls the task of eliminating the orange shag, smoked mirrors, 1960's bathroom tile and dead plants (dead is a major turnoff) that can stall a sale.
Like human eyeliner, stagers are brought in, usually at the urging of a real estate agent, to "bring out the good features of a home," particularly in aging homes, in the words of Marlene Wharmby, an Oakland stager, who propped nearly 200 houses last year and whose signature is the telltale Tiffany box she leaves on the night stand. (Arthur McLaughlin, a San Francisco stager, leaves chocolate kisses.)
"We live in a house one way, we sell it another," said Malin Giddings, a broker at TRI/Coldwell Banker, who often summons Mr. McLaughlin to stage million-dollar listings with props plucked from an inventory of some 20,000 items: linens, towels, plates, wingback chairs and lampshades. (Mr. McLaughlin buys 350 lampshades at a time.) "He does in four days what a housewife does in nine months," Ms. Giddings said. "I mean, it's a miracle."
Objects that do not fit in are out. Mr. McLaughlin once asked a client with an original Georgia O'Keeffe to put it under the bed. "It didn't fit in with the overall decor," he explained. (He prefers to have his own artist, Janet Bogardus, copy any painting, Monet to O'Keeffe, and alter it to his own specifications -- it might need a smidgen more peach, say.)
Such staging tricks can also warm up a newly minted house, said B. J. Droubi, a San Francisco real estate agent, who estimates that staging adds $30,000 to $60,000, often more, to the final price of a home.
With a profusion of I.P.O.-flush clients, the Bay Area has become the epicenter of staging, home to some 70 professionals with names like Stage Hands, Center Stage, Stage Right and House-Dressing. Then there is Stage Interiors, a 10,000-square-foot warehouse filled with rental furniture and accessories. In this town, it sometimes seems that all the world's a stager.
"Staging was supposed to be about creating a facade," said D. J. Grubb Jr., president of the Grubb Company, an Oakland real estate agency, who dates the craze to the period just after 1991, when developers were trying to lure buyers to houses they had built to replace thousands destroyed by wildfire in the Oakland and Berkeley Hills. Now, Mr. Grubb said, "it has become an icon, the branding of a house."
Although still largely a West Coast phenomenon -- the 1920's hacienda outside Los Angeles owned by William Boyd, a k a Hopalong Cassidy, was staged recently -- the trend has caught on in cities like Minneapolis, as a strong economy and expectations among time-pinched buyers seeking perfection grow, said Martha Webb, an author of "Dress Your House for Success: Five Fast, Easy Steps to Selling Your House, Apartment or Condo for the Highest Possible Price" (Three Rivers Press, 1997). "It's harder to look at a house that's well staged," she said, "because you lose your heart."
Ms. Droubi tries to steer buyers to houses that aren't staged, so they won't get into bidding wars on overpriced properties. "A staged house evokes an emotional response -- people will pay whatever it takes to get it," she said. "I tell them to try to see past the dirty orange shag carpeting."
Her sellers, however, are another story. "We tell them to paint the living room pale yellow," she said. "All of a sudden, it's a darling little house."
Mr. Fulk has a personality as buoyant as the sofa pillows he keeps, along with several hundred antiques, in his barn in Napa. "I see so many houses filled with bad carpets and wrong decisions," he said.
One afternoon recently he paid a visit to Charlotte Albright, 42, a confectioner who is selling the three-bedroom Victorian house she shares with her schnauzer, Rocket. "Pretty . . . I would lose it," he said of the yolk-colored sponge paint in the living room. "Let's minimize the track lights to focus on the beautiful woodwork." He then turned to the delicate matter of scent. "Anything that evokes Rocket we need to eliminate," he said sweetly but sternly.
Staging takes diplomacy. "You really have to be polite," Mr. McLaughlin said. "People's sofas are very emotional to them."
Stagers "depersonalize" a space, removing family photographs and other cherished possessions. "You don't want buyers thinking about who lives there," Mr. Fulk said. "You want them to think about themselves living there."
It's not uncommon for a houseful of lovingly accumulated objects to be banished to a garage or basement, which is what happened recently to Antoinette Broussard, an interior designer and writer in San Francisco. She is staying at her mother-in-law's house while Mr. Fulk stages her house of 22 years. "It's difficult," she said, her voice tinged with sadness. "But if you want to get the best price, you have to take your ego out of it, put your personal feelings aside."
Ms. Albright will spend $20,000 on staging. "It is a little invasive," she said, noting that she was feeling "a little protective" of the smashed-Fiestaware tiles around the fireplace, which Mr. Fulk deemed "too kooky."
Staging requires a different knack from regular decorating. Gray, for instance, is not a good resale color, "because it doesn't make a space look happy," Mr. McLaughlin said. Turquoise is a turnoff, reminding people of "the 'Miami Vice' era." Mr. McLaughlin, who has been staging for 18 years, possibly a national record, recalled a client in the Pacific Heights neighborhood with baby-blue halls and stair runners. "Baby blue is not a resale color, especially in a multimillion-dollar mansion," he said.
Maximum wattage is another staging must. "You want dramatic shadows," he said, "as opposed to dark, depressing shadows." Among the telltale signs of staging are unopened bottles of olive oil on the kitchen counters, a dining room table set for dinner (minus the silverware, an antitheft touch) and cozy-looking double duvets and mattresses piled a la "Princess and the Pea." Television sets -- "too harsh a reality," in the words of Ms. Wharmby, the Oakland stager -- are usually absent.
Staging is a little bit like romance, Mr. McLaughlin said: "You never get a second chance. First impressions -- that's it!"
For buyers, staging can present pitfalls, causing them to swoon over day lilies artfully placed in a kitchen corner where the refrigerator should be. "If at first glance a place looks like a perfect person lives there, then like nobody lives there, it's probably been staged," said Bob Powers, founder of Stage Hands.
Ralph Holman, a lawyer for the National Association of Realtors in Chicago, said sellers must disclose "material defects in a property of which they are aware," like a crack in a foundation. But strategically placing a Venetian glass vase at a window to block an unappealing view or making a bedroom look bigger by installing a narrow antique bed are not against the law. "Most buyers are unaware of staging," Ms. Droubi said. "But there's a fine line. You don't want people to feel manipulated."
Peter Sargent, a science professor at the University of California at San Francisco, recently bought an 1883 house in the Noe Valley area that had been staged by Mr. Fulk. A pewter tray on the coffee table had green apples lined up in a grid, three on a side. "You look at it and say: 'What is this? Pottery Barn?' " he said.
But what appealed to Professor Sargent was not the things that had been staged. It was the old stove and the view of a steeple between poplar trees. Staging, he said, "reveals the pathology of the real estate industry and how calculated it has become."
On a recent rainy Sunday afternoon, it was difficult not to be smitten by a humble three-bedroom bungalow on the market for $519,000 in Piedmont, an affluent community adjoining Oakland. No detail had been left unstaged. Lamps glowed invitingly in the front window, and an antique cookbook lay evocatively on the breakfast table. The house's defects -- tiny, undistinguished rooms -- seemed like assets, the narrow antique beds and floral comforters evoking a thatched-roof bed and breakfast in Dorset.
Striving to instill as many feelings of home as possible, Ms. Wharmby placed a bottle of Champagne with four antique glasses on the dining room table. She even brought a touch of class to the "Motel 6 bathroom," as she called it, taking attention away from dated, beat-up decor with cut-glass bottles of designer perfume.
"If you have drugstore perfume," she explained, summing up the stager's art, "it's never going to have the impact of a few bottles of Chanel No. 5."

HEADLINE: Long-Term Care Crisis

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Feb. 4 editorial "The Shortage of Health Aides" calls attention to a looming crisis that will take an enormous emotional and financial toll on millions of Americans. As the baby boomers age, studies show that nearly half of them will need some sort of long-term care. 
 A majority of them mistakenly believe that Medicare will pay for their care. It does not. At a current average national cost of $51,000 per year, long-term care has the potential to destroy most families' economic security, forcing them to rely on Medicaid, the federal and state program that helps pay for health care for the poor.
We believe that the president and presidential candidates must begin a national dialogue on long-term care financing reform so that we can help maintain economic and retirement security for our nation's elderly, chronically ill and disabled.

HEADLINE: Productivity's Price

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In your Feb. 9 front-page article about the 5 percent rise in productivity in the last six months of 1999, you point out that the economy can grow without igniting inflation because "workers, in effect, are producing much more without having to be paid more." Is that cause for self-congratulation? I call it exploitation.

HEADLINE: Vienna's Woe Is Heartening Isolationists Among Swiss

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Resentment against what is viewed as European Union meddling in Austrian affairs has given isolationist groups in Switzerland an unexpected lift. After months of trying, opponents have quickly gathered enough signatures to try to derail long-planned Swiss ties to the European Union.
A petition for a referendum with 70,000 signatures was delivered last week to the governing council in the capital, Bern, accompanied by a donkey draped with the European Union flag. 
 A coalition of 11 groups, including two right-wing parties, said they had gathered the bulk of the signatures last week.
"We have never had a dictator and we don't need to have one now from Brussels," said Flavio Maspoli, an official in a right-wing party.
The drive for a referendum has been led by Rudolf Keller, a former member of Parliament who, at the height of the controversy over Holocaust victims' money in Swiss banks, called for a boycott of American and Jewish companies. (He later backed down from the statement.)
As recently as early last month, Mr. Keller and his supporters had attracted only half the number of signatures needed to force a referendum -- 50,000. And it looked as if the effort had failed.
But a surge in signers from the eastern part of Switzerland, closest to Austria and considered the most conservative region, has forced the government to set the voting date for May 21.
Contention over neutral Switzerland's links with neighbors has been simmering for a decade. In 1992, the country voted against joining an economic grouping tied to the 15-member European Union.
Recently, views appeared to have shifted in favor of closer ties, in the face of prodding from the central government and changing economic realities. Polls now show that two-thirds of Swiss support closer relations with surrounding countries. But the referendum will be the first time that sentiment is measured at the ballot box.
In the fall, the center-left government was threatened by a better-than-expected showing by the country's most nationalist party, the People's Party, led by Christoph Blocher, in elections held after unflattering disclosures about Switzerland's actions in World War II.
Swiss are quick to say that Mr. Blocher's brand of nationalism is less strident than that of Jorg Haider, who has taken his far-right-wing Freedom Party into the government in Austria. But the Austrian situation has drawn adamant commentary here that the European Union is interfering.
"To sanction a country solely because of the political composition of its executive is a serious and unacceptable precedent," Eric Hoesli, editor of a daily in Geneva, Le Temps, wrote in a front-page editorial last Friday.
Opponents of the European Union here say by spurning Austria the organization has shown that it is not democratic enough and is too big and bureaucratic.
One organizer of the petition drive, Bernhard Hess, said that realization caused voters to sign for a referendum that would decide by a simple majority whether Switzerland should adhere to bilateral accords with the European Union. The Parliament has already approved the accords, which are to take effect next year.
Negotiated over four years, they are seen as a steppingstone to eventual membership. The agreements would ease tough border controls and immigration rules and eliminate trade barriers. In an unusual alliance with the conservative groups, Swiss environmentalists oppose the accords, in part because they would allow 40-ton trucks on trans-Alpine routes.
Supporters of the accords, which include many businesses, banks and unions, see them as crucial for Switzerland to gain access to the vast European Union market.
Economics Minister Pascal Couchepin pledged to lead the fight to win approval of the accords, which he maintains would allow Switzerland to be treated as an equal but would not require the country to be involved with decisions from Brussels.
Taking note of the donkey that delivered the signatures in Bern, Mr. Couchepin said, "It's necessary to know whether the donkey represents those seeking the referendum or those fighting it."

HEADLINE: Fight Over a Chinese Prisoner Goes Public

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Frustrated after six months of fruitless inquiries to Chinese officials, American legislators are mounting a public campaign on behalf of a prominent Muslim businesswoman from China's Far West who was jailed on vague charges of revealing state intelligence to foreigners.
The woman, Rebiya Kadeer, 53, was detained Aug. 11 in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang province, where she owned a department store and a trading company. She was picked up just before she was to meet visiting Congressional staff members, who had invited her to a private dinner. Later, two of her sons and her secretary were detained as well. 
 One son was released after three days. The other, accused of supporting subversive activities, was sent without trial to a labor camp for two years. The secretary was sentenced to three years in a labor camp.
Ms. Kadeer's trial was delayed and may take place in the next few weeks, her family has been told.
For years, Ms. Kadeer had been officially touted as a rags-to-riches inspiration for her fellow members of the Uighur ethnic group. Now, her arrest has highlighted China's troubled relations with the Uighur Muslims, who are a dwindling majority in the province as ethnic Chinese move in, and have been struggling to assert their national identity.
Ms. Kadeer's arrest has been condemned by international legal monitors, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, because the case appears to be flimsy and the real target appears to be her husband, Sidik Rouzi. He is an Uighur nationalist who fled to the United States in 1996 and made radio broadcasts critical of Beijing.
The son who was detained and released in August, Alim Abdiryim, asserted in an interview from Urumqi last week that his mother and his imprisoned brother, Ablikim Abdiryim, 26, had done nothing more than send published local newspaper articles about Uighur affairs to their father.
"She was arrested because she was one of the most patriotic members of our Uighur nationality and one of the people most willing to help the poor," said Mr. Abdiryim, who is 24. "The other reason was because of my father, who they said was engaged in counterrevolutionary activities in the United States."
Because Ms. Kadeer had been about to meet with the Congressional staff members, who were on an official tour, when she was arrested, several American senators and representatives have followed the case closely.
But letters and meetings with Chinese officials have yielded no explanations. So Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican, plans to seek wide support this week for a Congressional resolution calling on the Chinese to release Ms. Kadeer, her son and secretary, and calling for a United Nations human rights investigation.
Senator Roth, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, will manage the key trade legislation seeking permanent normal trade status for China in connection with China's entry into the World Trade Organization. He has strongly supported China's entry into the trade body, but said he had been frustrated by Chinese stonewalling on the Kadeer case.
"Six months of quiet diplomacy has achieved nothing," Senator Roth said in an interview on Sunday, adding that he was worried by indications that Ms. Kadeer would soon be put on trial. A guilty verdict in Chinese security trials is virtually preordained. Depending on how the court defines her transgression, Ms. Kadeer could receive anywhere from a short sentence to more than 10 years in prison.
A separate resolution calling for the release of Ms. Kadeer, her son and secretary was introduced last week by Senator Paul Wellstone, a Democrat from Minnesota and a frequent critic of China's human rights policies.
Splintered and lacking an internationally recognized leader like the Tibetans' Dalai Lama, Uighur nationalists have received relatively little international attention.
Xinjiang security forces have periodically battled members of a small, armed separatist movement that seeks an independent East Turkestan, and scores of Uighur militants have been executed in recent years.
But the Chinese are also struggling to contain a much broader effort by Uighurs to strengthen their sense of identity and their economic status in the face of domination by ethnic Chinese and the Communist Party. Outspoken intellectuals like Mr. Rouzi have been jailed or have gone into exile, and publications about Uighur history and conditions are tightly controlled.
In the mid-1990's, Ms. Kadeer was praised as a bootstrap millionaire. Born in poverty, married at 15, she amassed a trading fortune even as she raised 10 children.
The Communist Party held her up as a product of its enlightened ethnic policies. She was appointed to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Congress, a prestigious national advisory body, and a was delegate to the United Nations conference on women, held in Beijing in 1995.
Her star apparently began to fall after her husband left for political asylum in the United States in 1996. Mr. Rouzi had been imprisoned in the late 1960's for his role in an anti-Chinese demonstration, he said in an interview last week from Oklahoma, where he now lives. Then in the mid-1990's he published two articles in Urumqi newspapers criticizing Chinese treatment of Uighurs.
Fearing arrest, in 1996 he moved to the United States. He angered authorities further by broadcasting nationalistic messages on Uighur-language programs of the Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, United States-sponsored networks beaming into China.
In 1997, Ms. Kadeer's passport was revoked and the authorities froze the funds of an organization she had started to aid Muslim businesswomen. In 1998, she was removed from the national consultative conference and publicly castigated for failing to condemn her husband's broadcasts.
"She was never involved in politics," Mr. Rouzi said of his wife in an interview last week. "But she loves the Uighur people."
Mr. Rouzi said he had stopped his radio broadcasts. Five of their children live in the United States, while the other five remain in China.
Mr. Rouzi said the family had been told that Ms. Kadeer's case would be brought to trial soon after the Chinese New Year holiday.
The freed son, Alim Abdiryim, said relatives had been allowed to visit their mother only once since her arrest, on Jan. 5. "She was in poor spirits and said, 'I'm innocent, get me out of here,' " he said.
Soon after her arrest, he said, the authorities said she had been charged with providing foreign organizations with state secrets and intelligence.
"My mother is simply a businesswoman," Mr. Abdiryim said. "She doesn't know anything about state secrets or intelligence."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
A Modern French Aristocrat in Trade's Fractious Arena

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Pascal Lamy is known as "the Exocet" for a personality as direct and aggressive as the missile built in his French homeland. But now that he is Europe's top trade official, Mr. Lamy's subtle diplomacy may be a more useful weapon.
The 52-year-old career civil servant, appointed as the European Union's trade commissioner last fall, has found himself at the center of some of the world's most contentious trade disputes. French farmers want him to preserve the subsidies that keep their prices artificially high but are regarded as obstacles to free trade. European consumers want him to keep genetically modified food from abroad off store shelves. Then there are the seemingly never-ending fights between the European Union and the United States over bananas, steel, aircraft noise and hormone-treated beef. 
 There had been some surprise at Mr. Lamy's appointment, partly because of a widespread impression that he was simply too blunt and might alienate Europe's trading partners with his no-nonsense approach. But Mr. Lamy has shown himself to be adept at compromise.
He took the initiative to help restart the World Trade Organization talks that collapsed in Seattle two months ago, becoming the first top-level trade official publicly to propose a plan to break the impasse. This week, the Geneva-based trade forum announced that it would reconvene the talks, although with a narrower agenda than Mr. Lamy had wanted. "We have to repair and reignite the process," he said in an interview a few days earlier in his office in Brussels, headquarters of the European Commission, the European Union's administrative arm.
Mr. Lamy was named to the trade post after top officials of the previous European Commission had been dismissed last year over accusations of mismanagement and cronyism. His selection was a surprise partly because he had a not-altogether-flattering record in Brussels.
He served for nine years as assistant to the former European Commission president, Jacques Delors. It was in that post, where he handled top-level meetings of the Group of Seven industrial nations, that he acquired the sobriquet as a Delors hatchet man or, alternately, the Delors Exocet.
In 1994, Mr. Lamy left Brussels and returned to Paris to help in trying to salvage Credit Lyonnais, a troubled big bank that had accumulated enormous debts and required repeated taxpayer bailouts.
A graduate of an exclusive French management school, Mr. Lamy is identified with the country's political elite, a circle he mixes in easily as a member of a well-to-do Normandy family. Skeptics have wondered how a man ensconced in the French establishment would deal with the European practice -- espoused most forcefully by France -- of subsidies for farmers.
"Agriculture is a tricky one for him," said Paul Brenton of the Center for European Policy Studies. "He may want to move ahead, but he will face the strength of the agricultural lobby and ministries in Europe. He can only move ahead carefully and subtly in this atmosphere."
Mr. Lamy, trim from his passion for marathon running, maintained that he can make progress on agriculture. "I have room for maneuver," he said in the interview. "We believe agriculture has environmental, social, local and landscape impact, which deserve the taxpayer paying for this."
Deep-seated differences between Europe and the United States over the American view -- one backed by other exporting countries, that farm goods should be treated like any other item of trade -- contributed to the failure in Seattle. European and Japanese representatives strongly argue that farmers must be protected in order to preserve rural life.
"He has been less French than expected in agriculture," said Nicholas Clegg, a British member of the European Parliament, who was dubious about Mr. Lamy's selection. "He has said the future of agriculture reform is not taboo. This has been a highly pleasant surprise."
Mr. Lamy departs from some European colleagues on the even more fractious topic of genetically modified food. He thinks such disputes should be decided at the World Trade Organization. "The W.T.O. will have to articulate the rules about this," Mr. Lamy said, acknowledging that his view is unpopular in Europe.
He strongly defended the trade organization, which a broad range of critics have called a secretive group that has little public accountability. The W.T.O. "has been painted as the black box where multinationals do their dirty tricks in getting rid of barriers that protect nice people," Mr. Lamy said. To counter that, "my prescription is going out loudly on the idea that we need more trade liberalization with rules that benefit everybody."
He has proposed that the trade forum release more internal documents, sponsor a yearly public debate and open its deliberations to nongovernmental organizations. "This is all part of the democratic scene-setting at the international level," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Shocking Old Brands Back to Life

BYLINE: By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO 

 BODY:
F. Scott Fitzgerald said "there are no second acts in American lives." But he never heard of the new Volkswagen Beetle or the Apple iMac -- to say nothing of the comebacks of entertainers like Cher and Tony Bennett.
Today, second acts are as popular in the world of consumer marketing as they are in the entertainment business. Just in the last year or so, Maxwell House coffee, American Greetings cards, Volvo cars, the New York Stock Exchange and even the United States Navy have produced new advertising that tries to recast their brand names as hip and contemporary. 
 Whether it is by creating a new image, a new package, a new product benefit -- or a mix of all of the above -- long-established brand names are finding it necessary to update their acts in a bid to keep up with the rapid changes in American society and the economy.
"Every single brand, especially classic brands like Chevrolet and John Deere that are always given credit for trust and high quality, are fighting to become more contemporary and energetic," said David A. Aaker, vice chairman of Prophet Brand Strategy, a San Francisco-based consulting firm. "I'd say 70 percent of brands want to be perceived as younger than they are now perceived."
The buzzword in marketing is relevance. Brands have to be on top of the trends, or face the specter of declining sales. And the trends are changing at Internet speed. Brands now compete in a revved-up global market and face product trends that come from around the world. The competition is even fiercer at the supermarket, where instant sales information dictates how much shelf space brands get. Multiculturalism and changes in family life have also contributed to the need for change.
In such a market, a youthful image is more important than ever.
Take the New York Stock Exchange, the market leader whose previous advertising promoted its strength, stability and venerability. These are all great product attributes, but could be viewed as a tad stuffy. Besides, the Big Board wanted to show its current success in important global industries -- a message that was being overshadowed by rising competition from the National Association of Securities Dealers, the parent of the Nasdaq market, which has become synonymous with cool technology and Internet stocks.
"The reality is more technology companies are here than there, and that's lost on people," said Robert Zito, senior vice president of communications of the N.Y.S.E.
Last year the Big Board brought in Omnicom Group's BBDO New York, which introduced an untraditional television campaign, modeled on consumer product marketing and using sports celebrities, but aimed at corporate decision makers and other opinion leaders, Mr. Zito said.
In one spot, a little boy is propelled into a fast-paced almost breathless journey after he asks his computer, "Where is the center of the tech world?" He ultimately lands on the floor of the exchange where, a voice-over explains, the "most highly successful technology companies" are listed, like America Online and Gateway.
The other commercial features Terry Bradshaw, the former quarterback turned broadcaster, on an engaging quest for the center of the sports world as he interrupts, among others, Mia Hamm on the soccer field and Sammy Sosa at bat. The point? Big-name sports-related companies like Reebok International and Nike are traded on the Big Board.
Jack Trout, a marketing consultant whose book due next month, "Differentiate or Die" (John Wylie & Sons), notes the vast proliferation of product choices. In the 1970's there were 17 over-the-counter pain relievers; today the total has soared to more than 140, he says. Five hosiery brands existed then; today consumers can pick from 90. If you wanted contact lenses then, Bausch & Lomb was your only choice; 36 contact lens companies now vie for your eyes, offering everything from tinted lenses to disposables, he said.
"I think part of it is the global economy, brands are coming from everywhere and the international guys are getting a lot better at it," Mr. Trout said in an interview. "It's an explosion of choice."
It has also become more expensive and difficult to create and market new brands, explained Carol Davies, managing partner of Kane, Bortree & Associates, a New York marketing firm. That encourages companies to reposition existing brands rather than take the extra risk and cost of developing a new one. With scanners and other research, supermarkets are very sophisticated about what sells and are reluctant to give shelf space to new brand names without sales histories.
"The trade has become much more sophisticated," Ms. Davies said. Supermarkets are saying, "We can't afford to carry all your brands," and they have forced companies to reassess, she added.
At the same time, the emerging generation of consumers is much more comfortable with diversity than its parents are. "It's fusion -- what kids are doing with music, with food, with words," said Cathy Clift, a senior vice president at McCann-Erickson, West, a unit of the Interpublic Group. "We are looking at a cross-culturalism, and many more ethnic influences today."
Indeed, the Navy discovered that it had to reposition itself for a new generation after its 1998 recruitment efforts fell short. Research showed the Navy that young people aged 17 to 24 reject glossy messages with paid actors and instead want information and an honest approach, said Steve Lowry, public affairs spokesman for the Navy Recruiting Command. "They can spot a phony a mile away, and that will turn them off faster than anything," Mr. Lowry said.
Plus, the commercial has to move.
The Navy switched its campaign from a high-toned, earnest approach set to classical music. The new commercials, created by BBDO New York, have a documentary style and use real sailors who talk about the service. One spot shows young recruits on a ship alternating between work and jamming in their own hip-hop band. Another shows a young newscaster who landed her job after a Navy stint. In 1999, the Navy did meet its recruitment goal, but factors including changes in eligibility and better pay and pensions also played a role in the gain.
Brands are fighting to be forever young, not just for image sake, but to replenish sales. Kraft Foods' Maxwell House has lots of consumers, but its marketers want to attract younger consumers, aged 25 to 35, to keep the brand thriving in the future.
Faced with Starbucks, Maxwell House has been fighting back for several years by introducing high-end varieties and running new and different advertising. Still, its research showed that despite an enviable status as an American icon, it needed to "prove to younger consumers that Maxwell House is not only timeless, it's timely," said Rick Roth, worldwide client service director for Maxwell House's agency, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, New York, a unit of WPP Group.
As a result, last year the company replaced a line of ads that relied mostly on nostalgia with new advertising set to original music and showing people of all ages getting the most out of ordinary moments. The tagline reflects the theme: "Make every day good to the last drop." Ogilvy also reworked the media schedule, dropping out of daytime television and running more ads during prime time, as well as focusing on youth-oriented magazines. Ogilvy even covered city buses and subways with striking images.
The advertising, said Ann Fudge, executive vice president of Kraft Foods, a unit of Philip Morris Companies, and president of Maxwell House and the Post divisions, is aimed at making Maxwell House more relevant to young consumers by identifying with their state of mind.
"Our research showed while young people remembered us, they had not fully connected with us in a stronger way," Ms. Fudge said. "We need to be really plugged into what's going on and what's important to them."
Like Maxwell House, Volvo, the Swedish carmaker now owned by Ford Motor -- which long produced dependable and safe cars -- is trying to reinvent itself. But while it wants to attract younger buyers, it also realized that it had to change its overall image to appeal to a broader audience, younger and older. With all cars now safer than before, safety alone is no longer an exclusive selling point for Volvo, said Bob Austin, Volvo Cars of North America's director of marketing communications. Other features like style and comfort were necessary to broaden the market.
One commercial for its lower-priced model aimed at young people is a comical spot showing a couple dropping off a 2-year-old after a horrendous baby-sitting experience.
"We're trying to reach that prefamily group to get them in the Volvo family," Mr. Austin said.
American Greetings is also reaching out to younger people, even though most greeting cards are bought by women over 35. The idea is not just to appear youthful, but to introduce consumers to the card line before they reach peak buying years, explained David DeMuth, general manager of the Cleveland office of Doner, the advertising agency that created the irreverent print advertising to reinvent the brand. One image: a biker type in a tutu.
Of course, recasting a long-established brand is not easy. One risk is losing the core customer. Moreover, perceptions are difficult to change. Mr. Trout, the marketing consultant, said that Timex tried to go more upscale a few years ago, but had more success returning to its traditional position as a reliable, relatively low-cost, watchmaker. The General Motors Cadillac division, which is promoting sporty vehicles, has to fight its image as a maker of big, roomy cars, he noted.
"It's extremely difficult to reposition an established brand," Mr. Trout said. "You can try to change things, but sometimes your old identity just haunts you."

From Nemesis To Ally On Schools

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
AN unexpected voice of support from, of all people, Ramon C. Cortines for, of all people, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his call for mayoral control of the New York City school system.
"Give it to him," said Mr. Cortines, now interim head of the school system here. 
 This from the man Mr. Giuliani all but hounded out of office as schools chancellor in 1995, after two years on the job?
Well, yes. Sitting in his sunny (of course) office one afternoon this week, the 67-year-old educator poked holes in the current structure of the New York school system, from the perspective of someone who should definitely know better than most how things can go wrong when everyone is in charge, and therefore no one: six politicians (the mayor and five borough presidents) select the seven-member Board of Education, which picks the chancellor. And school funds flow through the city budget.
Small wonder that New York's school system is in perpetual tumult, with finger-pointing raised to a high art and chancellors coming and going with revolving door frequency. The setup so dilutes leadership of the schools, Mr. Cortines argued, that responsibility is fragmented and the mayor is forced to horse trade to try to get what he wants from the board, with mixed results.
"If the mayor were responsible, he wouldn't be as critical of the schools," Mr. Cortines said. "He would begin to understand some of the problems, the complexities of how kids learn. If he is accountable, if it is his board, his teachers, his contract, his parents, the education of children doesn't become the political football of a community."
To those who say that a mayor would turn the city school system into a fief and the chancellor into a puppet, Mr. Cortines says no way: "Mayors will find out that they cannot dictate policy from City Hall. You can have Jesus Christ as mayor and he could not run the school system. You have to have teachers, parents, administrators. Any mayor will learn that."
Given his unpleasant history with Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Cortines's support for mayoral control is not only surprising, but also gives those who want to revamp the system a persuasive ally. Mr. Cortines said that the schools should be no different from other city agencies, whose success or failure affect the mayor's reputation. Now politicians in New York and elsewhere, he said, can duck responsibility for education. "Give the mayor direct control and there won't be those sound bites," said the former chancellor. "The mayor can't say, 'If only I had control.' "
MR. CORTINES, who expects to work as interim schools superintendent here through the spring, did not address the situation in Los Angeles, where mayors are weaker and have even less say over education than in New York.
He did say that sound bite-itis infects the larger debate about education throughout the country, as elected officials grab for easy answers. Schools failing? Go for vouchers. Students failing? Raise standards and end social promotion. Teachers mediocre? Give merit pay.
It is not that he automatically opposes any of those approaches, he said, just that he would welcome a little more understanding of their complexities. For instance, merit pay -- another Giuliani idea -- is fine in concept, Mr. Cortines allowed, but who sets what criteria? Ending social promotion is a laudable goal, too, in his judgment, but unless schools set up strong tutoring programs and summer sessions to help students catch up -- as officials recently failed to here, he has complained -- proclaiming an end to social promotion will end up a mere publicity stunt.
The issue of vouchers is even more complex, said Mr. Cortines, who suggested that his successor, Rudy Crew, overreacted when Mr. Giuliani embraced the idea of a voucher experiment. Vouchers can be just another tool if educators insist that a certain percentage of them be set aside for economically disadvantaged students.
But with vouchers, as with school governance, the main problem is the same, suggested Mr. Cortines: politics. "The politicians don't get it. They're always looking for a quick fix. For most of them, vouchers is a quick fix. It isn't. It isn't the end-all. But instead of really trying to help education, the politicians give us sound bites.
"A sound bite does not fix anything."
Even his old nemesis at City Hall would figure that out, Mr. Cortines predicted, if he got what he says he wants -- direct control of the largest school system in the country.

HEADLINE: Issue of Elderly Housing Separates Suburban Generations

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO 

DATELINE: HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON, N.Y, Feb. 9

 BODY:
In a span of 35 years, Ruth Dewey has led the Girl Scouts here and presided over both the Board of Education and the Friends of the Library. Now, at 77, she looks forward to living out her final years here and believes she has the perfect place to do it: a proposed continuing-care retirement community, the sort of place that lets you decline gently into old age with a range of supports.
But there's a snag. A group of residents is trying to stop the project and its six new buildings. They warn about dangerous zoning precedents and increased traffic and argue that the project's scale is too big for this tiny riverfront village. 
 "You feel you've put in your two cents of work for the community," Mrs. Dewey said. "There's an assumption that the elderly are somehow different from the community, that we're not part of it. But I'm not somebody whose interests should now be ignored."
The skirmish here is part of a broader battle unfolding in suburban communities, particularly in Westchester County, where the 65-and-over population is expected to grow by 26 percent in the next 20 years. Those projections, coupled with the county's affluence and a recent loosening of state regulations, have put Westchester on the radar screen of developers eager to build the type of upscale housing that lends older people a hand with daily activities.
And so the county's older residents find themselves asking neighbors and elected officials to make room for them at a time when many feel that congestion and development have reached a critical mass. The resulting clash is providing a revealing glimpse of generational and real estate politics in the New York suburbs, often playing out as a conflict between the housing values of young professionals and the housing needs of their parents' generation.
Developers and advocates for the elderly say the kind of supportive housing designed to keep the elderly out of nursing homes has swept the South and West with little opposition. The New York region has posed a tougher challenge, and Westchester County has perhaps put up the most formidable resistance of all. In the last five years, dozens of projects representing about 7,600 units of housing for the elderly have been proposed. Many have been approved and are being built. But many others have become ensnared in high-powered local resistance -- opposition Web sites are whipped up and lawyers retained before a formal application can be presented to a planning board.
"We're heavily into New Jersey and Massachusetts and Connecticut, and New York is our only big void," said Michael J. Giacopelli Jr., senior vice president of development for Marriott Senior Living Services in Bethesda, Md.
The company, with 143 housing developments for the elderly in 29 states, has had five separate proposals for elderly housing fail in Westchester and Long Island over the last two years. "There are a lot of barriers to entry," he said. "Zoning codes don't even recognize the use in many cases."
Private groups and public agencies working with the elderly find the issue a source of rising frustration. "What communities are saying is that when you become too frail to live independently, there's no place for you," said Mae Carpenter, director of the Westchester County Office for the Aging.
But in many ways, the vehemence of the opposition has to do with the special nature of the housing. Developers, whether for-profit companies or nonprofit organizations, want to put the housing for the elderly in or near residential neighborhoods so that occupants feel part of a community.
The projects, however, are not purely residential, and that is the problem. Like hotels, they rise higher than two stories and have dining rooms, laundry facilities and 24-hour staffing.
Opponents are quick to point out that they are not "anti-senior." Indeed, some of the most active foes of such proposals, like 72-year-old Malvin Gersfeld of Ardsley, in Westchester, are themselves retired and have the time to digest environmental impact statements the size of phone books.
"The idea of senior housing is great for those who can afford it," Mr. Gersfeld said. "But we don't want it because it will destroy what little green space we have left."
Mr. Gersfeld is leading the opposition to a proposed senior housing complex on 12 acres in Ardsley. The developer, Hassett Belfer Senior Housing of Great Neck, on Long Island, needs a zoning change for the project, which would offer three levels of care and charge a monthly rent. But the community's protests, plus a preliminary thumbs-down from the planning board, have sent the company back to the drafting table.
"We met with a lot of opposition, and we are resubmitting a new plan with fewer units and addressing the concerns," said Andrew B. Belfer, a partner in the development company.
Supporters of the plan outnumber opponents, Mayor Sam Abate of Ardsley said, but he fears they are growing anxious. "When I campaigned around the community, one of the comments I got from seniors was, 'Will it be built before I die?' " he said.
There are two main kinds of elderly projects under discussion in the county. Continuing-care retirement communities, which allow residents to progress, if necessary, from fully independent living to 24-hour skilled nursing care, were not allowed in the state until 1989. State officials had been concerned that elderly residents would be vulnerable to losing their life savings if developments failed.
The projects require a large initial fee of $200,000 to $600,000, depending on the size of the apartment, in addition to a hefty monthly rent. Typically, 90 percent of the entrance fee is returned to the estate when a resident dies.
Assisted-living developments, on the other hand, charge a large monthly rent with no down payment. The drawback is their lack of 24-hour medical care, and some residents eventually need to move to a nursing home.
In addition to concerns about the effect on neighborhoods, some opponents worry about repercussions for school districts, because elderly voters are commonly assumed to oppose school budgets. Another fear is whether the current rash of proposals could saturate the market for housing for the elderly.
"What are they going to put in there when they can't fill it?" asked Mr. Gersfeld, the Ardsley opponent. "Will it go to the state, which could use it to house people? And will the residents spending $3,000 to $4,000 a month stay there? I don't think so."
Developers counter that in Westchester, there is pent-up demand for the housing. "There's a huge supply of senior citizens in the county, and a lot of them happen to be affluent," said Michael D. Daly, president of Forest City Daly Housing in Manhattan.
Mr. Daly has discovered firsthand what an unwilling suitor Westchester can be. His company recently failed to get the town of Eastchester to rezone to allow a 125-unit project. He is now presenting his wares to Pelham, a village in southeastern Westchester. But resistance to his plan for a mix of what are known as independent and assisted apartments has grown so fierce that opponents controlled the nominating process at the Jan. 31 Democratic caucus, forcing the selection of a slate of Republicans to run under the Democratic banner in the village's March election.
Here in Hastings-on-Hudson, where there is a proposal to create a continuing-care retirement community called Andrus on Hudson on the grounds of an existing retirement home, the zoning implications of the plan have taken a complicated turn.
To avoid being accused of seeking a preferential zoning change specifically for its property, Beth Abraham Health Services, a nonprofit health-care network in the Bronx and a sponsor of the project, has asked the village to create a "floating zone" for senior housing that could, in theory, apply to three other parcels in the village.
That tactic has created a small furor, as village residents envision a glut of complexes. "People think we don't want any senior housing, and that is absolutely not the case," said Leslie Chervokas, 41, a chairwoman of the Hastings Community Coalition, an opposition group. "What we don't want are four of these very large facilities, because the residential character of the community can't sustain them."
Like other senior housing plans, Andrus on Hudson is geared toward elderly residents with deep pockets. The entrance fees would run from $209,000 to $665,000; monthly rents are expected to range from $1,995 to $4,550.
Those projects are affordable only to elderly people with household incomes of at least $50,000 a year. That includes fewer than 25 percent of the county's residents 65 and older.
But soaring real estate prices have allowed many older residents who never considered themselves wealthy to sell their homes at prices that make even projects like Andrus on Hudson affordable.
Ruth and Donald Dewey paid $30,000 for a house in 1965 that they recently sold for $400,000. "When we came here we never thought we could afford something like this," Mrs. Dewey said, referring to Andrus on Hudson, where she and her husband have already secured a future home with a $1,000 deposit.
She and her husband, a retired Columbia University economics professor, are excited about plans for an outdoor pool surrounded by gardens and the smart apartments with magnificent river views. But the main reason they want to live in a place like Andrus on Hudson, they say, is to avoid feeling like a nuisance.
"I cared for my mother and my mother-in-law, and I thought how nice it would be to decline without all these crises, without having to involve one's own children in crises," Mrs. Dewey said. "If I fall and break my hip, my daughter doesn't have to come from California and say, 'What on earth am I going to do with my mother?' "

HEADLINE: U.S. Supports Tightening Of Sanctions on Belgrade

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
In an effort to tighten pressure on the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, the Clinton administration said today that it supported a plan to expand some sanctions against Belgrade while allowing some commercial airline flights to resume.
The most effective sanction so far, according to many officials, has been the little-publicized tool of refusing travel visas to Mr. Milosevic's political and financial supporters. 
 Under the plan of tougher sanctions announced by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, the number of associates of Mr. Milosevic officially barred from traveling to the United States and the nations of the European Union would be increased from the current 600, perhaps as much as 25 percent.
The administration also backed a plan, to be presented to the European Union's general affairs council in Brussels on Monday, to strengthen enforcement of a ban on banking transfers from Yugoslavia to European capitals, Dr. Albright said.
The secretary of state made the announcement at a joint appearance here with the British foreign secretary, Robin Cook.
In response to requests from the struggling opposition parties in Serbia, the ban on flights by airlines of European Union countries would be suspended for six months. If free and fair elections were not held in Yugoslavia within six months from the lifting of the ban, the concession on the airline flights would be "automatically" withdrawn, State Department officials said.
How to undermine Mr. Milosevic, who has been indicted by the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague, while unifying the the squabbling factions of the opposition, has been a subject of considerable debate within the State Department.
Dr. Albright has let it be known in recent weeks that one of her most fervent hopes for the remainder of her term is to see the end of Mr. Milosevic's power.
A recent round of political killings in Belgrade has encouraged some administration officials to speculate that Mr. Milosevic's regime may implode. The Yugoslav defense minister, Pavle Bulatovic, was shot and killed on Monday as he was eating dinner in a Belgrade soccer club. Last month, the Serbian paramilitary leader and close associate of Mr. Milosevic, Zeljko Raznatovic, was shot dead eating dinner at the Intercontinental Hotel in Belgrade.
The cause of these killings and whether they were masterminded by Mr. Milosevic is still unclear. But what does seem clear is that the dominant black-market economy in Serbia and fights over who controls it are resulting in the increased tensions within ruling circles.
In that respect, officials said, the visa ban on close associates of Mr. Milosevic -- many of them accustomed to high living in European capitals and on checking up on their foreign investments -- has been most effective. Some of these associates appear to be complaining that Mr. Milosevic's rule is hurting rather than benefiting them.
By tightening the screws with the tougher travel ban, the administration hopes that further cracks will emerge in the Belgrade government.
For several months, the administration had rejected proposals by European countries to lift the ban on civilian airline flights to Belgrade. Such an easing would open the door to lifting other sanctions, administration officials argued.
But Dr. Albright said today that the airline flights would be permitted because they had been requested by the opposition parties. The secretary has met twice in recent months with leaders of the Serbian opposition, and her aides are in daily contact with them.
"Today we are making very clear that the sanctions are going to be targeted, expanded and tightened against those from the regime that are not allowing the people of Serbia to express their will," Dr. Albright said.
The European Union and the United States have comparable regulations banning bank transfers from Belgrade, but enforcement has been lax in Europe, the State Department said. The European Union had pledged to increase its staffing to monitor and stop such transactions, officials said.
But how effective these banking sanctions would be remained an open question. "It's like squeezing Jello," one official said.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: EDUCATION;
Bradley Urges $80 Billion Plan to Improve Quality of Schools

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: UNIVERSITY CITY, Mo., Feb. 9

 BODY:
Declaring that the quality of education in America unfairly depended on the wealth of the district, former Senator Bill Bradley today unveiled an $80 billion education proposal that he said would improve the quality of teachers, hold schools accountable for student performance and give parents the safety valve of taking their children out of inferior public schools for better ones.
"I'm here today to say that we have separate and unequal when it comes to the quality of education in America," Mr. Bradley said at a school just 35 miles from where he grew up and attended public schools. "Education may be the great equalizer, but when schools are unequal -- when poor children get an inferior education to wealthy children, when minorities get a worse education than nonminorities -- we are often preparing them for a life of failure." 
 The former senator from New Jersey also criticized his opponent for the Democratic presidential nomination, Vice President Al Gore, for being part of an administration that Mr. Bradley said had increased the number of teachers without insuring that they were highly qualified.
Speaking before about 1,000 people at the University City High School gymnasium in this St. Louis suburb, Mr. Bradley proposed doubling the financing to $16 billion a year for Title I, the federal aid program for schools in poor communities. He said he would require teachers to pass a test in the subjects they teach or to have majored in that area. And he said he would triple federal money for charter schools, to $500 million.
Mr. Bradley has not focused on education with the fervor he has lavished on issues like health care, gun control and race relations.
Mr. Gore, speaking today at an early childhood center in Southfield, Mich., talked about his education proposals and faulted Mr. Bradley for not speaking out sooner about education. "There are sharp differences between his approach to education and mine," said Mr. Gore, who has outlined plans for universal pre-care, testing teachers, providing grants to train teachers and improving failing schools.
"Fourteen months have passed in this presidential campaign and three states have had elections," the vice president said, "and only today has Senator Bradley made his first speech" about education.
Mr. Bradley struck back at Mr. Gore in a news conference after his speech today.
"Once again, he's saying something that is not true," Mr. Bradley said. "It's defying reality to say that I haven't talked about education."
Instead, Mr. Bradley said, he had waited until now, as a crucial series of primaries on March 7 and 14 approaches, to tie elements of his education proposals together into one big package so that his ideas would be fresh on voters' minds.
"This is when the country is actually paying attention to what someone who's running for president would do," he said. "And I think it is an important part of reaching out to Democratic constituents and America to defining what this candidacy all about."
Indeed, Mr. Bradley promised that he would probably present more policy proposals about major issues of concern to Democratic voters.
He emphasized the need to improve race relations in speeches at a black church in Queens on Sunday, a town hall meeting in Tampa, Fla., on Monday and a predominantly black college in Columbia, S.C., on Tuesday. Along the way he criticized Mr. Gore; Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, a Republican, and the two leading Republican presidential candidates, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Senator John McCain of Arizona.
On Thursday, Mr. Bradley plans to talk to Los Angeles voters about gun violence. And on Friday, he will talk in Seattle about women's issues.
Today, as the backdrop for his speech on education, Mr. Bradley chose a racially and economically diverse school district that counts Tennessee Williams as its most famous son. The student body, however, is more than 80 percent black.
Mr. Bradley said the keystone to education was the quality of the nation's teachers, not class size or per-pupil spending, offering a different emphasis from that of the Clinton-Gore administration.
By requiring teachers to pass state-administered tests or to major in the subjects they teach, Mr. Bradley said, he would complement an earlier plan that would add 600,000 teachers over the next decade and offer to forgive student loans for college graduates who teach.
"Yes, I'll give schools that money, but I'll tell you, there are strings attached," he said. "I will hold those schools that receive federal money accountable for their results. And I expect them to show results."
 
In His Own Words
 
BILL BRADLEY
 
Remarks yesterday in a speech on education that he delivered in University City, Mo.:
 
"Fifty years, the Supreme Court ruled that separate but equal was unconstitutional when it came to race and education in America. I'm here today to say that we have separate and unequal when it comes to the quality of education in America.
 
A good education in America today is an American birthright. While millions of children are getting such an education, there are far too many children who are trapped in failing schools. Education may be the great equalizer, but when schools are unequal -- when poor children get an inferior education to wealthy children, when minorities get a worse education than nonminorities -- we are often preparing them for a life of failure. To me, that is unacceptable.
 
I believe there is nothing more important to education than a qualified teacher. Research shows that one of the strongest predictors of how students perform on national tests is not class size or per pupil spending, but the presence of a qualified teacher, a teacher who is fully certified and majored in the subject he or she taught. That is why I will require that schools that receive federal money will have to ensure that their teachers are fully qualified. 'Warm bodies' are just not good enough for our children, millions of who sit down every day in classrooms before teachers who do not meet the minimum requirements for teaching in a public school."

HEADLINE: Sid Abel, 81, a Hockey Star On a Famed Red Wings Line

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE 

 BODY:
Sid Abel, the Hockey Hall of Famer who starred with the Detroit Red Wings and was later a coach, general manager and broadcaster in the National Hockey League, died Tuesday at a hospital in Farmington Hills, Mich. He was 81.
Abel won the Hart Trophy as the league's most valuable player in 1949 and for several seasons he centered Detroit's Production Line, with Gordie Howe on right wing and Ted Lindsay on left wing. 
 Inducted as a player into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1969, Abel knew the hockey business from many perspectives. As a player, he married the secretary to the Red Wings' general manager and later he was considered a "players' coach" who was sensitive to their moods and needs.
Although Abel's career lasted long into the modern era of expansion, his roots were in the old six-team league, when players traveled by train, salaries were low and grudges were well nursed.
"We played hockey for money, but we would play the Toronto Maple Leafs for nothing," he once said.
The Red Wings won the Stanley Cup three times when Abel played for them, with their most memorable championship coming in 1950, when they beat the Rangers.
In the first series of the two-round tournament, Detroit lost Howe when a collision with a Toronto player left him in the hospital with a life-threatening brain injury. In the final game of the finals, Abel, the captain, scored a goal in a game at Olympia Stadium that went into overtime tied at 3-3. The Red Wings won on a goal by Pete Babando.
Many hockey books include pictures of a weary, sweat-soaked Abel kissing the silver trophy that night.
Abel's Production Line got its name because it produced goals and because his team played in the Motor City, where the economy was based on cars produced on assembly lines.
Howe was known as Mr. Hockey, Lindsay was Terrible Ted and Abel was called Boot Nose because of an altercation with Montreal's Maurice (the Rocket) Richard. After Howe flattened Richard in a fight, Abel skated by and asked him, "How do you like that?" and added a reference to Richard's French-Canadian ethnicity. Richard responded by re-arranging Abel's nose with a punch.
Howe, reflecting on the fight, said: "Today, if you called someone what Sid called Rocket, you'd get called up before a judge."
"There was never any question about his leadership," Howe said. "Sid was very much respected."
In a playing career that spanned 12 seasons with the Red Wings and 2 with the Blackhawks, Abel scored 189 goals and had 283 assists during the regular season.
Sidney Gerald Abel was born on Feb. 22, 1918, in Melville, Saskatchewan, played as a junior for the Saskatoon Wesleys and the Flin Flon Bombers before turning professional with Detroit in the 1938-39 season. His career was interrupted for almost three seasons during World War II, when he served in the Royal Canadian Air Force.
He left Detroit in 1952 to play and coach for the Chicago Blackhawks. He returned to the Red Wings in 1957 as a coach, and added general manager's duties in 1962, but left the organization in 1971 and worked with teams in St. Louis and Kansas City.
Abel returned to Detroit as a broadcaster in 1976 and became popular for his insights and speech patterns. Speaking in a Western Canadian accent and verb forms, Abel would tell his Motor City listeners "Montreal are a skating club" or "Detroit are pressing on the power play."
Abel was blunt on the air and sometimes angered management with his tart observations. But fans admired his honesty even while mimicking his voice. For several seasons, when the Red Wings struggled in the early 1980's, Abel the broadcaster was more popular than any player.
His No. 12 was retired in 1995, hung between Howe's 9 and Lindsay's 7.
Before Tuesday night's Red Wings game at Joe Louis Arena, hours after his death, the fans stood for a moment of silence in memory of Abel, and the banner that bears his number was briefly lowered.
Abel is survived by his wife, Gloria; a son, Gerald; a daughter, Linda Johnson; a brother, Don; five grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Rowland Offers Tax Cuts and Tighter Investment Rules

BYLINE: By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Gov. John G. Rowland laid out a proposed $12.27 billion budget today for 2001 that includes substantial tax cuts and credits for Connecticut consumers, families and corporations, and fundamental changes to the state treasurer's office and county sheriffs' systems.
In his annual speech to the General Assembly, Mr. Rowland, a Republican, repeatedly praised Connecticut's continuing prosperity, saying, "it is hard to remember a more prosperous moment in the history of this state." But his budget message was founded on the expectation of a cooling state economy and projected declines in sales and income tax revenue in the next fiscal year. 
 So while Mr. Rowland's new budget proposal is 4.3 percent larger than last year's adopted budget and includes $237 million in tax cuts for education, gasoline and business, it is also $84 million below the state's constitutionally mandated limit on year-to-year spending increases.
"With Connecticut's growing economy, with the state budget producing another surplus for the sixth year in a row, it would be all too easy to go on a spending spree," Governor Rowland said in his 36-minute speech this afternoon. "Connecticut has pledged never to let that happen again," he added, referring to the law capping how much state budgets can increase year to year. "It falls on us to keep that promise."
Among the most debated tax cuts the governor proposed today was a 7-cent reduction, beginning April 1, in the state's 32-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax, the nation's highest. The governor said the reduction, to 25 cents, would save drivers $99 million a year. But state Democrats, who control both houses of the legislature, questioned whether such a move would end up helping gasoline wholesalers without reducing pump prices.
Other tax reductions Mr. Rowland proposed include the elimination of Connecticut's 4.5 percent gross receipts tax on hospitals, totaling $75 million annually, and a four-year phase-out of the state's inheritance tax, valued at $52 million.
Mr. Rowland also proposed eliminating the state's county-based sheriff's system, which has come under great criticism in recent years as a corrupt patronage mill. In its place, the governor would have corrections and court officers perform most of the duties deputy sheriffs have now, like serving legal papers and transporting prisoners.
And, like his Republican colleagues in the legislature, the governor called for the creation of a board of advisers to supervise how the state treasurer, currently a Democrat, invests the state's $21 billion pension fund.
That move is just one more indication that Mr. Rowland, for now, has successfully navigated his way through a corruption scandal that threatened his administration last year.
Last September, Paul J. Silvester, whom Mr. Rowland appointed treasurer in July 1997, pleaded guilty to money laundering and racketeering charges stemming from financial schemes he ran from his office. The scandal touched the governor, who has since called Mr. Silvester's appointment the worst mistake of his six-year term. Mr. Silvester is expected to be sentenced in March, and the investigation into his conduct continues.
"I think we've seen that in a positive economy, no scandal stays in the public mind very long," said David B. Pudlin, a Democrat and the majority leader of the state House of Representatives. In fact, Mr. Pudlin, who will offer a detailed bill next week to limit campaign spending and help finance campaigns with public money, said he was encouraged by Mr. Rowland's professed flexibility to consider "everything" to do with campaign finance reform this year.
Over all, Mr. Rowland's budget provides what was expected from a Republican governor of a prosperous state. It focused not on ambitious new spending proposals but instead on tax cuts and credits, including a plan to finance private school tuition with $17 million in tax credits.
After the address, Republicans and business leaders offered praise, particularly for the governor's plan to use much of this year's estimated $241 million surplus to pay down the state's $11.8 billion outstanding debt.
Kenneth Decko, the president of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, said he was particularly pleased with proposed corporate-tax reductions totaling $21 million that would help Connecticut companies that sell their products outside the state. "We need to do this to keep our businesses healthy," Mr. Decko said.
Democratic legislators, conversely, signaled that they considered this budget proposal, while perhaps more detailed than they had expected, to be only the opening salvo in the legislature's 12-week session this year.
"A number of things that were proposed are really going to have to be changed if they're going to be passed," Mr. Pudlin said.
Mr. Sullivan criticized Mr. Rowland's vow, made during his speech, to spend the surplus, cut taxes and still stay under the spending cap next year.
"Our first look at it suggests you just can't move those kinds of numbers around and stay under the cap," Mr. Sullivan said after the governor's speech. Of Mr. Rowland's pledge to sign no budget over the cap, Mr. Sullivan added, "He's already signed two that bust the cap and he's proposed another that busts the cap."
The budget proposed today, while it offered relatively smaller increases in welfare-to-work programs to aid the poor, left some groups feeling excluded.
Daria M. Plummer, the president of the Connecticut Education Association, which represents 33,000 public-school teachers around the state, said she was dismayed at a private-school tax incentive that she called tantamount to a voucher system. "The children in the least wealthy homes don't even have a shot to earn these tax credits," she said.

Home heating prices in the Northeast, the region that relies primarily on oil to heat homes, have doubled over the past year. Indeed the residents of the Northeast have suffered a double blow. First OPEC, the consortium of oil-exporting countries, conspired last spring to cut production by millions of barrels a day. As a result, crude oil prices nearly tripled by December and gasoline prices rose by over 30 percent during the past year. Then a cold wave struck last month, drawing down inventories of home heating oil and sending its price soaring. Residents are demanding relief from Congress, but it is already too late to push down heating bills before spring.
Last September Senator Charles Schumer of New York, anticipating the impact of the OPEC cutbacks, called on the administration to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, almost 600 million barrels of oil stored in salt domes in Texas and Louisiana. The administration has balked at using the reserve because it is designed to soften the blow of another oil embargo or similar energy crisis, not to control market prices. Using it to offset temporary price increases can discourage conservation and run down reserves that will be needed in any future crisis. Legislation sponsored by Mr. Schumer to tap the reserve has gone nowhere. 
 In any case, the reserve cannot provide immediate relief because it takes at least several weeks to get oil out of the salt domes and into people's homes. If the reserve were tapped starting now, the oil would not arrive in the Northeast until the crocuses start to bloom, heating needs fall and home heating prices drop on their own.
Yet there is still good reason to open up the reserve today, though not in the way Mr. Schumer originally proposed. OPEC cutbacks have driven worldwide inventories down to dangerously low levels. That could send gasoline prices rising this summer. Worse, by next winter a combination of low inventories and cold weather could send crude oil prices to $40 a barrel, about twice the normal price of crude over the past several years.
The way to handle this problem is to open the reserve for "swaps" rather than sales for cash. The administration is reviewing the idea and is expected to make a decision soon. Under a system of swaps, a company would take oil out of the reserve and sell it at current prices. The extra oil on the market would help drive prices down. Later the company would return a somewhat larger amount of oil to the reserve. The incentive for the companies is that they would earn a profit from selling the reserve oil at today's high prices and replacing it later with cheaper oil bought when prices almost certainly will have fallen. Swaps could not only knock the edge off oil prices but, unlike outright sales, fill the reserve above its current level. Philip Verleger, an energy economist, estimates that swaps could reduce crude oil prices by $3 or $4 a barrel, a fall of more than 10 percent.
A virtue of swaps is that they could be made a permanent feature of the reserve. The administration would let companies withdraw oil at any time as long as they return it and additional oil at a predetermined date in the future. That would eliminate the need for jockeying that comes every time politicians are asked to open up the reserve for this or that episode of high oil prices. Had swaps been permanently in place when Mr. Schumer, who supports their use, first called on the administration to act, Northeastern homeowners would already be reaping the benefit. If a system of swaps is put in place today, they will be there in time for this summer's possible run on gasoline stocks or a run on heating oil over the winter.
Oil has already entered campaign debates. Bill Bradley has embraced the idea of swaps, and George W. Bush has called for the administration to pressure Saudi Arabia to ramp up OPEC production levels. Both ideas make sense. Pressuring Saudi Arabia is a way to get OPEC's production rates higher. Though the tactic has often failed in the past, the Saudis may be more receptive this time. By driving oil inventories to near zero, Saudi Arabia has inadvertently put Iraq, which could produce much more oil than it now does, into a powerful position. Next winter Iraq could well demand that the United Nations lift sanctions on its oil exports in return for added production. The Saudis might want to reconsider decisions they have made that have put their archenemy in control.

HEADLINE: In Welfare-to-Work Dispute, Giuliani Seeks to Limit Hevesi's Power

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
Escalating the feud over $500 million in welfare-to-work contracts, the Giuliani administration is pushing to severely restrict the city comptroller's power to review and approve municipal contracts, which now total $7 billion a year.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has asked his three appointees to the city's five-member contract policy board to rescind city policies that require Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi to be given detailed documents and enough time to determine if bidders have been treated equitably. Mr. Hevesi appoints the two other board members. 
 Mr. Giuliani's maneuver occurred after the comptroller rejected three contracts that the city had awarded to organizations hired to help people on welfare find work. Mr. Hevesi found that the mayor improperly applied a provision that allows an administration to limit competition on certain contracts.
The mayor said yesterday that his effort to change the policies was unrelated to the welfare dispute and that he was merely reasserting his long-held belief that Mr. Hevesi routinely oversteps his authority. Mr. Hevesi and City Council leaders vowed to block the mayor's initiative, which they said threatened to disrupt the delicate balance of power in New York City government.
"Last week I said even the mayor is not above the law," Mr. Hevesi said. "Now the mayor has attempted to change the law and destroy this checks-and-balances system. And that is wrong, and we are going to fight him on it."
The Giuliani administration's proposal was scheduled to be voted on by the contract policy board this morning, but the mayor announced yesterday afternoon that it had been taken off the agenda. The mayor, however, said he would continue to push the matter.
The jockeying came as new questions were being raised about one of the Giuliani administration's recently awarded contracts. The City Department of Employment has hired a job-training company run by two former executives of Blake Business School, a trade school in the city that closed in 1997 after investigators determined it had misled students and defrauded the state.
New York Works Training Center, the company run by the former Blake executives, started training unemployed city residents last July, even though the state five months earlier denied New York Works' application for a private school license, citing misleading statements in its application forms and improper business practices at the 1-year-old company. The company, on West 29th Street, maintains that it has obtained the proper state license for training security guards.
City Council members and Mr. Hevesi, whose office still has not approved the $174,000 New York Works contract, said the episode illustrated the need for a thorough and independent review of city contracts.
Late yesterday, Deputy Mayor Joseph J. Lhota said the city could not dispute the questions raised about New York Works.
In the last six years, Mr. Hevesi noted, he has objected on grounds ranging from fraud to tax delinquency to 347 contracts worth a total of $1 billion submitted by the mayor. In $220 million worth of those deals, the contracts were never submitted again, Mr. Hevesi said.
"If you have complete control over who gets contracts," said Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, chairwoman of the Council's Contracts Committee, "you can use that to prop up your own office, meaning everything from kickbacks to campaign contributions to getting your unemployed brother-in-law a job. I am not saying this mayor is doing that. But that is why you have these checks."
Currently, the 30-day period required by the City Charter for the comptroller's review begins only after the contract and the documentation justifying its award have been submitted. Under the new policy, the clock would start as soon as the contract is submitted, meaning that the city could withhold details explaining why one bidder was picked over another until the end of the 30-day period, Mr. Hevesi said.
Another policy change would remove a requirement that city agencies respond quickly to the comptroller's questions. Two other revisions would eliminate a requirement for a written recommendation that would explain to the comptroller why a city agency selected a particular bidder for a new contract or a contract renewal.
On Feb. 3, the day after Mr. Hevesi rejected the three welfare-to-work contracts on the ground that they were not properly bid, the Giuliani administration proposed that the five-member Procurement Policy Board begin the process of making these revisions.
"The mayor is furthering the welfare-to-work scandal rather than taking steps to stop it," said Councilman Stephen DiBrienza, who has been highly critical of the contracts. "To change these rules is outrageous. This is not a dictatorship. It is a democracy."
The Giuliani administration officials emphasized yesterday that it had previously proposed scaling back the comptroller's contract review, which they said at times unnecessarily delayed mayoral initiatives.
The proposed changes had been on the Procurement Policy Board's agenda for today. But after Mr. Hevesi held a news conference denouncing the changes, Mr. Giuliani announced yesterday afternoon that although he was still advocating the revisions, they would not be considered by the board today. Instead, the Procurement Policy Board today will address the welfare contract dispute, he said. "If the welfare contracts are approved, we still are going to press forward with a redefinition of the power of the mayor and the comptroller," Mr. Giuliani said. "If the welfare contracts somehow don't go through, we still are going to press forward."
While Mr. Hevesi and Mr. Giuliani disagreed yesterday over when and why the mayor had decided to temporarily put off his push for the contract review policy changes, aides for the two agreed that something appeared awry with the job-training bid submitted by New York Works Training Center.
The company, which listed Carlos Alvarado as its executive director and owner in its application to the city, offered to train adults 55 years old and older on how to become security guards and other types of safety officers, at a cost of up to $2,200 for each person trained and placed in a job. But the documentation submitted by New York Works cited as a reference a security company that the New York Department of State said it had no licensing records for. And the contract application did not disclose the link between New York Works and Blake Business School.
Herbert Marion, who is listed in state documents as the former owner and administrator of Blake Business School, acknowledged yesterday in an interview that he financed the start-up of New York Works and worked at Blake. He said, however, that he owned neither Blake nor New York Works. Mr. Alvarado also did not disclose in city documents that he is a former director of admissions at Blake Business School.
The school, which had branches at Union Square and Cooper Square, closed after state investigators concluded it had inappropriately received more than $1.5 million in tuition assistance and had used "false, misleading, deceptive and fraudulent bait-and-switch advertising as a means to procure, solicit and enroll students," according to a 1996 New York State Education Department complaint.
More recently, the state rejected a request by Mr. Alvarado and Mr. Marion for a private school license for New York Works, on the ground that the company had tried to hide Mr. Marion's connection with it, according to state documents. New York Works was selected as one of the winning bidders by the city for the job training contract last year, and Mr. Marion said yesterday that it had provided training to about 55 city-referred clients. But given that the contract has not yet been approved by the comptroller's office, the company has not been paid.
Mr. Alvarado and Mr. Marion yesterday rejected any suggestion of wrongdoing, saying only that they were legitimately operating a security guard training company. But Mr. Lhota, the deputy mayor, said that if the comptroller's findings regarding New York Works are accurate, the company will never be paid.
"I concur," Mr. Lhota said yesterday of the comptroller's findings, which came after a detailed review of the city's selection of the winning job-training contractors. "As far as I am concerned, we have no contract with New York Works and we will never do business with them."

HEADLINE: The Strength of theInternet Proves to Be Its Weakness

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 9

 BODY:
The Internet's greatest strength has proved to be its most disturbing weakness.
As attackers let loose a barrage of data that overwhelmed some major commercial Internet sites for a third day, the global network's administrators scrambled today to find a way to protect it and trace the culprits. 
 But the network's designers acknowledged that the attacks exploited the same attributes of the Internet that have made it one of the world's most effective engines for commercial and technical innovation over the last five years.
"This is a fundamental consequence of an open system," said Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor who has written on the Internet's social and legal aspects.
Unlike recent episodes in which Web sites were defaced or credit card records were taken from an online music retailer, this week's attacks have not involved stolen or altered data. But in a world of growing dependence on the Internet, even being denied access to an Internet web site like E*Trade can have an economic impact.
Indeed, longtime Internet executives muse about potential technical disasters in an increasingly interconnected world. What has been seen so far is not the Net's Armageddon, they say, but only an alert.
"There are nightmare scenarios that are real, but that's not where we are," said David Clark, an M.I.T. professor who was one of the Internet's original designers.
Even so, finding ways to contain anti-social acts in such a system -- one that by its very design permits anonymous behavior -- without compromising its openness is proving increasingly thorny for network designers, law enforcement officials and civil libertarians.
"We have run into a situation where the attackers are coordinated and organized but the people who have to respond -- both companies, Internet service providers, and most particularly law enforcement agencies -- are fragmented," said Mark Rasch, a former federal prosecutor who is now a vice president at Global Integrity, a computer security consulting firm based in Reston, Va.
This week's attacks have exploited a set of software programs developed over the last year, computer security experts said today. Known variously as Tribe Flood Network, Trin00 and Stacheldraht (German for "barbed wire"), the programs first identify individual computers on the Internet with specific security flaws, then use those computers as launching pads for an orchestrated attack.
Like the sorcerer's apprentice, the programs let a small group or even an individual pour buckets of data at one or many targets, inundating a Web site's computers with data.
Moreover, it is not easy to identify the person carrying the bucket. In some cases, the malicious programs systematically falsify the network addresses from which the data is sent.
But while the consequences of these programs are harmful, it is just this kind of novel intervention that the Internet was designed to make possible.
In the early 1980's, Mr. Clark and two other M.I.T. computer network researchers, Jerry Salzer and David P. Reed, first described one of the Internet's most powerful aspects: it was a simple network -- or even a "stupid" one, as it was later described by David Isenberg, then an A.T.& T. Bell Labs researcher -- in contrast to the more centralized, or "intelligent," and tightly controlled telephone network.
The very simplicity of the Internet, they wrote, made it a platform for innovation in ways that a more centralized and tightly controlled network could never become.
In the last decade the Internet has served as a virtual petri dish for new ideas -- from low-cost communications systems that have redefined telephone, radio and television, to business methods that have remade industries like stock trading, auctions and bookselling.
But that same power for innovation can be redirected upon the data network in a way that makes it remarkably resilient but extremely vulnerable.
"If an owner of a specific network wants to add some kind of cool feature it doesn't matter in an internetworked world," said Mr. Isenberg. Because there is no central point of control, as on other networks, "you have the control way out on the edges, and anyone can do anything," he added.
Other Internet pioneers are concerned that incidents like this week's attacks may lead to increasing calls for government and law enforcement intervention into the structure of the Internet.
Last July, for example, the Clinton administration began circulating a plan for an extensive software system monitoring government computers, and possibly those of private industry, to protect data networks from intruders.
The network, known as the Federal Intrusion Detection Network, or Fidnet, alarmed civil libertarians who said it could be used to curtail privacy in the Internet age.
"The real danger of any terrorism is not so much in the act itself as the overreaction," said Robert Frankston, a computer researcher who is the co-inventor of the spreadsheet. "The Internet has enabled rapid economic growth because it has made it difficult to prevent disruptive innovation."
And he suggested that the Internet becomes more secure as it experiences attacks and its administrators reconfigure it to repel invaders -- "just as our immune system is strengthened by exposure to disease."
In any case, some longtime law enforcement officials said that there was no simple centralized solution to these kinds of attack.
"The problem is that if you're smart about this there is no trail for law enforcement to follow," said Scott Charney, who until recently was the Justice Department's top computer crime official and who is now a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers. "There are obvious privacy implications. The real question is how strong a response do you want."
The best response, several computer security experts said, would be to strengthen the security of individual computers on the Internet. That would make it more difficult for the automated programs that now take over many systems to find systems to exploit.

Chart: "How the Sites Were Besieged"
The attacks that overwhelmed several big Internet sites in the last few days used a method called distributed denial of service.
 
THE ATTACKER
The attacker uses a computer to find other computers on the Internet that are not protected from attack.
 
THE NETWORK
The attacker gets access to those computers. They in turn are used to carry out the attack or to control a second group of computers that attack.
 
THE ASSAULT
A Web site can be brought to a standstill in two ways. The attacker may send data to the site and ask for confirmation. Because the attacker is using many computers, the requests can overload the system. Or, data may be sent that the site's computers cannot understand, causing them to crash.

HEADLINE: In Britain's Health Service, Sick Itself, Cancer Care Is Dismal

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: MIDDLESBOROUGH, England

 BODY:
Jackie O'Donnell's oncologist couldn't have been more clear about her prospects.
Suffering from advanced ovarian cancer, with five inoperable tumors after surgery, Mrs. O'Donnell urgently needed aggressive chemotherapy. But, the doctor explained, her local health authority would not pay for the treatment he was recommending, a drug that can prolong life for a year or more and is routinely used in the United States, Europe and some parts of Britain. If Mrs. O'Donnell wanted it, it would not be free, as most treatments are in the government-financed National Health Service, but would cost her $16,000. 
 "I just didn't believe it, because in this country we were brought up to believe that we would get the best treatment available," said Mrs. O'Donnell, now 55. She chose her life over her budget, put the bills in a drawer when she could not pay them, and has been in remission since last spring. "It's hard, when it stares you in the face that what you thought was really all nonsense."
In a country where cancer care horror stories are as common as the winter flu, Mrs. O'Donnell's is striking only because it is so familiar. Doctors, health-care advocates and even the government say that Britain's record on cancer, the country's second biggest killer after cardiovascular disease, is nothing short of disgraceful, a stark example of the limitations of Britain's fraying system of socialized medicine.
Problems in the health service, advocates and doctors say, are so pervasive that literally billions of dollars directed specifically at cancer are needed. But cancer is not the only disease making demands on a system struggling to cope with rising patient expectations and increasingly stretched resources.
Health care has already become one of the major political headaches confronting Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is debating whether to increase the government's health spending and, if so, by how much.
In cancer, the problems include a chronic lack of money, specialists and cancer treatment centers; a lack of national standards that means that treatment is available in some parts of the country but not others; and a tendency at times to postpone aggressive treatment until it becomes too late.
Cancer programs are so underfinanced and chaotically managed, the World Health Organization says, that 25,000 people die unnecessarily of cancer in Britain each year -- people who would most likely have survived if they lived in countries with better standards of treatment, like France, Germany or the United States.
"The phrase 'third world cancer care' has hung heavy over the National Health Service for years," Gordon McVie, director general of the Cancer Research Campaign, one of Britain's largest cancer charities, wrote recently in The Daily Mail. "Today it is no longer a sound bite; it describes a reality."
The problems in the overstretched National Health Service are not limited to cancer. It is hard to pick up a newspaper these days without seeing signs of a system in trouble. A critically ill patient is shunted from place to place in a desperate 100-mile search for an intensive-care bed, and finally dies in the ambulance. A new study shows that 500 patients die a year while on the national waiting list for heart operations.
In a particularly grim instance, a 73-year-old woman with advanced esophageal cancer has the misfortune of being scheduled for surgery in mid-December, when operations are routinely canceled to make way for emergency patients suffering from pneumonia and the like.
The operation on the woman, Mavis Skeet, was scheduled, and canceled, four times over the next five weeks: first because the anesthesiologist had the flu, and the next three times because no intensive care beds were available. After the fourth cancellation, an ultrasound scan showed that the tumor had spread and was now inoperable.
Mrs. Skeet is now in a hospital, being fed through a stomach tube and receiving chemotherapy, waiting for the inevitable, her daughter, Jane, said in an interview. "They haven't given us a timetable, but it's spread so quickly in five weeks that anybody can work it out," she said.
Experts say that in a system with some successes -- the infant mortality rates in Britain are lower than those in the United States, for instance -- there are few areas where the situation is so demonstrably bad as it is in cancer. "The health service has been chronically underfunded in the last 10 or 15 years and is desperately short of money, and I'm not aware of where things are any worse than in cancer," said Dr. Tim Maughan, a clinical oncologist specializing in gastrointestinal cancer and lymphoma at Velindre Hospital in Cardiff, Wales.
According to the most recent studies, a British man with lung cancer has a 6 percent chance of surviving for five years after treatment, compared with a 12 percent chance in France and a 13 percent chance in the United States. For colon cancer in men, the five-year survival rates are 41 percent in Britain, 59 percent in the Netherlands, and 64 percent in the United States.
And for breast cancer in women, the figures are 67 percent in Britain, 72 percent in Germany, and 84 percent in the United States.
Even the relentlessly optimistic government of Mr. Blair has begun, however reluctantly, to acknowledge that its cancer care is, in fact, bad. Last summer, Mr. Blair pledged to try to reduce the death rate from cancer for people under 75 by 20 percent in the next 10 years, saving 100,000 lives.
It is unclear exactly how he plans to do this, short of injecting billions more dollars into the system or changing the way it is financed. Britain currently spends 55.7 billion -- about $89 billion -- a year on health care, or 6.8 percent of its gross domestic product -- nearly all of it public money. There is little political will in Britain to move to a more cash-rich European or American-based model. Germany spends about 10.7 percent of its gross domestic product on health care, and the United States, about 14 percent.
In a recent television interview, Mr. Blair appeared to promise that Britain would bring its health spending up the European levels by 2006, but when Treasury officials calculated that that would cost perhaps an extra 12 billion a year, money that would have to come out of roads and schools, the promise was hastily downgraded to an "aspiration." Mr. Blair has already made an extra 21 billion available to the health service over three years, but much of that is being taken up by steep salary increases for workers.
The problems in cancer care start at diagnosis. The National Health Service is set up so that no patient can see a specialist without first visiting his local general practitioner. But many Britons never visit their doctor until their symptoms become alarming, by which time their cancer might be advanced. And they are culturally inclined not to demand things that Americans take for granted, like regular physicals.
The next problems are an aging network of radiotherapy and other equipment, which health-care advocates say would cost hundreds of millions of pounds to replace, and a severe shortage of cancer centers and doctors. With about 600 cancer specialists serving a population of 59 million, the average British cancer consultant sees 550 patients a year -- and in some cases sees as many as 1,000 -- compared with 250 in France or Germany.
"Britain has about half the number of cancer specialists it needs," said Karol Sikora, the vice president in clinical research for oncology at Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc. and the former chief of the World Health Organization's cancer program. To reach European levels, he said, Britain would have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to hire, train and support new cancer doctors.
Once cancer is diagnosed, care can vary significantly. The health service is divided into about 115 local health authorities, each of which receives a fixed sum from the central government and decides independently how to spend it. That is why some authorities will pay for drugs that others won't.
"You end up with a situation where if you live on one side of the street, you may be eligible for expensive anticancer treatment, and if you live on the other side, you aren't," said Dr. David Secher, director of drug development for the Cancer Research Campaign.
Specialists say that the worst aspect of their job is having to tell patients that the system will not pay for the drugs they need -- drugs that, in some cases, have been developed in British laboratories.
In Birmingham, Prof. David J. Kerr, a specialist in colorectal cancer at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, spends much of his time begging various health authorities to let him administer the cancer drug Camptosar, or irinotecan, which costs less than $10,000 for a course of treatment and can prolong life by three or more months. The drug is available in some parts of England, but not necessarily where his patients live.
"For these patients, sometimes the drug increases their life expectancy by 100 percent," he said. "That might be an anniversary reached, or a first child born."
Before Christmas, Professor Kerr said, he asked the health authority to provide irinotecan, or Camptosar, to a 39-year-old woman with three small children who has advanced colorectal cancer and a life expectancy of six months. The authority balked. "The patient asked me, 'Aren't my life and children worth a few thousand pounds?' " he said.
Last year, the government created a group charged with recommending whether cancer drugs like Taxol and Camptosar, and those that treat illnesses other than cancer, should be used nationwide. But the panel has not yet issued recommendations on any cancer drugs. And when it does -- it is expected to recommend Taxol, for instance -- this will be good news for some cancer sufferers, but bad news for other patients.
"Every time there is the prospect of a new and effective drug that's going to help people suffering from cancer," said Stephen Thornton, chief executive of the N.H.S. Confederation, an advocacy group for health authorities and hospitals, "my colleagues running health authorities are going to have to think, 'What are we going to stop doing in order to pay for that drug?' "
What is to be done? Many health-care experts argue that if the government is not willing to raise taxes, then it should allow more private money into the system, perhaps introducing nominal charges for visits to the doctor, for instance. Under one scenario, Britain would move closer to an American-style model, where richer people would buy insurance and poorer people would have their bills paid for by the government.
But Britain is wedded to a National Health Service financed by taxation, and any tampering with it would touch off a heavy political fight.
And few British experts are persuaded that the United States is anything to emulate when it comes to health care. "America doesn't deliver much bang to the buck," said Dr. Anna Donald, a clinical lecturer in health policy at University College, London. "There are definite problems in the U.K. but over all the health system works reasonably well on a shoestring."
Mr. Thornton, who heads the advocacy group, is not so sure.
"If we are to attempt to meet the demands and the expectations that people seem to have at the moment of a publicly funded health care system, then we need a substantial increase in money," he said. "Some would say it is one of the cheapest services that provides the best value for money. But that's debatable. It may be that we're just providing cheapness."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE END;
Forbes Spent Millions, but for Little Gain

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
Steve Forbes's withdrawal from the presidential race -- after having spent $69 million of his own money on two runs for the White House -- was heartbreakingly clear in a photo on his campaign Web site yesterday.
With snowflakes falling and his aides at his sides, Mr. Forbes is shown gamely walking through the cold. The caption says that Mr. Forbes "has canceled all of his previously scheduled" events for the day. 
 So ends one of the most expensive personal odysseys for the presidency. Mr. Forbes spent around $32 million of his own money in this campaign -- on top of $37.4 million he spent on his failed 1996 effort. His current spending, along with some $5 million he received in donations in this campaign, gained him 2 to 19 Republican delegates and no primary victories.
Mr. Forbes's spending puts him almost on a par with Ross Perot, the Texas businessman who spent almost $71 million on his 1992 and 1996 Reform Party bids. And, on a per delegate basis, it brings him into competition with John C. Connally, the former governor of Texaswho raised $13.7 million in 1980 on his failed Republican effort and won only a single convention delegate.
As Mr. Forbes returned to his New Jersey home yesterday, his aides were scrambling to cancel the 14 live radio appearances and the three television interviews his campaign had set up for the day. After midnight yesterday, just after he came in third in Tuesday's Delaware primary, Mr. Forbes had met with his closest campaign adviser, William Dal Col, and the two decided to end Mr. Forbes's second presidential bid.
"It was very straightforward," Mr. Dal Col said in an interview yesterday. "We realized it was time to go. We talked last night and we basically discussed how to get from here to there. And the answer was that there wasn't really an opportunity in light of Delaware. It was hard to see how we could put it together to get the nomination and, if not, it was time to leave the race.
"So we did," said Mr. Dal Col.
With that, Mr. Forbes halted a quest for the presidency that began in 1996, when he first challenged Bob Dole for the nomination, and ended in Delaware, where Mr. Forbes's 20 percent showing in a state primary he had won in 1996 gained him no delegates to the Republican convention and illustrated how his campaign had begun to falter. His last days in Delaware were spent on a four-day bus tour talking to high school students, too young to vote, and holding events like an impromptu visit to a bakery where fewer than two dozen people greeted him.
Mr. Forbes's campaign began to unravel after having scored a strong showing in January in the Iowa caucuses, where he came in second to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. But Senator John McCain of Arizona was not running in Iowa, making that an easy race. In the tougher New Hampshire primary, Mr. Forbes was unable to capitalize on that success and he took only 13 percent of the vote, just a single point above his 1996 showing there and far behind Mr. McCain, who won the race, or Mr. Bush, who came in second.
And polls were already beginning to show that Mr. Forbes was still stuck in the single digit range in important coming primary states like Michigan and South Carolina.
In the analysis of why Mr. Forbes's effort failed, both those inside the Forbes campaign and Republican observers say Mr. Forbes's anti-tax, anti-abortion message may have been too abstract and too issue-oriented at a time when polls say that voters are looking more at a candidate's personal character than his exact message. In response to the Clinton White House scandals, polls show that voters are interested in tales of character-building and the perception that their candidate could beat the Democratic nominee.
Moreover, in a robust economy, voters are less interested in issues of drastic changes in the tax code than in the character of the next person in the White House. Even Mr. Forbes, in an interview yesterday with NBC News, his only one of the day, acknowledged as much: "While I did have a strong message, I did not want to have the fate of the messenger get in the way of the message."
The Forbes campaign agreed. "While a lot of people may have liked our message, it didn't translate into votes," Mr. Dal Col said. "You have a healthy economy and not the anger you had in 1992 and 1996. With the Clinton White House, issues of morality and character were important. This became a race more about biography and character, and Steve's strength is as an issue candidate. Voters were not looking at Steve as the type of person they wanted as president at this time."
Mr. Dal Col said it was hard for Mr. Forbes, the son of a millionaire publisher, to compete with the war record of Mr. McCain and the legacy of the Bush family. "If it was a biography fight," Mr. Dal Col said, "we couldn't win."
Ed Gillespie, a Republican strategist and Washington lobbyist, said: "Fairly or unfairly, Steve does not come across as presidential. It's hard for the public to envision him in the Oval Office. He's smart and has lots of ideas, but doesn't fit the role."
For starters, Mr. Forbes has never held office. In his career he has had only one boss, his late father Malcolm, from whom he inherited a publishing empire that forms the basis of his $440 million net worth. Also his conservative message evolved very little, while his rivals adopted many of Mr. Forbes's anti-tax themes, drawing votes away.
Rich Galen, a Republican strategist, said that Mr. Forbes's anti-tax message was "so old it was growing whiskers." Many of the conservative voters that Mr. Forbes had targeted, Mr. Galen said, felt Mr. Bush reflected their views and had a better chance of winning the White House.
It appeared that Mr. Forbes had ruled out running for the United States Senate in New Jersey. "He flat out has no interest in the Senate whatsoever," Mr. Dal Col said.

HEADLINE: White House Raises Expected Cost of Medicare Drug Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
The White House now says President Clinton's proposal to provide Medicare coverage of prescription drugs will cost 35 percent more than it estimated just seven months ago.
In late June, when Mr. Clinton unveiled his plan to offer drug coverage to all Medicare beneficiaries, he said it would cost $118 billion over 10 years. In his new budget request to Congress this week, he put the cost at $160 billion. 
 While Mr. Clinton's basic proposal has not changed, the White House estimate of its cost has shot up. White House officials said today that they had revised their estimate to reflect several factors, including a realization that the use of prescription drugs by the elderly and the prices of new drugs were rising faster than they first assumed.
The rapid increases in drug spending help explain why millions of elderly Americans want government help with the costs and why some members of Congress are apprehensive about establishing new drug benefits. Critics of the Clinton proposal said that the first White House numbers were too low and that the revisions showed that the government must move carefully in designing Medicare drug benefits.
Asked why the cost estimates had increased, Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White House, said today: "We've had another year of experience, during which drug utilization and costs have increased. We included that experience in our new projections."
In addition, Mr. Jennings said, the administration's earlier estimates did not adequately account for the cost of providing drug benefits to Medicare patients in nursing homes.
After Mr. Clinton offered his proposal last summer, the Congressional Budget Office said he had grossly underestimated the costs. At a Senate hearing in July, Dan L. Crippen, director of the budget office, testified that Mr. Clinton's plan would cost $168 billion over 10 years.
Beyond the basic Medicare drug benefit that Mr. Clinton proposed last year, he is now asking Congress to set aside $35 billion to help protect Medicare beneficiaries with extremely high drug costs in the years 2006 to 2010. Mr. Clinton did not say exactly who would be eligible.
The change in the White House cost estimates underlines the difficulty of predicting the course of drug spending at a time when scientists are continually developing new drugs to prevent and treat disease and improve the quality of life. Economists have developed rules of thumb to predict how small changes in variables like economic growth and unemployment will affect federal spending and revenue. But they say they have no reliable models to predict drug spending.
Two members of the Senate Budget Committee -- Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, and Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon -- said today that they would seek money for Medicare drug benefits as part of the budget blueprint for the coming year.
Their approach is different from Mr. Clinton's: it would offer consumers a wide range of private insurance policies to cover drug costs. The government would offer to pay at least 25 percent of the premiums for insurance covering the drug costs of any Medicare beneficiary, with larger subsidies for lower-income people.
Ms. Snowe and Mr. Wyden said they had been working closely with the White House and Senate Republican leaders. They described their proposal as a middle ground between the Clinton plan and more conservative schemes.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, which has authority over Medicare, has endorsed the approach proposed by Ms. Snowe and Mr. Wyden.
Senators Snowe and Wyden said Congress should authorize Medicare drug benefits this year, even if lawmakers could not agree on a comprehensive overhaul of the entire Medicare program. In addition, they said, senators generally agree that the federal government -- specifically, the Health Care Financing Administration -- should have little or no direct role in operation of the drug insurance program.
Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, said few insurance companies would want to offer free-standing policies to cover drug costs.
"It would be like providing insurance for haircuts," because so many elderly people need prescription drugs, Mr. Kahn said.
But Senator Snowe said she believed that some insurers would offer drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries with the federal subsidies envisioned in her bill.

CONCERN ABOUT EURO'S DROP

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The chief economist of the European Central Bank, Otmar Issing, said he was worried that the euro's drop against the dollar was damaging public confidence in the 13-month-old single European currency. "I'm concerned about a possible loss in confidence," Mr. Issing told the German weekly newspaper Rheinischer Merkur. The euro has fallen 15 percent since its inception on Jan. 1, 1999. Mr. Issing said that the euro's drop was largely a reflection of the "picture book" state of the United States economy, but that European growth was set to catch up with the United States this year and next.

A Sidewalk Soapbox Assails Braves' Rocker

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Commissioner Bud Selig, who suspended John Rocker for all of spring training and the first four weeks of the season, was the first and chief witness at the hearing on the pitcher's appeal of the suspension yesterday, but what went on outside the hearing room said at least as much about the controversy Rocker has stirred as the testimony inside.
Rocker's presence at the commissioner's office on Park Avenue in New York prompted curious and critical onlookers and a series of signs protesting Rocker's remarks that denigrated foreigners, gays and some minorities. That the Atlanta Braves closer was back in the city where his problems began last fall during the Braves' games with the Mets only added to the unusual atmosphere surrounding the day's events. 
 "Go back to Atlanta, you rat," one sign read.
Said another: "New York immigrants against Rocker."
Selig, who testified for nearly six hours on the first day of the grievance hearing before the arbitrator, Shyam Das, disclosed afterward that he had met privately with Rocker yesterday. He declined, however, to discuss their conversation.
"Anything that was said will remain private," said Selig, who headed back to Milwaukee immediately after completing his testimony.
Following Selig on the witness stand yesterday were Derrick Boazman, an Atlanta city councilman, and Stan Kasten, the Braves' president. The hearing is expected to be completed today. Kevin Hallinan, baseball's chief security executive, will be Major League Baseball's final witness. When the players association presents its case, Rocker will be one of the witnesses.
Although the union appealed the suspension, management presented its case first because, under the collective bargaining agreement, the burden of proof falls on the person imposing disciplinary action.
Selig issued his penalty, which also included a $20,000 fine, on Jan. 31, after hearing the outcry over Rocker's remarks in a magazine article in December. The players association appealed the suspension on Rocker's behalf the next day, contending that the suspension was excessive.
"They do have the right to appeal," Selig said after his testimony, speaking with reporters outside the building that houses the baseball offices. "That's his right under our process. He has strong feelings on the matter and so do I. Other commissioners have had to go through this process. I did what I thought I had to do. I'm very comfortable with what I did. The matter is now in the hands of the arbitrator."
Rocker said little. "Just be patient," he told reporters. "You'll find out later."
When he arrived for the hearing, Rocker was greeted by a round of boos from a group of Bear Stearns employees who were outside taking a mid-morning smoking break.
A group of Bear Stearns mail-room workers appeared with hastily made signs on brown packing paper that read, "Go back home, Rocker."
"John Rocker is a rat; this symbolizes Rocker," said Matt Reischl, a labor organizer from Local 78, which represents asbestos, lead and hazardous waste laborers. He was manning a 12-foot tall inflated rat he had set up along the sidewalk in front of the building. "We don't appreciate the statements he made about immigrants. Our union consists mostly of immigrants."
Reischl, 24, of Salzburg, Austria, said the local membership was primarily divided between Spanish-speaking and Polish immigrants.
Workers from nearby buildings ignored the cold weather to linger outside 245 Park Avenue in anticipation of getting a glimpse of Rocker, who took an instant dislike to Mets fans when the Braves played at Shea Stadium. His comments and feelings about the fans fueled his larger verbal attack that he extended to many other segments of society in an interview in Sports Illustrated.
In suspending Rocker, Selig said, "Mr. Rocker should understand that his remarks offended practically every element of society and brought dishonor to himself, the Braves and Major League Baseball."
A 25-year-old Georgian, Rocker returned to New York yesterday for the first time since the Braves played the Yankees in the World Series last October. His return prompted the assignment of more than a dozen uniformed and plainclothes police officers from the Manhattan North precinct. The officers said they were concerned with keeping the sidewalk clear for pedestrian traffic.
One curious sidewalk observer was Tom Halligan, 39, a client manager, who works on the 27th floor of a building across Park Avenue. "I've been looking out the window every 15 minutes to see if he was coming out," Halligan said. "I understand what all the commotion is about, but I believe in freedom of speech. He should have kept his feelings to himself, though."
Also on hand was a delegation of community leaders and clergymen from Atlanta.
"The mere fact that this hearing is being held shows that Rocker is in a total state of denial; he doesn't get the message," said Michael Langford, a member of the Atlanta coalition.
In the hearing room, Selig testified about why he felt disciplinary action was necessary. Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, questioned him about precedent in his cross-examination.
 Boazman, the city councilman, followed Selig to the stand and told about community reaction in Atlanta. He testified, he said after, "to convey the message we were disappointed in the appeal and that these comments were very serious, bigoted, homophobic, racist." He said Rocker deserved the suspension and added that the Braves should release him. Kasten, the final witness of the eight-hour session, testified about the impact of Rocker's remarks on the Braves, particularly what he said was the economic impact.

HEADLINE: Spread of Attacks on Web Sites Is Slowing Traffic on the Internet

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL with JOEL BRINKLEY 

 BODY:
As anonymous assaults on major Web sites continued yesterday, computer vandals crippled a large online brokerage operation and a media site. The Justice Department pledged to find those responsible, but computer experts questioned whether any defenses could easily be deployed against the attacks.
On the third day of what increasingly appeared to be a well-planned and tightly coordinated siege by a single individual or group, the impact of the attacks deepened. In addition to damaging commerce at the sites that have become targets, the attacks slowed traffic in some portions of the Internet. 
 In Washington, Attorney General Janet Reno, while pledging a vigorous pursuit of those responsible, also acknowledged that the attackers had covered their electronic tracks well and remained unknown to authorities.
Concerned e-commerce companies across the Net, many of whose publicly traded shares dropped in value yesterday as investors tried to understand the implications, began taking measures to protect their Web sites from becoming targets.
Even so, computer security experts said the complex, anonymous nature of the attacks made them difficult to trace or stop.
Indeed, security experts said that the attacks appear to have been weeks or months in the planning, since they required clandestinely loading software onto dozens, if not hundreds, of computers around the Internet.
When those programs were activated this week, the host computers were transformed into platforms for starting the attacks. In almost all cases, experts said, the owners of the computers never knew -- and still may not know -- that their machines had become cogs in the attack machinery.
"We tend to believe there are thousands of these tools out there waiting for the launch button to be pushed," said David M. Remnitz, chief executive of IFsec L.L.C., a information security company in New York. Suggesting that the attackers already had the infrastructure in place for the attacks to continue indefinitely, he added, "I don't see any reason why they would stop."
Ms. Reno said that the F.B.I. had opened a criminal investigation, but she and bureau officials acknowledged that they had no strong leads and had heard no credible claims of responsibility.
"At this time, we are not aware of the motives behind these attacks," the attorney general said, "but they appear to be intended to interfere with and to disrupt legitimate electronic commerce."
Keynote Systems, a company that measures the reliability and performance of Web sites, reported yesterday that during the attacks, it took eight seconds to call up a typical Web site's home page, nearly twice the time required the last two weeks.
Government and computer industry officials also continued to acknowledge yesterday that they could not be certain that the same group or individual was behind all the attacks, but they said the nature of the assaults seemed too similar to be coincidental.
What began with an attack on the popular Yahoo portal site on Monday spread yesterday to Zdnet.com, a media site, and E*Trade, one of the largest online brokerage houses.
And at least one other major site appears to have been a target. Although CNet, the Internet media company, declined to comment yesterday, its network service provider reported detecting an attack on the company's sites Tuesday afternoon but said it had managed to prevent any crippling effect on users.
Patrick DiChiro, a spokesman for E*Trade in Menlo Park, Calif., said that the company planned to deal "one on one" with customers who contend that they had lost money by not being able to gain access to the site to place trades.
Mr. DiChiro said that after the assaults Monday on Yahoo and Tuesday on Buy.com, a retail site, and eBay.com, an auction site, E*Trade began discussing what steps it might take to defend its site against a similar attack. Though he said unnamed measures were taken, the company was unable to prevent the attack, which hit at 5 a.m. Pacific Standard Time and slowed access to the site for about three hours, according to Keynote Systems.
The company did have several contingency plans in place, including directing customers who called E*Trade to an alternate Web site.
One reason it is difficult to defend against such an attack is that finding and cutting off the responsible parties requires a cooperative, concerted effort between the affected Web site and its network service provider -- the company that connects the site's own computers to the Internet.
Paul Vixie, senior vice president of Internet services for AboveNet, a network service provider whose clients include eBay and CNet, said the attackers appeared to have installed widely available software that, when secretly planted on other people's computers, flood a target site with instructions to perform meaningless tasks.
Mr. Vixie said that AboveNet was hit with as much as 800 megabits of "spurious traffic" a second, a level that could cost $400,000 a month to transport if it continued.
"It would cost us $400,000 a month just because some teenager with a $300 Linux box doesn't like one of our customers," Mr. Vixie said. "It makes us a little testy."
An earlier incarnation of this type of attack emerged two years ago, but new illicit software has circulated that makes such an attack easier to start and more difficult to defend against. The attacks themselves have intensified in the last nine months, striking not just the well-publicized major sites, but also smaller sites.
CERT, a federally financed computer security organization based at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, along with private computer security companies have released numerous warnings in recent months describing the attacks and suggesting ways to combat them.
Ron Dick, chief of the F.B.I.'s computer investigations and operations section, acknowledged that tools for this type of attack, known as a distributed denial of service attack, are so readily available on the Web that "a 15-year-old could use them to launch these attacks."
"It doesn't take a great deal of sophistication," Mr. Dick said. "In a relatively short period of time an unsophisticated intruder or unsophisticated computer user can take advantage of not only the U.S. government, but also e-commerce."
Under Federal law, purposely disrupting computer networks is a felony punishable for first-time offenders with a term of as much as five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, plus assessment of damages.
But Mr. Dick repeatedly said the F.B.I. had no hope of solving the crime without "help from the entire community" -- primarily meaning the various Internet service providers, or I.S.P.'s, whose servers were used to pass the data from the attacker to the victims.
"We are working with the F.B.I. to track the source of the attacks," Mr. Vixie said, echoing similar statements from officials at Yahoo and eBay.
Mr. Vixie said there were several steps sites could take to protect themselves. Those include increasing their capacity to handle traffic; using operating systems that can sift out malicious traffic; and installing new security patches that prevent sites from being commandeered to begin attacks.
But he added: "This level of alertness is not sustainable. We are hoping that there will be a technological or legal solution so we can go back to building our network rather than defending against attacks."
For their part, AboveNet and other Internet service providers have begun filtering out suspicious traffic. But that approach, they said, must be continuously adjusted as attackers change their means of assault.

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day on Feb. 10 with an article about attacks against several Web sites referred imprecisely to the durations of the interruptions. Keynote Systems, a company that measures Internet performance, supplied data ranging from the point of less than 5 percent availability to the point of at least 80 percent availability. The sites were not necessarily blocked altogether during the periods shown, and some say their disruptions were shorter than indicated. The sites and the times they observed were Amazon, 1 hour 7 minutes; Buy.com, 3 hours 10 minutes; E*Trade, 1 hour; Yahoo, 3 hours 10 minutes; ZDNet, 2 hours 32 minutes.
The chart also misstated the day of the attack against Buy.com. It was Feb. 8, not Feb. 7.

HEADLINE: WEEKEND EXCURSION;
For Relaxing, Luxury Helps

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va.

 BODY:
"So do I need to curtsy when I go in?" Gabriela wanted to know.
Gabriela, my daughter, is a month shy of 10 and has been to places like Versailles and Blois. So her awed reaction surprised me. I had just shown her the brochures for the Greenbrier, the grand old 6,500-acre resort with the world-class golf courses 2,000 feet up in the mountains of West Virginia. 
 One color photo showed a tuxedo-clad waiter serving two women in black evening dresses and two men in dark suits and ties dining in a high-ceilinged, mirrored room under a five-tier crystal-and-gold chandelier. The main dining room is so formal that it has a dress code for dinner: suits and ties or black tie for men, dresses or evening suits for women. Gabriela figured she'd fit in fine with her new black velvet dress with the leopard print bolero jacket bought for $9.95 from the sale rack at Limited Too.
I am in the final stretch of writing a book, the stretch where day after day you work 18 hours to make deadlines that defy logic in the computer age. My husband was heading to California for a bar mitzvah of the son of one of his childhood friends and taking along our elder daughter, Alessandra. How delightful it would be to spend a quiet weekend at home together, I told Gabriela. How dreadful, she replied.
Gabriela was determined to top her sister. She wanted nothing less than Disney World; I wanted a spa. So we came up with a Disney World of sorts: a step back in time known as the Greenbrier.
Indeed, the Greenbrier is a magical kingdom for mothers and daughters, particularly if they're prepared to drop a lot of money. The resort boasts 637 guest rooms, including 46 suites and 71 guest and estate houses, 10 lobbies and 30 meeting rooms. The 1,600 employees serve a maximum of 1,200 guests. There are three 18-hole golf courses, a golf academy, 20 indoor and outdoor tennis courts, indoor and outdoor swimming, croquet, mountain biking, trap and skeet shooting, whitewater rafting, horseback riding, carriage rides, fishing in a trout-stocked creek, wild game hunts, ice skating, exercise rooms, personal training, a medical diagnostic clinic and a 25,000-square-foot spa.
There is simply too much to do in one weekend, even in winter.
In the 19th century, the plantation owners of the South -- men sporting top hats and walking sticks, women in sweeping skirts and parasols -- gathered on the Greenbrier's lush, manicured lawns to sip a Champagne-watermelon juice cocktail. President John Tyler spent his honeymoon here in 1844. (So did Joseph and Rose Kennedy and Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher.) The spa's famous heated sulfur water, from natural springs smelling like rotten eggs, gained an international reputation for curing rheumatism and arthritis. "A European cure without going to Europe," one of its early 20th-century brochures boasted.
During the Civil War, both the Union and the Confederacy alternately occupied the Greenbrier. During World War II, the State Department housed several hundred German and Japanese diplomats here for several months until they could return home. The hotel was also used as a hospital for 20,000 wounded American soldiers. An ultra-secret bomb shelter to house all of Congress in the event of an enemy attack on Washington was built in a separate wing in the 1950's. More than two dozen presidents have visited the resort.
 
A Contrast in Colors
By car, the Greenbrier is four and a half hours from Washington, eight and a half hours from New York. Since our time was short, Gabriela and I flew in on a 19-seat US Airways Express propeller plane. We were the only passengers on board the one-hour flight that Friday morning.
Gabriela was entranced by the decor. We live in a house that has white walls, hardwood floors, Middle Eastern carpets and art bought mostly at flea markets around the world. There are no draperies, no floral print upholstery, no boiserie. The decor at the Greenbrier, by contrast, is Martha Stewart on an acid trip. The resort is particularly proud of its decorating style, originated in the late 1940's by Dorothy Draper, the New York interior designer who used bold colors (mixing pinks and greens with red was her favorite) and made flower-patterned chintzes an American design statement.
Our room was a vast expanse, with so much space between the king-size bed and the television set that we could scarcely see the screen. Like the rest of the hotel, nothing in the room seemed to match. The striped pink-and-pale-green-flowered wallpaper did not match the kelly green carpet or the red comforter with the forest green trim or the pink-and-white checked upholstered armchairs or the cranberry-and-white print tablecloth and dust ruffle. It wasn't supposed to, we were told. This was all part of the Draper plan.
Gabriela was fascinated by the wallpapered walk-in closet, the cupboard that pulled down to reveal two ironing boards -- a large one for shirts and a small one for shirt sleeves -- and the well-stocked mini-bar, which she photographed from several angles.
The Greenbrier has remained faithful to Draper's fastidious attention to detail. The fluffy bathrobes in our walk-in closet and the towels in our bathroom were monogrammed with elaborate G's. The end sheet of the toilet paper roll in our bathroom did not hang; it was folded into a V and secured with a gold sticker engraved with the same G. The G was stamped into the sand in the urns used to snuff out cigarettes at the entrances to elevators and restaurants. Pots of perfectly trimmed fresh flowers graced every public room.
 
Aiming to Please
The Greenbrier may not be for everybody. For urban Northerners like us, it was a dramatic leap backward. During our three-day visit, neither Gabriela nor I saw one nonwhite face among the guests. "The History of the Greenbrier," a 222-page hard-cover book, includes only a few nonwhite faces, including a member of a United States pro golf team, Japanese diplomats interned during World War II and the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin L. Powell. But where else can you find a mosaic-tiled pool? O.K., so it's not Piazza Armerina, the 1,800-year-old Sicilian villa where the pool's colored mosaics depict frolicking women in bathing suits. But the Greenbrier pool is big -- Olympic-size -- and lined with tall white columns, with hundreds of yards of fabric draped from the ceiling.
The Greenbrier also believes in service, real service, the kind in which the staff really seems to care that you're perpetually comfortable, fed and entertained. On the weekend of our visit, there were only about 400 guests, including a veterinary convention, which meant we got appointments whenever we wanted and instant pampering.
 
Bowling and Tennis
Even in the dead of winter, the Greenbrier isn't cheap. But the beauty of traveling here as a single parent is that the child stays free. It cost $220 a night for the two of us, including breakfast and dinner. (That doesn't include taxes or an automatic service charge.) The price also includes free access to the game room, the swimming pools and an outdoor ice rink, afternoon tea and a movie every evening. And Gabriela got to choose her meals from the adult menu. A couple would pay almost twice as much.
Other activities come with price tags: bowling ($8, including shoe rental), horseback riding ($42 an hour), indoor tennis ($37 an hour for singles), a 30-minute carriage or sleigh ride ($26), a falcon and hawk demonstration at the Falconry Academy ($65 for adults and $40 for children). The shops sell gift items geared to indulgent grandparents. Gabriela spotted a small metal horse as a gift for her baby sitter. The only problem was that it cost $495. Porcelain-shard boxes that can be found in Beijing's overpriced state-run stores for less than $2 started at $15. We didn't do much shopping.
But we did do a lot of eating. We arrived and headed straight to lunch in Draper's Cafe. Gabriela was wide-eyed. "It's just like the ice cream parlor in 'Annie,' " she said of the pink-and-white striped entrance and the wicker chairs with cushions covered in plasticized cabbage-rose chintz. It was an odd menu, a combination of regional American and ethnic. (The soup and sandwich of the day on Friday was New England clam chowder and lox, lettuce and tomato on a bagel.)
Nothing on either the children's or the adults' menu appealed to Gabriela, and she wondered out loud if scrambled eggs and bacon were an option. When the waiter smiled and said sweetly, "No problem, Gabriela," she gave the cafe five stars.
Breakfasts were perfection. The miniature muffins were homemade; the juice was fresh-squeezed; the mixed berries were fresh, sweet and piled high in big bowls. This is farm country, and the eggs tasted like eggs, the bacon like bacon. Second helpings were allowed.
Dinners were almost as good, and we ate our way through multicourse meals of respectable American-Continental cuisine, to the music of a violinist and a pianist who welcomed our requests. Gabriela goes to a progressive school in Washington with no dress code, so she embraced the Greenbrier's formality and even learned how to use which utensil when. Much to her chagrin, a woman was admitted to the dining room wearing what looked like a coral sweat suit.
 
Sulfur and Scotch Spray
During our stay, I made two appointments for myself: one at the spa, the other at the beauty salon. At the spa I opted for the $93 "Greenbrier."
For 15 minutes I was soaked in a deep, bubbly hot bath of sulfur water and salt. A steam bath or sauna followed, then a "Swiss shower" of water from 16 shower heads and something called a "Scotch spray," when the spa therapist turned a high-pressure hose on me. The finale is a 15-minute Swedish massage, not nearly enough to iron out all the kinks, she informed me. It was in the spa that I noticed the pink rhododendron, West Virginia's state flower, on the tiled walls. Of course! Romance and rhododendrons had been Draper's motto. (Throughout the weekend Gabriela and I found rhododendrons in all sorts of places: on the menus, on the china, on the napkins, on the minibar price list.)
Gabriela, meanwhile, spent an hour bowling in the Greenbrier's eight-lane bowling alley with the other children registered in the "Brier Patch" program. For $40, a child can spend the day. A team of baby sitters feed and entertain the children, in winter with bowling, swimming, ice skating and arts and crafts.
Afterward, Gabriela reminded me that this was our weekend together. So when I went for a facial ($130) at the beauty salon the next day, I took her along.
Reluctantly, I signed off on a mini-manicure for her (I've had only one manicure in my life) and a trimming of her bangs. (How much could a bangs-trim cost?) When I saw her again, her hands had been paraffined, her nails multicolored and topped with sparkles. Her bangs were indeed shorter, and her hair was swept up in a French braid. The tab: $80.
 
Tea and Napoleons
Along the way during our weekend, we also watched a PG-13 movie, "The Bachelor," in real leather seats in the Greenbrier's movie theater, which is larger than many commercial ones. (The nearby powder room displayed dozens of black-and-white glamour portraits of movie stars from the 1940's and 50's, from Clark Gable to Jane Russell, the latter in a bubble bath.) We took tennis lessons together from a good-natured and very patient high school chemistry teacher named Bill, who doubles as the tennis pro. We sipped tea and ate tiny napoleons at the 4:15 afternoon tea in the main lobby with a live violin and piano concert. We walked to the outdoor Springhouse, where we held our noses as we sampled the sulfur water in plastic cups with the signature rhododendron on them.
But Gabriela discovered pool at the Greenbrier, and what she really wanted to do was to spend as much time as she could at one of the two pool tables in the dimly lighted game room.
I hadn't played pool since I was about 13, and the deep-green-and-black plaid wall-to-wall carpeting and reproduction fowl prints at the Greenbrier bore little resemblance to the neighborhood pool hall at the foot of Porter Avenue on the west side of Buffalo.
 
The Bomb Shelter
The high point of the trip was our tour of the cold war-era bomb shelter, built 720 feet into a hillside below a wing of the hotel during the Eisenhower administration; the president frequently visited the resort. Code-named Project Greek Island, the shelter was kept secret -- and active -- until The Washington Post revealed its existence in 1992.
The bomb shelter is closed for renovation now; we were able to finagle a private tour. There are 12-foot-wide, 25-ton concrete-and-steel "blast doors" to shield inhabitants from a nuclear explosion as close as 25 miles away; a decontamination room; chambers for the House and the Senate; a kitchen and a cafeteria; a power plant; a medical unit (complete with an operating room and 12-bed hospital); a communications room; and dormitories for the lawmakers. (All this was very exclusive: the families would not have been allowed in, although they might have booked space in the resort proper.)
To help fill up the resort during the slow winter months, the Greenbrier wants to convert part of the bomb shelter into a casino with mostly card games, we were told. The museum, it seems, is simply not enough of a moneymaker. The fusty old image would be shed. Eisenhower would be replaced by Kennedy. Cold war seriousness would be out, Rat Pack glamour in.
Last year the West Virginia State Legislature passed a bill allowing the county commission to put the casino question to a referendum by the people of Greenbrier County. But the county is a conservative place, and the project faces stiff opposition. Even many on the resort staff, some of them third- and even fourth-generation Greenbrier employees, have expressed concern to management that a casino could bring in hard-drinking riff-raff. Still, management has a golden argument: this is an economically depressed area whose main source of income is the Greenbrier.
Gabriela decided she liked the bomb shelter just the way it was. In fact, there was nothing about the Greenbrier she would change. On Sunday, after the East Coast was hit with more than a foot of snow, Gabriela and I opted out of flying and took a six-hour train ride home on Amtrak's Chicago-Washington line instead. We asked Draper's Cafe to pack box lunches.
As we chugged along the back yard of rural Allegheny Mountain country, eating B.L.T.'s and sipping chocolate milk, I realized just how well the weekend had gone when Gabriela asked, "Mom, does it cost a lot to have a wedding there?"

The Muse
Suddenly booted off the studio lot, the screenwriter Steven Phillips (Albert Brooks, left) finds himself with no livelihood and an expensive wife, Laura (Andie MacDowell), and photogenic Hollywood abode to maintain. Short on ideas and convinced that his best years are behind him, Phillips is advised to get help from Sarah (Sharon Stone), who is billed as a muse of the original ancient Greek variety. But while Sarah comes up with a workable project, she is expensive and seems more interested in teaching Laura the right way to shop. Stirring his own ingredients, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, Mr. Brooks concocts a "mordantly hilarious cri de coeur about contemporary life." 

1999. USA. $108.01; DVD, $24.95. 97 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: Feb. 15.
 
The Story of Us
In a middle-aged marriage running on empty, a surburban dad named Ben (Bruce Willis) and his beleaguered spouse, Katie (Michelle Pfeiffer), keep up appearances for the children's sake. While Rob Reiner's film means to depict the workaday realities, its elbow-in-the-ribs humor doesn't work, nor does "trumpeting its insights at high volume, relying on heavy shtick and turning its characters into clowns" (Maslin).

1999. Universal. $107.37; DVD, $24.98. 90 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: Feb. 15.
 
Brokedown Palace
Defiantly proud of her own deceitfulness, Alice (Claire Danes) persuades Darlene (Kate Beckinsale) to lie to her family and say they are visiting Hawaii on their high school graduation trip. Actually, the girls are headed for Bangkok, where things turn nasty when they are gulled by a charming Australian (Daniel LaPaine) and arrested at the airport with six kilos of heroin planted on them. Thrown in prison, Alice really has a chance to show how clever she is. With a pungent sense of cultural dislocation and Ms. Danes riding a strong emotional current, Jonathan Kaplan's film is "good enough that you wish it were better" (Maslin).
 
1999. Fox. $107.37; DVD, $34.98. 100 minutes. PG-13. Closed captioned. Release date: Feb. 15.
 
In Too Deep
For this film's purposes, God is the name of a blustery Cincinnati drug lord (L. L. Cool J) and J. Reid is the alias of the agent (Omar Epps) charged with infiltrating God's operation. Not the most original situation perhaps, but within the framework there are some interesting subtleties, provided in the main by Ellery Ryan's cinematography.
And "to its credit, the film treats its characters seriously and doesn't resort to the obvious very often" (Maslin).
 
1999. Dimension. $104.16; DVD, $29.99. 104 minutes. R Closed captioned. Release date: Feb. 15.
 
Straight to Video
 
Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in earlier editions.
 
THE ART OF REMEMBRANCE. Shown on PBS, Johanna Heer and Werner Schmiedel's documentary follows the war-crimes expert and Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal through eight countries and traces his life from his childhood in Eastern Europe, with interviews with many friends and foes. 1998. River Lights Pictures. $39.95. 99 minutes. Information: (212) 226-1526 or rlp.homepage.com.
 
RAINING STONES. In one of Ken Loach's mid-90's responses to the trickle-down economic policies of Britain's Tory governments, Bob (Bruce Jones) tries to make ends meet in a depressed job market. But a stolen sheep yields worthless mutton, the local priest thinks his offer to clean drains is a contribution to the church and a job as a bouncer at a disco lasts one night. Meanwhile, where is Bob supposed to get the money for his daughter's communion dress? With a fine screenplay and camera work, Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times, "Mr. Loach again shows himself to be in top form." 1994. Winstar. $19.98; DVD, $29.98. 90 minutes. No rating.
 
A SLIGHT CASE OF MURDER. A film critic on cable television, Terry Thorpe (William H. Macy), gets more than a chance to evaluate murder plots when he accidentally causes his girlfriend's death. Yes, she really did slip on an ice cube and hit her head and Terry is in the clear and all, but he feels he has to cover up any involvement because he has been two-timing his regular girlfriend. "In a role that echoes his delicious 'Fargo' character, Mr. Macy is great fun to watch," Caryn James wrote in the New York Times. 1999. Warner. $79.99. 94 minutes.

HEADLINE: The Calculus Of Voter Support;
For Some, Politics of Senate Race Come Second to Personal Concerns

SERIES: UNDECIDED/First Impressions

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS 

 BODY:
A lot rests on just a few.
Of the nearly 11 million registered voters in New York State, 3 to 11 percent of them tell pollsters that they have not yet made up their minds about the race for United States Senate. The figure is surprisingly small this early in an election campaign, perhaps because the two candidates, Rudolph W. Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton, are celebrities. 
 The undecided voters are registered in both major parties, or no party, or they cannot remember which party. Some yearn for a third choice, a candidate on a white horse. Some have single-minded concerns like the upstate economy or campaign finance reform. One voter, perhaps exaggerating, says he simply wants to hear a candidate say the word "lymphoma."
Understanding the thinking of these voters, and winning them over, will be crucial to both campaigns, but no easy task. The calculus behind a decision to support a candidate can have as much to do with personal circumstances and gut feelings as with political philosophy and ideology.
Some of these undecided voters, culled from respondents to recent New York Times/CBS News polls, have agreed to discuss their decision-making as the campaign unfolds. Their willingness to do so suggests they are not typical, if there is such a thing, and their participation could alter their thinking about the campaign. But, with those caveats, they will offer a window in the coming months into the minds of the handful of voters who could decide this race.
Well-Informed, And Cynical
Tom and Barbara Smith of Saugerties speak the familiar, even fashionable, language of voter cynicism. But for them, skepticism is no pose. Their lives are so hard, their status so lowly, that they do not expect much from politicians.
"At our end of the food chain, nothing they say or do matters," said Mr. Smith, 41, a customer service manager at Wal-Mart and the embodiment of the working poor.
The Smiths scrape by, barely. His current job, at $18,000 a year, is a step up from his last, at a convenience store, because he now has health insurance and the opportunity for advancement.
But repairs are out of the question at the house they rent on an unpaved street in a rundown part of town known as "the Gut." And the Smiths do without a car. Their old one died, and their "new" '88 Ford Tempo needs $600 in repairs, which the Smiths do not have.
They are well-informed voters, he a registered Democrat and she a Republican. But they are not party loyalists: Mr. Smith twice voted for Ross Perot, not in protest but because he believed the blunt industrialist had something to offer people like him. And Mrs. Smith, who works part time stuffing advertising inserts into the local newspaper, chose Charles E. Schumer in the last Senate race because he seemed to have a good heart.
In this race, for the seat being vacated by the retirement of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, they see little but negative qualities in either candidate and wish for a surprise third option.
Mayor Giuliani is "too mean, too harsh," said Mrs. Smith, 53, who is stooped by osteoporosis. "It's the old U.S. attorney coming out in him," her husband agreed. "He doesn't know when to back off or give in."
As for the first lady, both say she has much to overcome. "There's Whitewater, Travelgate, her husband, the fact that she's imported, so to speak," said Mr. Smith, who moves stiffly on a lame leg, the result of a childhood injury.
"The way he runs New York and the way she just decides to come here and set up residence, I get the feeling we're dealing with superior beings, and you can put that in quotes," he said. "People like us, trying to make ends meet, that's who they should answer to. But I don't get the impression they care."
When Illness Is the Only Issue
Karl Schwartz has only one thing on his mind.
His wife, Joanne, has non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and Mr. Schwartz, a self-employed computer consultant, has spent the last five years learning everything he can about her disease, its treatments and its causes.
Ms. Schwartz, 47, has never voted. She dislikes them all, she explained. But her husband goes to the polls each Election Day, usually voting Democratic. He made an exception, and does not regret it, in choosing Mr. Giuliani over Mr. Dinkins. "I respect the idea of enforcing little rules," Mr. Schwartz said of the mayor's campaigns against urban nuisances. "That's a good sane position to take."
But these days he cares little about the quality of life in New York City. Or about crime rates or race relations. Even the havoc in the New York City school system, where he once taught, is a minor ripple next to his wife's illness. And Mr. Giuliani has never spoken a word about cancer research or qualifications for drug trials, at least not in Mr. Schwartz's hearing or in any of the publications, mainstream and otherwise, that he reads on the Internet.
Mr. Schwartz gives a slight edge to Mrs. Clinton. Despite the failure of her plan for universal medical coverage, Mr. Schwartz has no doubt that the first lady knows all about the ins and outs of health insurance.
But he has gone way beyond that into the minutiae of his wife's disease, and he wants a candidate who cares about the details as much as he does. He said he would gallop to the nearest polling place on Staten Island, where he lives and works in a tidy cottage near Raritan Bay, if one or the other would say the word "lymphoma." Or talk about the Food and Drug Administration, the agency that sets criteria for drug trials, for which his wife has been ruled ineligible. Or issue a position paper on the environmental causes of cancer or the safety of foods.
"These are issues for a senator," Mr. Schwartz said. "But you're considered on the fringe if you're concerned about these things."
'Isn't There Anybody Else?'
Thomas Beck, a guidance coordinator at a special education school on Long Island, is also hoping that "somebody will ride in on a white horse" and offer an alternative. "Isn't there anybody else out there?" he asked.
Mr. Beck says he is not particularly interested in ideology or party affiliation and makes his political choices in a personal way. He is at least as interested in a candidate's qualities as in policy positions.
In the 1992 presidential election, he voted for Bill Clinton, because "he made sense" and "looked like a grass-roots politician" -- without George Bush's "patrician" airs. In 1996, he chose Bob Dole because of President Clinton's personal indiscretions. "He's a lounge lizard type of guy," Mr. Beck said. "Can't you just see him in a Holiday Inn dancing to 'Feelings'?"
Mr. Beck, 47 and divorced, sees good in both candidates. "If you could take Hillary and Rudy and combine their best attributes, you'd have a great senator," he said.
But each, in his mind, also has huge deficiencies.
The mayor is "well-organized, has an excellent political mind and a great staff," Mr. Beck said. 'But his management style is 'My way or the highway.'
"He gets things done, no doubt about it. But he gets it done by not caring who he steps on. He's very callous in the way he treats people. You can get rid of the squeegee guys in a more humanistic way."
Mrs. Clinton is "clearly in the forefront," he says, on issues close to Mr. Beck's heart, like education and mental health. But he doubts that a stranger to New York can "know the problems and the pluses" of the state. He cites, as an example, the challenge of keeping the Long Island economy booming should the current bubble of prosperity burst.
"I do, to an extent, think about the carpetbagger thing," said Mr. Beck, who lives in his childhood home in Bethpage and continues to frequent sporting events there, sometimes as a coach or referee. "If the Democratic Party had a viable candidate who was charismatic and could raise money, I doubt she would even get the nomination."
 
Upstate, Tired Of Being Ignored
Upstate, in the land of abandoned carpet mills and toy factories, politics matters. The old industrial cities are hurting, untouched by the prosperity in the metropolitan region. And voters, of all political stripes, are looking for government to pay attention, relieve their pain.
In Amsterdam, Bob and Cathy Harrison are insulated from economic distress because of their professions -- he is a high school history teacher and she is a nurse. But they were born and raised in these parts, are committed to the well-being of their community and sick of being ignored by downstate politicians.
The Harrisons, both in their late 40's, with two teenagers, usually vote Republican. But they took a liking to the first lady during her summer visits upstate and think her connections in the nation's capital could help them.
"Who's going to find incentives to get industry back?" Mr. Harrison asked. "We need help from Washington."
The Harrisons recall with excitement Mrs. Clinton's appearance at a Labor Day parade in Albany, where their daughter played the flute in a high school band. The first lady was accompanied by the Harrisons' neighbor, their state assemblyman. He whispered something in her ear and she flashed a thumbs up at 14-year-old Kristin Harrison.
"That's the ultimate baby-kissing, I know," Mr. Harrison said, as if ashamed that he enjoyed it. "But she's showing some interest."
Mr. Harrison said he was automatically suspicious of someone like Mayor Giuliani, who made his mark south of New York's Mason-Dixon line. He mentioned a family trip to Disney World, where fellow tourists identified New Yorkers by how pushy they were. "We always say we're from upstate New York," Mr. Harrison said.
But Mrs. Harrison, citing the turnaround in New York City during the mayor's tenure, was more forgiving. After all, she felt perfectly safe in Manhattan last spring during her daughter's class trip to see "Les Miserables" on Broadway.
And then there was New Year's Eve in Times Square, which she saw on television. "It was a pressure situation and Giuliani came through," she said. "With him being -- what's the word? -- pig-headed, wouldn't he fight for us if he knew what we needed?"
Taking Offense At Corruption
Doug Taggart, a 41-year-old vice president at Standard & Poor's, says he is offended by the corruption of the American political system. The candidate who interests him most this political season is Senator John McCain, the Republican insurgent who has built his candidacy for president around the issue of campaign finance reform.
Restricting campaign contributions, in what is expected to be the most expensive Senate race in history, is what Mr. Taggart cares about. And he doubts that either Mayor Giuliani or Mrs. Clinton, vying for a seat in what he calls the "special interest branch of government," will make campaign finance reform a Holy Grail.
Mr. Taggart, a father of two from Cortlandt Manor in northern Westchester County, sees little to like in either Senate candidate. "I wouldn't want to say they are monstrous," he said. "But they are both very unlikable people."
He appreciates Mayor Giuliani's accomplishments in making New York City a more orderly place and commends him as a "take-charge person" compared with his predecessor, David N. Dinkins, "who was laid back to the point of doing nothing."
But the mayor chooses the wrong battles, Mr. Taggart said: rousting the homeless from the sidewalks, ticketing jaywalkers, prohibiting protests on the steps of City Hall. Referring to Mr. Giuliani's "relationship management skills," Mr. Taggart wonders "how somebody who is such a bully will adapt to a consensus-building environment" -- the Senate -- "where he doesn't always have the right of way."
But the first lady is just as easy to scorn, he said -- for small matters like whether she roots for the Yankees or the Cubs, medium-size matters like whether she lives on Old House Lane or on Pennsylvania Avenue and large matters like whether she made money in questionable stock deals. Lumping Mrs. Clinton with her husband, Mr. Taggart calls them "the couple that never learns their lessons," continuing to "live in a totally unconscious way" despite a succession of scandals.
Referring to both Senate candidates, he asked: "Why reward that type of person? I almost don't want to vote."
 
Day-to-Day Life Before Politics
For some people, politics doesn't matter much. Their lives are good, their problems few and personal, and their days stretched full with new careers, new babies, new houses.
This is how it is for Brad Easterbrook and Kim Shaunesey, both 33 and parents of an infant daughter. Ask this couple what they need and they will tell you: a shorter commute; lower property taxes; weekends together; more sleep. These are not issues that United States senators can do much about.
Mr. Easterbrook is the pro for tennis and other court sports at the Short Hills Club in New Jersey. Ms. Shaunesey is clinical coordinator for disturbed children at a hospital in Connecticut.
To accommodate these far-flung careers, they chose to live in between, in Rye Brook in Westchester County. Now Mr. Easterbrook commutes 90 minutes each way and his wife 45 minutes. He works every day except Monday, until 8 at night. She works four days, including Monday. This saves money on child care, but the savings is more than eaten up by their property taxes -- $12,000 a year for a routine three-bedroom raised ranch on a quarter acre. It also means that they rarely see each other awake.
So commonplace concerns trump politics. "We're too involved in our own lives," said Mr. Easterbrook, a registered Republican.
Their thoughts on the campaign come haltingly. Mr. Easterbrook is a fan of the mayor because "the city is definitely a better place to be." He has heard that crime reductions might have been a result of heavy-handed tactics, but he dismisses that as media exaggeration. Plus, Mrs. Clinton's strong suits are "touchy feely things" that don't interest him. He sees the mayor as a politician with a clear agenda. "Guys with simpler approaches tend to make things happen better than guys who think too much," he said. But he's not sure Mr. Giuliani's style would work in the Senate, and "that's where my undecidedness lies."
Ms. Shaunesey knows she is registered but isn't sure of her party affiliation. "Probably Republican," she said, with the distracted air of a sleep-deprived mother.
The mayor, she said, is "a hothead," who "overreacts and makes things a huge deal." She notes that "at least Hillary treats everyone nicely." But, Ms. Shaunesey said, the first lady "is so far removed from what my life is, I don't see how she can represent me. Do you think Hillary washes her own floor?"
 
Poverty May Be More Pressing
Politics can also take a back seat to poverty.
Charlene Clinton, a 44-year-old Buffalo Democrat, barely noticed that the first lady was in town twice in recent weeks. Struggling to make ends meet as she eases her way off welfare, Ms. Clinton -- no relation to the president -- has more pressing matters on her mind.
For her, the political visits came on days like any other: waiting in a drift of dirty snow for the bus that would take her to her job as a school monitor; wheezing with asthma and listening to her 13-year-old daughter do the same; worrying about her grown son, a high school dropout, and his girlfriend, pregnant with their second child, with four others under the age of 5 scattered in foster care; trying to find a ride to her weekly Bible study class.
Ms. Clinton does not whine about her lot and, in fact, says she has much to be thankful for. She owns her two-story house on Buffalo's east side, where her parents raised one son and eight daughters. Her late father, a janitor at the post office for 30 years, "made excellent money," Ms. Clinton said. She hopes to do the same and praises the decision to phase out welfare.
At her current job she nets $488 a month, compared with $230 from Aid to Families With Dependent Children. Briefly, as a secretary for a state drug program that lost its funding, she brought home $940 a month. She attends a training center where she is polishing her computer skills, hoping for another office job. She continues to get food stamps and Medicaid.
Ms. Clinton said that to choose a candidate this early in the campaign would be "taking wild guesses." She simply doesn't know enough. "I have to hear these people speak on different subjects," she said. She has every intention of voting, having missed only one election that she can recall, the last presidential contest, when she was recovering from a heart attack.
The issue she cares about most is how to move people from welfare to work. Will they get help finding a better job? How long will they remain eligible for food stamps? Will there be affordable health care when they no longer qualify for Medicaid?
Ms. Clinton said she would shape her views from television and "word of mouth," especially discussions with her elderly next-door neighbor, whom she generally escorts to the polls, for safety in a rough neighborhood.
"She reads the paper faithfully," Ms. Clinton said of her neighbor, "and is always telling me something about something."

Old Traditions on New Network: Igloos and Seals

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: WINNIPEG, Manitoba

 BODY:
Like most children growing up across North America in the 1960's, Jim Compton took cultural cues from the family television set.
"I had six-shooters and a cowboy outfit," Mr. Compton, a member of the Saulteaux tribe in Saskatchewan, said. "I identified more with John Wayne, not with the Indian that got shot down." 
 Now, after a 20-year career in television, Mr. Compton has his hands on a tool that he hopes will improve the television images that will wash over the next generation of Canada's indigenous peoples.
In December, from newly completed studios in this city on the central plains, broadcasting started for the Aboriginal People's Television Network, APTN. Mr. Compton is program director for what he bills as "the world's first national aboriginal television network."
As the cultural collision between Indian America and European America grinds into its sixth century, the aboriginal network seeks to create an electronic home and meeting place for Canada's million Indians, Eskimos and Metis, or people of mixed race. Aborigines constitute the fastest-growing segment of the population. But native communities are often the most troubled, with high rates of suicide, unemployment, incarceration and alcoholism.
Many Indians say the intrusion of European-dominated programming into native houses contributed to cultural dislocation and loss of pride. In the 1970's, a group of Eskimo elders in the eastern Arctic called television "an atomic bomb that leaves buildings intact, but destroys the lives and souls of the people."
"All of a sudden, they were getting images that did not reflect their cultures," Mr. Compton said of television's demoralizing effects. "All of a sudden, native people had to try to be like Barbie and Ken."
In contrast, an Indian-centered view of the world is the fare on APTN, which is now included by law in the basic cable package received by all Canadian subscribers, nearly eight million households.
Reaching into the far corners of Canada, the network started broadcasting in September from studios in Yellowknife, where it supplanted a decade-old network that served only Inuit communities in the Arctic.
"Inuaraq teaches his son how to survive using the old ways: driving dogs, building igloos, catching seals in open water and running down caribou to feed the family," says the network program guide about "Dog Team," an Inuit, or Eskimo, show broadcast in English, the lingua franca of the large majority of Canada's indigenous peoples. About one-fourth of the programming is in one of about 18 aboriginal languages.
For young people, there is also "Spirit Bay," a half-hour drama told through the eyes of children who live in a village in the northern wilderness. The program guide summarizes, "Lives of trapping cabins and fishing boats, freezing winter storms and quiet summer afternoons."
For aboriginal peoples steeped in oral history traditions, there is "Storytime," English-language segments filmed at the Yukon International Storytelling Festival. For Inuit speakers of Inuktitut, there is "Kippinguijautit," described on the network Web site, www.aptn.ca, as "funny and interesting stories of traditional and contemporary Inuit ways of life."
Touching on political issues, the network has shown "Hunters and Bombers," a documentary on the fight by Labrador natives against low-level military flights over their homeland, and "Unfinished Business," about having the government live up to land treaties.
For perspective, the network has shown films on tribes in Brazil, Papua New-Guinea and the Philippines.
To ensure a high percentage of Canadian content, the broadcasting authority limits "foreign" shows on all stations. APTN is allowed 12 hours considered foreign out of the weekly broadcast of 120. But in the Indian world view, Mr. Compton said, the rule reinforces the artificial European division of North America, where Blackfoot, Dine, Mohawk, Ojibway and other tribes straddle the United States-Canada border. Speaking in a province with a sizable Ojibway population, Mr. Compton predicted that regulators would rule that a six-part series on the Ojibway of Minnesota was "foreign."
The network hopes to generate advertising revenue by telecasting programs intended to draw large white crossover audiences. This year, a weekly "blockbuster" film program will begin, with Gary Farmer, a Cayuga from Ontario who acted in the movie "Smoke Signals," as host. Popular programs shown include a music special by Buffy Ste. Marie, a Cree from Saskatchewan, and "Cooking With the Wolfman."
"I have had 14,000 hits on my Web site, a lot of queries about recipes," said the host, David Wolfman, a member of the Lillooet tribe of British Columbia. "People are liking the caribou and venison recipes. But we also have done vegetarian recipes."
In March, the network plans to start a regular native-affairs news program.
Mr. Compton, who worked for nine years here as a reporter for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the government-controlled network, added, "Our people do not trust the mainstream media to be forthcoming on these issues."
The national press has largely given a sympathetic welcome to the network, which under the terms of its approval by the federal licensing authority draws most of its $10 million annual budget from mandatory cable fees, $1.25 a year for each subscribing household. Although an Angus Reid poll in 1998 indicated that two-thirds of Canadians supported the concept of a national aboriginal network, some caustic press reviews reflect a deep racial and cultural divide among some Canadians.
"Only white liberals will watch the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network," headlined a column by Kevin Michael Grace in The Western Report, a conservative newsweekly.
Making cable customers support the network perpetuates "the stereotypes of Indians as people who must be given a handout to succeed," said The National Post, which is edited in Toronto and sells nationwide. "It also sends the message that a politically favored ethnic group can force its way into our living rooms and wallets."
Such comments fall flat in the APTN newsroom here. "Don't judge us with racist attitudes," said Mr. Compton, whose goal is rub out the old stereotypes of Indians as sidekicks or savages.

HEADLINE: Socialist Is Charting Middle Way For Chile

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile, Feb. 9

 BODY:
With a month to go before he becomes the first Socialist to lead Chile since Salvador Allende, President-elect Ricardo Lagos is showing a strong streak of independence from his party leadership and has appointed a relatively conservative, American-educated economic team that promises to keep down budget deficits and inflation.
Aware that his stature was diminished by a campaign that often lacked direction and by the narrowness of his victory last month, Mr. Lagos has worked hard to project a take-charge image. He has quickly appointed his cabinet and announced the broad outlines of an ambitious agenda that will focus on crime, housing and education. 
 He has broken new ground by appointing four women -- more than ever before -- to the cabinet, obliging senior aides to disclose their personal holdings as an anticorruption measure and promising to introduce a law that would limit campaign contributions and spending.
His governing style concentrates decision-making within a small circle of aides known more for their technical abilities than ideology. And he has shown that he will carefully balance the often contradictory demands of his varied constituencies, ranging from leftist Socialist Party stalwarts to the conservative business community.
Rising prices for copper -- Chile's primary export -- and a pick up of economic growth after a yearlong recession have come at just the right moment for Mr. Lagos. After he is inaugurated on March 11, he should be able to increase social spending without producing inflationary budget deficits or major new taxes.
In an article in the Santiago daily El Mercurio, a political writer, Blanca Arthur, said that Mr. Lagos, a 61-year-old lawyer and economist, "has shown that he is secure and confident in himself." She added, "He has shown the disposition to conduct presidential authority without submitting himself to party pressure."
In the days after his election, Mr. Lagos consulted with the leaders of the Christian Democratic and Socialist parties that constitute his governing coalition, but he ignored their preferences. His cabinet is heavily weighted with technocrats who are young and not closely tied to any party. In a clear act of revenge, he ignored the conservative wing of the Christian Democratic Party in his appointments after its leaders essentially sat out the campaign.
Before Mr. Lagos took off this week for a vacation at his country house outside Santiago, he announced almost a barrage of policy plans.
He said he would personally lead a stepped-up anticrime program that would coordinate the activities of the police with community groups and focus more attention on drug addiction. He pledged to set in motion a vast public housing program that would build one million units in 10 years to house every shantytown resident around the country. His appointed education minister, Mariana Aylwin, announced that the new government would make a major effort to reallocate resources to public schools serving rural and impoverished communities.
But just as Mr. Lagos distanced himself during the campaign from Dr. Allende, who was overthrown in a United States-backed military coup led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet in 1973, he has shown himself to be a moderate as president-elect.
Mr. Lagos has appointed two orthodox economists as his economy and finance ministers, mindful that business leaders and foreign investors would be watching. Jose de Gregorio, a conservative economist educated at M.I.T., will oversee energy, mining and fishing as economy minister. And Nicolas Eyzaguirre, a Harvard-trained economist, will step down as an executive director of the International Monetary Fund to take over the finance ministry.
In an interview with El Mercurio this week, Mr. Eyzaguirre said that after creating jobs, the major economic goal of the new government would be to create a budget surplus quickly. "This is fundamental to reaffirm the credibility Chile has in international markets," he said.
Mr. Lagos's most important cabinet appointment was of Jose Miguel Insulza, currently the chief of staff of President Eduardo Frei, as interior minister, a position that combines law enforcement and vice presidential duties. Mr. Insulza is a Socialist Party member, but his long defense of the government's attempts to block General Pinochet's extradition from Britain to Spain to stand trial on human rights charges has made him anathema to the party's leaders.
Still, the official who will most likely receive the most attention is Soledad Alvear, a former justice minister, who will be Mr. Lagos's foreign minister. A Christian Democrat, Ms. Alvear will fill the most senior political position of any woman in Chilean history, and she is already being talked about as a presidential contender in 2005.

HEADLINE: Administration Takes a Bow In Final Economic Report

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
With a technological revolution, low inflation and global integration in full swing, the current United States economic expansion, already the longest in American history, shows few signs of old age, President Clinton said in his administration's last annual survey of the economy.
In a 500-page report released today that mixed politics with an analysis of the country's record-breaking prosperity, the president's top economic advisers said a combination of deft fiscal management and a surge of entrepreneurial activity had made the current economic expansion not only the longest in history, but also by many measures the most unusual. 
 By the late stages of previous economic booms, in the 1960's and 1980's, inflation had surged, productivity had ebbed and income inequality had risen, the report said. But this expansion, which began in March 1991, has defied gravity, with inflation tame, productivity rising and the income gap narrowing after nearly a decade of growth.
"I don't know how long it can last, but the economic fundamentals look very good," said Martin N. Baily, chairman of Mr. Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. "As long as we stick to the fiscal policy we have there is no reason this shouldn't continue indefinitely."
The report updates projections on how fast the economy will grow this year and next. It predicts the economy will expand at a slightly slower rate of 2.9 percent this year, down from 4.2 percent in 1999, with growth of 2.6 percent in 2001, and no recession in sight.
The administration also adjusted its estimate of the rise in productivity, a measure of worker efficiency and a crucial determinant of the longevity of an expansion. The more each worker can produce in the same number of hours, the more the economy can expand without straining resources and igniting inflation, the thinking goes.
The report predicts that productivity growth will average 2.1 percent a year for each of the next four years, far higher than the 1.4 percent average for the period between 1973 and 1995, but slower than the average gains over the last couple of years.
Indeed, that estimate could be conservative, Mr. Baily said. Productivity actually grew at a 5 percent rate in the final half of last year. If that were to keep up, then the overall economy could probably grow much faster -- perhaps at almost 4 percent a year -- without serious risk of inflation, he said.
Economists are sharply divided on whether Mr. Clinton, or any president, for that matter, does much to influence the overall direction of the economy. To the extent that the widespread use of computers, the growth of the Internet and the stock market surge have powered the economy, for example, the administration's fingerprints are barely visible.
But the report contends that Mr. Clinton deserves credit for what it calls two of the most important ingredients of today's strong economy: a sharp improvement in the financial condition of the federal government and the sizable increase in the role of trade.
"The expansion has been the result of a complementary set of developments in policy and in the private sector," the report said. "Rapid technological change has occurred in an economy that is more globalized than ever."
When Mr. Clinton took office, the federal government was deeply in debt and adding to the red ink in huge annual chunks. Today, the government is running a hefty surplus and paying down the national debt for the first time in decades. That reversal has freed hundreds of billions of dollars for investment in more productive sectors, the report says.
The sound economy and the resulting rise in tax revenues have a good deal to do with that, of course. But some economists outside of government agree that Mr. Clinton deserves a tip of the hat.
"Government spending declined as a share of the economy during his term," said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. "There was a surge in tax revenue, it's true. But in another era, it could have been frittered away."
Another engine of the economy has been globalization. Trade -- the sum of exports and imports -- accounts for a greater share of economic activity today than at any time since the turn of the last century, the report says. Moreover, the flow of capital among nations has exploded in the 1990's.
Credit Mr. Clinton's push for market-opening initiatives around the world, the White House argued. Mr. Clinton persuaded Congress to ratify free trade agreements with Mexico and Canada and helped usher in the creation of the World Trade Organization during his tenure. The seeds for both those achievements were laid in the Reagan and Bush administrations, the report acknowledges, but final credit for making them a reality goes to Mr. Clinton, it says.
The report notes two less rosy indicators, either of which could eventually contribute to the next recession. Private households are spending lots of money now based on expectations of future earnings and a continuing run-up in stock prices, the report says. That could foreshadow a sharp reduction in consumption if the stock market slumps.
The United States is also running a record trade deficit with the rest of the world. Long term, the deficit threatens the strength of the dollar and the reliance on cheap imports and capital from abroad to help fuel the domestic economy.

HEADLINE: Jamaican Fishermen's Tainted Boom: Rising Trade in Cocaine

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: YALLAHS, Jamaica, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Gordon, a villager whose family has been fishing the waters off Jamaica's southeastern coast for generations, needed a little extra cash. So one day last year, another fisherman introduced him to a local cocaine smuggler.
Gordon became a bit player in a growth industry. In his 18-foot boat, he makes regular pickups at prearranged spots a few miles offshore. Occasionally he is called at the last minute to pluck floating packets from the sea when they are jettisoned by traffickers spotted by American and Jamaican coast guard patrols. 
 It is dangerous work -- but very tempting in a land where times are hard and hopes are scant.
"Fishing can't send my kids to school. Fishing can't buy a new motor for my boat," said Gordon, who spoke openly about his activities but refused to give his full name for fear of being arrested.
Smuggling cocaine has more than doubled his income, Gordon said, sipping rum at a seaside bar and talking about the $15,000, 45-horsepower Yamaha engine that now graces his boat. While local residents refused to discuss Gordon specifically, they confirmed that cocaine-smuggling by fishermen is widespread.
"I hear it happens all up and down the coast," said Reddy Gilson, 32. "This kind of thing is hard to keep secret. One man shows up with money, new shoes, new clothes, more money than he had before, and everyone knows where he got it from."
Jean-Luc Lemahieu, manager of the Barbados-based United Nations program to fight drugs in the Caribbean, said the phenomenon is rather new in Jamaica. "Up to two or three years ago, the impression was that Jamaica's major problem was marijuana," he said.
Colombian traffickers began routing more shipments through Jamaica -- as well as Haiti -- as American authorities clamped down on smuggling through Puerto Rico and as enforcement improved in the Dominican Republic, Mr. Lemahieu said.
Jamaica, about halfway between Colombia and Florida and offering a well-established network of gangs as allies, is an attractive alternate transit point.
"Where we used to see maybe one boatload of cocaine a week, we're now seeing three to four boatloads of cocaine, each weighing" 800 to 1,800 pounds, said Beres Spence, head of Jamaica's police narcotics division. "Traffickers can access every inch of our shoreline, but it would be impossible for us to cover every inch."
Mr. Spence and foreign analysts estimate that at most a fifth of the cocaine passing through Jamaica is intercepted. A record 5,500 pounds was seized last year, more than double the amount of the year before. .
Only a small amount of the cocaine is consumed by the local market, where a kilogram, 2.2 pounds, fetches $6,000. Most is smuggled to the United States, where the same amount sells for $20,000.
With unemployment running officially at 15 percent -- in reality much higher -- finding "mules" to carry the drugs is easy. More than a thousand Jamaicans -- out of a population of 2.6 million -- were arrested for possession of cocaine in the past two years, and most were also charged with trying to export the drug, the police say.
The extent of Jamaica's role is summed up by one statistic: according to the United States Customs Service, 64 percent of those arrested for cocaine smuggling at American airports between October 1998 and September 1999 were coming from Jamaica, though not all were Jamaican.

HEADLINE: Online Fingerpointing Finds Suspects Everywhere

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Lacking information about who has been attacking some of the biggest sites on the Internet, cyberkibitzers have been busy nominating suspects in chat rooms, electronic bulletin boards and mass e-mailings.
Teenage hackers, the government, foreign terrorists and the owners of the Web sites themselves are mentioned repeatedly as having ideological or economic motives for overwhelming various sites with traffic, thus denying service to millions trying to use them. And while hackers were the main suspects in most published reports, it was the federal government that raised eyebrows in the chat rooms. 
 "Maybe it will turn out to be a couple of 12-year-olds in a basement somewhere and maybe it won't," said Michael Sims, one of many at www.slashdot.org suggesting that the media investigate possible government involvement. "The national security apparatus of the United States has the means, motive, and opportunity to have done this."
That motive, several said, would be to bolster the Clinton administration's request for more money to counter illegal Internet activity.
But some fancied that powerful private-sector forces might also be at work. Wall Street analysts, always ready to see everything through the lens of trading, passed around rumors that those jamming the sites had shorted the stock of the companies first. Short-sellers borrow and sell stock when they anticipate bad news, expecting to buy the shares back after prices decline.
And, of course, some posters could not resist anonymously blaming William H. Gates, the man whose power and wealth as chairman of Microsoft inspires as much envy as admiration.
"Maybe little Billy Gates has a NEW product under wraps that will protect all those poor e-businesses," said one such submission to the Time Bomb 2000 discussion group on Lusenet at www.greenspun.com.
A posting signed Mad Monk offered a rebuttal that was not exactly a defense: "I doubt that Microsoft has sufficiently good security products to halt the denial of service."
Mad Monk continued, "My personal suspicions are foreign nationals, possibly with some covert foreign government support," only to be rebuked by "kritter," who said, "Just don't forget, there really ARE roving bands of idiot kids who live to do stuff just like this." Kritter's conclusion: "This is the work of bored teenagers, moronic Hacks, plain and simple."
Postings that dismissed the likelihood of hackers said the interference did not actually require serious enough hacking skills to make it attractive to those who break into computer systems for thrills. "Hackers to Blame? Doubtful" read the headline on an editorial at www.2600.com, the site for a company that publishes a magazine for hackers.
The editorial speculates that the attack could have come from "someone who lost their life savings to electronic commerce," communists, and the government. Then there is "corporate America itself", the editorial says. "After all, who would be better served by a further denigration of the hacker image with more restrictions on individual liberties?"
Amid the cynicism, one optimist in an America Online discussion suggested that if the reports that hackers were at work turned out to be true, "Those who 'control' the Internet" could, among other things, "set up a series of Web sites specifically for the hackers, with challenging twists, turns, keys, and codes, well fortified and harmless, for their enjoyment and as a kind of contest between them."
Such sites, the posting suggested, could be monitored and used to "recruit the most talented hackers and mainstream them into the system with lucrative rewards and great jobs."

HEADLINE: Fake Auto Inspection Stickers Lead to Arrest of 2 Merchants

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, Feb. 10

 BODY:
All the problems with New Jersey's new motor vehicle inspection system have suited Rafael Ottenwalder and Jesus Valle just fine, the police say.
Mr. Ottenwalder, 44, owns a bodega here, and Mr. Valle, 57, operates a tire shop. And at each place, detectives said today, the two men operated a black market in fake or stolen automobile inspection stickers and counterfeit auto insurance identification cards. Business has been brisk in the weeks since December, when the new, more stringent inspection system went into service, contributing to long waits for drivers and sometimes damaging cars, the detectives said. 
 "There seems to have been a drastic increase in the sticker sales since the new system started," said Sgt. Walter G. Kierce, commander of the Jersey City Police Department special investigations unit. "Some people have been waiting on inspection lines four, five and six hours, and if you have to take a day off from work to do that, some probably figure it's cheaper to buy illegal stickers.
Police Chief William Thynne said the street value of fraudulent stickers has tripled since the new inspection system started faltering. In some cases, Chief Thynne said, they are selling for $200 on the street here.
Detectives in Sergeant Kierce's unit raided the bodega and the tire shop and arrested both men on Wednesday on charges of forgery and possession of stolen or fictitious documents. Detectives learned about the suspected black markets while investigating a stolen-car ring, Chief Thynne said. Just before the raids, undercover officers bought an inspection sticker at Mr. Valle's tire shop for $45 and a counterfeit insurance card for $40, Sergeant Kierce said. At Mr. Ottenwalder's bodega, an undercover purchase involved 10 stickers for $100, he said.
During the raids, Chief Thynne said, detectives confiscated 249 fraudulent stickers and 108 counterfeit insurance cards at Mr. Ottenwalder's and 25 fake stickers and 113 counterfeit insurance cards at Mr. Valle's.
Detectives displayed the confiscated stickers and insurance cards at a news conference today. To the untrained eye, most of the inspection stickers appear identical to legitimate stickers.
Sergeant Kierce said state police detectives would be called in to examine them. "Possibly, some are stolen and some are counterfeit," he said. "If they are phonies, they are very, very good copies."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Falls 55.53 Points, But Nasdaq Keeps Soaring

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq composite index soared to a record yesterday while blue-chip stocks once again lagged, pulled down by persistent worries that their earnings were not growing fast enough to offset rising interest rates.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 122.39 points, to 4,485.63. It was the fourth closing high in five sessions for the index, topping Tuesday's record of 4,427.50. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 55.53 points, to 10,643.63, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 5.13 points, to 1,416.83.
The technology shares that dominate the Nasdaq rose as investors determined that their powerful earnings growth puts them in the best position to thrive even if interest rates move higher later this year.
"Investors are seeking out the biggest earnings gains," said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment strategist at Gruntal & Company in New York. "The companies in the Nasdaq are probably going to grow their earnings 30 percent this year, while the companies in the S.& P. 500 will probably see 13.5 percent growth."
Investors are scrambling toward the fastest-growing companies on concerns that the Federal Reserve will continue raising interest rates in its effort to cool the economy enough to ward off inflation. Four modest increases since June have done little to slow economic growth.
Higher rates can cut into corporate profits. In recent sessions, investors have punished old-line industrial stocks much more than high-technology shares, wagering that their slower growth rates will be especially endangered by rising rates. Yesterday, Merck, down 2 3/8, to 69, and Minnesota Mining, down 1 5/8, to 86, led the Dow lower.
Also, DuPont fell 2 5/8, to 54 1/16, and Procter & Gamble fell 2 59/16, to 91 7/16.
On the Nasdaq, earnings were a catalyst for buying. MCI WorldCom rose 1 11/16, to 49 13/16, after reporting that fourth-quarter profits nearly tripled from the final quarter of 1998 because of strong growth in its Internet and data services businesses.
Also, Dell Computer rose 3 15/64, to 38 51/64. The company, considered a bellwether for the technology industry, released its latest earnings report after the regular close of trading, beating Wall Street expectations by a penny a share. In after-hours trading, shares of Dell traded as low as 37 3/4. The stock has lost about a quarter of its value this year.
Internet stocks were mostly lower a day after hackers disrupted several popular Web sites. Amazon.com fell 4 1/16, to 76 3/16, and the online auctioneer eBay fell 1 5/8, to 162 3/8.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: EDUCATION PLAN;
McCain Attacks Unions And Vows Better Schools

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: SPARTANBURG, S.C., Feb. 10

 BODY:
Repeatedly attacking teachers unions and "self-serving union bosses," Senator John McCain called today for an experimental program of school vouchers, for merit pay for teachers and for judges who would allow voluntary prayer and the posting of the Ten Commandments in schools.
Mr. McCain's proposals were set out in an education speech in which he said the nation must "insist on high academic standards" but left it up to the states to devise them. 
 "Some believe that educational standards should be established by the federal government," Mr. McCain said. "I do not. Education must remain under the control of state and local authority that is closer and more responsive to the needs of parents and students. States are better able to develop appropriate standards than a one size fits all."
Though he has been a maverick on issues like campaign finance or tax-cutting, Mr. McCain stood squarely with the Republican Party on education, calling for a sharp reduction in federal regulations, no federal standards and for an experimental program of school vouchers. While he spoke of local accountability, he gave no indication of how he would measure or enforce it.
Gov. George W. Bush, Mr. McCain's chief rival for the Republican presidential nomination, has proposed a loosening of federal education regulations, but he would require in return that states conduct annual testing of elementary and middle school students. He would use a system of incentives and punishment for lack of performance.
Mr. McCain's education speech had once been scheduled to be delivered before the New Hampshire primary and was then postponed. Mr. Bush's supporters had pointed to Mr. McCain's failure to give a full-scale education address as a sign that he was not serious about a domestic issue at the top of voters' concerns.
And today the Bush camp called Mr. McCain's proposals insufficient to turn around poor student performance. The plan, said Scott McClellan, a Bush spokesman, "has no accountability and continues to allow federal dollars to follow failure."
"Governor Bush," Mr. McClellan said, "has shown in Texas that real education reform must include real accountability."
Little in Mr. McCain's speech today was new, and few details were provided. Mr. McCain had already called for a three-year, $5.5 billion test of school vouchers for one million students and for some kind of merit pay for teachers. For the first time time, he said he would create a $500 million annual federal block grant program for teacher testing and merit pay, leaving it to states to decide how to use the money.
Mr. McCain used his school voucher proposal to try to center himself between Mr. Bush and Vice President Al Gore.
"Governor Bush and I have a serious difference of opinion on school choice," Mr. McCain said, saying his voucher program would not use already existing public school money but money obtained by closing corporate tax loopholes that help the sugar, oil and gas and ethanol industries.
Mr. Bush has proposed that economically disadvantaged students who are supposed to be helped under the federal Title 1 program be given a voucher option to switch schools if schools have failing programs that they cannot reverse in three years.
Mr. McCain noted that Mr. Gore opposed vouchers, asserting that "he defends the status quo and reaps the money, the organization and the votes of entrenched interests."
There was no mistaking whom Mr. McCain was calling an entrenched interest. Time and again he attacked teachers unions.
"At the beginning of this new century," he said, "it's time to break the grip of the education monopoly that serves the union bosses at the expense of our children."
Mr. McCain also set himself apart from both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore because he would wrap most federal education money into a block grant to the states, whereas, he said, "they would continue to use federal funds to require local communities to meet federally approved standards and they would continue to allow bureaucrats to determine how federal funds should be spent."
Mr. McCain said he would "insist that this money makes it to the classroom and is not diverted to bureaucrats -- and that accountability is measured not in federal paperwork, but by improved performance."
When Mr. McCain was asked at a news conference afterward about what guarantees there would be of performance, Lisa Graham Keegan, Arizona's superintendent of public instruction, who was accompanying him, tried to jump in to answer the question for him. But Mr. McCain said, "If the student performance goes down, all those people will be thrown out of office by their voters." He was apparently referring to state officials and school boards.
He also pledged to nominate judges "who don't divine from our Constitution nonexistent prohibitions on basic rights" including posting the Ten Commandments and reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Investors ShunAuction of U.S. Bonds, Causing Yields to Jump

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
For several weeks, the Treasury bond market has been whipsawed by uncertainty associated with the government's plan to buy back some publicly held long-term debt with the budget surplus. There have been sharp daily moves, then reversals a day later. And traders say that they have often been on the wrong side of the action, causing painful losses for some.
Yesterday, Wall Street dealers and traders indicated that they had had enough. They shunned the Treasury's auction of $10 billion in new 30-year bonds, leaving the government with the least demand ever at such a sale. "People didn't want the risk of participating because they didn't know where it would come out," said Louis Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson Associates. 
 Those results, and growing frustration over the signals from the Treasury -- even though some have been misinterpreted -- sent Treasury prices tumbling while yields, which move in the opposite direction, shot higher.
In recent weeks, the yield on the 30-year bond, which is usually higher than that on short-term securities to entice investors, has fallen below that of the two-year note. Then yesterday the spread between the yield on the two-year note and the 30-year bond narrowed sharply, giving the bond market another sudden jolt.
The yield on the new 30-year bond, which was auctioned at 6.34 percent, finished at 6.32 percent, well up from the 6.17 percent Wednesday in the so-called when-issued market. The yield on the old 30-year bond jumped to 6.43 percent from 6.31 percent, while the price fell 1 12/32, to 96 1/32.
The yield on the two-year note rose to 6.65 percent from 6.63 percent Wednesday. On Tuesday, the yield on the two-year note was 6.67 percent, while the yield on the new 30-year bond was 6.10 percent, a spread of just over half a percentage point. That spread has now narrowed to a third of a percentage point.
These swift and costly swings are a result of the distortions that have occurred in the market since the Treasury confirmed on Jan. 13 that it would be buying back longer-term debt. The yield on the 10-year note has also been distorted as investment firms indicated that Wall Street would replace the 30-year bond as the market benchmark.
The distortions intensified last Wednesday, when a few more details about the buybacks were announced along with the news that the amount of the new 30-year bond offering, being sold yesterday and in May, would be much smaller than expected. The prospect of limited supply led to panic buying last Thursday. As the price rose, the yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.13 percent, from 6.28 percent Wednesday and then jumped back up to 6.26 percent on Friday.
Dealers say these swings produced big losses, but no one is owning up to them so far.
Before a Treasury auction, dealers on Wall Street usually go short the issue to be sold -- that is, in this case, they sell 30-year bonds they own to make room for the ones they expect to buy when they bid in the auction. This assures that they do not wind up with more than they want.
But because so many dealers wanted nothing to to with the new 30-year bond, they did not go short ahead of the auction, traders said. They then made very weak bids in the auction, leaving the bonds to insurance companies and pension funds that need them for investing and money management purposes.
This meant that the new bond's yield soared. Just before the bidding closed, the yield in the when-issued market was 6.24 percent and the yield at the auction was 6.34 percent.
"People didn't feel confident going short," said Charles Parkhurst, managing director for government bond trading at Salomon Smith Barney, explaining that dealers just did not want to risk being short 30-year bonds if the price suddenly took off again and they did not want the new bond either.
N. Graham Allen, managing director for global fixed income at Wells Capital Management in Los Angeles, said he was not interested in the new 30-year bond because the trading distortions had sent the yield down too low and "we couldn't see what was going to maintain that."
Adding to the confusion yesterday were comments made on Wednesday by Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers. Many investors took his remarks as a signal that the Treasury would also buy back shorter-term securities, leaving many investors to conclude that the 30-year bond was not so special after all. Although the Treasury indicated this interpretation was wrong and that the buybacks would be of long-term securities, investors sold the 30-year bond Wednesday, pushing the yield up.
But the flight from the 30-year bond may not be so bad. Mr. Crandall said the two-day sell-off was unwinding some of the distortions that had racked the bond market.

HEADLINE: Dell Computer Posts Profit That Meets Lower Forecast

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Feb. 10

 BODY:
The Dell Computer Corporation reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income yesterday that matched the sharply lowered expectations of investors.
The personal computer manufacturer, based in Round Rock, Tex., said net income in the period, which ended Jan. 28, rose to $436 million, or 16 cents a diluted share, from $425 million, or 15 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. 
 The numbers, which included a special gain of one cent a share, matched Wall Street's recently revised consensus estimates.
But the results were far short of the 21 cents per share that Wall Street had been anticipating before the company said on Jan. 26 that earnings would be hurt by a component shortage and by what the company called the failure of corporate customers to step up purchases after worries about the Year 2000 computer problem had subsided.
Dell said revenue for the quarter was $6.8 billion, a 31 percent increase from $5.17 billion a year earlier and slightly higher than what Dell officials had forecast last month. However, it, too, was far lower than what Wall Street had expected before the company's warning.
Dell, which pioneered direct selling of personal computers, said sales through its Web site approached half of revenue, and, by the end of the quarter, were averaging $40 million a day, up from $14 million a year ago.
In regular Nasdaq trading yesterday, Dell shares rose $3.23, to $38.80, but they slipped back to $37.88 in after-hours trading. Dell announced its earnings after the 4 p.m. close of regular trading.
Despite the stock's 9.1 percent gain yesterday on another record-setting day for the Nasdaq, Dell shares have fallen 4.8 percent in the last three months, compared with a gain of 51.2 percent for the Nasdaq index. Some analysts say investors are beginning to recognize that Dell's days of 50-percent-or-better growth are gone for good.
Dell executives have said they expect revenue to grow in the low-30-percent range this fiscal year -- a huge number, for sure, that would give Dell annual sales of more than $33 billion. But that follows 38 percent year-over-year growth for the just-completed fiscal year, and growth of 50 percent, or more, in the prior years.
Charles Wolf, an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read who lowered his rating on Dell from buy to hold earlier this week, said he was concerned that Dell had reached the point that it may be impossible for it to ever enjoy the sort of growth it had in the past.
"The kind of levitating growth rates we've seen in the past just aren't possible any more," Mr. Wolf said, in part because the company has grown so large. But he also said Dell's rivals were becoming more competitive on direct sales. For example, the Compaq Computer Corporation, the big Houston PC maker that stumbled badly last year and lost its lead in domestic sales to Dell, announced plans last month to increase its direct sales.
In an interview, Michael S. Dell, the company's founder and chief executive, said it was not feasible to believe the company could consistently post the sort of growth of past years, now that it has annual revenue of more than $25 billion. "Let's say $25 billion grows 40 percent a year. After 5 to 10 years, it has become bigger than the whole economy," Mr. Dell said. "Certainly as we approach a higher share of the market, our growth rate will look more and more like the market's growth rate."
But he added, "We're still growing at two to three times the market's growth rate, and there are new markets for us to expand into."
He also said that results for the first fiscal quarter this year would not be much better than what the company released yesterday. "We don't expect that the first-quarter bottom line will be considerably different than the fourth quarter," he said.

HEADLINE: New Airline To Emphasize More Flights For Upstate

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

 BODY:
The nation's newest discount airline, JetBlue Airlines, is to begin operations today out of its new home base at Kennedy International Airport with flights that, among other things, seek to ease air travel to an underserved upstate New York market.
With its first flight taking off from Buffalo and flying to Kennedy and then on to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., JetBlue is to inaugurate a service that its president, David Barger, said would eventually send 100 flights a day to more than 30 cities in the eastern two-thirds of the country. 
 In its first month of service, the startup airline will charge $25 one way between Buffalo and Kennedy, and thereafter as little as $98 round trip depending on travel time. Other scheduled airlines charge as much as $600 for a round-trip ticket between Buffalo and New York.
Mr. Barger said the airline hoped that travelers would be lured by a number of features not normally associated with the cattle-car image of discount flying.
The airline is emphasizing the greater leg room on its 162-passenger Airbus A-320 planes, which include all-leather seats and television monitors at each seat back with 24 channels to choose from, as well as the less-crowded traffic at J.F.K. compared with Newark and La Guardia Airports.
"It may take longer to get down the Van Wyck Expressway to get to us," Mr. Barger said, "but once you get here you are not going to be No. 18 in line on the tarmac to take off."
The start-up of the airline, which with $130 million is said by analysts to be among the best capitalized new airline ventures since the 1950's, comes as the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, proposed a $650 million plan to improve airports around the state to increase air service to Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and other upstate cities.
Mr. Bruno and others have long criticized the high fares and lack of service to upstate cities, calling them factors in the region's stunted economy.
JetBlue expects to be serving Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse within 18 months, Mr. Barger said. Its entry into that market was made possible by a waiver that federal transportation officials granted to Kennedy late last year, lifting restrictions on the number of takeoffs from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m.
Kennedy, along with La Guardia, O'Hare in Chicago and Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, are the only airports in the country where the Federal Aviation Administration restricts the number of flights to limit congestion in the airways.
William R. DeCota, director of aviation for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates Kennedy and La Guardia, said that the waivers were granted after pressure from Senator Charles E. Schumer, Gov. George E. Pataki and members of New York's Congressional delegation.
Mr. DeCota noted that Kennedy had plenty of underutilized capacity in the morning hours since most of its international flights arrived and departed in the afternoon and evening. JetBlue, he said, wanted to run domestic flights during those peak hours when the F.A.A. limited traffic so that it could get the maximum use and efficiency out of its fleet of new Airbuses.
Flying those new planes up to 12 hours a day is one of the factors that Mr. Barger said would allow the airline to offer the lower prices. Another factor, he said, was the Kennedy location, which put the airline close to a potential market of air travelers that had four million more people than were close by La Guardia and Newark.
Mr. Schumer and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani are to be among the airline's first passengers out of Buffalo today and are to participate in an inaugural ceremony at Kennedy.
Adam Whiteman, a senior vice president of Moody's Investors Service, said that while airline start-ups are risky ventures, JetBlue seemed better capitalized than others and, unlike other discount carriers, was starting off with new planes rather than older, used planes, which require more maintenance. Among the backers of the airline, which was founded by David Neeleman, are the financier George Soros's Quantum Fund, Weston Presidio Capital and Chase Capital.
"All of this makes them a little different than other start-up, discount carriers," Mr. Whiteman said. "It will be interesting to see if they can expand the market for air travel to their destinations."

HEADLINE: A Toast to Larry Summers, Bond Salesmanof the Year

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
LARRY SUMMERS is taking heat for the way he has handled the bond market. I say it's a bum rap. He just saved the taxpayers a billion dollars while leaving Wall Street baffled. He is the salesman of the year.
Consider the situation the Treasury secretary found himself in three weeks ago. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds had climbed to 6.75 percent, and the market value of such bonds was down 9 percent in just two months. Sentiment indicators showed that investors disliked bonds more than at any time since 1987. 
 It was the Treasury's job to sell bonds into that market. With sentiment like that, Mr. Summers faced a daunting task. It's not easy to sell something that the buyers have come to hate.
So what did Mr. Summers do? He put on a dazzling display of fakes and feints that would have made Michael Jordan proud. Suddenly, Wall Street seers who hated bonds came to love them, and there was talk about a shortage of bonds. Then Mr. Summers seemed to switch gears this week and hint that maybe the government wouldn't be buying back as many long Treasuries as he had indicated.
He left Wall Street traders stumbling and gasping for air. Some of them are mad. A few weeks ago, they were happily selling bonds short -- only to get ambushed by Mr. Summers. So yesterday they bought bonds in advance of the 30-year auction, secure in the knowledge that demand would be huge and prices would rise after the auction. They lost money again, and they blamed Mr. Summers.
The reality here is that the supply of Treasury bonds is not a very important issue for the long term. Anyone who fears that there won't be enough bonds to go around hasn't paid much attention to corporate America, which has been eagerly issuing bonds. But Mr. Summers managed to get a much better rate for the Treasury. It paid 6.34 percent at yesterday's auction, down from the recent market rate of 6.75 percent. Taxpayers will save $1.4 billion in interest payments over the life of the bonds.
The real issue on interest rates remains the same as it was before Mr. Summers faked out Wall Street. As Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company, noted, Alan Greenspan has made it clear that short-term rates "are going to go up until the economy slows down."
Two questions remain: How long will it take for that medicine to have the intended effect? Will the slowdown turn into a recession? If a recession were coming, you would expect long-term interest rates to fall even as short-term ones were rising, which is just what has happened.
Of course, you'd also expect the stock market to fall if a recession was likely, and the Nasdaq composite hits new highs almost every day. But the strength of the technology stocks that dominate major indexes has obscured general weakness. The Morgan Stanley index of cyclical stocks -- companies that generally prosper in a booming economy and suffer in a weak one -- is down 17 percent in three weeks. Most bank stocks are lower than they were during the 1998 scare over Asian and Russian collapses. The Dow has fallen 9 percent in four weeks.
That kind of stock market action is not what you would expect if the economy is destined to stay as healthy as almost everyone thinks it is. Perhaps the stock market will soon reverse, and the longest period of economic growth in American history will continue. If not, it may turn out that long-term interest rates were going to fall soon even without the help of Mr. Summers's brilliant salesmanship.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Mr. Bush's Homework

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
The Times Op-Ed page sponsored a forum yesterday for people to give advice to George W. Bush on how to reinvigorate his campaign. I'm a day late, but here's my entry:
The first thing Governor Bush needs to grasp is the context of his campaign. He should consider just a few facts: 
 1. When Bill Clinton was elected president seven years ago there were 50 pages on the World Wide Web. Today there are over 50 million.
2. In 1992 no one had heard of e-commerce. This year retail e-commerce alone in the U.S. will hit $50 billion -- all of it untaxed, which is starting to drive mayors and governors crazy, because they're losing their tax base. The original Boston Tea Party was colonists throwing tea into the harbor under the motto "No taxation without representation." The new Boston e-party will be mayors and governors throwing Internet servers into the harbor under the motto "No representation without taxation."
3. The three biggest foreign relationships the U.S. has today -- with Japan, Russia and China -- have all been turned upside down, as all three countries go through the painful adjustment to globalization. While U.S. foreign policy in the cold war was about how to manage the military strength of Russia and China and the economic strength of Japan, today U.S. foreign policy is about how to manage the weakness of Russia, China and Japan. The old security agenda has been inverted, and with cyber-vandals disrupting Yahoo, eBay, E-Trade and Amazon.com, who knows what new threats are emerging?
In other words, the whole context for this campaign is that we are now in a period of radical change, possibly more sweeping and complex than in any period since 1776-1789. While the candidates are not talking about it, many voters feel it. And this leads to Governor Bush's biggest problem -- that many wonder whether he is up to managing this complexity.
You remember that silly picture of Michael Dukakis riding in a tank, with an ill-fitting helmet on his head, in the 1988 campaign? That picture helped to destroy Mr. Dukakis's chances because, at the height of the cold war with Russia, who could vote for someone who looked so dopey in military headgear? Well, the dunce cap is to this presidential campaign what that Army helmet was to the 1988 campaign. Any candidate who looks too comfortable in a dunce cap has a real problem today.
George W. is not a dunce, but he has not exactly demonstrated that he is a master of complexity, and that is a particular liability in this campaign. Voters look for one of two things in a candidate: convictions or capabilities. Ronald Reagan was not the smartest president, but he conveyed strong convictions about the biggest issue of his day -- how to confront the Soviet Union -- and people connected with that on a gut level. So much so that they gave Mr. Reagan the freedom to pursue a nuanced, far-reaching arms control policy toward Moscow. President Bush was not ideologically consistent, but his curiosity and instincts made him extraordinarily capable at managing the complexities of ending the cold war.
What hampers George W. Bush today is a gnawing sense that he has neither the convictions nor curiosities to cope with this new world. (But beware John McCain: he may have too much conviction about the cold-war foreign policy, and be too quick to invade in all the wrong places.) George W. doesn't convey any sense that he understands the period of radical change we are entering, or has any big ideas -- other than a big tax cut -- for how to deal with it.
He also has another problem: We all know him, or at least we think we do, because we all went to high school with him. We all had a kid in our high school class -- the charming, pampered goof-off, the one you let peek at your homework -- whom you loved for fraternity president, but not student council president.
A president doesn't need to be a genius to be successful, if he has strong convictions relevant to his times. A president doesn't need to have strong convictions to be successful, if he has capabilities relevant to his times. But in a period of radical change, a president must have one or the other. If George W. is to survive, he must prove that he indeed has one or the other, that we really don't know him, and that he really isn't just copying his advisers' homework.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
A Yankee in Europe's Court?

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Airbus aircraft are strange birds.
Their wings are made in Britain, their bodies in Germany and parts of their tail assemblies in Spain. They are put together at a factory in southern France. Yet this cosmopolitan creature has become a symbol of the challenge facing Boeing, Airbus's lone remaining rival. 
 In recent years, Airbus has clawed its way to roughly half the world market for commercial jetliners, often evoking a mixture of aggression and disdain from Boeing.
Yet to orchestrate this remarkable feat, Airbus has relied largely on a cheery 49-year-old native of Rockville Centre, N.Y.
Of course, that man, John J. Leahy, senior vice president for sales at Airbus Industrie, does not see it as a one-man show. He stresses the size of his sales team, the 500 people stretching from brochure designers to finance experts, and the company's seven sales regions, including North America, Europe, China and the old Soviet Union.
In recent years, as America pioneered deregulation, European airlines have often turned to American executives to transplant a rough-and-tumble spirit to Europe. Jeffrey G. Katz, a former American Airlines executive, is chief executive of Swissair. Frederick W. Reid, another American Air veteran, was president of Lufthansa before leaving last year to become chief of marketing at Delta. Three years ago, when British Airways started a no-frills carrier, Go Fly Ltd., it hired an American, Barbara Cassani, to run it.
In part, Mr. Leahy has benefited from an industry consolidation. With Boeing's 1997 acquisition of its rival McDonnell Douglas, the field has essentially been reduced to two, Boeing and Airbus.
Yet Mr. Leahy's remarkable rise is also a result of deregulation. As head of the Airbus division in North America in the 1980's, when deregulation unleashed competition and forced airlines to examine their cash flows, Mr. Leahy convinced many airlines that buying an Airbus was more economical over the long haul than buying a Boeing. In the 1990's, as deregulation lapped across the Atlantic, he brought that pitch to Europe, where Airbus was already strong.
His scorecard is impressive. In 1995, his first full year as global head of sales, Airbus booked 106 orders, against 468 for Boeing. Last year, though Boeing continued to turn out roughly twice as many planes, Airbus had signed orders for 476 planes, against 391 for Boeing. By now, the companies' order backlogs are roughly equal -- about 1,500 each.
And as the European partners that control Airbus seek to transform it into an independent company and start its biggest project ever, a 550-seat superjumbo jet, Airbus's thirst for private capital is growing sharply. Increasingly, Mr. Leahy has assumed the role of Airbus ambassador, intensifying a practice he began not long after moving to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, in the south of France, of explaining the company's strategy to international investors and analysts.
Thanks to his success, few airlines remain all-Boeing. One is the Israeli airline, El Al, and Mr. Leahy's efforts to change that illustrate the challenges he and Airbus often face.
After Mr. Leahy and his team briefed El Al pilots and executives and flew an A330 to Israel for a demonstration, the board of El Al, which wanted to expand its long-range fleet, voted in October to purchase new Boeing 777's and Airbus A330's.
The sales effort was out of all proportion to the size of the deal, which was worth about $400 million, an amount Airbus often books in a single month. Yet the victory had symbolic importance. Israeli economic dependence on the United States had made El Al reluctant to buy planes anywhere but in America. If El Al bought Airbus, the reasoning went, it would have to be because Airbus was better.
In December, however, after extensive lobbying by American officials, including Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, Israel froze the decision pending a review by the government, which controls El Al.
Mr. Leahy "staked a lot of his reputation on convincing El Al to buy Airbus," said Jim Frank, the Boeing sales representative responsible for trying to secure the deal. "I'm glad to say he didn't win it."
Mr. Frank has never met Mr. Leahy, but "based on hearsay," he said in an interview, Mr. Leahy is "a real charmer, a smooth talker." El Al executives, Mr. Frank said, told him "they had never met a better marketer and salesman."
Nachman Kleiman, the El Al spokesman, who saw Mr. Leahy in action, described him as "very personable," and added: "I would buy a used car from the man. You have a sense of trust. And cars don't cost over $100 million." The Airbus deal, he said, was suspended until the Israeli government decided whether "El Al can buy and pay for the planes."
Mr. Leahy said he remained confident that El Al would stick to the deal and chided the State Department for its interference, accusing American officials of "forgetting all their lectures on free trade."
Boeing's ultimate weapon, of course, would be to hire Mr. Leahy away. Yet Mr. Frank said he was not aware Boeing had ever sought to do so. In the early 1990's, McDonnell Douglas tried, asking through a headhunter whether Mr. Leahy would become senior vice president for marketing at its Douglas aircraft division. Mr. Leahy declined.
Mr. Leahy's mix of entrepreneurial flair and a passion for flight became evident early on, when he earned his pilot's and flight instructor's licenses after graduating from Fordham University. While working toward an M.B.A. at Syracuse University, Mr. Leahy flew cargo planes four nights a week from Syracuse to Chicago to help pay tuition. (He stopped flying seven years ago, when he was unable to fly the 50 to 100 hours a year he feels are necessary to fly safely.) After getting his degree, he joined Piper Aircraft in Pennsylvania. In 1985, at age 34, he was hired by Airbus of North America.
By the mid-1980's, efforts by Airbus to crack the North American market had stalled, with few orders after a big sale to Eastern Airlines, now defunct, in the late 1970's.
To this day, executives involved in hiring Mr. Leahy marvel at his doggedness. "He would not take no for an answer," said Alan S. Boyd, a former Amtrak president who was then chairman of Airbus North America. Mr. Leahy, he added, possessed "bulldog tenacity."
Yet the key to Mr. Leahy's success, he said, lay in the growing influence of financiers in America's newly deregulated airline industry. "There were no more people in silk scarves and leather helmets," Mr. Boyd said, in an industry that "was being taken over by money men." Airbus's idea, he said, was "to put M.B.A.'s out on the road, who could talk their language; John knew that language."
In 1986, Mr. Leahy hauled in his first big catch when Northwest Airlines agreed to buy Airbus planes.
Daniel Solon, managing director of Avmark International, an airline consultancy in London, agreed that deregulation was crucial: "At the time, Northwest was in play, and the industry was taken over by financial players. They were potentially receptive, and you could induce them to buy other than Boeing."
Yet Mr. Leahy's early years were not all smooth. At times, the other side of his charm appeared to be aggression. Noel Forgeard, the Airbus chief executive and Mr. Leahy's No. 1 fan, described him as "the best marketing person I know." He added: "He's always angry. He cannot relax. He's always in movement."
Mr. Boyd, former chairman of Airbus North America, said Mr. Leahy sometimes treated employees harshly if they did not perform, and cut them off from communication. "I talked to him about that several times," he said. "But he considered me an old fogey."
Other executives defend him, however, arguing that what might appear as aggression is his relentless drive. "People notice that he's extremely focused on the matter of the day," said Nick Tomassetti, president of Airbus North America. "And guess what? They're right." Yet, he said, Mr. Leahy "means no disrespect in an angry way."
In 1990, when Mr. Tomassetti worked for International Aero Engines, a consortium of engine makers that included Pratt & Whitney and Kawasaki of Japan, Mr. Leahy cobbled together an innovative package of low-interest loans from aircraft-leasing companies and engine suppliers that enabled America West Airlines to acquire the Pan Am shuttle in exchange for America West's agreement to buy or lease more than 100 Airbus aircraft. Such loans have since become familiar features of aircraft purchases.
In 1994, when Mr. Leahy moved with his wife and three children to France, one immediate goal was to crack British Airways, a stubbornly all-Boeing carrier. Four years later, British Airways purchased its first Airbuses, the single-aisled, short-haul A319, after Mr. Leahy put the 319 side by side with a Boeing 737-700 on the tarmac and invited British executives to compare them. The Airbus offer, said Robert J. Ayling, chief executive of British Airways, "was a better value than the competitive offer."
But can Mr. Leahy keep up against the giant of the industry, Boeing?
To do so, Airbus is now busily transforming itself from a loose consortium into a unified company. The agreement last year to merge three of its partners -- Aerospatiale Matra of France, DaimlerChrysler Aerospace of Germany, and Construcciones Aeronauticas of Spain -- to form the European Aeronautic, Defense and Space Company, or EADS, leaves Airbus in effect with two shareholders: EADS, with 80 percent, and BAE Systems, as British Aerospace is now known, with 20 percent.
Moreover, Airbus plans the 550-seat jumbo, the A3XX, to compete with the Boeing 747 on the high end. If Airbus decides later this year to build the A3XX, Mr. Solon of Avmark said, it may be the first aircraft started not by a single big airline order but by the alliances of airlines that increasingly dominate intercontinental travel. Indeed, KLM and Alitalia, the core players in an alliance that also includes Northwest, have already decided to merge their fleet planning and purchasing activities.
Given the size and cost of the A3XX, Mr. Solon said, alliances will have to ask, "Can we make sense of this?"
Mr. Leahy disagrees. The A3XX, he said, with an estimated list price of up to $220 million, will be costlier than Boeing's biggest plane, the 747-400, which costs up to $180 million, "but we are not talking double the price."
Yet he does not underestimate the scale of the challenge. "Life isn't fair," he likes to tell his team. "If all things are equal, they're buying Boeing." He added, "We have to show them it's not equal, that we've got a better mousetrap."

Rocker States His Case at Appeal of Suspension

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
John Rocker's words earning him a 73-day suspension appeared in a national magazine for all to read. His words concerning his remarks and his subsequent suspension were recited in private, aimed only at the arbitrator who will decide Rocker's immediate future.
Rocker, the Atlanta Braves' closer, testified yesterday at the hearing that resulted from the players association's challenge of the suspension that Commissioner Bud Selig levied against Rocker on Jan. 31 -- all of spring training, which for pitchers lasts 45 days, and the first 28 days of the season. 
 Shyam Das, the arbitrator, will decide if Selig's disciplinary action was appropriate or if it should be overturned or lightened. His ruling is expected to come near the end of the month.
Rocker, who in his comments published in Sports Illustrated in December denigrated foreigners and many other segments of society, was one of three witnesses on the second and last day of the hearing at the Major League Baseball offices on Park Avenue in New York. Kevin Hallinan, baseball's chief security executive, was management's final witness, testifying about the increased burden Rocker's presence would present for the Braves if his suspension were reduced.
Rocker was the union's first witness, and Scott Sanderson, a former major league pitcher, was the union's only other witness. Sanderson testified about the ill effects an abbreviated spring training can have on a pitcher.
Under the suspension, Rocker, a 25-year-old left-hander, can begin working out in the Braves' extended spring training on April 3, the day the major league season begins, and then work with their minor league teams and join the Braves on May 1.
The arbitration panel consists of three members, but Das will decide the appeal because he is the only impartial member. The other two members are Donald Fehr, head of the players association, and Robert Manfred, the owners' chief labor executive.
Fehr declined to comment on the proceedings. "We're in the middle of an arbitration," he said. Asked about the feelings of the others present at the hearing, he said: "I wouldn't comment on what anyone else felt or thought. I can only tell you that the case has been submitted. There has to be the process by which a decision is reached."
Manfred, when asked, declined to discuss Rocker's testimony.
"I think the entire grievance process has been handled in the way that you'd hope that the grievance process would be handled," he said. "We had a disagreement; it's been handled in a businesslike way."
On the first day of the hearing, Stan Kasten, the Braves' president, testified about the negative impact the club says Rocker's remarks have had and will have on the Braves' economics. Asked yesterday about those problems, real or anticipated, Kasten declined to talk about them.
"I have no intention of discussing it at all," he said by telephone, meaning any aspect of the case.
The atmosphere surrounding the second day of the hearing was less circuslike than that of the first day. Fewer police officers were on hand outside 245 Park Avenue, and fewer office workers and passers-by lingered on the sidewalk protesting Rocker's presence or waiting for something to happen or for someone to emerge from the building.
Rocker, in fact, entered the building almost unnoticed, going through a construction area entrance. About an hour earlier, he arrived at the players association offices on East 49th Street. Before entering that building, he put his arm around a stunned news photographer.
"How you doing, buddy?" he said. "Want me to do anything for you?"
The photographer was Robert Mecea, who came to this country from Romania. "I didn't tell him I'm an immigrant," Mecea said.

HEADLINE: Web Attacks Have Government Revisiting Laws and Security

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Expressing concern about the economic damage, including sell-offs in the stock market, caused by the attacks on leading Web sites this week, the Justice Department said today that tougher criminal penalties might be necessary to prevent malicious disruption of Internet commerce.
"We don't consider this a prank," Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said today at a news conference. "These are very serious matters." 
 The Pentagon announced today that as part of the investigation, it had begun a check on some 7,600 military computer systems to determine whether any had been used as relay points by the Internet attackers.
At the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a spokesman said that four field offices had opened formal investigations: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Seattle.
"This is not cyberterrorism; this is cybercriminality," said an administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. And it has frightening implications, he said. If eBay and Yahoo can be shut down, the next target may very well be the National Security Agency or satellites, he suggested.
Since Monday, attacks have blocked access to several major Internet sites, sometimes for several hours. They have included Yahoo; Buy.com, a retail site whose stock began trading this week; E*Trade, one of the largest online brokerage firms; and eBay.com, the online auction site.
As the attacks appeared to taper off, law enforcement agencies and computer security experts said evidence suggested that the three days of digital assaults had been the work of more than one person or group. They said many Web sites remained vulnerable because of inadequate security precautions.
The White House has been holding meetings for the last two years with leaders in the computer industry to discuss security, and another meeting is set for next week, David Leavy, a White House spokesman, said today. He said the focus would be on the need for the government and private industry to cooperate in enhancing computer security.
Though the government recognizes an obligation to prosecute criminal activity on the Internet, there are knottier questions about the obligation to protect private Internet companies from vandalism and about just how much protection is possible.
Investigators are moving into relatively new ground: no crime scene, no rubble to comb through, no DNA. At the same time, experts say, some of the traditional police techniques, from developing informants to picking up tips on the street, may eventually crack the case.
The administration has been expanding its computer crime-fighting capabilities in recent years, establishing computer crime squads in F.B.I. offices around the country and training prosecutors in United States attorneys' offices. At the F.B.I., a National Infrastructure Protection Center was established to help coordinate such investigations, and Mr. Holder said the president was seeking an additional $37 million next year to expand these efforts.
He said the extra money would help set up regional computer forensic labs that would respond more quickly to problems. "Time is important in these matters," Mr. Holder said.
Under Federal law, purposely disrupting computer networks is a felony punishable on the first offense by up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Asked if that would be adequate in this case, Mr. Holder said: "We will obviously have to determine what the magnitude of the loss actually is. But it seems to me that you could end up with a situation where we might want to consider raising the penalties."
The fall in stock prices on Wednesday, attributable at least in part "to what we saw happening in these attacks," he said, "points out a reason why these things have to be taken extremely seriously."
Although the government has an obligation to prosecute the perpetrators of such crimes, experts say, companies have the primary obligation to protect themselves.
"The company has to hire their own guards," said William Arkin, an expert on the national security dimensions of the Internet. He used the analogy of a house burglary: law enforcement agencies have an obligation to search for the criminals, and to prosecute them. But the government does not have an obligation to install an alarm system in any home.
The police do, of course, have patrols that are intended to provide protection in neighborhoods. "There are no patrol cars on the Internet," Mr. Arkin noted.
Whatever resources the government puts into its efforts, it will be impossible to protect against all invasions, said John Thomas, commander of the Pentagon's Global Operations Security Center for four years until his retirement last summer. He is now with AverStar, an information technology company.
Given that there is no absolute defense against computer crime, a company, like the government, has to ask what information must be protected and how much it is willing to pay, Mr. Thomas said.
Mr. Thomas said it was possible to become alarmist about the risks from computer crime. But, he added, it is not possible to know who the attackers are, and who might be behind them. "Who is to say it is not being mentored by organized crime, corporate espionage, foreign governments, or terrorists," he said.
In the end, this case will be solved, if it is, "in physical space, not cyberspace," Mr. Thomas said.
Investigators will have to go onto the streets, as they do routinely, looking for informants or someone the hackers bragged to. "Hackers will do a lot to cover their tracks in cyberspace," he said. "Where they're vulnerable is physical space."

House Passes Bill to Cut Taxes for Married Couples
The House passed a Republican-sponsored bill that would cut taxes for married couples by $182 billion over the next decade, brushing aside the Clinton administration's position that any such tax cut should be far smaller and be enacted only after more pressing issues are resolved.
While they stopped just short of an outright veto threat, administration officials made clear that Mr. Clinton would not sign a bill like the one passed by the House. Page A1. 

Dell Meets Revised Profit Estimates
Dell Computer reported fiscal fourth-quarter net income that matched the lowered expectations of investors. Shares of Dell had increased in regular trading by $3.23, to $38.80, in anticipation of the numbers, but fell in after-hours trading to $37.88. The results were far short of what Wall Street had been anticipating before the company disclosed on Jan. 26 that earnings would be hurt by a component shortage and by what the company said was the failure of corporate customers to increase purchases after worries about the Year 2000 rollover had subsided.

Nasdaq Surges; Blue Chips Wallow
The Nasdaq composite index soared to a record while blue-chip stocks lagged again, pulled down by worries that their earnings are not growing fast enough to offset rising interest rates.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 55.53 points, to 10,643.63, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 5.13 points, to 1,416.83. C8.
 
Shares of Ben & Jerry's Increase
Shares of Ben & Jerry's Homemade rose $2.875, to $28.375, after it was reported that the ice cream company had received a buyout offer for $268 million from Meadowbrook Lane Capital in a bid including the venture capital firm Chartwell Investments. C2.

Scores of e-commerce entrepreneurs are making Valentine's Day the next battleground, defying predictions of a big post-Christmas shakeout among Internet start-up companies that had been expected to substantially lower demand for commercial time and ad space after the fourth quarter. A number of online retailers are running special Valentine's Day ads, including Flooz.com, an online gift store that is featuring Whoopi Goldberg. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. C2.

East Side Tower Extends Luxury Rentals North

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Continuing a northward pattern of luxury apartment construction in Manhattan, a development group later this month will open Century Tower, a 128-unit apartment building at the southeast corner of First Avenue and 90th Street.
The building has studio to three-bedroom units of 440 to 1,450 square feet. Half of the apartments have one bedroom to appeal to young professionals and couples, but the units may also be combined to accommodate families. Monthly rents range from $2,000 to $7,000, and since leasing began in December, contracts have been signed on 24 units, according to Wolf Management and Leasing of Manhattan, the project's leasing agent. 
 The $50 million project is being developed by RFR/Davis, a partnership of Trevor Davis, Aby Rosen and Michael Fuchs that has been building mostly luxury rentals on the Upper East Side for the last five years. Century Tower is one of five such projects, totaling 746 apartments, that the group has built or is building in the neighborhood.
It is also the farthest north in the area that the partners have developed a building, reflecting the northward migration of new construction, many residential brokers said.
"We have never been market makers," Mr. Davis said. "Rather, we follow the market, and the market is moving north."
Indeed, north of the 23-story Century Tower is the Chesapeake, a recently completed 205-unit mixed-income rental building at 345 East 94th Street at First Avenue, developed by Sidney Fetner Associates of Manhattan. Leasing began in August and all but 17 apartments have been rented in the building, according to the Feathered Nest, its leasing agent.
Mr. Davis said that he and his partners "remain focused on the Upper East Side" and that the Chesapeake had reinforced "our decision to build Century Tower."
Nancy Packes, president of the Feathered Nest, said the lack of available building sites on the Upper East Side was pushing development northward and in turn "redefining by expansion the neighborhood's borders." Construction in Harlem "is also a positive," she said.
Another factor stoking the expansion, said Marilyn H. Kaye, president of Prudential MLB Kaye International Realty in Manhattan, is that the demand for apartments continues to outstrip the supply and may grow as some would-be buyers turn to rentals because of the recent rise in mortgage rates.
"The 90's are no longer pioneer country," Ms. Kaye added. "The real frontier now is around 110th Street."
Rents on the Upper East Side, as in the rest of the market, continue to rise. According to the Feathered Nest's year-end 1999 report, average rents rose in the neighborhood by 11.2 percent for all size apartments in the second half of last year. Ms. Packes said that increase put the average rent at $4,125 a month for a typical 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment on the Upper East Side.
The monthly rent for a similar size unit in a building on the fringe of the neighborhood, above 86th Street, generally is lower, she said, noting that a 1,191-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment on the 10th floor of the Chesapeake leased for $3,500.
The rents at Century Tower appealed to Robert J. Schneider, who has signed a contract to lease an 870-square-foot, one-bedroom apartment on the fifth floor of the building. Mr. Schneider, who is 35 and vice president of sales for his family's custom bookbinding business in Farmingdale, on Long Island, is moving back to Manhattan, and the Upper East Side, after living in Newport Beach, Calif., for two years. His company has a factory in Santa Anna, Calif.
Mr. Schneider said that compared with rents at other buildings, the $2,800 a month he will be paying at Century Tower "is reasonable and I feel I am getting more bang for my buck."
As for the building's location, Mr. Schneider said: "The 90's is actually more quiet and has more of a neighborhood feel. Being so high up also gives me easier access to the Triborough Bridge and to my business on Long Island."
Felicia Harrison, director of marketing and leasing at Wolf Management, said the building's 90th Street address had not proved to be an issue with prospective tenants. "The good thing," she said, "is that they already know they want to live in the neighborhood."
Century Tower replaces a Mobil gas station that stood on the site, which RFR/Davis bought 18 months ago because of its corner location. The site, Mr. Davis said, "lends itself to more creative layouts and multiple exposures" for the apartments.
The building was designed by H. Thomas O'Hara of Manhattan with a traditional masonry facade colored in multiple shades of red. Michael Graves & Associates of Princeton, N.J., is the architect for the building's interior public spaces, including its elliptical-shaped lobby, with an ocher and gray stone floor laid out in a checkered pattern.
"We wanted to take a classical-based design and adapt it to a modern high rise to provide something familiar, yet with a twist," said Thomas P. Rowe, a principal at the Graves firm in charge of the project. This is the first such project in Manhattan for the firm, which is also designing the common spaces for another RFR/Davis project: a three-building, 216-unit rental complex, called the Impala, nearing completion on First Avenue between 75th and 76th Streets.
Amenities at Century Tower include a screening room that is available for rent, a business center and a health club with a children's play area. There is also garage parking for 60 cars and 8,000 square feet of ground-floor retail space. Tenants will begin moving into the building in two weeks.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Nights Turn Brighter

BYLINE: By ANN POWERS 

 BODY:
GO out in Brooklyn? On the weekend? For groovy New Yorkers, that was once an unbearably tepid proposition. Russian immigrants may drink vodka in Brighton Beach leisure palaces, and Trinidadians let loose to soca near Nostrand Avenue. But the students, artists and hipsters seeking the cultural edge started their evenings on the subway to the Village and beyond.
Now the Brooklyn-Manhattan power balance is changing. Exiled trendsetters eventually found themselves loving their neighborhoods and dressed them up with shops, restaurants and bars. Younger residents tried spots that no one else had yet declared chic. Hot spots multiplied, some as buzz-filled as Manhattan, others retaining an air of simplicity, messiness, home. 
 As a Brooklyn dweller, I knew Smith Street in Boerum Hill, where the bistros have sprung up as suddenly as Brooklyn's famous ailanthus trees. I had hung out at that strip's wonderful cafe, Halcyon. But I'm always working at night, when others are relaxing. To find Brooklyn's best hangouts, I needed expert assistance.
I enticed some Brooklyn savants into showing me their favorite pleasure dens. As we made our way, we discussed how the influence of time and money have affected Brooklyn's rim by day as surely as it has made things more fun after dark.
 
THE RISING CAFE.
Toshi Reagon sat at the bar of the Rising Cafe in Park Slope, smoking a cigar. "I picked up the habit on tour," she said. "I don't do it often. But this is our night out."
That's Ms. Reagon -- always one to make a simple meeting a party. The singer and songwriter knows the importance of cultivating merriment. She had obviously made an impression at the Rising. A co-owner, Christine Marinoni, greeted her with a big hug and joined us as we corralled a table.
"I should play here sometime!" said Ms. Reagon. The Rising, which caters to a mostly young, mostly gay crowd, has many events, including readings, political meetings and music about once a week.
"But my band wouldn't fit," she added, gesturing to the tiny stage.
"Toshi, I'd build the stage out the door if you'd play!" Ms. Marinoni said with a laugh.
As she turned to help a customer, Carl Hancock Rux and Chrystalin Wright entered. Ms. Reagon had enlisted these two old friends to take us farther than her favorite watering hole. Mr. Rux, a writer and musician who is one of Fort Greene's brightest talents, and Ms. Wright, a dancer and choreographer who was once a leader of the troupe Urban Bush Women, are self-described night crawlers, full of stories about their adventures in the borough's seedier spots.
This night, however, they had planned a more fabulous route along De Kalb Avenue, the center of Fort Greene's latest revival. As on Smith Street, restaurants and bars are rapidly multiplying here. Chez Oskar, the Buttercup, Sol and Lucien Blue around the corner have made this the place to be seen among the multiethnic elite.
Our first stop was a South African restaurant Mr. Rux had mentioned, where the congenial waitress mixed up a fresh batch of the ginger beer he loves. It was delicious, sharp and cool. Our hostess overheard Ms. Wright mention a recent trip to Johannesburg, and soon they were caught up in lively conversation. Brooklyn night crawlers love this friendliness.
 
A Pan-Latin Stop
Yet bigger and changing crowds are making such connections harder. When we entered Sol, a Pan-Latin restaurant that features live music in its long front bar, Mr. Rux declared it his hangout. But over crab cakes and chicken wings, he shared his mixed feelings about Fort Greene's recent transformation.
"This used to be the Claremont Lounge, one of the oldest bars in the neighborhood," Mr. Rux said. "It was very ghetto. You'd see people coming in with their yellow suits and ties, and the women would have their long nails. It was great! I went there because I'm always out in my neighborhood.
"Then Sol opened about a year ago, and I remember sitting here being very mad because there was a middle-class white couple -- the kind of people who've bought property but you didn't see out at night. And the woman said: 'This is great. Finally somewhere to eat in the neighborhood.'
"I said to her: 'Wow. You couldn't find anywhere to eat? Because there are places all up and down here.' There was a little Dominican chicken and rice joint then, where Madiba is now. And I got my dinners there for $3, and I was really happy."
Ms. Reagon added, "These neighborhoods have gone round and round." She noted that Fort Greene had endured another arc of popularity and decline in the late 1980's. "It's almost like nobody really owns anything; it's just the cycle. But it was really strange. One day there was an article in the paper that said Fort Greene's kind of cool. And then the next week, it seemed, there was this whole level of people coming in."
There is what Mr. Rux calls "a new socio-cultural-racial reality" in Fort Greene. Yet my three companions know that they, too, are part of the change. Artists make the first inroads. Night life, as Mr. Rux put it, anticipates changes in day life.
At Alibi, where we headed for a nightcap, the artists were in full force. The crowd at this classic bohemian dive, with its tin ceilings and graffiti-covered back walls, was almost all white. But these were students at Pratt Institute, the Clinton Hill art college, not stockbrokers. One man in a cowboy hat greeted Mr. Rux, and they settled into a corner for a conversation.
"I'm a bar guy," Mr. Rux said. "I love the community." He finds that fellowship among the painters at Alibi as well as the hip-hop poets at Sol or Lucien Blue. He knows it's fragile but he's glad it's blossoming.
 
Along Fifth Avenue
I was hoping for a straight-ahead pub crawl from one end of Fifth Avenue in Park Slope to the other with Greg Zinman, who plays guitar in the band Sea Ray. He brought along his friend Robert Galligan of the newly defunct group Sunday Puncher; both have lived and imbibed in Brooklyn since their Yale days half a decade ago. When we ventured into the subzero weather, however, we quickly amended our plans to include only four spots on this growing watering-hole row.
We started at O'Connor's because it was closest. Another "old man's bar" like the Alibi, O'Connor's was the first this neighborhood's hipsters commandeered. Other classic rooms, like Montero's on Atlantic Avenue and the Brooklyn Inn at Bergen and Bond, have their loyalists. But O'Connor's was the one for the youth in the Slope.
"O'Connor's wasn't a scene when we first came here," Mr. Galligan said. "The jukebox was just a boombox. There were more neighborhood people. The gentrifiers didn't outnumber them."
Mr. Zinman said: "Here's the hypocritical thing. We don't like it as much because more people like us come in."
These two friends are quite aware of their place in their neighborhood's transformation. They are renters, and as musicians with day jobs they don't enhance its economic profile. But they explore the bars and drag other friends to the ones they like. In Brooklyn, they could pioneer a scene already set in stone in Manhattan.
After leaving O'Connor's, we ventured across Flatbush Avenue to Freddy's. With decaying fixtures, a friendly barkeep, good beer on tap and a generous back room with a pool table, it's an exceedingly comfortable joint. My guides immediately ran into friends, including Kid Millions of the band Oneida, who shared the exciting news of good reviews in the British press.
Some of Freddy's clientele publish a literary 'zine, Lurch, out of the bar, and it decorates the walls along with the notices of open-mike nights and a weekly screenwriters' workshop. The posted information is haphazard; the staff likes to keep things low-key and local. Freddy's is a little bit blessed, a place on the verge. In a few months, I thought, it will be different.
It will be more like the Gate, probably, where a quick car service ride took us next. "This place is what it wants to be," Mr. Galligan said. Every bench in the rectangular room was taken; the barkeep skillfully kept up with orders from the lengthy beer list.
"It's got a publike atmosphere," Mr. Galligan said. "The decor is homey; there are dogs in here. People just start talking to each other."
Indeed, a host of apparent strangers were chatting at the bar. One couple danced to Sinatra on the sound system. Mr. Galligan called his roommate and musical partner, Howe Lin, who soon joined us. We had to pull ourselves away from our snug spot to keep the crawl going.
 
No Longer Jostle Free
We dashed into Loki, a new place with Victorian-style couches in the rear, but that sweet rear room was inadequately heated, and we headed down the block to Great Lakes, a bar with a Midwestern theme that archly plays on Brooklyn's unpretentiousness. Mr. Galligan spent a long stretch at the jukebox, selecting underground hits by Bailter Space and Nick Drake.
"When you go out in Manhattan, it's eyeing people and vibing -- looking and being seen," Mr. Lin said when I asked him about the lure of Brooklyn night life. "Here you can have a conversation because you're not distracted."
Mr. Zinman said: "As more time goes by, all I care about is being with my friends. I already have a girlfriend. I just want to be able to catch up at the end of the week and see how my friends are doing, and if I can't do that because I'm standing up, jostling with people, looking at people, it's just not worth it."
Brooklyn is no longer jostle-free, though. The bars on Fifth Avenue can be uncomfortable, especially on the weekends.
"We want to go someplace new, that has something to inspire us, to make us talk to each other in different ways," said Mr. Galligan, back from the jukebox. "It's this weird mix of hometown hanging out and new experiences. But where are the old dudes with their dogs and their dreams of writing the great American novel?"
Mr. Lin concluded: "It can be kind of constructed, this sense of community. A lot of Manhattan refugees are trying to find it here. Sometimes it doesn't ring true."
 
Williamsburg
 
If anywhere in Brooklyn houses a constructed community, it is Williamsburg. People jokingly call Williamsburg's main strip, Bedford Avenue, Avenue E because so many bohemians have fled the East Village to live there. With spacious converted factories attracting visual artists and no brownstones for Wall Street types, Williamsburg has made it to a solid and prosperous phase of gentrification.
Nicholas Hill has lived here since 1987. The multitalented music entrepreneur once ran one of Williamsburg's many speak-easies, Quiet Life, in a funeral parlor. I paired him as a guide with Judy McGuire, a writer who moved to Williamsburg in 1995, because they were players in a classic Brooklyn story -- a real estate story. A while back, sorely needing a new place for his growing family to live, Mr. Hill found a deal at the final hour through a friend of a friend. That contact, whom he had never met before our night out, was Ms. McGuire.
That's Williamsburg: an elaborate web of people and establishments. Many here have been pioneering for years. Trust overshadows the inevitable worry that change brings.
We started at the charmingly garish Greenpoint Tavern, then quickly hit the Charleston, where a fledgling band was churning out painfully earnest Celtic rock. We walked through the glamorous and huge new restaurant Planet Thailand just to see the boat hanging from the ceiling. But we lingered at Sweetwater, a punk bar where, Ms. McGuire said, mohawks often bump in the back room.
"I come here on Sundays to play pool," she said. "It's emptier. The bartender, George, shows movies on the television. He's getting his master's in poetry."
In Williamsburg the nightmare of being squished by scene-makers comes true. Sweetwater was so packed that I couldn't hold my beer straight. Galapagos, closer to the river, teemed with beautiful people. It is a visual artists' showcase with a reflecting pool in the foyer and vast walls that act as a gallery. We wove through the scattered crowd to the back room, Ocularis, where art films are shown and performances held.
"The way Galapagos established itself, its owners lived in the neighborhood," Mr. Hill said. "And they sought out a place that wasn't a problem for people living nearby. They opened slowly, over two years. They just got their hard liquor license last month."
Not all Williamsburg establishments have made such peaceful transitions. Residents are protesting the opening of the new Brooklyn branch of the defunct St. Marks Place club Sine. The room could be New York's hottest showcase, Mr. Hill said, but may never serve its rightful purpose as a nightclub. Mr. Hill understands the residents' concerns about crowds and noise because he also lives close by.
We wandered toward the Stinger, a three-week-old bar that opened with a bang. Inside a band called Tinker had the crowd in a frenzy of punk-style Irish clogging. We lucked into seats at the bar and were immersed in a musicians' confab. The bassist Tony Maimone joined Ms. McGuire, while Mr. Hill bent the ear of the guitarist Phillip Marshall of Teenage Mustache. Soon, Joe McGinty, the maestro of the Loser's Lounge at the Fez in the East Village, ambled up.
What made the Stinger so successful, I wondered? "It's owned by Cathrine Westergaard, who was a bartender at the Abbey," Mr. Hill said. Williamsburgers are loyal to their drink-pourers. Perhaps the club's location off the beaten Bedford Avenue path added to the attraction for this obviously local crowd.
 
A Peek at Greenpoint
The wrong kind of invasion can rankle. Leaving the Stinger with Mr. McGinty and Mr. Marshall in tow, we headed to Enid's in adjacent Greenpoint. The big tin-ceilinged room was lovely, and everyone says the crowd is local, but my guides were put off by the young people draped over the thrift store furniture. We headed to Pete's Candy Store.
Several musicians from the Stinger had stumbled over to tiny Pete's Candy Store. Again, family loyalty seemed to draw them; this bar is co-owned by Juliana Nash, the former singer of Talking to Animals. Plus there's the future promised by the bar's back room.
Simon Peach, a bartender there since Pete's Candy Store opened, ushered us into an unfinished space shaped like a train car. The dainty room will be a live music venue, a real neighborhood space where artists can try out their new material before friends.
The Candy Store's miniaturist aesthetic suits a neighborhood where the locals keep looking for new hideouts. Yet Mr. Hill said they ultimately tolerate newcomers, glad for the amenities they bring.
"Frankly, most of us are happy that there's a health food store and a yoga place," Mr. Hill added.
And what do the curious find when they take the L train to Williamsburg on a weekend? Something we all want, Mr. Marshall said.
"Have you ever been on vacation somewhere, and you know you're not part of it but you think, 'I could live here?' " he said. "That's what most people feel about Williamsburg."
 
Around the Academy
For my last night's frolic, I turned to a professional. Limor Tomer has worked at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for seven years. She now books the music at BAM Cafe, and has established it as an adventurous and congenial spot in its first year. "When we opened we wanted to make this a showcase for Brooklyn musicians," said Ms. Tomer, who also books acts from all over the world. "It wasn't hard. Ninety percent of the phone numbers on my list are in the 718 area code."
Ms. Tomer herself currently has a good rental situation in 212. But she gets her inspiration from Brooklyn.
"I see the Upper West Side as my little home in lower Westchester," she said. "But where I go out, where my friends live is Brooklyn."
She certainly showed the command of the local as she steered us toward Frank's, a vintage blues bar adorned with balloons, Christmas lights and red plastic tablecloths, a few blocks from BAM Cafe. She greeted the owner as a favorite uncle and exchanged pleasantries with the regulars at the bar.
"I need to have good relationships with the locals," she explained. BAM's foray into night life might have been perceived as a conquest, but Ms. Tomer's good will and other proprietors' desire to expand their own possibilities through collaboration have helped keep the peace.
She insisted that we stop by the Brooklyn Moon Cafe, two blocks from Frank's, because, she said, "it's totally essential to the story." It was one of the first spots to open in this latest night life wave. The owner was locking his gate as we walked up, so Ms. Tomer gave him a kiss and speeded us toward her next connection.
The Up Over sits above the Wing Wagon restaurant at Seventh Avenue and Flatbush, just across from the busy D train stop where hundreds of Slope dwellers pass every day. But how many know about this pristine room where classic jazz is played four nights a week? This small treasure represents the subtle side of Brooklyn night life -- not imported trends, but individual dreams played out close to the homes where they were devised.
Another kind of dreaming was happening at our next stop. The Atlantic Night Cafe is a place few hipsters may penetrate; the Middle Eastern men smoking hookahs at sidewalk tables intimidate the average Brooklyn lager-seeker. Ms. Tomer, of course, had crossed the threshold long ago. Entering the room, which resembles a deliriously decorated wedding reception hall, she greeted the staff and ordered a hookah for us.
"It's just tobacco, sweetened with apple," said Ms. Tomer, who is Israeli-born, with a laugh. "In Jordan the men are puffing on hashish!"
We watched as men and a few women slowly freed themselves from the jovial groups seated at long tables to dance solo, swaying their hips and brandishing beads or sticks, in the center of the room. Ms. Tomer's attention was on the duo playing music.
"I should get that oud player into BAM Cafe," she said. "I would hook him up with a real band. Lose the synth."
In this setting, though, the synthesizer sounded great, and it was hard to abandon the tasty smoke and the serenely festive mood. We wanted to hit Dumbo, the newest point on the Brooklyn night life map.
"The bars there aren't having any music tonight, but let's check it out anyway," Ms. Tomer said. A few minutes later we were in Between the Bridges, where three female chefs operate the tiny bistro Superfine and sometimes have "fire shows and cabarets."
It was nearly 2 a.m., and Between the Bridges had reverted to its natural state as a great dive with a fine jukebox. Led Zeppelin blasted through the speakers, and tattooed night owls occupied the tables. A few trucker types hugged the bar. We took a rear table and talked about all we had seen.
Ms. Tomer sees the expansion as overwhelmingly positive and is convinced that even if it increases tenfold, Brooklyn will still remain Brooklyn, day and night.
"It's freer; it's more real; it's more mixed," she concluded, echoing all the guides I had enlisted. "It's everything we moved to New York for that doesn't exist in Manhattan anymore because Manhattan has become a playground for the rich. All the creativity and the energy that we came here for is living and breathing here."

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:
Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on Page 12.
 
Now Playing
 
*"ANY GIVEN SUNDAY," starring Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid, James Woods and Jamie Foxx. Directed by Oliver Stone (R, 160 minutes). Mr. Stone's brawling, hyper-macho professional football film has enough in-the-thick-of-it playing-field action to satisfy the fantasies of most armchair players. In the style of Mr. Stone's "Wall Street," the movie is also a crude morality play that pits the old ways against the new, with the veteran coach Tony D'Amato (Mr. Pacino) embodying tradition and a young hotshot quarterback, Willie Beamen (Mr. Foxx), the new. Although the acting is uneven (Ms. Diaz is disappointing as a tough team owner), and the final scenes are shamelessly "Rocky" -ish, the movie delivers a credible, action-charged vision of the frenzied world of professional sports as a metaphor for the volatility of American culture (Stepehn Holden). 

"EYE OF THE BEHOLDER," starring Ewan McGregor and Ashley Judd. Directed by Stephan Elliott (R, 105 minutes). Mr. McGregor is a British surveillance expert and Ms. Judd the serial-killing femme fatale he falls in love with (while observing her kill a boyfriend) in this ludicrous psycho-thriller. As Mr McGregor's character, known only as the Eye, follows the object of his obsession from city to city, the movie tries futilely to capture some of the mystique of "Vertigo." But the film, by the director best known for "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,"is so garish, disjointed and incoherent that it feels like an extended music video posing as a movie (Holden).
 
"FANTASIA/2000," with James Levine and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and introductions by Steve Martin, Bette Midler, Mr. Levine, Itzhak Perlman, James Earl Jones, Angela Lansbury, Quincy Jones and Penn and Teller. Various directors (G, 75 minutes). The millennial version of Disney's 1940 ground-breaking fusion of animation and classical music includes seven new segments and keeps one from the original film (the wonderful "Sorcerer's Apprentice," starring Mickey Mouse). Despite the science fiction title and the Imax-size screen on which it is shown, "Fantasia/2000" is more backward-looking than futuristic. The two best segments are "Rhapsody in Blue," a witty Manhattan-in-the-Jazz-Age homage to the caricaturist Al Hirschfeld set to the music of Gershwin, and the finale (set to Stravinsky's "Firebird" Suite), in which a cometlike sprite whooshes around the globe explosively creating, destroying and renewing the planet's life forms. Celebrity introductions lend the film the feel of a deluxe corporate promotion. At the Sony Imax Theater, Broadway at 68th Street (Holden).
 
"GIRL, INTERRUPTED," starring Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie. Directed by james Mangold (R, 120 minutes). Except for being several years too old for the role, Winona Ryder, an actress who oozes high-strung intelligence, is ideally cast as Susanna Kaysen, a college-age girl who lands in a Massachusetts mental institution in 1967 after a halfhearted suicide attempt. (The movie is based on Ms. Kaysen's memoir). The period details are perfect, and Ms. Ryder has the courage to make her character a pain in the neck. But the small, introspective movie is nearly stolen by Ms Jolie as a charismatic, brutally truth-telling sociopath who becomes Susanna's best friend (Holden).
 
"THE GREEN MILE," starring Tom Hanks, Michael Clarke Duncan, David Morse, Doug Hutchison, Sam Rockwell and Bonnie Hunt. Written and directed by Frank Darabont (R, 180 minutes). In adapting the death row drama that Stephen King wrote in multiple installments, the director of "The Shawshank Redemption" could have managed more economy and fewer talky bits of business around the cellblock. Still, this lengthy film is vivid and well played. Smooth ensemble acting builds up to the discovery that a gigantic condemned man (Mr. Duncan) is a prisoner with very special abilities, which gives the film its mixture of religious overtones and mild horror. Mr. Hanks, as a wry Southern prison guard, is so unaffectionately good that it's redundant to say so (Janet Maslin).
 
* "GUN SHY," starring Liam Neeson, Oliver Platt, Jose Zuniga and Sandra Bullock. Written and directed by Eric Blakeney (R, 102 minutes). Last spring saw both a film comedy ("Analyze This") and a cable series ("The Sopranos") about gangsters forcing themselves to unload to a shrink. This year, in "Gun Sky," we get a shaken undercover Fed, Charlie Mayo (Mr. Neeson), seeing a psychiatrist on the down-low. Charlie, a wreck who has lost his nerve after he was exposed during an undercover operation, is assigned to a job that involves his acting as an organized-crime envoy. He moves between the preening Fidel (Mr. Zuniga), a yuppie Colombian thug, and Fulvio (Mr. Platt), whose vulgar pride in his violent streak is perverse. Mr. Blakeney has come up with one of the most subtle and inspired comedies you'll see this year in his feature-film writing and directing debut (Elvis Mitchell).
 
"HOLY SMOKE," starring Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel. directed by jane Campion (R, 95 minutes). Having roamed so gorgeously through North Africa as a young hippie mother in "Hideous Kinky," Ms. Winslet this time appears in India as Ruth barron, a head-strong young Australian seeking enlightenment. Eventually Ruth's mother coaxes her home, where a "cult exiter" named P.J. (Mr. Keitel) is waiting to wean Ruth away from her Indian guru. But as the film moves from its early mix of rapture and humor into this more serious, confrontational stage, it runs into trouble. It doesn't help that Ms. Winslet's obvious strength and beauty leave Mr. Keitel's P.J. looking overmatched (Maslin).
 
*"THE HURRICANE," starring Denzel Washington. Directed by Norman Jewison (R, 120 minutes). The life story of Hurricane Carter, a middleweight contender who spent nearly 20 years in prison for a triple murder he didn't commit, is a big, schmaltzy ballad of a movie redeemed by Mr. Washington's moving, bone-deep protrayal of the boxer from Paterson, N.J. But the movie plays fast and loose with the facts, giving far too much credit to the members of a Canadian commence who took up Mr. Carter's cause and all but eliminating his heroic co-defendant, John Artis, from the story. And the minor characters are either saints or monsters. Yet the story of a man heroically fighting his demons and winning his freedom is still inspiring (Holden).
 
"ISN'T SHE GREAT," starring Bette Midler, Nathan Lane, Stockard Channing, David Hyde Pierce and John Cleese. Directed by Andrew Bergman (R, 90 minutes). In this bio-pic, Ms. Midler protrays the author Jacqueline Susann, who took the lurid pulp genre to a new, sweaty level. No one is more suited to playing a tease of a diva than Ms. Midler, who can wring more comedy out of operatic self-absorption than anyone else. And Mr. Lane, who plays Irving Mansfield, Susann's husand, promoter and biggest fan, is a spark plug: his voice shows up before he does. Yet in this adaptation of the material, Susann's life is flattened, made campy and cute. Sly hostility seems to be a facet of the screenwriter Paul Rudnick's talent. But Mr. Rudnick and Mr. Bergman have sodefanged "Isn't She Great" that it's like watching a sketch from the old "Carol Burnett Show" that has mildewed (Elvis Mitchell).
 
"PLAY IT TO THE BONE," starring Woody Harrelson, Antonio Banderas and Lolita Davidovich. Directed by Ron Shelton (R, 124 minutes). This screwball sports comedy stars Mr. Harrelson (with a shaved head) and Mr. Banderas as fading middleweight boxers and best friends summoned at the last minute to fight each other as the opening act for a Las Vegas heavyweight bout. The formulaic road movie follows them with their pal and mutual ex-girlfriends (Ms. Davidovich) on their wise-cracking way from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, where they fight a brutal match. The dialogue has sass, and the filmmmaker's jaudiced vision of the professional boxing world is very knowing, but the relationships don't track (Holden).
 
* "SCREAM3," starring David Arquette, Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox Arquette. Directed by Wes Craven (R, 116 minutes). At this point it goes without saying that the "Scream" movies are like episodes of "Scooby Doo." Like the others, "Scream3" belongs on the Cartoon Network. This time for a better reason: the film is funny and brisk, with enough good lines to make the comedy more satisfying than the somewhat routine but still unsettling jobs to the spine. Mr. Craven and his group recognize that the franchise's real competition is not the recent hit films "The Blair Witch Project" or "The Sixth Sense," but rather "Scream" itself. "Scream 3" doesn't skimp on jacked-up scares, but it's as much as personality show as it is a slasher film (Mitchell).
 
* "THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY," starring Matt Damon, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett and Phlip Seymour Hoffman. Written and directed by Anthony Minghella (R, 135 minutes). There are diabolically smart surprises wherever you care to look in this glittering thriller. Proving that the brilliance of "The English Patient" was no fluke, Mr. Minghella shapes a hypnotic, sensually charged adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's fascinatingly retilian murder story. The traffic-stopping cast includes Mr. Damon as the dangerous chameleon of the title and, in a star-making role the English actor Jude Law as a rich dilettante who exerts a homoerotic magnetism. Ms. Paltrow plays the odd woman out with the shrewdness of a fine character actress, while Ms. Blanchett makes the delirious most of her role as a needy American post-debutante. As the story's odious playboy-snob, Mr. Hoffman is scene-stealingly wonderful. Gorgeously photographed in Italy by Jon Seale (Maslin).
 
* "TITUS," starring Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, Alan Cumming, Harry Lennix and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Directed by Julie Taymor (R, 160 minutes). Ms. Taymor, the theater director and puppeteer who created transfixing stage pictures in "The Lion King" and "Juan Darien," has turned Shakespeare's goriest tragedy, "Titus Andronicus," into a powerful contemplation of murderous revenge enacted throughout history. Mr. Hopkins is ghoulishly funny and tragic as the title character, whose political stupidity sets in motion a devastating chain reaction of killing, torture and retaliation. Ms. Lange is Tamora, the captured Goth empress who strikes back. Although the movie's British theatrical and Ameican film acting styles don't mesh, Ms. Taymore's vision is realized with a shattering force in time-traveling imagery that blends ancient Rome with Mussolini's Italy and contemporary cyberpunk flash (Holden).
 
* "TOPSY-TURVEY," starring Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent. Directed by Mike Leigh (R, 161 minutes). Mr. Leigh's grandly entertaining "Topsy-Turvey" is one of those films that create a mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting oportunities, much as "Shakespeare in Love" did last year. Instead of a love-struck young playwright, it presents the curiously matched personalities of the librettist William Schwenk Gilbert and the composer Arthur Sullivanin the midst of a robust, knowing, frequently hilarious look at the musical theater over which they held sway (Maslin).
 
Film Series
 
"THE AMERICAN PLACE: LANDSCAPE IN THE EARLY WESTERN (AND A FEW LATER CLASSICS)." An opportunity for a new look at the Old West is a hand at the Museum of Modern Art, where a monthlong series highlighted by early westerns is in progress. Spanning the history of the genre, the series features more than 50 films in 30 programs, including works that extend from Edwin Porter, D. W. Griffith, Thomas H. Ince, John Ford, Charles Chaplin and Allan Dwan to Victor Fleming, Victor Seastrom, Sam Peckinpah, Mel Brooks, Clint Eastwood and Jim Jarmusch. This weekend is highlighted by "Biograph's Western Heroines: Lillian Gish, Mae Marsh and Blanche Sweet." This program of four films to be shown at 2:30 p.m. today and at 5 tomorrow, consists of four films, the first three starring Sweet, who was Griffith's most spirited western heroine. These three are 15-minute 1912 films: "The Goddess of Sagebrush Gulch" and "The God Within," both directed by Griffith, and "An Outcast Among Outcasts," directed by Wilfred Lucas. The fourth feature is Griffith's 3--minute "Battle at Elderbush Gulch" (1913), with Marsh and Gish among the settlers besieged by Indians and saved by the cavalry. On all four films the cinematographer was Bily Bitzer, Griffith's longtime collaborator in the development of filmmaking technique. The screenings will have a piano accompaniment. Continuing through Feb. 24 at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, the series is free with museum admission: $10 for adults, $6.50 for students and people 65 or older; free for visitors under 16 accompanied by an adult. Pay what you wish on Fridays from 4:30 to 8:30 p.m. Screening information: (212)708-9400 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

HEADLINE: Valuable 'Work Colleges'

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The value of life lessons learned at "work colleges" and other colleges stressing a blend of education and practical experience is indeed significant (news article, Feb. 6). It is mostly at work where many of us put to use the critical thinking, communication and problem-solving skills that advocates of liberal education so rightly admire. 
 At a time when 60 percent of young Americans attend college, we should recognize that curricular models created when higher education was reserved for social and economic elites need to be rethought. Rather than perpetuate the longtime opposition of a liberal arts education and practical experience, we should seek ways to nurture in our students both the impulse to grow intellectually and the desire to prepare for adulthood.

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
Why Not Fat and Happy?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
There is a curious thing about the John McCain phenomenon. Populist campaigns usually arise from adversity. In this time of unprecedented prosperity, one would expect voters to be fat and happy, contented with the status quo. Why, then, are so many turning to an iconoclast, a candidate who promises to shake things up?
The answer must be that a good many Americans, however full their pockets, are discontented with something. And the something is evident: the political system. Fewer and fewer people vote: in 1996, under half of those of voting age. Why vote when you feel that policy is shaped not by your votes but by money? One observer summarizes it this way: 
 "The economic boom of the 90's has masked a looming national crisis: a corrupt political system that auctions off public policy to the highest bidder and leaves the overwhelming majority of Americans feeling alienated from their own government."
That quotation is from a new book by Arianna Huffington, "How to Overthrow the Government." Yes, the same Arianna Huffington who has so pungently argued conservative views. Her rhetoric is still pungent, but her viewpoint seems to have undergone a sea change.
The book is devastating on the flood of money into our politics. There is a certain irony in that: Her former husband, Michael, spent $28 million of his family fortune in an unsuccessful race for the Senate in 1994. She notes wryly that Al Checchi spent $40 million trying to be governor of California in 1998 -- "thankfully, for those of us named Huffington, replacing Michael Huffington as the poster child of campaign profligacy."
Lobbying is another of her targets. She describes Dwayne Andreas, chairman of Archer Daniels Midland, as "Mr. Special Interest" for his success in getting federal subsidies for ethanol. He and ADM have given more than $3 million to the parties in soft money, and they get $300 million a year in ethanol subsidies. "How this differs from Al Capone buying off judges in Chicago is a topic worthy of debate in civics class," Ms. Huffington writes.
But the book is not only about money in politics. Ms. Huffington attacks what she calls "the culture of greed" that makes the rich much richer while "more children are homeless than at any time since the Great Depression." She savages Republican attempts to abolish the estate tax for the sake of the rich.
What has happened to Arianna Huffington? I asked her that question when she was here in Boston the other day. Writing a column about politics as she does, she said, brought her "face to face with distorted priorities, the abuse of language, the neglect of poverty as a social issue. I couldn't bear to hear them going on about our prosperity."
The most striking thing in the book, for me, is Ms. Huffington's discussion of what she calls the two greatest crime problems, "the exploding prison population and the failure of the war on drugs."
The priorities of the drug war, emphasizing criminal prosecution and attempts to cut off drug supplies, are all wrong, she argues. Supplies and use have increased, and will not go down until the priority is shifted to education and treatment of addicts.
Coupled with the excesses of the drug war is the policy of mandatory minimum prison sentences for even trivial drug offenses. The policy is not only inhumane, she says, but has created an enormous social problem: two million Americans in prison, where they are being brutalized.
The drug war and long prison sentences are indeed a disaster for our country. Yet it seems impossible to do anything about them. Politicians are afraid to do anything that would make them vulnerable to charges of being "soft on crime."
That is the problem that Ms. Huffington's book underlines. We have a democratic system of government, but it seems unable to respond to urgent needs. The power of money prevents economic and political reform. In California the prison guards' union is so powerful that even the most sensible criminal law reform is blocked -- because the union wants more prisons and more prisoners.
What will break us out of the stalemate? In a democracy the answer is leadership. I have no idea whether Senator McCain would look at the drug war or poverty or health care and say it is time for a change. But people are looking for someone who might have the courage to challenge the profound flaws in the status quo.

HEADLINE: Zimbabwe Constitution Vote Is a Showdown for Mugabe

BYLINE: By HENRI E. CAUVIN

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Citizens in this economically struggling nation go the polls this weekend for what is in fact, if not in name, a referendum on the only leader whom this country has known, President Robert Mugabe.
Officially, the five million voters projected to go to the polls will be voting on a new constitution, and the government has been pushing hard for a "yes" vote. 
 But opponents say the document would only solidify the president's power and, with its provisions for seizing white farmers' land without compensation, erode Zimbabwe's already diminished standing in eyes of foreign investors and donors.
"What we need now is a much better image abroad to encourage investment and confidence in our country," said Jerry Grant, deputy director of the Commercial Farmers Union, which represents 4,000 farmers, most of them white.
Even the National Constitutional Assembly, a civic organization started a few years ago by people who wanted the country to replace the constitution adopted just before independence from Britain in 1980, is urging rejection.
The showdown occurs at a crucial time for Mr. Mugabe and his Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front party, which holds all but a few seats in Parliament but is most likely to face a fierce challenge from a new opposition party when parliamentary elections are held in April.
The new party, the Movement for Democratic Change, has been attracting support across much of the country. A strong turnout against the constitution this weekend could propel the party to a strong showing in April.
"What we have is a vote of confidence or no confidence in Mugabe and in the government," the party president, Morgan Tsvangirai, said. "If a lot of people turn out and vote no, it's an indication of things to come."
For months, the economy has been staggering toward a total collapse. Inflation has soared to more than 60 percent a year.
The Zimbabwe dollar has declined dramatically against the American dollar, from 12.11 in 1997 to 38.2 at the end of 1999. Fuel and electricity shortages have plagued the country for weeks, set off by mounting back bills to suppliers.
And the International Monetary Fund has cut off its credit after it had found Zimbabwe was underreporting its considerable contributions to the war in Congo.
Many opponents say they are most angered by what they call the blatant disregard for the opinions of the many citizens who were consulted by the constitutional commission that came up with the draft.
The proposal does nothing to limit the powers of the presidency, a change that was widely advocated by many who said they favored making the presidency a ceremonial post, with a prime minister answerable to an elected parliament as the chief executive.
Nor would the proposal change the parliamentary voting system, which opponents say makes it all but impossible for new parties to crack the grip of the governing party.
What it would do -- and what has outraged the small but vocal white minority -- is give the government the right to seize white-owned farmland without paying for it. Added to the draft a few weeks ago, the provision is widely seen a crude bit of racial politicking in a country where land reform has been a painful and persistent issue since independence.
Today, Justice Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa told voters on state television that if they approved the constitutional revisions they would be more likely to receive land, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Mnangagwa said the transfer of white-owned land to landless blacks had been hindered by guarantees in the old constitution that handovers involved compensation.
The National Constitutional Assembly is hoping its campaign can keep that clause and the rest of the proposed constitution from taking effect.
At the assembly headquarters today, volunteers wearing "Vote No" T-shirts hurried about, unpacking fliers and handbills and scrambling to assemble teams to monitor polling stations.
It has been a frantic, chaotic effort, and not entirely by choice, opponents of the new constitution said. Only this morning, they pointed out, the government published an official list of polling stations. Only then could the assembly apply for accreditation for its observers.
"We're not happy with the process," Dr. Lovemore Madhuku, a lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe and the vice chairman of the assembly, said. "Everything has been completely upside down."

HEADLINE: Candidate for Senate Tries To Bask in McCain's Glow

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Senator John McCain's surging presidential candidacy is lending hope to another Republican maverick seeking higher office: the Essex County executive, James W. Treffinger, who is considered a dark-horse contender to succeed Senator Frank S. Lautenberg when he retires.
Mr. McCain's arrival at Newark International Airport this morning for a day of fund-raisers, interviews and meetings in New York and New Jersey gave Mr. Treffinger, who is trailing two other moderate Republicans in the race to raise money and collect endorsements, a chance to identify himself with Mr. McCain as a fellow crusader against what both call the Washington establishment. He did not waste the opportunity. 
 In welcoming remarks at the airport that went on so long that Mr. McCain looked a bit embarrassed, Mr. Treffinger said Senator McCain's positions on fiscal policy were nearly indistinguishable from his own. They both favor lowering taxes and cutting pork-barrel spending, strengthening Social Security and Medicare and eliminating the national debt, he said. "I share the beliefs and values and goals articulated in Senator McCain's career and in his campaign for the presidency," Mr. Treffinger said.
Above all, the two share a commitment to reform the nation's campaign finance system. Mr. Treffinger says he favors eliminating political action committees, allowing contributions from individuals only, and providing matching funds and spending caps for all candidates for federal office. He made no mention, however, of their marked differences on abortion rights, which Mr. Treffinger favors, and other social issues.
Standing shoulder to shoulder with Mr. McCain in front of the senator's "Straight Talk Express" campaign bus, Mr. Treffinger praised the senator as "a true American hero," adding, "I am very proud to join his team today."
Mr. McCain did not return Mr. Treffinger's endorsement, saying that he was pleased to receive it, but that "obviously I'm seeking the support of every citizen of New Jersey." Mr. Treffinger's chief rivals for the Senate nomination, Representative Bob Franks and State Senator William L. Gormley, have both endorsed Gov. George W. Bush.
Still, Mr. Treffinger believes that even unrequited support for Mr. McCain could help his own Senate candidacy, as he acknowledged when he said that from now on, he would end all his own campaign speeches by making a plug for the senator.
Like Mr. McCain, who said today that he was gaining support from so-called Reagan Democrats in South Carolina and elsewhere, Mr. Treffinger, a former Democrat who worked on the 1980 presidential campaign of Gary Hart, is advertising his own potential appeal to Democrats.
In a letter mailed this week to registered Republicans, Mr. Treffinger, who was elected to two consecutive terms as county executive in predominantly Democratic Essex County, asserts that he is the only Republican who can win a general election. "In every statewide election, Essex County always gives the Democrats the margin of victory they need to win," he writes. "I won in Essex County, twice."
Tom Wilson, a former chairman of the Republican state committee who is directing Mr. McCain's New Jersey efforts, drew yet another comparison between the two candidates, though a somewhat hyperbolic one. "McCain spent five and a half years in a prison camp," Mr. Wilson said. "Some might say that being a two-term Republican county executive in Essex might qualify as the same thing." 
In fact, Mr. Treffinger's relations with Democratic freeholders in Essex County have been anything but contentious.
In any event, Mr. Treffinger appears to face an uphill climb. He has little support in the southern third of the state, while Mr. Gormley, who represents the Atlantic City area, has made deep inroads in North Jersey counties. Representative Franks, meanwhile, a fellow North Jerseyan whose district includes part of Essex County, said today that he had won the endorsement of nearly every prominent official in southern Burlington County.
Mr. Treffinger suffered another setback earlier this week when Mr. Gormley's campaign complained that some radio stations had unfairly charged Mr. Treffinger's campaign discounted rates for advertisements; the radio stations agreed, and billed Mr. Treffinger's campaign for several thousand dollars more.

HEADLINE: White House Raises Questions About Governors Island Plan

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
A month after Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced a long-awaited plan to redevelop Governors Island with parks, a conference center and museums, a senior White House official has called the proposal "only a conceptual framework" and urged the city and state to provide more details.
But the comments, by Jacob J. Lew, director of the Office of Management and Budget, ultimately concern the price that the city and state will have to pay for the island, a question that remains a sticking point with both the mayor and the governor. 
 In a Feb. 7 letter to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Mr. Lew said the island could be transferred to the city and state before the end of the year at "a nominal cost."
And although he did not specify the amount, the letter made no reference to a 1995 pledge by President Clinton to help transfer the island as surplus federal property for $1.
Mr. Lew said the island might be transferred at a bargain-basement price, but only if city and state officials act quickly, using what he called "their best efforts."
In an interview yesterday, Tony Coles, the mayor's senior adviser, said the city-state plan for the island announced in January was detailed enough to warrant a commitment from the White House, and the letter to Mr. Moynihan "talks all around the promise that was made by the president."
"We had hoped and expected that the president would come through," Mr. Coles said.
Mr. Lew's letter responded to requests to the White House from Mr. Moynihan, the mayor and other officials to help remove a Congressional barrier and allow the island to be used as a nonprofit public resource.
The barrier was created in 1997 when Congress adopted a federal budget plan that designated Governors Island an asset to be sold to the highest bidder in 2002.
On Monday, when President Clinton sent his budget proposal to Congress, it disappointed New York officials by failing to delete Governors Island from Congress's list of disposable assets.
The president's proposal merely lowered the island's estimated value to $300 million from $500 million.
That provoked angry criticism from Mayor Giuliani, who said at a news conference on Tuesday that the president may no longer intend to help transfer the island to the city and state.
"It seems to me that the president is just trying to fund some of his spending programs out of that $300 million," the mayor said.
Charles Gargano, the chief economic adviser to Governor Pataki, said the new federal estimate of the island's worth was "utter fantasy." Since the city and state intend to devote much of the island to public use, and pay for its maintenance, "its fair market value is really $1 or less," he said yesterday.
But another official said the long-awaited transfer of Governors Island for $1, or another acceptably low amount, had not been derailed.
"It was reasonable to look at the president's budget and say, 'Yikes, what is the intention,' " said Tony Bullock, the chief of staff to Senator Moynihan. "But the letter from Mr. Lew comes out saying, 'don't pay much attention to the $300 million figure.' "
"What we have to do now," Mr. Bullock said, "is get busy on the details of the plan."

Why Pick a Winner? There's Boy George

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
As news of John McCain's New Hampshire landslide hit the networks, I was in Beverly Hills interviewing Warren Beatty on a subject other than his unconsummated political striptease of last fall. But Mr. Beatty can't stop talking about politics, and while he has yet to endorse a candidate, he couldn't contain his ebullience about Mr. McCain, whom he regards as a friend. Yes, the Arizona senator (like the other candidates of both parties) is well to the right of Bulworth -- even on his signature issue of campaign finance reform. But still, Mr. Beatty avows: "John is a good man."
Back East a day later, I found that as goes 90210 so goes 10021 and less glossy strongholds of the not-so-vast liberal conspiracy. It isn't easy to find a Democrat who will say an unkind word about Mr. McCain. Is this because of the media's infatuation with him, a love affair so outrageously syrupy it threatens to toss the entire nation into insulin shock? Or is it merely a mandate for his war-hero past and Trumanesque public persona? Or do liberals, disappointed by Bill Bradley's fumbled insurgency and fatigued by Al Gore's hyperventilating rhetoric, feel that secretly Mr. McCain is one of them? 
 On the last point the answer should be definitively no. As one of Mr. McCain's closest advisers, the former Senator Warren Rudman, put it somewhat overzealously on the Imus show this week, to call Mr. McCain a liberal is "like accusing Hitler of founding the B'nai B'rith." Mr. McCain's legislative record has at times earned him single-digit ratings from the Americans for Democratic Action and zero from the League of Conservation Voters. He was for all the planks in the Contract With America and each article of impeachment. He has always voted against abortion rights, and as recently as a town meeting Wednesday night said "I don't think abortion should be legal" and that Roe v. Wade should be overturned. He continues to vacillate about the symbolic meaning of the Confederate flag, and he's no fan of gun control.
Yet Democrats from Massachusetts to California are flocking to vote for him in Republican primaries, and surely not just out of a desire to make mischief for the rival party. Were Mr. McCain actually to get the Republican nomination, the greater mischief would be inflicted on the Democrats. Mr. McCain is the G.O.P. candidate who has a serious shot at ending the era of Clinton-Gore.
This is not just because Mr. Straight Talk Express is, in the character department, the archetypal un-Clinton. Nor is it just because he tilts at lobbyists and big money and champions campaign finance reform (an also-ran issue in polls of voters' priorities). The other, subtle weapon in Mr. McCain's political arsenal is that, in a brilliant coup of triangulation, he is as much the un-Kenneth Starr/un-Henry Hyde as he is the un-Clinton. He's the first major G.O.P. presidential candidate in years who is not running as a pious moral scold in hock to the religious right.
Instead of proselytizing for his own religion to get votes, Mr. McCain has described his faith as "something that's between me and my family." He was the sole G.O.P. candidate who declined an invitation to kowtow to the Christian Coalition at last fall's Road to Victory conference, and yet he did meet with the gay Log Cabin Republicans and spoke of being "proud" to have their support. He was the first Republican candidate with the guts to urge his party to show Pat Buchanan the exit.
Throw in Mr. McCain's rejection of supply-side tax cuts and you don't have a liberal, but you do have a conservative who won't scare away the moderates who decide elections. He alone has positioned himself to deflect the inevitable Gore attack that a Republican president will throw the monkey wrench of voodoo economics into a booming economy. Nor do swing voters have to worry that Mr. McCain will owe Pat Robertson or Jerry Falwell a say in public policy or that he'll be policing anyone's sex life. (Indeed Mr. McCain has readily owned up to the tomcatting in his own past.) The Arizona senator has thrown in just enough pro-choice rhetoric to beguile voters for whom abortion is a secondary issue into believing that he's not Draconian on Roe -- and, taking the bait, the National Right to Life Committee is running commercials attacking him. Mr. McCain's surly G.O.P. enemies -- hard-core right-to-lifers, Tom DeLay, Trent Lott -- may be more valuable in a national election than most G.O.P. friends.
Tough as it is to believe now, George W. Bush, the former "compassionate conservative," was initially programmed to be the candidate that Mr. McCain is -- a moderate who might appeal to independents and independent-minded Democrats who were turned off by Bill Clinton yet found the puritanical perpetrators of the Starr report even more egregious (and frightening). But Mr. Bush, falling right into the same traps as Bob Dole in '96, never got beyond his kinder, gentler slogan and is already fatally stuck to the flypaper of the religious right.
Just as Mr. Dole returned a Log Cabin contribution early in that race, making himself look intolerant and petty, so the Texas governor refused to meet with Log Cabin this time, telling Tim Russert such an encounter would be "a political nightmare." It is a nightmare -- for Mr. Bush -- and it cost him one of the country's foremost thinkers on education reform, Diane Ravitch, who resigned from his campaign on principle after he spurned Log Cabin.
Eager to please social conservatives, Mr. Bush failed to stand up to Pat Buchanan's Jew-baiting and then marketed his own sectarian religious beliefs. Like Mr. Dole in '96, he has also backed into endorsing a hard-line Human Life Amendment. As a piece de resistance this week, the tone-deaf Bush campaign fielded Ralph Reed, former executive director of the Christian Coalition, as its spokesman on "Larry King Live." There Mr. Reed had to defend the governor's appearance at Bob Jones University, a school that forbids interracial dating, ridicules Catholicism on its Web site and threatened gay alumni with arrest for trespassing should they show up on campus.
Why would Mr. Bush's campaign move so far to the right? It's the same thinking -- that you can pander to a right-wing base and hope centrist voters suffer amnesia on Election Day -- that led the G.O.P. to defeats not only in '96 but in '98. Even at the height of impeachment and even in the South, religious-right-embracing incumbents were thrown out -- including South Carolina's governor, David Beasley, North Carolina's Senator Lauch Faircloth and Alabama's governor, Fob James. Pandering to the far right in 2000 -- a time when gay couples can embrace on "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" without prompting complaints to ABC -- would seem to be more ill advised than ever, including in the increasingly globalized demographics of states like South Carolina, let alone California. Mr. Bush's campaign also seems not to recognize that in primary season 2000 -- unlike primary season '96 -- there are three, not one, all-news networks, as well as a more pervasive Internet, amplifying and codifying his every last pander.
In the fall, Mr. McCain would have little such baggage -- even as he possesses a biography that makes Governor Bush look just like what his father called him, Boy George. But Democrats who are worrying about the prospect of a race against Mr. McCain shouldn't lose sleep yet. The same G.O.P. minds that blew it in '96 and '98 are doing everything possible to shore up Mr. Bush.
Typical of their prescient thinking was the conservative pundit Robert Novak's Dec. 30 column promising that Mr. Bush's public touting of Jesus "actually enhances prospects of his wrapping up the Republican nomination by early February." On The Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial page Mr. McCain is thrashed repeatedly as a "crank," a "Clintonian," a perpetrator of an agenda with "more holes than a Harold Ickes deposition," a faux creation of his "idolators in the media." One of its sages has called Mr. McCain's tax policy a probable "fatal mistake" (even though a Time/CNN poll shows that 72 percent of Republicans in South Carolina echo Mr. McCain, not Mr. Bush, on tax cuts), and just yesterday desperately (and patronizingly) trumpeted Mr. Bush as having "a softer personality" that would appeal to women.
Doesn't softer mean weak? Well, never mind. Kamikaze thinking like this should make Gore partisans jubilant, for once again the hard right is in full froth, busily transforming a potential Republican victory into a lost cause.

HEADLINE: Fog Delay Of 3 Hours Hits JetBlue On First Flight

BYLINE: By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
Stymied only by weather, the nation's newest discount airline, JetBlue, began service yesterday in its main market -- upstate New York -- with a flight from Buffalo to Kennedy International Airport.
"When you use technology the way we do, you can be efficient," said David Neeleman, the founder and president of JetBlue. 
 He made the comments in a prepared statement moments before airline executives and dignitaries, including Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Senator Charles E. Schumer, boarded the 162-passenger A-320 Airbus, and then were kept waiting for nearly three hours by fog.
The airline hopes to operate three flights a day between New York, Buffalo and Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Besides Rochester and Syracuse, the airline hopes eventually to expand to 36 cities around the country, using Kennedy as its hub.
The start up of JetBlue has industry experts and airline executives watching to see whether it can survive.
JetBlue is entering a tough market. Less than half of the 39 airlines that have begun operations in the last decade still remain, according to the federal Transportation Department.
But company officials hope that the airline's low fares, new planes and strong financial backing will keep it flying.
Mr. Neeleman, a former executive at WestJet, helped to found Morris Air, a Utah-based carrier that Southwest Airlines bought six years ago for $129 million. He said JetBlue would be profitable within a year.
To keep costs and delays to a minimum, company officials hope to capitalize on the low maintenance requirements of the new A-320 planes, which include all-leather seats and television monitors with up to 24 channels. JetBlue will officially begin its service between Buffalo and New York on Thursday. The airline expects to expand to Rochester and Syracuse within 18 months, Mr. Neeleman said.
Other low-fare airlines have been grounded for a variety of reasons, including poor finances, maintenance and safety questions and crashes. But JetBlue officials hope that their start-up will have staying power. The venture is backed by $130 million from the billionaire investor George Soros and Chase Capital Partners and is said by analysts to be the best financed airline venture since the 1950's.
"From the standpoint of initial capital, they are one of the largest, if not the largest in history," said Richard Bittenbender, a vice president and senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service.
But there is some risk, he said. "I think that the primary downside would be that to the extent the economy softens and the rest of the industry lowers its ticket prices, we could see a company with a thin operating margin that would be unable to support itself like other larger, more established companies."
The inaugural flight was scheduled to take off from Kennedy at 7:30 a.m., but did not leave the tarmac till nearly 10:30 a.m.
Just as all the financing in the world could not prevent the weather-related delay, so could the flight also not avoid a little politics during this campaign season.
Mr. Giuliani, the Republican candidate for Senate, was at the airport early, hopping from interview to interview announcing and taking some credit for the new service.
Low-cost air service has long been of concern to upstate voters and politicians who want their support, and it was a central topic in a speech that Mr. Giuliani's opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, gave on the upstate economy here on Monday.
Establishing cut-rate air routes upstate was a central campaign pledge of Senator Schumer in 1998. And JetBlue and federal aviation officials said today that it was Mr. Schumer who was largely responsible for the service.
Indeed, the mayor's place in the take-credit pecking order became clear as he stood, rocking on his heels, through a 45-minute news conference, waiting for his turn to speak. He was last.
The airline will charge $45 one way between Buffalo and Kennedy and as little as $129 round trip depending on travel time. Other airlines charge $109 to $400 for the same flight.
David S. Stempler, the president of the Air Travelers Association, a passenger advocacy group based in Washington, called JetBlue's beginning a "shot in the arm for competition" in the New York region.
American Airlines, for example, is already offering round-trip fares between Kennedy and Buffalo for as low as $109, according to company officials. Just as JetBlue has begun its services between New York and Florida, both Southwest Airlines and Delta Express have also increased their flights between Islip, N.Y., and Tampa, Fla.

The Hong Kong Association of Banks followed the United States Federal Reserve's lead and raised interest rates by a quarter-point. The association increased short-term savings rates to 4 percent from 3.75 percent, and the city's biggest lenders immediately began announcing rises in their benchmark retail lending rates. Hong Kong's currency is pegged to the United States dollar, so changes in United States monetary policy are often followed by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and by the bank association.

EMPIRES OF THE SAND
 The Struggle for Mastery in the Middle East, 1789-1923.
 By Efraim Karsh and Inari Karsh.
 Illustrated. 409 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
 Harvard University Press. $29.95. 
 With "Empires of the Sand," Efraim and Inari Karsh attempt a major reinterpretation of Middle Eastern history in the "long 19th century," which stretched from the French Revolution to the final peace settlements after World War I. The importance of this period for the Middle East is immense; indeed, the whole Middle East agenda in the 20th century was laid out between 1915 and 1922.
The Ottoman Empire, which had maintained a kind of regional order for six centuries, was extinguished. Radically new national borders were established in those years, and these still stand. At the same time, the resentments and conflicts generated by the war and by the postwar settlement have been equally durable -- a shattered and embittered Armenian nation, a failed Kurdistan, an Arab world divided into suspicious small states and above all the Arab-Israeli conflict.
The story of these events has of course been told many times, but Efraim Karsh, the director of the Mediterranean studies program at King's College, the University of London, and Inari Karsh, a scholar of Middle Eastern history, believe that this story has been governed by a number of self-serving myths. Among the chief myths are the following: the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century was a helpless pawn in the hands of its far more powerful and aggressive European rivals; the European powers intended all along to dismantle the empire; the Ottomans did not enter World War I as a partner of Germany and Austria of their own free will but were either beguiled by German promises or forced to join the Central Powers by the dark designs of the Allies, especially Russia; and the revolt led by Sherif Hussein in 1916 represented a true Arab national movement.
In assaulting these myths, the Karshes bring a lot of artillery to bear, and their book is distinguished by both clear, vigorous writing and much new research. The tale of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire is hideously complicated, but they hold it all together in a narrative that is not only coherent but often dramatic. Yet in the final analysis, "Empires of the Sand" is unsatisfying and at points even annoying.
To start with, the authors' approach is startlingly old-fashioned. It is all diplomacy and war. The enormous demographic, economic, social and cultural changes that reshaped the Ottoman Empire in the 19th and early 20th centuries go almost unmentioned. One would never guess that there were huge displacements of Muslim populations from Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and the Caucasus, or that the empire's population underwent rapid growth in the decades before World War I because of improvements in public health and internal security. One could not surmise that the press in the Ottoman Empire was gaining in influence, literary culture was flourishing and education was spreading rapidly. Even in the arenas of administrative and political reform, we are given only glimpses, although Ottoman statesmen were striving not only to keep their empire together but to recast it as a modern state.
All these changes were constantly present in the minds of the empire's rulers and shaped Ottoman actions quite as much as the doings of the British, French and Russian governments. What we are given is war and diplomacy without context.
A second problem lies in the sources used -- or not used -- by the authors. They have searched the Public Record Office in London quite effectively and even found some new veins of ore in that much-exploited mine. But they seem to use only published documents from the French and German archives. Most troubling, they make very little use of the Ottoman archives, which are relatively accessible for much of the period they cover. Surely the Ottomans ought to be allowed some voice of their own.
Still another problem is the authors' habit of making blanket characterizations of motives and purposes, when the evidence they themselves present would permit very different constructions. The two principal leaders of the Arab revolt, the Sherif Hussein of Mecca and his son Faisal, are subjected to a withering critique of everything they did or said. Yet even on the facts included here, Hussein and Faisal were no worse than two ambitious men trying to hedge their bets and make the best deal they could in the chaos of the war. How were their actions in any way different from, or more corrupt and self-serving than, those of the British and French statesmen the Karshes admire?
What is finally most unsatisfying, however, is the authors' insistence that they are the first to make a serious critique of the myths they identify, when in fact every one of these myths has been subject to intense scrutiny for the last four decades. For example, Ottoman diplomatic skill in a very difficult environment has attracted increasing admiration from many scholars. And I cannot remember when the Arab revolt was not looked upon with considerable skepticism.
On the other hand, the authors might be accused of creating a countermyth of their own. Never have the intentions and actions of Russia, France and Britain in the Middle East seemed so benign. One can hardly imagine why Middle Eastern politicians and intellectuals might have feared them. It is perfectly clear, as the authors argue, that the Great Powers did not want the Ottoman Empire to collapse into chaos. Yet it is hardly arguable that they meant to dominate every aspect of life there as far as they could, and were quite ready to dismantle the empire if that was to their advantage. There is nothing particularly sinister about this -- that is how great powers have behaved since time immemorial, and how the Ottomans themselves behaved in the empire's glory days. But neither was there anything benign about it. The conduct of the Great Powers was undeniably a grave threat to the Ottomans and their way of life.
The Karshes have, as they intended, given us a controversial book, and its forceful and provocative presentation will make it an important contribution to the literature. But "Empires of the Sand" falls well short of transforming our understanding of the Middle East during the last decades of Ottoman rule.

HEADLINE: On Harassment Of Tenants

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your article on tenant harassment "Is It Harassment? Or Is It the Law?," Jan. 16 confirms what tenant activists had predicted in 1997 when the rent laws were weakened to permit landlords to remove all apartments with rents over $2,000 from the rent regulatory system as they become vacant. 
 That change gave landlords a substantial economic incentive to force tenants to move out, because, once a tenant was out, landlords could, by taking advantage of vacancy increases and capital improvement pass-alongs, increase the rents over $2,000 and be relieved of any form of rent regulation.
While few landlords may use physical violence, the kinds of harassment described in the article -- and observed every day by tenant lawyers and organizers -- are no less devastating for tenants.
Your article should be required reading for the City Council members when they consider the extension of the rent laws this spring, so that they will appreciate that further weakening of the rent laws will lead to yet greater harassment.

Lights, Action in France For Second Disney Park

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
THE early struggles of Disneyland Paris, which the Walt Disney Company opened at Marne-la-Vallee east of Paris in 1992, may have led some to believe that Europeans don't like amusement parks. But in fact, the eventual huge success of the park prompted Disney to announce in September that it would build a second theme park next door to the first.
The leftist Paris daily Liberation recalled that some had described the arrival of the first park as a "cultural Chernobyl." Yet that did not deter Disney, which owns 39 percent of the company that runs Disneyland Paris, from announcing plans for a new $615 million, 62-acre park that will focus on film studios, animation and television. The official opening is planned for April 2002, 10 years from the inauguration of the first park. Nor did it discourage the French authorities, who are delighted with the prospect of 5,000 jobs that the new park is expected to generate. 
 Whatever some Europeans may think about theme parks, the majority seem to be voting with their feet. In the year that ended Sept. 30, Disneyland Paris drew over 12.5 million visitors, more than any other attraction in France. Only about 41 percent were from France, with 17 percent from Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, 15 percent from Britain and 10 percent from Germany.
"In California, we needed 35 years to reach those results, even though the park there is larger," said Gilles Pelisson, chief executive of Euro Disney S.A., the company that operates the French Disney park.
The planned studio park is not a first for Europe. A park called Movie World near Bottrop, Germany was recently sold by Warner Brothers, the film and entertainment unit of Time Warner, to an American company called Premier Parks; Warner Brothers and Premier are building another movie park outside Madrid, to open in 2002.
The Disney project in France will have the familiar features: Guided tours of television and movie studios, demonstrations of special effects, a half-hour stunt show in which actors portraying secret agents attempt to arrest a band of terrorists on a set that recreates a Mediterranean village.
Disney's entry into the world of European theme parks was not an easy one. Disney spent roughly $5 billion, much of it borrowed, to develop the original park, only to swing open its pink Victorian gingerbread gatehouse in 1992 in the midst of a European recession. The park's hotels drew so few guests that some had to be shuttered temporarily. To hold costs down, Disney kept salaries low, which over the years has led to strikes by disgruntled employees, mainly low-paid performers.
Moreover, Disney's original marketing strategy for the park proved a flop. Originally named Euro Disneyland, signaling the parent company's intention to reach out beyond France to all of Europe, the park was soon quietly rebaptized Disneyland Paris, in recognition of the need to focus on national markets. Advertising for the park was also redesigned along national lines, taking into account the fact that features of the park that appealed, say, to Germans would not be the same ones that drew Dutch or British visitors. Wine was added to Disney menus, an omission that had irritated the French, and perhaps most important, ticket prices were temporarily reduced.
Thanks to these initiatives, annual attendance quickly took off. By the mid-1990's, Disneyland Paris was attracting more than 9 million visitors a year. Still, as the interest burden on Euro Disney's debt caused financial losses to mount, the company was forced in 1995 to obtain a five-year debt rescheduling agreement from banks and forfeiture of management fees from the parent Walt Disney Company.
For the fiscal year 1998-99, which ended Sept. 30, Euro Disney recently reported a $24 million net profit. Though that was 46 percent less than the year before, the drop was attributed mainly to a resumption of Euro Disney's payment of management fees to the Walt Disney Company and to stagnant attendance, which was hurt by the World Cup soccer tournament in France in the summer of 1998. Even so, Disney was buoyed by the rise in occupancy rates at the six big hotels at Disneyland Paris to 82.6 percent for the year that ended in September, from 80.9 percent the year before.
So successful has Disneyland Paris been at drawing crowds that some local politicians in the Marne-la-Vallee area are growing nervous. Euro Disney is pushing to increase the returns on land it bought in the early phase of the project, and this spring a megamall built by an outside developer and designed to be Europe's largest is set to open at Serris, next door to the original park. On one weekend in late October, when crowds flooded into Disneyland Paris, highways leading to the park were completely blocked by traffic. The addition of the Serris mall, plus the new park, some local leaders say, will lead to continuous gridlock.
In November, the local Communist Party demanded an immediate study of the possible impact the mall and park will have on local roads; not to be outdone, the conservative Assembly for the Republic appealed to the ministers in Paris responsible for transportation and the environment for early action to double the size of the A4 highway that links the French capital and the park.

Broadband

BYLINE: By William Safire 

 BODY:
His necktie was defiantly ripped away. His old-fashioned mustache was shaved off. All but rocking on the soles of his feet and snapping his fingers to illustrate his with-it-ness, the new boss of AOL Time Warner Inc. announced to the world, "I am a broadband person."
As if that transmogrification were not enough, Gerald M. Levin, age 60 1/2 -- and until now a fairly dignified executive -- added plaintively that "I'm an interactive guy." But interactive is yesterday's word, for years meaning "acting upon each other" and then meaning "reciprocating by electronic means"; now used mainly by aging Wunderkinder straining to keep pace, it awaits the coinage of its opposite, interinactive, "a one-way flow of data." Hip, connected e-lexies in this winter of our content provision focused on his broadband personhood. 
 That word has a glorious history in the northern dialects of Britain. "The verie euill thoughts of the wicked," wrote Zachary Boyd in "Last Battell," his 1629 masterpiece, "in that day shalbe spread out and laide in broad-band before the face of God." James O. Halliwell, in his 1847 Dictionary of Archaic and Provincial Words, reminded us that a band was a space 20 yards square, and broad-band was "corn laid out in the sheaf on the band, and spread out to dry after rain."
Over three centuries, the band evolved from a marked-out strip of land into "a range of radio frequencies or wavelengths." In 1956, W. A. Heflin's U.S. Air Force Dictionary defined broadband as "a band having a wide range of frequencies." In our time, it morphed into a medium that not only transmits a wide range of radio, video and data signals, but also can carry other independent channels in their own bandwidths, or space on the band. (On these multiple spaces the communicators still seem to lay out wet corn.)
Then metaphor began to beat the broadband. The adjective (sometimes hyphenated) is still used to describe multiplex communications networks, but in more sweeping terms. "In a broad-band world," wrote Andrew Sullivan in The New York Times, "even the distinctions among telephone wires, cables and satellites will be erased. There will be one cultural-economic tube." The Milwaukee Journal Sentinal wrote of "the broad-band war, the struggle over who will control the ability to deliver seamless streams of data to consumers."
And now, in an interinactive linguistic breakthrough, Mr. Levin has extended the metaphor from networks to human beings. "I am a broadband person" means more, in my view, than "I work in an industry characterized by simultaneous transmission of multiple channels." It means that he sees himself as a person with broadband personal characteristics -- able to think, speak, gesture, persuade, broadcast and data-disseminate in an unlimited way, while chewing gum at the same time.
Look at yourself, dear reader. Are you a narrowband person, cribbed, cabin'd and confined in a strait gate -- or are you the sort whose mind ranges far out over the amber waves of corn? By rejecting the "verie euill thoughts of the wicked," you, too, can mega-merge yourself into a broadband person.
If that's your choice, move quickly to so identify yourself, because telecommuning lingo changes fast, and broadband is sure to be crowded out soon.
 
The Agnostic Bit
"Bits are agnostic," Bill Gates, self-dethroned boss of Microsoft, told Forbes's ASAP magazine. "They don't care how they get where they are going -- only that they arrive in the right order and at the right moment."
William Marmon of Chevy Chase, Md., demands a ruling as soon as possible: "Has agnostic -- holding the belief that the ultimate reality on matters such as the existence of God is unknowable' -- been successfully morphed by high tech to mean 'indifferent'? Everywhere one hears the word used in this perverted manner. Where do you stand?"
Hier stehe ich, in the phrase of one unwaveringly opinionated Worms dieter. In theology and usage, I react religiously.
The etymology of agnostic is plain. It's Greek for "not known." Here's how it was coined to describe the position held by people who are neither atheists nor believers: "It was suggested by Professor Thomas Huxley at a party . . . one evening in 1869, in my hearing," wrote R.H. Hutton in 1881. "He took it from St. Paul's mention of the altar to 'the Unknown God.' "
Henry Kissinger, in his 1979 memoirs, "The White House Years," was among the first to give the word a metaphoric stretch: "I favored European unity, but I was agnostic about the form it should take." The intended meaning (I have always been able to read Henry's mind) was more "noncommittal" than either "undecided" or "indifferent." In 1983 Warren Buffett, the investor, treated the word as a verbal shrug: "I look at stocks, not markets. I am a market agnostic."
Broadbandniks in the computer world have adopted that stretch toward neutrality. "We will deliver 'infrastructure agnostic' solutions," announced Steven Francesco, C.E.O. of N(x) Networks, "that can handle both voice and data and be deployed over virtually any network." (The odd-looking company name is pronounced "nex" or "nix"; the new agnostics, professing a hands-off attitude, sometimes take a negative approach.)
Another computer executive, holding that the alliance of Dell and Red Hat came as no surprise, commented, "They've always been operating-system agnostic." At Microsoft, Gates's usage gives the reheated term about bits a sense of "indifferent" to the point of "uncaring."
Can we ever know if this new meaning -- as in "Frankly, Scarlett, I'm agnostic" -- will overtake the theological sense?
Sure we can. Give the voguish jargon a little time; this anomie-tooism will pass because it is a highbrow term that lacks specificity. Neutral passively takes no side; noncommittal suggests a more active refusal to take a side; indifferent describes a mild state of apathy; unconcerned imputes aloofness; and uncaring has a hint of cruelty. But the new agnostic wanders all over the lot.

HEADLINE: Q. & A.;
A Buzzer That Kept Buzzing

 BODY:
Q I live in a rent-stabilized apartment on the Upper West Side. A few weeks ago, the buzzer system in the building went awry and was buzzing constantly. Tenants who called the owner's office were assured that someone would fix the problem by the end of that day, as the next day was a legal holiday. The buzzer was not repaired as promised and was going all night, keeping me and other tenants awake. I called a 24-hour locksmith and paid out of pocket for the buzzer to be disconnected. When I sent the receipt in with a reduced rent check the following month, the owner returned both the receipt and the check with a letter saying that the deduction was "unapproved and unacceptable." How do I get him to reimburse me without going to Housing or Small Claims Court? . . . Madeleine Tress, Manhattan.
A David Ng, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer, said that while the letter writer could file a complaint for diminution of services with the state Division of Housing and Community Renewal, that would not be useful since the problem was quickly resolved by the letter writer herself. 
 Accordingly, Mr. Ng said, unless the landlord can be persuaded to reimburse the letter writer voluntarily for the amount of the repair, there would be two basic options remaining, both of which involve judicial intervention.
The first, he said, would be to sue the landlord in Small Claims Court -- an option that requires the letter writer to take the initiative. The second would be for the letter writer to continue to withhold the money from the rent and wait for the landlord to bring a nonpayment action in Housing Court. When that happened, Mr. Ng said, the tenant could raise as a defense the necessity for calling the locksmith to fix the broken buzzer.
The judge, in making a decision on whether the defense is valid, would likely make a determination on whether the tenant provided sufficient notice of the problem to the landlord and whether the tenant's action in calling the locksmith was reasonable. If so, Mr. Ng said, the court would then make a determination on whether the amount charged by the locksmith was reasonable.
 
Responsibility for Water Damage
Q We live in a co-op apartment. The upstairs neighbor's defective refrigerator icemaker caused a severe leak into one of our dining room walls. Since the room has not been painted for some years, the same color paint is not obtainable, thus necessitating repainting the entire room. What are we entitled to, the paint necessary to paint the room or the paint plus the fee that that the painter will charge? . . . Bonnie Dwork, Forest Hills, N.Y.
A Ronni Lynn Arougheti, a lawyer who is president of Heron Ltd., a Manhattan property management company, said that since the damage was caused by the upstairs neighbor, the neighbor would be responsible for compensating the letter writer for her loss. And since it is now impossible to match the paint on the damaged wall with the paint on the undamaged ones, Ms. Arougheti said, it is likely that the neighbor would ultimately be responsible for the cost of painting the entire room.
However, she said, if the letter writer has insurance, she should first submit a claim through her insurance carrier, who would then go after the neighbor for reimbursement.
"This is a prime example of why all shareholders should carry homeowners' insurance," Ms. Arougheti said.
If the letter writer does not have insurance, she said, she could file an action against the neighbor in Small Claims Court if the neighbor does not voluntarily agree to pay for repainting the room.

HEADLINE: FILM;
L.A. Noir or College Comedy, the Genre Is Real Life

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SRAGOW; Michael Sragow writes about movies for Salon.com. He is writing a biography of the director Victor Fleming.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
THEY always want you to do what they've seen you do before," says Curtis Hanson, who last directed (and co-wrote) that extravagant blend of slam-bang police saga and character study, "L. A. Confidential."
In his new film, "Wonder Boys" (opening Feb. 25), Mr. Hanson has outwitted Hollywood's powers that be. With the help of his star, Michael Douglas ("the motor of this movie"), he has taken Michael Chabon's ebullient novel, set in and around an English department at a Pittsburgh college, and come up with a different kind of movie. It's a pothead picaresque, a contemporary screwball comedy-drama with a mellow emotional tang. 
 Mr. Douglas plays the middle-aged creative-writing teacher Grady Tripp, a once-hot novelist unable to complete his latest work. (He is currently on Page 2,611.) Tobey Maguire co-stars as Tripp's most formidable student, James Leer, a weirdly talented prevaricator poised to overtake his mentor in accomplishment and glory.
But the director insists that his film is only partly about writers confronting "past promise and future success, and chances for renewal." This movie, says Mr. Hanson, "isn't all about writing; it's about characters who think that it's all about writing. And they find out that it's not."
Mr. Hanson has never been a wonder boy, at least not in the sense of enjoying an overnight sensation. Although he has had his share of commercial triumph (with the 1992 evil-nanny thriller "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"), it took him decades to reach the forefront of American moviemakers.
He started out as a screenwriter (notably for the 1978 suspense film "Silent Partner"), turned director with exploitation films and youth movies like the engaging comedy "Losin' It" (1983) and had his breakthrough as a writer-director with the skilled Hitchcockian pastiche "The Bedroom Window" (1988).
It was just three years ago that "L. A. Confidential" raised Mr. Hanson to master-craftsman status. This simultaneously sweeping and incisive adaptation of James Ellroy's epic period crime novel took home all the major critics' awards in 1997 and won Mr. Hanson and his co-writer, Brian Helgeland, the Academy Award for best adapted screenplay. By the time that happened, says Mr. Hanson, "I had worked too long and hard to attain a position that would allow me to make movies I wanted to make" to let the burden of success derail him.
But in another sense, Mr. Hanson is a wonder boy -- or maybe a wonder man. Speak to him about great novels or movies, and you get intelligent enthusiasm raised to the level of awe. Unlike generations of film school and video store movie brats, he is a gifted autodidact who never separated his love for moviemaking from his love for all types of storytelling and who, as a high school dropout (from Tarzana, Calif.), learned his way around a film set as a photographer and journalist. For example, when some pictures he took of Faye Dunaway helped win her the female lead in "Bonnie and Clyde," Mr. Hanson had the leverage to hang out during the filming in Texas and interview Arthur Penn and Warren Beatty. The editor of "Bonnie and Clyde," Dede Allen, became his editor on "Wonder Boys."
As the chairman of the U.C.L.A. Film and Television Archive (the first one to be appointed), Mr. Hanson was busy mounting a Billy Wilder retrospective while completing post-production work on "Wonder Boys." Hoping to arouse interest in the program among students whose collective memory dates back to "Reservoir Dogs," he was co-host for a recent series of double bills with present-day film school idols: on the final night, David O. Russell ("Three Kings") helped him introduce "Sunset Boulevard" and "The Lost Weekend."
That back-and-forth approach informs his moviemaking. "L. A. Confidential" did justice to Mr. Ellroy's juicy material about the collision of power, celebrity and economic development in Los Angeles of the 1950's. But it used all that fresh content about L.A.'s underbelly (and Mr. Hanson's novel ideas about ambience and lighting) to revive the heightened, stylized world of adult drives and emotions where many of Hollywood's classic melodramas took place.
"The big thrill of making 'L. A. Confidential,' " Mr. Hanson recently said over dinner in West Hollywood, "was that I got a phone call from Billy Wilder inviting me to meet him at his office. And as soon as I walked in he said, 'Next you want to do a comedy, right?' And I said, you're right, how did you know? And he said: 'I felt the same way after I did 'Double Indemnity' and 'The Lost Weekend.' The trouble is, getting them to let you.' "
Not even Mr. Wilder, whose comedy credits range from "Some Like It Hot" to "Kiss Me, Stupid," ever made a movie like "Wonder Boys," in which the slapstick complications keep getting pushed to the side to make room for psychological complexities. Its characters are as stoned and libidinous as they are literary, yet Mr. Hanson keeps them moving according to a woozy kind of clockwork.
TRIPP'S randy gay editor, Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr.), comes visiting and sniffing for the long-promised manuscript; Tripp's wife leaves him; Tripp's mistress, the college chancellor Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand) -- who is married to the head of the English department, Walter Gaskell (Richard Thomas) -- announces to Tripp that she is carrying his baby. All this happens right before the kickoff of a campus literary festival ("WordFest"), which features speakers like a wily blockbuster writer known as "Q" (Rip Torn). Before long, Tripp's protege, Leer, shoots the Gaskells' blind bulldog and steals Walter's prize possession: the jacket Marilyn Monroe wore when she married Joe DiMaggio.
This movie is not just some gimcrack farce. Mr. Hanson says, "When I was about to launch into the project, people said, 'You're smart to do something so different,' which on the surface it is. But it was very similar to 'L. A. Confidential' in the degree of emotional involvement I had with all these characters. Each has a yearning for family and a fear of family. They're all wrestling with what the hell they should be doing with their lives."
The thrillers Mr. Hanson made as a director for hire before "L. A. Confidential" were also filled with doppelgangers, illusion versus reality games and troubled relationships and marriages -- all the stuff of identity-crisis comedy and drama. Mr. Hanson patterned these ingredients to lend texture to the plots, and to give actors like Rob Lowe (in "Bad Influence," 1990), Julianne Moore (in "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle") and Meryl Streep and Kevin Bacon (in "The River Wild," 1994) bouncy subtexts. In his most recent films, though, these elements bubble up, naturally and unpredictably, from a rich and humanistic take on life.
"L. A. Confidential" was a box office disappointment, but it upped Mr. Hanson's standing with actors, who admired the performances he got from the likes of Russell Crowe and Kim Basinger. "They looked at the performances in some of my other films, and began to see a continuity," he says.
"What this can mean is that you have better success with actors when you're trying to get them into your project. But in this case it meant that Michael Douglas was interested in the 'Wonder Boys' script, and communicated that interest to me. I read it based on that, with Michael in mind."
The book's Tripp is obese and classifies himself as "homely." So, as Michael Chabon said by telephone from Berkeley, the novelist assumed from the start that "whoever they got was going to look different."
"I was pleased when it became Michael Douglas because he would get the movie made, but the more I thought about it the more I realized he had this kind of character in him," Mr. Chabon continued. "I thought back to 'The China Syndrome,' where he played kind of a longhair, and to 'The Streets of San Francisco,' where even though he was playing a cop he was loose and rangy, and you thought there might be a joint in the breast pocket of his tweed jacket."
Mr. Hanson understood that Grady Tripp was not just emotionally and intellectually adrift: he was a benign, accepting man who endeavored to help James Leer as an unconscious tryout for fatherhood. "The essence of this character keys into the difference between Michael and his father, Kirk," says Mr. Hanson. "There's a vulnerability Michael has -- a softness, if you will -- that he's not afraid to expose, along with a humor, and a lightness. I thought he could be funny without working at it. That's what convinced me he could do it."
What clinched the deal for the superstitious Mr. Hanson was that his own first name popped up twice in the novel, along with a character based on H. P. Lovecraft, whose "Dunwich Horror" he had adapted in 1970. Plus, the actress Elizabeth McGovern had once advised Mr. Hanson to work with the screenwriter Steve Kloves -- she said, "You're both serious, but you both make me laugh" -- and Mr. Kloves's name was on this script. Mr. Kloves is best known as the writer-director of "The Fabulous Baker Boys" (1989); he had never before done an adaptation. And because of the novel's gamboling form and pothead hero, a lot of writers would have agreed with Mr. Chabon that "it wasn't the most obvious candidate for a movie." But Mr. Kloves says that this lack of obviousness made it seem obvious to him, "because I love the films of the late 60's and early 70's."
Mr. Chabon encouraged him to make the material his own, even if it meant deleting whole sections in an effort to focus the action and keep it both absurd and believable on-screen. (To those who have read the book, it registers as an in joke that Tripp's eccentric Jewish in-laws are now proper Yankees who live in a house that is "a great place to wake up on Christmas morning.") Intense script work continued when Mr. Hanson entered the picture.
Mr. Kloves says: "Curtis is more naturally drawn to being clear than I am. But he's clever about clarity. He doesn't hit the audience on the head 17 times. And he goes to great depths when he thinks about a scene. When he presents ideas, he thinks them through -- he knows how they will affect the fabric four scenes down."
With all the trims and changes, the story is still a loosey-goosey fable about the perils to maturity that lurk in the adolescent quasi-bohemia of a college campus. (It is quite an achievement for a director who never finished high school.) The film says that life as well as literature is about holding to hard choices. And that is how Mr. Hanson makes his movies.
"Wonder Boys" starts with Tripp reading a student's story, then beginning his voice-over narration -- over his own voice. It's as if the filmmaker is signaling, "Pay attention!" Mr. Hanson hoped the movie would seem "unthought-out," but also wanted every detail to add to the total effect. For example, it made more sense to him for the self-dramatizing James Leer to be a fan of Douglas Sirk and William Inge ("another wonder boy") than a devotee of Frank Capra, as he is in the book. And the film's visual poetry is the kind that sneaks up on you. "It's partly just Pittsburgh in the winter," says Mr. Hanson. In a typically beautiful, unstressed nocturnal car shot, the viewer sees, in the director's words, "the furnaces and the factories of Pittsburgh glowing behind James Leer, the one whose future lies before him," while darkness shrouds the driver, Grady Tripp.
As a Bob Dylan buff since childhood and a devotee of his score for "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid," Mr. Hanson thought that Mr. Dylan's work would be an ideal musical expression of Tripp's taste and character. Luckily, Mr. Dylan was a fan of "L. A. Confidential." He visited the "Wonder Boys" editing rooms, and watched an hour and a half of rough-cut footage. "One day a little package arrived with a CD in it," Mr. Hanson recalls. "Can you imagine? I popped it into the player and heard a song with Dylan's unique imagery, about being 'in love with a woman who doesn't appeal to me,' and success, and things out of the movie that are also things he knows more about than any of us." (In addition to Dylan's song, Mr. Hanson built the score around nine singer-songwriters, including Leonard Cohen and Neil Young, and used three other Dylan numbers.)
At the outset, Mr. Hanson told Mr. Chabon that the best director for his novel would have been Hal Ashby ("The Landlord,""Shampoo"), because of his embrace of humanity in all its quirks and failings. Yet Mr. Hanson seems more like Ashby's mentor, William Wyler: he charges every frame in a way that sets off the vitality of his performers. "Wonder Boys" leaves you with a gallery of eloquent faces, from the fuzzily anxious Mr. Douglas and the sometimes haunted, sometimes goofy Mr. Maguire to the effervescent Mr. Downey, who brings to his part the comic charisma of the young Jack Lemmon.
Indeed, Mr. Hanson's adept handling of large, diverse ensembles -- even more than his yen to tell engulfing stories -- may be what gives his latest films their depth and dash. It is as if, by playing straight with the living figures in front of him, he is staying true to what he sees as the ultimate theme of "Wonder Boys": "Without life," he says, "there is no art."

State Expected to Change Affordable Housing Law

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
THE General Assembly is expected to enact changes in Connecticut's 11-year-old Affordable Housing Appeals Law in April, based on recommendations made earlier this month by Gov. John G. Rowland's Commission to Study Affordable Housing.
The recommendations, arrived at after six months of deliberations by a 30-member commission composed of municipal officials, union organizers, developers, housing advocates and members of the state legislature, are intended to increase the amount of affordable housing in Connecticut. 
 They are also designed to give the towns more leverage in rejecting affordable housing proposals, which many of them have opposed for, among other reasons, size, density, impact on schools and town services and environmental objections.
Representative Patrick J. Flaherty, a Coventry Democrat who is co-chairman of the commission, said public hearings would be held in Hartford this month on nine bills embodying 44 recommendations before being sent to legislative committees in March.
Reactions to the report by developers were swift and negative. "By agreeing with low-income housing proponents and creating more onerous income restrictions, the commission has produced a chilling effect on the private sector," said Samuel Fuller, regional vice president of AvalonBay Communities, builders of luxury rental complexes.AvalonBay has used the law's requirements that towns make a range of housing available to overcome resistance to its large apartment houses.
The report recommends increasing the number of required affordable units in a development from 25 to 30 percent, and reducing the income eligibility level from 80 percent of the area or state median income (whichever is lower) to 60 percent for half of the affordable units, 80 percent for the rest. Developers receive a negotiable bonus of additional units when they use the law.
"We would have to get free land in a city like Stamford," said Mr. Fuller, "in order to get a return that investors would accept. In towns with snob zoning where affordable housing was targeted by the law, there is no way to build rental housing without the carrot of the law."
A goal of the original law was to have an inventory of affordable housing amounting to 10 percent of all dwellings in every municipality. But as communities grew the 10 percent climbed proportionately until towns lost hope of achieving it.
The larger municipalities of Bridgeport, Hartford, New Haven and Danbury have reached or exceeded the 10 percent goal. In southwestern Fairfield County, Greenwich, with 5.20 percent, has done better than its wealthy neighbors -- Darien, New Canaan, Wilton and Westport -- with around 2 percent.
Scarcity of land in the area has driven housing costs up to unprecedented levels, making Stamford and the surrounding gold coast towns anomalous to the rest of the state.
"The suburbs of Stamford," said Joe McGee, a vice president at SACIA: Business Council of Southwestern Connecticut, "drive up the median income to $94,300, among the highest in the nation. You are eligible for affordable housing if you earn $75,000 a year. The impact has been that when developers build they can meet criteria for affordables at the highest end, driving out people at the $45,000 a year level. We have many workers earning $55,000 a year who can't find housing. It's a quirk in the formula."
The state median, Mr. McGee said, is around $60,000.
"We have a crisis in housing," he said, "impacting our ability to grow our economy. Developers are obviously upset, but you can't establish public policy based on the needs of developers."
Jay Fisher, president of Griffin Land & Nurseries, which has proposed a 640-unit subdivision in Bloomfield, agrees that "anything that makes it more expensive to build is a deterrent, which is why wealthy towns want to push it that way."
In hammering out a series of compromises, Greg Ugalde, a commission member from Torrington who is chairman of the Developers' Council of Connecticut, said that the report "recognized some of the concerns that towns have as well as recognizing the need for more affordable housing."
He called a moratorium recommendation "very exciting for the towns." Under the proposal, a community that has affordable housing equal to 2 percent of its total dwellings is eligible for a three-year moratorium on building more. The town may continue adding to the supply in 2 percent increments, until it reaches 10 percent when it becomes exempt from the regulations.
"Many of us felt this will encourage towns to create more units, working toward a moratorium," said Mr. Ugalde.
The root of the problem, said Rick Redniss, a Stamford land use consultant and a commission member, "is the fact that most of Connecticut's 169 towns never enacted zoning regulations that encourage affordable housing, in direct violation of the purpose of the law."
According to Tim Hollister, a Hartford lawyer who specializes in affordable housing issues, "the law now requires regulations but without a deadline, so less than half of the towns have them."
THE report recommends setting a deadline for enacting a set of model zoning regulations for creating affordable housing. They would be devised by the state's Department of Economic and Community Development and distributed statewide, providing towns and developers with guidelines. Currently, planning and zoning officials are confronted with developers' proposals that do not comply with local zoning, or which attempt to create new zoning. Two members of the commission -- Vincent Ditchkus Jr., a Milford alderman, and Dr. Stephen Katz, a Milford psychologist -- issued a minority report. "The best thing is to repeal the law," said Mr. Ditchkus. "They have pitted the cities against the suburbs, and the suburbs should fight back. Developers have the upper hand over small towns by using the law as blackmail to build what they want."
State Senator William H. Nickerson, a Greenwich Republican who was not a commission member, opposed the existing law from its inception. "It assumes that planning and zoning officials are wrong and they bear the burden of proving they are right. That is unheard of in Connecticut law," he said.
Under the affordable housing law a town must prove that an affordable housing project is a threat to the public welfare if it rejects a developer's application. Developers have tended to prevail in court, or in negotiations at the local level when towns are reluctant to defend a lawsuit.
Diane Fox, the town planner in Greenwich, served on the commission and believes that its recommendations, if enacted, will have a positive effect on the towns. "The increase in units," she said, "and the increase from 30 to 50 years during which affordable units must remain so may give more teeth to municipalities." Under the existing law, affordable units go to the market rate after 30 years.
Since 1989 fewer than 2,000 affordable housing units statewide have been created using the law, according to informal statistics gathered by Mr. Hollister, the Hartford lawyer. Moreover, according to a report by the Connecticut office of Fannie Mae, the nation's largest provider of mortgage funds, , 68,000 new units are required to meet current needs and 48,000 households pay 50 percent or more of their income for housing. (Fannie Mae, formerly the Federal National Mortgage Association, is the nation's largest purchaser of home mortgages on the secondary market.)
"While I have concerns about whether we are undermining affordable set-aside units the percentage of housing units sold or rented below market rate by making development more difficult," said Mr. Hollister, "I supported the commission's recommendations to see whether they will work or not."
Successful challenges to the law had been rare since its enactment. But that began to change last spring when the State Supreme Court and the Superior Courts of New Britain and Bridgeport ruled in favor of Glastonbury, Newtown and Bridgewater in rejecting affordable housing applications. Vulnerability of potable water sources, open space, and septic systems -- concerns that were negligible 10 years earlier -- emerged as new reasons to oppose the law.
In addition to recommendations for change, the commission wants more financial support for housing from the state.
"That includes use of $50 million of an expected $200 million surplus for the year 2000 with which to create a Housing Trust Fund, and a $20 million Affordable Housing Incentive Fund," said Representative Flaherty, the commission's co-chairman. The amounts are intended to offset the reduction in state bonding for affordable housing from $125 million in 1989 to $5 million last year.
The Housing Trust Fund would be used to further racial and economic integration by, among other things, expanding multifamily rental housing opportunities in suburban and rural communities and homeownership in central cities. The Affordable Housing Incentive Fund would reward municipalities that built new affordable housing to adequately cover the additional services required by the housing.
"The idea of the existing law," said Eric Schwartz, president of Pemberwick Associates, second generation developers of market rate and affordable housing in Greenwich, "was to create an incentive for developers to build projects that made economic sense for them, while providing the affordable housing stock necessary throughout the state. It's become a case of cities against towns. Cities have plenty, and they want towns to share the burden."

State's Rose Business Hangs On -- Just Barely

BYLINE: By NANCY POLK 

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH roses are going to be delivered all over the state tomorrow, it's a safe bet that most of them were grown any place but here. Roses have never been a huge crop in the state and if it weren't for William Pinchbeck, the business would be dead in Connecticut.
Mr. Pinchbeck, 67, who runs William Pinchbeck Inc., on the Post Road in Guilford, is the last man standing in the state's rose business. The company has been around for about 70 years and Mr. Pinchbeck said he sells about $1 million worth of roses a year. 
 Shirley Ferris, the state commissioner of agriculture , said the Pinchbecks have succeeded for one reason:
"They have paid a lot of attention to their market," said Ms. Ferris. "The Pinchbecks, who grow wonderful roses, sell within Connecticut and deliver to the New York market. They saw the market, reached out to the market and it sustained them."
Rose growing is fast disappearing as a national crop. In 1968 there were 347 growers. In 1998, the latest year that figures are available, 132 rose growers survive, said James Krone, executive vice president of Roses Inc., the greenhouse rose growers association in Haslett, Mich. He said 409 million roses were sold in the United States in 1968, all of them grown domestically. In 1998, 1.3 billion roses were sold, but only 325 million were domestic. The rest were imported.
"The grower losses, indeed, have been significant," Mr. Krone said. "Without question, the primary cause is low-cost imports of fresh cut flowers."
He said most roses are grown in Columbia and Ecuador because of the cheap labor there. South American roses account for between 70 and 80 percent of the roses sold in the United States.
According to Bob Heffernan, executive secretary of the Connecticut Nursery and Landscape Association, from 1960 to 1980 there were three or four growers in the state. The largest, Pierson's, went out of business after a century in 1991 at the height of the recession.
How has Mr. Pinchbeck survived in a field where others have failed? "They kept a close eye on costs," Mr. Heffernan said.
Although the greenhouse recently had dripping icicles hanging along the roof line, the inside was toasty warm and moist. It is heated in fall and winter by steam that the Pinchbecks produce by burning sawdust, wood chips, old pallets and ground up Christmas trees.
"That's what's kept us in business," Mr. Pinchbeck said. At the height of the energy crisis in 1973, he made the switch from oil to wood. In summer, they use natural gas.
Mr. Pinchbeck has been joined in the business by his son Tom, 35, the fourth generation in the rose business. Tom Pinchbeck explained that the two major costs in growing roses are fuel and labor. "Not too many young people want to go into agriculture around here," he said. Their work force of 35 comes mostly from Puerto Rico and Mexico. Both Pinchbecks have mastered Spanish.
"They can tell us about their family problems back home and we can ask them to please not take vacation the week before Valentine's Day," William Pinchbeck said.
The Pinchbecks have developed other strategies to remain competitive. They own a fleet of second-hand delivery vans so they can control the quality of their product. They do their own equipment maintenance. They specialize in a type of rose called Forever Yours that is dark velvety red. It has been so successful that the deep red rose has decorated the plush New York Plaza Hotel. "This is an exquisite rose," said Matthew Kolins of Atlas Floral Decorators located at the hotel. "It opens quickly and is beautiful, very fragrant with a rich color."
They continue to seek out innovations such as new colors. They are considering adding a sunny yellow rose called Excitement to the 15 varieties they raise.
"We try to stay away from fad colors," said the younger Mr. Pinchbeck.
He recently returned from a trip to Holland where he saw roses in terra cotta and a near black that he does not plan to raise. "We are always trying to keep abreast of changes which fit into our style of growing," he said. "I learned a lot. The Dutch are very big on technology with more emphasis on machinery."
They are gradually switching their stock from soil-based roots to pots of coir, a shredded coconut husk that holds water and air. They place the plant's roots into a pot with a brick of coir, add water and watch it swell to fill the pot. About half of their 90,000 bushes are in pots. They use drip irrigation which saves labor in the quarter-mile-long glass house. Every six years they replace their bushes as production begins to decline.
They also sell Christmas trees from their field and potted roses to garden centers.
Tom Pinchbeck said their quality of life is important. "I can walk to work and go home for lunch." His father adds, "I get to see my grandchildren every day."
Tom lives on the property with his wife, Bonnie and two daughters, Clara, 4, and Ellie, 2. The elder Pinchbecks live down the road.
Both men are Cornell University graduates. The senior Mr. Pinchbeck attended the College of Agriculture, but his son studied liberal arts. Nonetheless, he said, "I always knew I wanted to be in this business."
They said they confine distribution to Connecticut and New York so that their roses are fresh. William Pinchbeck explained that the roses are shipped in ice while still in tight buds and over two weeks gradually open and die. "Just like people they have a life cycle," he said.
The Pinchbecks sell their roses sorted by stem length. The longest are 26 to 30 inches. The shortest 10 to 14 inches. Calculating the price is based on demand and competition.
"The return per square foot is the most critical," Tom Pinchbeck said. "Different varieties bring in different amounts." He said the average return is about $10 per square foot.
The Pinchbecks sell mostly to wholesalers and florists, but will also sell to individual customers who stop by.

HEADLINE: Space for Research Is Expanding in Cambridge

BYLINE: By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
DEVELOPERS and life-science companies are planning to invest about $1 billion to build more than three million square feet of new research labs in Cambridge, more than doubling the amount of research and development space in this six-square-mile city.
Most of the buildings will go up within a few blocks of Kendall Square, where the region's biotechnology industry first put down roots in the early 1980's. Five new buildings with 1.2 million square feet of space are in construction or were recently completed in the area. Four other projects in the neighborhood with a total of 2.1 million square feet of research space have received city approvals. 
 Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that are not building themselves have agreed to lease most of what is in construction, some at annual rents approaching $50 a square foot. The buildings themselves are among the most costly commercial structures to build, costing about $350 a square foot from conception to fit-out.
The lure for this new construction is the intellectual firepower of the Cambridge work force, forged at some of the world's top colleges, research institutes, medical schools and teaching hospitals here and across the Charles River in Boston.
On the Boston side of the Charles, where the medical schools of Harvard, Tufts and Boston Universities conduct training programs, 1.3 million more square feet of biomedical and pharmaceutical labs are being developed, according to E. Owen Donnelly, deputy director of the Boston Redevelopment Authority.
The biotechnology, biomedical and pharmaceutical companies of the life-science industry put a premium on locating in areas with plentiful academic links because new products usually spring from lab discoveries.
"To keep our pipeline full, we want to be in the Cambridge market," said Peter J. McCawley, development manager for Amgen Inc., which with 1999 revenues of $2.4 billion is the country's largest biotechnology company. "It's no secret that Cambridge has the largest and best pool of scientific research talent in the world." Amgen sells products based on genetic information unearthed by biotech research, such as Procrit and Epogen to enhance red blood cells.
Amgen, which is based in Thousand Oaks, Calif., started work last year on a $100 million, 285,000-square-foot lab on a 71,000-square-foot site that it bought for $1.4 million in the slow market of 1994. Instead of building back then, it developed a research center near Boulder, Colo. But in 1998, it converted that lab into a manufacturing plant and started to plan its Cambridge project.
Amgen's sliver of a site here, once part of a sprawling plant that made fire hose, will be wedged in front of the research lab for Genzyme Inc. and across the street from a new lab being built for Biogen Inc. by Boston Properties Inc. Once its building is completed, Biogen will occupy 740,000 square feet in the neighborhood where it first leased space in 1984. Together, the three biotechnology companies make 5 of the industry's 10 best-selling products, according to a 1999 report by Ernst & Young.
Amgen shimmied into this little site because, like most life science companies, it wanted to be near industry colleagues and researchers to share knowledge and insights. "We can't convince these companies to take cheaper space in the suburbs," said Steve Buckley, regional director of the life-sciences practice for Ernst & Young.
THE presence here of an industry giant like Amgen, therefore, creates a new critical mass for the life science industry that will attract even more companies, according to John A. Southard Sr., an economist for Tordo Wheaton Research, a unit of CB Richard Ellis, an international real estate firm.
"Also, it signals that the region's real-estate market is finally moving to the next level of growth after one of the nation's worst downturns," he added.
Cambridge has about 11 million square feet of offices, 8 million square feet of which is in the East Cambridge neighborhood bordered by Kendall Square on the west and the Charles River on the east. It also has 2 million square feet of research labs for bench scientists who work in controlled environments, known as wet labs.
By late 1999, the labs had a vacancy rate of less than 1 percent, versus 24 percent in 1995. Since then, rents have risen as much as 150 percent to reach $50 a square foot annually for some new space, said Gregory W. Hoffmeister, a broker for Spaulding Slye Colliers International.
STAR attractions for these companies are Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which together own about half of the city's land, said Jean E. Strain, Cambridge's director of economic development.
Another magnet is the Whitehead Institute/M.I.T. Center for Genome Research in Kendall Square, which is about halfway between the two colleges. Scientists there are mapping the human genetic material. Such research could revolutionize health care with the ability to grow new organs and design drug therapies for a person's genetic profile.
With wet lab space set to jump from 2 million to about 5.3 million square feet, the city will adopt new zoning rules to prevent overbuilding.
With the real-estate boom of the 1980's, new zoning rules and special permit requirements appeared. Last month, Cambridge passed an 18-month moratorium on new permits for projects larger than 20,000 square feet around Kendall Square, and in April is expected to adopt a new zoning code to control future growth citywide, said City Councilor Henrietta Davis.
"Two years ago, property owners worried that it would become more difficult to build and they could loose value," said Mr. Hoffmeister, the broker.
Indeed, the city may reduce the ratio of usable building space to site size, from a floor area ratio of 4 to 2.5, said Lester W. Barber, Cambridge's director of zoning. For Amgen, that could have meant a building of 200,000 square feet rather than 285,000 square feet, for a loss in value of $30 million. Amgen's new eight-story building, designed by the Stubbins Associates, is to be completed in June of next year.
The current strong demand increases existing property values, said Thomas Ragno, a vice president of Beacon Capital Partners Inc. Beacon owns Technology Square, a five-building complex with a million square feet of space in Kendall Square. The complex, completed in 1975, is currently being renovated and expanded. Mr. Ragno projects $50-a-square-foot rents for the new research and development space, designed by Sasaki Associates.

HEADLINE: Highlights in the Life Of Marian Anderson

BYLINE: By LESLIE KANDELL

 BODY:
MARIAN ANDERSON'S most famous recital was sung into a microphone. It was only half an hour, outdoors on a cold Washington Easter in 1939, and the selections, including "Ave Maria" and "America," were not showy or virtuosic.
At that time she was 42. Anderson's contralto voice was probably the world's most magnificent, but her recital on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial before 7,500 enthusiastic listeners was about more than vocalism. It showed her determination to prevail, even after the Daughters of the American Revolution barred her from performing in Constitution Hall because of her race. 
 Considering that the conductor Arturo Toscanini reportedly said to her, "A voice like yours is heard only once in a hundred years," she spent precious little time singing opera, but devoted herself to art songs and spirituals, studying privately. Neither was by choice; her race precluded scholarships and opera roles. When at almost 60 she finally sang at the Metropolitan Opera, she was its first black soloist.
First seen last year and newly revised for Black History Month, "My Lord, What a Morning: The Marian Anderson Story," a short play about her produced by the Kennedy Center, is less a musical play than a meeting of music and theater, enhanced by audio technology. It is told in a sort of simultaneous flashback, with Anderson as an old woman recalling her life.
The play will be performed today at 3 p.m. and tomorrow at 10 a.m. and noon in the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College. The number to call for information is 251-6222. The hourlong play begins when she declines a request to sing a concert in her hometown, Philadelphia, feeling that age prevents her from being at her best. At the end, she decides to accept, in a gesture of perseverance for those who will come after her. As the older Anderson, Charlene Williams is on stage the whole time.
Over the years, Philadelphia made several such requests of Anderson, and there was another that she agreed to after first refusing. That one, described in "Marian Anderson: A Singer's Journey," by Allan Keiler, (Scribner, published this month) came while she was depressed after a critical drubbing of her 1924 Town Hall recital. Her eventual change of mind put her back on the path that would lead to the Lincoln Memorial concert, the support of Eleanor Roosevelt and until Anderson's death in 1993 a series of honors.
Carlyncia Peck, a singing actress from Washington, plays the young Anderson. She and the play faced the challenge of re-creating Anderson's artistic integrity and her striking, if uneven, vocal quality.
Ms. Peck's live performance is blended into a continuation with her own recorded voice, which in turn progresses to Anderson's. Some of the recorded songs, like Brahms's "Von Ewige Liebe" and Handel's "He Shall Feed His Flock" and excerpts from spirituals, play under an acted scene and then fade.
Notably absent are "Ave Maria" and any squib from the role of Ulrica in Verdi's "Masked Ball" with which she made her breakthrough Met debut. The playwright, Kim Hines, and the producers could find only a bad recording of "America" from the Lincoln Memorial recital, so they substituted "America the Beautiful," sung by Ms. Peck.
Ms. Peck had to acquaint herself with some of Anderson's repertory and read the autobiography, but though born in Connecticut, she has not visited Marianna, Anderson's Danbury home.
In a telephone interview, Ms. Peck spoke of what children should take from this play: "The lesson of perseverance, and that it pays off when you have faith in yourself and what you do. In Town Hall, when Marian was denied success, she had to look up and say, 'I'm O.K.' We pray that the younger generation goes away with a sense of identity and pride."
Though Ms. Peck has not experienced the overt prejudice Anderson battled, she referred to something less direct. "When I go into a certain type of upper-economic store," she said, "the feeling that you get if you're approached too soon, or not soon enough, is definitely connected. I don't think that's a sleeping dog yet. We have made major strides, but we still have a long way to go."

HEADLINE: For Immigrants Chasing a Dream, Citizenship Doesn't Come Easy

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
AMID flag waving and cheers, 350 new citizens at the County Courthouse here last month declared their allegiance to the United States, their numbers but not their enthusiasm diminished in recent years.
Like 59-year-old Giovanni Abbate, formerly of Sorrento, Italy, and 20-year-old Kamyna Myeka Robinson, who emigrated from Jamaica, many of those who took the oath of citizenship last month, spent years working their way through paperwork and government regulations to achieve their goals. 
 One group of 176 citizens was sworn in on Jan. 12; a second group of 174 was naturalized on Jan. 26, fulfilling long-held dreams to vote in the United States, become eligible for federal jobs and share the privileges and responsibilities of American citizenship. Swearings-in usually occur once or twice a month.
For all of last year, however, there were only 1,728 new citizens in Westchester, compared with 1,951 in 1998,2,079 in 1997 and 3,462 in 1996. For many, the wait for citizenship has been as long as four or more years, the result of a bottleneck caused by bureaucratic mix-ups and fingerprinting errors made by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, County Clerk Leonard N. Spano said. After a green card is obtained and an application for citizenship is filed, the usual wait is less than a year.
"I kept having to go back and back, over and over again for fingerprinting," said Carl John Hegarty, 34, who emigrated from Dublin 10 years ago. "Then the I.N.S. lost my paperwork. It was a mess, but in the end it was worth it."
The problems have since been resolved, the County Clerk said, with the number of new citizens expected to reach higher levels in coming months.
As has been the trend in the last decade, most of the new citizens in 1999 were from the Caribbean and Central America -- with the largest number, 396, coming from Jamaica. Another 120 came from the Dominican Republic, 26 came from Trinidad and Tobago and 22 from El Salvador.
The following are excerpts from interviews with 10 people sworn in at the two most recent ceremonies by Mr. Spano, who -- as clerk of the State Supreme Court and the County Court -- is vested with the responsibility to administer the oath of allegiance to the United States to all candidates for citizenship.
 
'Too Cold Here'
At the age of 5, Kamyna Myeka Robinson arrived in the United States from Montego Bay, Jamaica, with her father and a brother and a sister. It had been two years since the children had seen their mother, who like many new immigrants, was the first in the family to emigrate and who worked as a household maid to save enough money so the others could come as well. Ms. Robinson, now an office receptionist, recalled that 15 years ago when she walked out of Kennedy International Airport for the first time, it was a cold, wet and to her, depressing September day. "All I could think of was that I wanted to go back home to beautiful Montego Bay," she said. "And although I still complain that it's too cold here, I'm happy now." She said her formerly middle-class family "suffered a big culture shock having to start from the bottom all over again in the U.S." In school the teachers did not understand the child's Jamaican patois, and her American classmates were unfriendly. Although the early years were difficult, Ms. Robinson is preparing to study merchandising at the Fashion Institute of Technology next fall, observing that as a citizen, she will be eligible for many scholarships.
Ms. Robinson said all of her family members applied for citizenship at the same time several years ago and hoped to be sworn in together. Although the eldest daughter is now a citizen, the others in the family continue to wait.
 
Now, a Chance to Vote
Now that he is finally a citizen, Giovanni Abbate will have an opportunity officially to go on record and say who he thinks should be president of the United States. As a new citizen, it is a responsibility he regards seriously -- unlike some citizens who were born here and take voting for for granted.
"I will vote for who I think will do good for the country," said Mr. Abbate, who dressed in his best suit and tie to honor the occasion of his naturalization. "I have a lot to figure out, because I consider the presidency to be very important."
When he arrived in the United States in 1967, Mr. Abbate worked in the construction industry, logged long hours and saved his money for the future. He met his wife, Carmella, also an Italian immigrant, in Westchester, and she too has become a naturalized citizen. The couple have five children and three grandchildren.
 
A New Life After Mexico
When he was a small boy and living in Mexico City, Rafael Barajas remembers always being hungry. "My family was very poor," he said, "and I carried bags for the ladies at the supermarket to buy food and shoes."
At 33, he is working as a handyman at Beach Point Club in Mamaroneck and happy to be thriving, he said. After arriving in the United States 12 years ago, he took jobs in the construction industry and was so tired from digging all day and stanching the flow of blood from his raw hands at night that he said he thought, "What am I doing here?"
"My father said: 'Come back if you want to. We have enough beans and rice,' " Mr. Barajas recalled. "But my cousin who lived here reminded me that nothing is easy in life, and I decided that he was right."
Mr. Barajas studied English two nights a week at a high school and finally got a better job. Now that he is a citizen, he said, his next step is to vote "and help decide what kind of government is right."
After that, he will try to bring his girlfriend, who works for a bank in Mexico City, to Mamaroneck, so they can marry and raise a family.
 
'Life Is Still Hard'
Unsure of her command of the English language, Maria Julia Ramos, who became a new American citizen on Jan. 26, spoke through her 23-year-old daughter, Silvana Ramos.
"My parents gave up their life and started a new one for us," the young Ms. Ramos explained, saying that her father, Julio Ramos, a taxi driver in Maldonado, Uruguay, left his homeland first and sent for Maria Julia and the children after establishing himself in Ossining.
Today, Mr. Ramos works as a handyman, and Mrs. Ramos is a domestic worker. Lourdes, another daughter, is married and has a child. Julio, a son, is attending a trade school, and Silvana is a bartender.
"Life is still hard for them," Ms. Ramos said, "but my parents own their home now, and in most ways, their life is better."
 
From Army to Police
For Carl John Hegarty, 33, of Yonkers citizenship signals an opportunity to accept a job offer from the New York Police Department -- a new step that he welcomes after the hurdles leading up to his naturalization.
The difficulties began when he arrived at Kennedy International Airport from Dublin in 1990, and no one showed up to welcome him. "If there had been a plane going back, I would have taken it," he said.
Mr. Hegarty served as a sergeant in the Army in the Gulf War and put in five years of active duty and five years in the reserves, but he could not re-enlist because he was not a citizen. And without citizenship, he has not been able to accept a job as a police officer. In the last several years, his application for citizenship has hit many dead ends, and with the economy thriving in Ireland, he said he thought more than once of returning to Dublin.
But when he made it through the snow-covered roads to the County Courthouse on Jan. 26, at least some of the frustrations of the past melted away, he said, as he took his place among the assembled group. "In many ways it was a relief, but it was also very anticlimactic," he added.
 
'Worth It in the End'
Like many of the others who were naturalized last month in Westchester, Amani Marji, 31, who was born in Amman, Jordan, said the process of becoming a citizen was a matter of long waits and many frustrations, although it was "worth it in the end."
Mrs. Marji of Dobbs Ferry and is an office worker for the county clerk and has lived in Westchester for 10 years. She is married to John Marji, an American-born plumber of Jordanian descent. Because she joined a large and established Jordanian community from Yonkers when she first arrived -- a large crowd of relatives greeted her at Kennedy with flowers and hugs -- she said she did not experience the isolation and feelings of rejection that many immigrants do.
The family has worked hard to assimilate, she said. And even though they speak Arabic at home and often cook Jordanian meals -- "so that our three children know their heritage," she said -- everyone in Mrs. Marji's large and extended family communicates in English at school and work. Her father works for Liberty Bus Lines in an office, and two of her uncles work at the Yonkers Water Treatment Plant. "We are doing well here," she said.
 
Last in the Family
At 80, Sogmen Petrosian, originally of Erevan, Armenia, is among the oldest of Westchester's new citizens. Escaping a chaotic political situation at home, she came to the United States nine years ago with her son, Karapet Petrosian, her daughter-in-law, Sironush, and two grandchildren.
Knowing only a few words of English -- "You can't do very much without knowing the language," Mr. Petrosian said -- the grandmother is the last among her immediate family in Yonkers to become and American citizen. "But she is happy here," said her son, who drives a delivery truck and is a caretaker for an Armenian Church in New York City.
"In America it pays to work hard," Mr. Petrosian said. "We have our own home. My daughter graduated college. My son has a good job. This is a free country and nobody bothers you. So everything is O.K."
 
New Citizen From China
Fleeing political unrest in his homeland, Weidon Xia, 39, came from Chengdu, China, in the early 1980's to study civil engineering at the graduate school of the University of California at Berkeley.
Three years ago he accepted a job with the New York Power Authority and moved with his wife, Shing, a fellow college student from China, and their two children to Mount Kisco.
Although his mother, father and sisters are still in China, Mr. Xia said he has chosen not to return. At first it was concern over the 1989 riots in Tiananmen Square that stopped him. Now he wants to stay because the family has achieved a good standard of living here. In addition to renting an apartment in Mount Kisco, Mr. Xia owns a house in Syracuse.
"I have a good job, a good family, and other than the price of a home in Westchester being very high, we have a very nice life here," he said.
Mrs. Xia has also applied for her citizenship, but she is still waiting for her papers to be processed.
 
Sending Money Home
Jose Camacho, 35, a former resident of Moca in the Dominican Republic, was also among the new citizens sworn in on Jan. 26. Once a waiter at the Tarrytown Hilton, he had to stop working after he was hit by a car last year and became disabled. Until recently, he has been able to send money home to family members.
Mr. Camacho, who lives in Ossining and has been studying English at night at the local high school, said he looks forward to returning to work as soon as his injuries heal -- "and making money for a bright future."
Among the large group of immigrants from the Dominican Republic coming to Westchester -- there were 2,876 from 1990 to 1999 -- Mr. Camacho said he is rarely homesick for his homeland. His sister, Anny, and his brother, Juan Antonio, also live in Westchester and have become citizens, although his companion, Elisa Severino, who immigrated with Mr. Camacho in 1990, has not yet done so.

A Realtor Finds a Niche, Gay Couples Find Homes

BYLINE: By ANITA DENNIS 

DATELINE: MONTCLAIR

 BODY:
When Mark Hoebee and Larry Elardo decided two years ago that is was time to leave Manhattan for the suburbs, they wanted a place where a gay family could feel at home. A quick search on the Internet led them to Jaan Henry, whose agency these days lists and sells about 40 houses a year and boasts sales of $8 million to $12 million.
"There is a lot of economic clout in the gay community," said Ms. Henry, whose clientele is about 85 percent gay, though she is quick to add with a laugh, "I don't discriminate against straight people." 
 After doing social work and restoring old homes, Ms. Henry started out in real estate in 1984, working for a large mainstream company. But being a lesbian, she naturally saw a market for gay homebuyers.
Not surprisingly, that specialty didn't exist in the area, so she helped form a networking group of about 10 other gay and lesbian real estate agents. More and more, her business began coming from that referral base, and seven years ago she opened her own business here, Jaan Henry & Company.
"I realized this was a niche market," said Ms. Henry, 56. "People like to network with someone who is like them. If you are Asian, say, you might want to work with someone who shares a social and cultural understanding. The same is true in the gay community. People like to work with someone who is out and affirming."
Today, more than 15 years after starting out in the business, she says that while she knows gay and lesbian real estate agents throughout the country -- in fact, she has gathered a database of about 6,000 gay and "gay-friendly" agents nationwide -- she isn't aware of another agency in New Jersey agency with her specialty.
There are other very practical considerations as well, particularly in New Jersey, where liberal adoption policies have made the state something of a magnet for gay families in the area.
And like their counterparts in the straight world, gay couples do not always stay together. Since there are no clear-cut legal guidelines for dividing property, Ms. Henry can anticipate some of the legal and financial issues that the couples may face, andrefer them to those with useful advice.
For one client, Mr. Hoebee, finding a specialized realtor "was very important because we wanted someone who really understood what we were looking for. We wanted a diverse, integrated community. We wanted a place where there were not just gay and lesbian people but gay and lesbian families."
Mr. Hoebee and his partner, who now have a 15-month-old son, eventually settled in Maplewood, which along with neighboring South Orange has a thriving gay and lesbian community, according to Ms. Henry.
When Carol Morokoff, who also lives in Maplewood with her partner and their daughter, researched suburbs in the New York area, she learned that the towns most often cited as welcoming to gay and lesbian couples in the region were all in suburban New Jersey, and also included Montclair, Morristown and Plainfield.
Apparently, the state's reputation was deserved, because Ms. Henry says neither she nor her clients have ever faced discrimination in their real estate dealings. Her recent sales have ranged from a $74,000 condominium in Montclair to a $710,000 house in Glen Ridge.
In general, Ms. Henry says her clients are seeking proximity to the city, liberal political views, diversity and locally active gay and lesbian organizations. A history of progressive adoption laws has also fueled interest in the state, she says. In December 1997, New Jersey became the first state to establish that gay and unmarried couples should be subject to the same adoption standards as married couples, and that couples should not be denied the right to adopt because of their sexual orientation or marital status.
Then there are the details that people don't often think about. Ms. Henry does. For instance, she recommends that her clients ask their lawyers to draw up partnership agreements. "The laws in divorce are laid out," she said, but when a gay or lesbian couple split, disposition of the proceeds from the sale of a house can become an issue. A partnership agreement can also answer questions such as who will deduct the mortgage interest from his or her tax return.
Ms. Henry finds most people have not thought about these issues. "They think about romance and about their new house," she said.
Ms. Morokoff, who is a lawyer, likens partnership agreements to prenuptial agreements. "Is it an extra good idea to have one?" she asks. "Yes, but most people just don't like to think about it."
Among her current clients, Ms. Henry says, is a gay couple from Jersey City who have two children and want to move to the suburbs, a straight couple coming from New York who were referred by a gay customer, and a straight client moving from St. Louis who met her while she was showing a house in Montclair.
Ms. Henry and her two employees (who are straight) often work with homebuyers from around the country through her relocation service, crossroadsrelocation.org and (800) 4GAY-RELO. The service is a nonprofit effort that she has sponsored for the last six years. She says that offering it costs her about $40,000 a year for telephone, postage, printing, stationery and promotional items like magnets and pens. She finds out where callers plan to move, how much they have to spend, when they're going and other details, then puts them in touch a real estate agent in the area where they are headed. She devotes about 10 hours a week to it and considers it a way to give back to the community.
"Some people work with charitable groups," she said. "This is what I do."
In the end, Ms. Henry believes that clients of any description are looking for professionalism. "People want to work with someone who is knowledgeable, someone they can trust," she said. "I've worked with everyone from conservative F.B.I. agents to guys in red pumps. They all want to be associated with someone who is good at what they do. If you are successful, it speaks for itself."

In Carlstadt, Industrial Space for Cyberspace

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
IN an area around Central Boulevard in Carlstadt dotted with low-slung warehouses and manufacturing complexes the steel skeleton rising on a 12-acre site at the far western end of the thoroughfare is an anomaly. For it has more to do with cyberspace than industrial space.
Comdisco, the company that will occupy the site, will use the new building to house its clients' duplicate files to provide continuity services, formerly called disaster recovery services. If a client's computer files are wiped out or if the client's business results in an overload at its office the client can transmit data without interruption from the Carlstadt building. 
 The 302,000-square-foot building will be the Northeast technology services center for the international technology management company, based in Rosemont, Ill. Comdisco provides data services to businesses that range from banks and stock brokerages to dot-com companies and manufacturers.
The new structure will use raised floors to run the tangle of wires required by the high-tech equipment that will fill much of the space.It will also have enhanced heating and air-conditioning systems and a substation for additional electrical power -- as well as an independent power source with six diesel-fueled generators -- to keep the machines humming.
The Russo Development Company of Hackensack, which owns the development site within its 44-acre industrial park, is constructing the shell of the building and will lease it to Comdisco for 15 years with two five-year renewal options. Comdisco will pay to improve the interior space. No one involved with the project would disclose the overall cost but commercial brokers estimate it to be between $42 million and $63 million.
Brokers say the project is indicative of the appetite for industrial space -- and to a lesser degree office space -- by companies like Comdisco that are involved in servicing the technological and telecommunication needs of today's businesses.
A booming economy and the growth in technology-based companies have all combined "to bring more cerebral white-collar users into the industrial setting," said Jonathan S. Meisel, associate director at in the East Rutherford office of Cushman & Wakefield, the international commercial brokerage.
This is "only the beginning" of the activity, which "will grow exponentially as the use of the Internet grows," he said.
According to state figures, the number of high-tech related jobs in New Jersey, including telecommunications and computer software development and services, have grown by 25 percent from 1994 to 1999. As a result the number of such jobs grew by a total of 59,000 to 295,000 as of last year.
AMONG the companies that are taking or are expected to take industrial or commercial space are those that will provide Internet data centers, also called "server farms." Such centers manage Internet sites for businesses.
One such company, brokers said, is Exodus Communications, based in Santa Clara, Calif., which set up such a center in about 230,000 square feet at 300 Boulevard East in Weehawken. The 311,000-square-foot building, once used by the Metropolitan Opera for storage, is near the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel.
Other uses, they said, are so-called "telecommunications hotels," which are outfitted with the requisite equipment and electrical power for telecom companies to set up operations, including switching stations. One such "hotel" has taken shape on the upper floors of the former 1.2-million-square-foot Macy's department store building at 165 Halsey Street in downtown Newark. Tenants such as Level 3 Communication, and MCI/Worldwide have leased a significant amount of space in the building over the last 18 months, according to Cushman & Wakefield's year-end 1999 market report.
Now a group of Manhattan developers want to set up other telecom hotels in the state. The group -- comprising Young Woo, a principal of Young Woo & Associates, and a venture of Angelo Gordon & Company and Belvedere Capital -- has closed on a 240,000-square-foot warehouse off Exit 12 of the New Jersey Turnpike in Carteret. It also has signed a contract to buy a nearly 900,000-square-foot warehouse on Jersey Avenue in Jersey City, said Mr. Meisel, who with James Quinn, a senior director at the brokerage, is representing the group in the transactions.
Such users, in turn, are helping "to fuel the state's industrial real estate market by reducing the supply of properties and making a tight market even tighter," and Paul E. Giannone, a principal at Jacobson, Goldfarb & Tanzman Company, L.L.C, a Woodbridge brokerage which represented Comdisco in the Carlstadt project.
For instance, in the Meadowlands region where Comdisco's center is situated, his firm put the industrial vacancy rate at 6.37 percent at the end of 1999, down from 7.8 percent the year before. Over the same period, average asking annual rents rose to $5.50 a square foot, from $4.75; the rental rate for new buildings is $6.50 to $7.50 a square foot.
Mr. Giannone added that while such users conduct different businesses they are drawn to the high ceilings and raised floors that industrial properties provide, in order to accommodate "the high-powered guts in a building" needed to support their operations, which run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In addition, he said, they also need to be situated near a high-speed fiber-optic network.
THOSE factors were involved in Comdisco's decision to go forward with the build-to-suit project in Carlstadt, Mr. Giannone said. The company, he said, surveyed 25 properties, some as far west as Parsippany, but "none had everything the company needed."
Patricia M. Knoll, director of global real estate for Comdisco, said the Carlstadt site was chosen because it had all its approvals in place, was suitable for the size of structure the company wanted to build and its location. It is within a few miles of four of Comdisco's existing operations elsewhere in the Meadowlands, close to its client base in Manhattan and the rest of the New York metropolitan area and accessible to a fiber-optic network, she said.
Comdisco will consolidate operations that are now in the four nearby structures, together totaling just under 200,000 square feet, into the new building and still have 100,000 square feet left "to grow in the future," said Steven Harris, Comdisco's director of project planning.
With the growth in dot-com and e-commerce companies, which "are looking to back up their data, we have a new market segment," Mr. Harris said. The building, which 65 employees from the other locations will move to in phases from next December through July 2001, will be the largest of the 32 centers Comdisco operates in North America.
Mr. Harris said the centers his company operates have in the last three years moved away from the "old model" of such buildings being used only in the event of a disaster.
The new model, he said, is that businesses will also use the center to test their data systems or as a back-up data site.
Since computers are now a common workplace business tool the centers "also have evolved to be more people friendly," places and no longer have that bunker-like look of the past, Mr. Harris said.
As now envisioned the outside of the Carlstadt center will be faced in brick on three sides and have large windows to allow natural light inside. Also planned is a nearly 42,000-square-foot mezzanine at the front of the building. "We want it to look like an office building not like a concrete box," said Ms. Knoll.
Inside, along with the data center, the building will be divided into rooms for testing systems or conducting business, including a work and trading floor area with 1,000 seats and personal computers. There will also be conference rooms, lounges, T.V. rooms and canteens, Mr. Harris said. He added that his building would be "completely up and running" by July 2001.

HEADLINE: Taking A Shot At Their Olympic Dreams

BYLINE: By KENNETH BEST 

 BODY:
THREE years ago, while attending Connecticut College in New London, Gregory Skidmore attended a lecture expecting to learn about the Olympic experiences of Timothy Young, an alumnus who won a silver medal with the 1996 crew team that competed in Atlanta. He left the room inspired to fulfill his childhood dream of sailing in the Olympics.
"I got to hold his medal," said Skidmore, who is 23. "I held the dream in my hands. I decided to try and do it." 
 A sailing enthusiast from the age of 10, Skidmore at the time was ranked 213th in North America in the laser class of single-handed sailing competition, one of 10 sailing events that will take place in the Summer Games to be held in Australia in October. Within a year, the memory of holding an Olympic medal in his hands pushed Skidmore to the elite level of United States sailors; most recently he ranked as high as 12th in the United States and in the top 25 in North America.
Skidmore, who lives in Greenwich, is one of several Connecticut residents hoping to qualify for the United States Olympic Team that will compete in Sydney. Among them are Skidmore's friend and fellow laser sailing competitor, Andrew Scrivan, another 23-year-old from Greenwich; Anna Norgren, 25, of Orange, a teacher who competes in the hammer throw, a track and field event; and Richard DeStefano, 28, of Hamden, an exercise physiologist who competes in the javelin. Other state residents hoping to compete in Sydney include Carlos Parra, 22, of West Haven, a midfielder for the Miami Fusion of Major League Soccer; and Kristen Lilly of Wilton, a member of the champion World Cup United States women's soccer team.
While team-sport athletes may be selected for the Olympics after an invitation to try out for an all-star team, individual-sport athletes must qualify through direct competition just to get to the Olympic trials, where top finishers in each event or sport earn a spot on the United States Team. For today's Olympic hopeful it means raising money to keep training and for travel to the qualifying events. Some athletes can work, train and raise money, while others don't have the time to do all three if they are to make it to Sydney.
For Skidmore, who is competing in the laser class competition (the least expensive of sailing events) it has meant raising more than $100,000 from corporate and individual sponsors while completing his studies in economics and history, training throughout the year and sailing in key competitions in warm climates, including recent trips to Australia.
"I know I have to be just as good at fund-raising as I am at sailing," he said. "People like to help because they can make a difference. I try to share as much of my experience as possible with them, trying to give back as much as they give me."
Nearly 200 supporters from the Greenwich area will be able to track his progress with e-mail messages as well as a newsletter and a Web site (www.GloryDownUnder.com). He also has corporate support from Advest, the investment banking company based in Hartford that employs his father, Philip.
Skidmore and Scrivan met at the Riverside Yacht Club as youngsters and went through middle school and high school together before heading their separate ways to college. Scrivan recently graduated from Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, N.Y., with a degree in environmental sciences. The two describe themselves as best friends and find comfort in having each other around amid the strain of competition.
At every major championship there is a significant amount of pressure to perform, goals to attain and results to accomplish, Scrivan said. "Having my best friend around to laugh with and talk about the races takes the edge off," he said.
His breakthrough as a competitor came in 1997 at the Cork regatta, the largest North American laser championship held each year in Kingston, Ontario. He placed fifth and finished as the third American out of 160 competitors.
In addition to financing from people in the Greenwich community, Scrivan has lined up corporate support from Nestle and Hobie Sunglasses, and from The Boat Locker, business located in Westport.
The laser-class Olympic trials will take place in April in San Francisco.
DeStefano and Norgren often train together as part of a group of track and field athletes who find strength and support in numbers. Both balance working and training as world-class athletes. "You get fired up with your training partners," DeStefano explained. "We're all on the same page as far as what it's going to take to succeed. They're very crucial to my routine. It's why I stay healthy."
He began throwing the javelin in high school in South Windsor, after running the mile in track and playing baseball. While attending Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven, he refined his throwing technique. But it was after graduating college that he started to make great strides, steadily increasing his distances to his current best of 241 feet, which is still about 30 feet short from qualifying for Sydney. He was ranked 13th in the United States last year by USA Track and Field.
Two years ago, DeStefano began to organize a javelin festival in New Haven that has attracted javelin throwers from around the world. More than 180 athletes attended, including Brian Chaput of East Haven, a javelin thrower who is a member of the University of Pennsylvania track team.
For DeStefano, one challenge is to fit in training around his job conducting cardiopulmonary stress tests for pediatric patients at Yale-New Haven Hospital and his family. He is married and the father of two.
He has also managed to find time to gain sponsorships from Fovama, a rug store, and Klub Kehais, a throwing club based in North Carolina. His travel to the national Olympic Training Center in San Diego is covered by USA Track and Field.
Norgren is ranked 23rd in the world and fourth in the United States among women hammer throwers. Her best effort to date is about a foot short of the Olympic standard of 213.3 feet.
"The thing I feel pretty good about is that I've beaten all the top three throwers ahead of me in the U.S. at one point or another," she said.
Norgren, who is an English teacher at Stamford High School, began throwing the hammer in college, where most in the sport begin to compete. While at the University of Vermont, she was a 300-meter hurdler and also competed in the shot put. When her coach thought that increasing her running to the 400-meter might be too much distance, she started throwing the hammer.
"This will be the first time the hammer throw for women will be in the Olympics," she said. "It's kind of exciting. Once it becomes an Olympic event, that's when it becomes harder to compete."
In addition to training with the local group, which includes her fiance, the high jumper Sean Mahon, Norgren has worked with Stuart Togher, the coach of the men's American hammer record holder, Lance Deal. She also has trained with Bill Sutherland of Southern Connecticut State, who previously worked with Togher.
Norgren is quick to note that if she gets to Australia, she will not be the first Olympic athlete in her family. Erik, her 29-year old brother, provided the example when he began competing in the Special Olympics as a sprinter, long jumper and softball thrower. She had her first Olympics experience at the age of 9, as a Special Olympics volunteer.
She recently gained her first sponsorship from SoBe Beverage, which has its headquarters in South Norwalk.
The Olympic trials for track and field take place in Sacramento, Calif., in July.

HEADLINE: Around Grand Central, New Office Towers And a 54-Floor Residence

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
IN 1994, when it still had eight years remaining on its lease at 245 Park Avenue, smack in the middle of the tony Grand Central area between 46th and 47th Streets, the investment banking firm of Bear Stearns & Company began looking for a new home, and soon its name was linked to sites from Times Square to the financial district.
Today it is well along on its planned 45-story headquarters, sections of its steel structure already thrusting above much of Manhattan's East Side skyline. Once the new site, the entire block bounded by 46th and 47th Streets and Madison and Vanderbilt Avenues, became available, said James E. Cayne, the chief executive of Bear Stearns, "it was our first choice, our second choice, our third and our fourth." 
 While the renaissance of Times Square has been more dramatic, largely because of the depths to which the area had plummeted in the 1970's and 80's, the area around Grand Central Terminal is undergoing a significant transformation of its own.
In addition to the Bear Stearns skyscraper, another new office building is rising in the district and several others are in various stages of planning. Construction has also begun on a 54-story residential tower, while two boutique hotels are scheduled to open in the spring. The 200-foot walkways under the Helmsley Building at 230 Park Avenue leading to Grand Central Terminal are to undergo extensive renovation later this year, while the 34-story building itself -- bought by Max Capital Management last year for $225 million -- undergoes extensive refurbishing. And any number of buildings have recently completed multimillion-dollar makeovers or modernizations, or are in the process of doing so.
"Times Square has been the focus of development," said Tara I. Stacom, executive director of Cushman & Wakefield, the real-estate services group, "but in a few years Grand Central will be the main focus."
The main reason for the flurry of face-lifts and upgrades is economic, to command higher rentals, or, at the very least, to dissuade tenants from bailing out when their leases expire. But there is also the matter of pride -- of many landlords wanting to keep up with the neighboring Joneses, who in turn were inspired to dress up their properties because of the example set by the acclaimed makeover of Grand Central Terminal.
That makeover not only improved the experience for the half-million commuters who pass through it on an average day, "it amounted to a vote of confidence in the area's potential," said Robert L. Billingsley, vice president of Colliers ABR, the leasing agent for many properties in the area. Even the success of Times Square, which until recently had been a model only of urban decay, served as an example for what's going on in Grand Central. "The ripple effect of Times Square development and energy can be felt all the way to Third Avenue," said Mary Ann Tighe, vice chairman of Insignia/ESG, the real estate services group.
Because the new Bear Stearns building was intended to accommodate the business of the firm, not to attract tenants (although it will have retail tenants along Madison Avenue, as required by zoning regulations), its raison d'etre from the beginning was decidedly pragmatic.
"If you had your druthers and could afford it, this is what you would do," Mr. Cayne said. "It was the only major site available on the East Side of Manhattan, and its location and design convey convenience, stature and commitment."
Between December 2001 and the expiration of its current lease in 2002, Bear Stearns plans to move most of its 4,500 employees in New York into the new site, which is owned by CS First Boston and the al-Babtain family of Saudi Arabia.
UNTIL it was leveled to build the Bear Stearns building, the 12-story Knapp Building stood on the site, at 383 Madison Avenue, although it remained unoccupied for a dozen years. At one time it was the headquarters of the Manhattan Savings Bank and the Webb & Knapp real estate domain of William Zeckendorf Sr., whose circular penthouse office was designed by I. M. Pei.
Bear Stearns signed a 99-year lease for the land beneath its new building in 1996. But some employees will remain at its current headquarters, 245 Park Avenue at 46th Street, where its lease on the almost 600,000 square feet of space it has been occupying includes options for the 25 years beyond its 2002 expiration.
"This is the space we will have for internal growth," Mr. Cayne said, referring to 245 Park Avenue, "so we will end up using all or most of the space available to us under the agreement with Brookfield." The Brookfield Properties Corporation owns the building.
Both Mr. Cayne and Samuel L. Molinaro, the firm's chief financial officer, said that a major factor in their decision had been the restoration of Grand Central Terminal, which they said greatly enhanced the aesthetics and quality of life throughout the broader Grand Central area. And they were equally lavish in their praise both of the administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and of Metro North, whose train tracks run beneath the new Bear Stearns building, as well as beneath those of most buildings between Lexington and Madison Avenues.
"That was only one of the problems we confronted," said David M. Childs, a senior partner at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the architectural firm that designed the Bear Stearns building. Other challenges included the design, which calls for the base of the building to rise nine floors (seven of them trading floors with 2,000 trading positions) before two setbacks between the 10th and 17th floors. From there the building becomes an octagon until it reaches the crown, 777 feet above ground, where it is sheathed in a patterned, rolled, laminated glass -- or, in the architects' phrase, "crinkled glass."
T. J. Gottesdiener, the architectural firm's managing partner on the project, added that the building would be unusual in New York because "it's a square full-block site, and there are so few of them."
"So we took advantage of this geometry," he said, "by designing a skyscraper that starts square at the base and culminates in a crystal octagon in the skyline."
Moreover, within the Bear Stearns building will be a pedestrian arcade -- a blocklong passageway that will connect with Grand Central Terminal through a new north end passageway that can be accessed at either Madison Avenue at 47th or Vanderbilt Avenue between 46th and 47th Streets.
All this costs a great deal of money, of course -- almost $280 million for construction alone. But Mr. Cayne, a world-class bridge player and a self-described "pretty good" poker player, does not regard that investment as a risk. "It's the closest thing to a sure thing I've ever seen," he said.
How so? "Because opportunities like this don't come along often," he said. "You couldn't duplicate it because New York real estate has since gone through the roof."
Dr. Axel Stawski had the foresight to buy his properties almost 20 years ago at 360 Madison Avenue and just around the corner at 17 East 45th Street. Now his Kipp-Stawski company is knocking down the building on 45th Street and keeping only the steel frame, columns, beams and slabs of the Madison Avenue building and combining the new and the old structures into a single 24-story office building at the 360 Madison address -- a mere chip shot from the new Bear Stearns tower.
"Grand Central has always been special," Dr. Stawski said, "and it's extra-special since the terminal was restored."
Lots of heavy-duty restoration is taking place in and around the terminal, the very heart of Grand Central. The 200-foot-long Helmsley arcades, which connect Grand Central Terminal with Park Avenue through the Helmsley Building at 230 Park Avenue, will be shut down one at a time for 18 months starting later this year while they are spruced up.
The makeover will include 30-foot-high ceilings (double the existing height), a 15-foot by 40-foot center skylight that will fill the passage with natural light, new double-height retail spaces facing 14-foot-high video screens along the walls, a glass floor beneath the center skylight revealing trains below street level -- and, not least, direct access to Grand Central Terminal.
In addition, the Helmsley Building itself -- originally the New York Central Building, but whose most recent name will remain on the facade of the building, as part of the sales contract, under the new ownership -- will be extensively gussied up.
Adam Hochfelder, the president of Max Capital, said that the limestone and granite of its four-story base would be restored, its glazed terra cotta roadway tiles would be cleaned, and that he is considering restoring the building's copper mansard roof and its gilded golden cupola (which previously had been restored in July 1998).
In the lobby the installation of the original brass fixtures, marble trim, travertine walls and floors is nearly completed, while the public corridors are being redone with custom screened wall coverings and Persian carpets. By late summer people who visit the 24-story building at 350 Madison Avenue -- formerly the Conde Nast Building, until that publishing company moved into its skyscraper in Times Square -- will have an unusual urban experience awaiting them. As they enter the building they will cross a glass bridge that can be illuminated from underneath, and once inside they they will find themselves in a 22-foot-wide lobby that is also made of glass, thus affording a rare unobstructed view of the sky.
"By breathing new life into these older buildings in Manhattan, where there's almost no space to put up new buildings, you preserve the archaeology of New York," said Roger Duffy, a design partner at Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, the architectural firm that designed the bridge and glass lobby. Mr. Duffy also designed the Helmsley Building arcades.
In addition to the two new buildings now under way on opposite sides of Madison Avenue, several other new office buildings are in advanced planning stages.
Tishman Speyer Properties, part owner of Rockefeller Center and the Chrysler Building, is planning to build a 365,000-square-foot speculative office building at 222 East 41st Street, near Third Avenue. And at the northeast corner of 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue Mitchell B. Rutter, the president of Essex Capital Partners, intends to put up a 30-story office building that will include retail stores on the street level. That building is also expected to be put up as a speculative building.
Brookfield Properties has announced plans to buy a site at the equally conspicuous corner of 42nd Street and Madison Avenue to build a million-square-foot building, which is likely to be occupied by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Canada's biggest bank.
Most of the activity in and around Grand Central involves office buildings. The office vacancy rate in the area -- 38th to 47th Streets, Fifth Avenue to the East River, was 7.1 percent last month, according to Barbara Byrne of Colliers ABR, compared with 6.7 percent in midtown Manhattan.
But a sprinkling of residential properties are also under construction.
The biggest of these is RFR Davis's 54-story limestone and brick residential tower at 425 Fifth Avenue, at 38th Street, on which construction started three months ago. Eighteen floors are intended for extended-stay residents, while the remainder will house apartments. The building, designed by Robert A. M. Stern and H. Thomas O'Hara Architects, will also have space for commercial tenants.
AT 52 East 41st Street, between Madison and Park Avenues, in the former Chemists Club building, the 108-room Dylan hotel and the separately owned Restaurant R are scheduled to open in April. The Dylan's owner, Morris Moinian, said that more than $1 million of the overall $30 million renovation is devoted to architectural details, including a marble staircase that spirals up three floors. (The architect is Jeffrey Beers of Manhattan.)
Nearby, at the northeast corner of Madison Avenue and 41st Street, a former 12-story office building is expected to open at the end of April as the refurbished 16-story, 60-room Library Hotel. Under the husband and wife design team of Stephen B. Jacobs and Andi Pepper, each floor will be keyed to the Dewey decimal system used to catalog books. Not only will floors will be named after various subject headings (i.e., Social Sciences, Economics, etc.), rooms on those floors will contain books on those topics.
The Library Hotel's developer, Henry Kallan, said he was undertaking the $10 million restoration largely because Grand Central is about to become a mecca for tourists as well as visitors on business. "The whole area," he said, "from Grand Central Terminal to Bryant Park" -- at 42nd Street and the Avenue of the Americas, behind the New York Public Library -- "is already dynamic and will become more so."
It is hard to find an important building in the area that is not being upgraded, or has not been upgraded recently. The $100 million refurbishment continues on the Chrysler Center, the name recently bestowed on the 76-story Chrysler Building at 405 Lexington and the 32-story East Building (formerly the Kent Building) at 666 Third Avenue.
The work on the landmark Chrysler Building, which is nearing completion, includes refurbishing the entire facade as well as the signature stainless steel and nickel top. It also includes modernizing the system that controls and operates the 20 elevators and employing artisans to renovate the landmark elevator cabs. The building will have new heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, and a new generator will provide emergency backup for both Chrysler Center buildings.
MEANTIME, work on the East Building is expected to last at least a couple more months, according to Valerie Peltier, senior director of Tishman Speyer Properties. That ranges from changing its white-brick exterior to aluminum and glass, enlarging the lobby, modernizing offices, improving the heating and ventilating systems, replacing the elevator cabs and much more. By adding space on each floor, the East Building will have an additional 150,000 square feet.
In addition, two small buildings and three floors of a five-story in the middle of the Chrysler Center have been torn down and will soon be replaced by three glass trylons (one 75 feet high) designed by Philip Johnson that will house a restaurant accessable from 42nd Street. (The East Building's main entrance will remain at 666 Third Avenue.)
For the better part of two years S. L. Green Realty, which has extensive holdings in the Grand Central area as well as elsewhere, has been busy rewiring and otherwise upgrading all its buildings, most of them Class B.
"It's important to our tenants to have speedy access to the Internet," said Jerry Nocera, Green's executive vice president of leasing, "so we're putting in fiber-optics that will take us into the next decade."
Beyond that, Green is carrying out an extensive renovation of the Graybar Building attached to Grand Central Terminal. This includes a new bronze and glass entrance, a renovated lobby, a steam-cleaned facade, and new floors, ceilings and bathrooms.
At the landmark former Bowery Savings Bank at 110 East 42nd Street, where the Cipriani family leased the ground floor and basement for its catering service -- and where the taped voice of Enrico Caruso resonates from the marble mosaic floor as well as the 65-foot-high ceiling -- S. L. Green was able to redo the lobby and install new elevator cabs without running afoul of the landmark preservation strictures.
The former bank has been host to bar mitzvahs reunions, weddings and similar happy occasions -- and according to Charles Kasper, the doorman at the property, "we've even had some divorce parties.'
A block west, the Lincoln Building, owned by East 60 East 42nd Street Associates, of which Peter Malkin is the general partner, is in the midst of a $28 million refurbishment. The original ceiling has already been restored by a New York firm that specializes in historic restorations. A new concierge desk was added recently, and a new corridor, new windows, a new conference center, new public bathrooms on each floor and a covered lobby entranceway are either already completed or will be soon.
Lest art and history buffs rise up in arms, they can rest assured that Daniel Chester French's sculpture of the "Seated Lincoln," the model used for the creation of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, still reposes in the building's lobby.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Former Showroom in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, Is Turned Into 27 Rental Apartments;
Old Studebaker Building Has New Tenants

 BODY:
Alfred Thompson never owned a Studebaker. But Mr. Thompson, a Brooklyn-based developer, has long been a fan of the distinctive, futuristically designed car, which ceased being made in the 1960's -- and of the five-story Studebaker building at Bedford Avenue and Sterling Place that once housed offices and a big-windowed showroom.
"The Studebaker showroom in Detroit was turned into a jail, and I was determined to do everything I could not to have something like that happen here," said Mr. Thompson, executive director of Food First, a nonprofit developer of housing and supportive services for homeless, disabled and low-income families. 
 Two years ago his company bought the 1910 building, which in recent years was home to artists' studios on the upper floors and a church in the walled-over showroom. Since then, with the help of financing from the city, the company's subsidiary, New Start Group, has converted the structure into 27 low-income rental apartments. The studio, two- and three-bedroom units, from 485 to 925 square feet, are being rented to tenants earning $22,400 to $32,000 a year, depending on family size. All have been leased at monthly rents of $487 to $725.
"This project resulted in not just the creation of more affordable housing, but the preservation of a neighborhood's character," said Russell A. Harding, president of New York City's Housing Development Corporation, which provided the bulk of the public financing for the $3.3 million project.
Because the building got government financing and is eligible for listing on the State and National Registries of Historic Places, the developer agreed to put in replicas of the original wood-frame windows, restore the terra-cotta facade and keep the interior columns exposed.
Mr. Thompson said that the showroom was turned into two floors, to create enough units to make the project economically viable and to provide 1,500 square feet of ground-floor space for a supportive services center. Tenants have begun moving in. Mr. Thompson said that while many are too young to remember the Studebaker, "they will come to know it" through photos posted on bulletin boards. Another reminder is the circular sign on the facade with Studebaker written on it.

HEADLINE: Public Housing's New Face: Will It Lift the Urban Poor?

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

DATELINE: ELIZABETH

 BODY:
UNDER a late morning sun the landscape is a stark profile, a jumble of bulky brick boxes that make up the Migliore Manor public housing complex in the Elizabethport section of this Union County city.
Over the next few years, these aging reminders of the underside of urban life will be turned into rubble. 
 But just a block away, the light is streaming through the wooden skeletons of the first row of town houses that are beginning to rise and that will ultimately replace the rubble.
Four generations of the Ancrum family have lived here most of their lives in those boxes. Over a pancake and egg breakfast one recent Saturday, family members ranging in age from 9 to 70 discussed the transformation of the housing complex, which overlooks the Arthur Kill and turns its back to the streets of the city's old industrial section. They also talked about the reasons they have bought into the housing program the federal government calls Hope VI.
Housing advocates and developers say they support the program's aim, which is to transform public housing from cruel and degrading places for those hunkered below the bottom rung of the real estate ladder into Levittown-like communities that fit into the neighborhood -- even though they concede the process is time-consuming and burdened by red tape.
On the other hand, some tenant groups say that by any name, the effort is simply a gentrification program that takes away more housing for low-income families than it produces.
"Wherever you go, it's never better," said Shirley Ancrum, the 70-year-old grandmother of this group, said flatly in defense of the program, her voice trailing off. "So why leave?"
Shirley's daughter, 44-year-old Wynona Ancrum -- a forceful bear of a woman with a sweet face -- added, "We said we must become part of the process, or there would be no deal."
The Hope VI program -- so named because Hope is an acronym for Homeownership and Opportunity for People Everywhere and VI because there have been four previous programs created by Congress since 1990 (number five was skipped) -- is the latest federal effort to reverse the image, and frequently the reality, of public housing as an insular and dangerous place to live. Earlier efforts, from renovation to selective demolition, were fragmented, rigid and ineffective because of the myriad sources of funds -- as insufficient as they often were.
Since 1997 Wynona Ancrum, president of the Migliore Manor Resident Council and a member of the local housing authority board, has been working with other residents to implement their vision of what will replace Migliore Manor, an eight-building complex with 250 units, and the adjacent Pioneer Homes, whose 12 buildings house 405 apartments.
"Decent housing, and not being stacked on top of one another," the elder Mrs. Ancrum said. "That's all."
Her daughter added for emphasis, "A chance to live like everyone else."
The sweatshirt that Wynona Ancrum is wearing reinforces that theme. On it are the outlines of a high-rise as well as simple pitched-roofed houses, a rising sun and the words, "The dawn of a new era," which she interprets as a new beginning for tenants.
For now, at least 600 new and renovated residences for people of various means are planned for rent or sale; about half will rise on the site of the two public housing complexes, and the rest will take shape on sites scattered in the Elizabethport neighborhood. Over all, half of the new housing will be for people who now live in public housing in the neighborhood.
"We made sure that all the tenants who wanted to come back could," Wynona Ancrum said.
Officials at the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development say the program aims to use public and private financing to allow the housing to fit in more gracefully and incorporate more services like education and job training -- a component that has grown more important with the government's welfare-to-work campaign, a link never made with past housing projects. It also encourages a shift in the ownership and management from public housing authorities to private concerns.
"The idea is to walk through a neighborhood and not be able to detect the public housing units from the low-income or market-rate residences," said Edward DePaula, coordinator of the program in New Jersey at the regional housing agency office in Newark.
Though conceived in 1993, Hope VI picked up steam only in the last three or four years. The federal housing agency has allocated $3.7 billion nationwide -- including $250 million to eight New Jersey projects in Newark, Jersey City, Camden, Paterson, New Brunswick, Atlantic City and Elizabeth.
"This program is not just about public housing, or bricks and mortar," Mr. DePaula said. "It's about changing whole neighborhoods and offering positive incentives to tenants."
YET many people contend that Hope VI is no panacea. "It's a good program," said Nicolas Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. "But is it the solution to the country's severe housing needs? The answer is no."
Other housing experts agree with Mr. Retsinas, who says the program is saddled with a lack of resources and tenant skepticism over such issues as displacement and relocation. And, he added, for all its flexibility, the program is complex, frustrating and peppered with politics. "The longer it takes, the skepticism increases," he said.
Mary E. Rone, president of the New Jersey Association of Public and Subsidized Housing Tenants, a nonprofit tenant advocacy group in Newark, put her opposition more bluntly. "I do not favor demolition, and this is a demolition program," Ms. Rone said. "The numbers are out of sync because the housing being built will not replace all the units being torn down."
She also said that unless tenants are involved from the beginning -- which is the case in Elizabeth -- only "a handful will benefit, but for the majority it stinks."
Elinor Bacon, deputy assistant secretary for public housing investments at H.U.D., takes issue with Mr. Retsinas and Ms. Rone. "These are huge undertakings, which take a long time to complete," she said. "We don't want to overregulate, but we want the planning done up front because it is our fiduciary responsibility to make sure we have a successful development at the end, which has happened elsewhere in the nation."
As for the concerns that there will not be enough public housing for all the people who leave the old projects, Donna White, a spokeswoman for the federal housing agency, said: "To create these new communities -- and better housing -- in most cases you can't put back what has been taken down. But no one is going to be left out, because they are given alternative housing."
New Jersey has 45,000 public housing units; under the rebuilding program, 4,200 are scheduled to come down. So far, 985 units have been demolished and 500 are under construction, the federal housing agency said. Ultimately, 4,000 units are to be built, 2,400 for public housing tenants.
Many residents are relocated during the rebuilding process, and those who do not choose to move into the new housing can receive federal rent subsidies and go elsewhere. But given the scant supply of decent affordable housing, Ms. Rone said, the question becomes: where do they move?
Public housing -- mostly low-rise town houses and walk-ups -- began appearing in the 1930's to help working families in the Depression. After World War II, the focus shifted to help low-income families, ushering in the high-density mid- and high-rise complexes of the late 1940's and 1950's that most people think of today. By the 1960's, the complexes were opened up to minorities and welfare recipients; the concentration of extremely poor and minority tenants accelerated in the 1970's, and public housing came to be viewed as the last resort.
Wynona Ancrum recalled the day 21 years ago when she stepped into apartment 22G, her first one at Migliore Manor, as a divorced mother of three young children trying to raise a family on welfare. "I saw it as way to get up on my feet, and it was good through the 70's and 80's," she said.
Then Migliore Manor and Pioneer Homes -- built in 1940 and 1953, respectively, and the oldest and densest of Elizabeth's seven public housing projects -- spiraled downward while the city's industrial core was disappearing. Construction of the New Jersey Turnpike, which severed the far eastern part of Elizabeth and isolated it from the rest of the city, contributed to the decline.
By the late 1980's the housing complex became terrible, said Wynona's 26-year-old daughter, Kiona. "I was scared to go out," she said, recalling the rapes, killing and drug activity that became facts of life.
Kiona Ancrum, who is now the mother of her own four children, went on: "I lost a lot of friends. It makes you aware."
Last year she took a job as a longshoreman at the Elizabeth Seaport and got off the welfare rolls. But she never left her home. Nor did her mother, Wynona, who suffers from a bad back and asthma and is on disability, or her grandmother, Shirley, who is widowed and retired and who moved in with Wynona 10 years ago.
Though the complex is rundown and at times dangerous, and though life there can be disheartening, the three women said it was what they knew. It was home.
Even 9-year-old Shadya, Kiona's daughter, said with a child's optimism, "All my family is here and I have a lot of friends."
Today, the two complexes are home to about 1,450 people, with an average annual income of $8,200, compared with $24,487 for households in the rest of Elizabethport.
In the 1980's, the federal government no longer supported the building of high-density public housing. While even the housing agency supported razing some of the bleaker buildings, it required that the units be replaced on a one-to-one basis, a practice discontinued about five years ago.
In New Jersey, some public housing was razed and replaced by town houses before the advent of Hope VI. For instance, the Newark Public Housing Authority is involved in the state's largest rebuilding program as a result of a 1989 settlement of a federal lawsuit that maintained that the authority wasn't putting up enough apartments. The settlement called for the creation of 1,777 low-rise units to replace apartments in eight towers. All of the towers have been demolished and 1,000 new units have been built, 488 more are under way and the development of 289 more is to start this year, said Harry Robinson, a Newark Public Housing Authority spokesman.
In Jersey City, 10 years ago the housing authority began to reshape Curries Woods, a seven-tower complex with 712 apartments in the Greenville section. At that point, said Maria T. Maio, the authority's deputy executive director, "We were limited by the one-to-one replacement requirement and working around existing tenants, who under our agreement with them would not be involuntarily displaced."
Ms. Maio said that the plan then was to configure one tower and demolish another, replacing it with 100 town houses, but "there was never enough money to do everything at the same time."
In both cases, money was not available for all the support services needed by the prospective tenants, and the federal housing agency did not encourage mixing residents of various income levels.
Still, some tenants who moved into the town houses say the new homes are an improvement. Louranett George moved into a town house on the Curries Woods site with her five children in 1998 after living in a high-rise for 18 years. "It's safer and like living in your own home, which is great for the kids who have a backyard," said Ms. George, who is a resident liaison at Curries Woods and works as an administrative assistant at the Jersey City Housing Authority.
Since then, Jersey City and Newark have received Hope VI grants. Newark has received two; one, for $50 million, was given in 1994 to demolish the 630-unit Archbishop Walsh Homes and replace it with 498 low-rise units, and a $35 million grant was given in 1997 to raze the 1,206-unit Stella Wright Homes and replace it with 750 mixed-income units in the nearby neighborhood.
In 1997, Jersey City received a $32 million Hope VI grant to raze the remaining five buildings at Curries Woods and build another 130 town houses on the site. There will also be three off-site projects, one with 124 mixed-income units and the other two with a total of 70 homes that qualified public housing tenants can buy.
"Hope VI goes in the right direction," said Robert J. Rigby, executive director of the Jersey City Housing Authority. "The difficulties are in pulling it off in the real world."
WITH no Hope VI rebuilding program completed in the state, the jury is still out on its ultimate success. The process has not been without flaws, and the relocation of tenants is the thorniest issue, Ms. Rone said, adding that often tenants end up in worse housing than what they left.
"It's a real issue for H.U.D," added Michael A. Stegman, who was assistant secretary of housing for policy and research from 1993 to 1997 and is now chairman of the department of public policy at the University of North Carolina.
In Elizabeth, the Ancrums remain upbeat. "In the beginning," Wynona Ancrum said, "there were misconceptions, but the tenants have been involved in every step, which is a departure from past history."
She said that although "anything could happen, so far the process is working." And though people are becoming restless while waiting for the new housing, she said she had not received any complaints from the tenants who had chosen to relocate.
Manny Grova Jr., the councilman for the Elizabethport neighborhood and a commissioner of the Elizabeth Housing Authority, said he had not received any complaints either, though he had concerns about costruction that have since been resolved.
Mr. Grova, who grew up in a house across from Pioneer Homes and now owns a home six blocks away, said, "We feel this is a better way to go because it eliminates brick monsters and provides a better quality of life and better housing that mixes incomes and is spread out."
Doing so, added Mayor J. Christian Bollwage, will attract private investment to the neighborhood.
The five-year rebuilding program, which will cost $80 million, started about 16 months ago. The housing authority received a $28.9 million grant from H.U.D., and the rest is to come from private sources.
"It shakes up all the old pieces to the public housing puzzle and winds up with the same players, but the roles and responsibilities have changed," said Christiana Foglio of Home Properties, who has developed affordable housing in the state. Ms. Foglio's company, based in Rochester, N.Y., with an office in New Brunswick, will develop, own and manage the on-site units
Four vacant public housing buildings have been bulldozed, paving the way for the first 72 town houses, with porches and small backyards, of which 26 will be for public housing tenants, Ms. Foglio said. A dozen single-family homes that qualified public housing tenants can buy are also under construction throughout the neighborhood.
Wynona Ancrum said the support services, including job training and placement and an entrepreneurial program would start soon, leading her into a discussion of her dream to one day open a small restaurant in the neighborhood, which she is hopeful will change as the new housing goes up.
"Tenants want this to happen, especially for the children," she said.
Wynona Ancrun went on to say, "And we continue to watch the process."
For now, 9-year-old Shadya said she was looking forward to decorating her bedroom in one of the new town houses with special curtains of Mickey and Minnie Mouse or Winnie the Pooh.
Minutes later after visiting the wooden shells rising on Front Street, the family lingered a while before heading home.

COUNTRY'S HOTTEST MARKET

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
The hottest housing market in 1999 was in the central New Jersey, according to a real estate industry survey. The region including Middlesex, Somerset and Hunterdon counties saw home prices rise by 23.3 percent last year, a report from the National Association of Realtors said. That was the highest percentage increase in the group's survey of 126 metropolitan areas in the United States. The median retail home price in the region was $221,200 in the fourth quarter. The sharp increase surprised even real estate agents and came despite higher mortgage rates. They attributed the rise to the prosperous economy and increasing population, together with a housing shortage in the most sought-after suburban neighborhoods.

ROSY REPORT

BYLINE: By WENDY GINSBERG 

 BODY:
New Jersey is enjoying its longest economic boom in history, one that is likely to continue, a report released by the state-appointed New Jersey Council of Economic Advisors says.
The council said last week that more than four million New Jersey residents were working, an increase of 65,000 jobs from the 1998, and the unemployment rate was 4.5 percent last year, 0.1 percent lower than in 1998. The council's report predicted continued but slower growth for this year, with an expected 53,000 new jobs to be created. 
 Joseph J. Seneca, the chairman of the council, said the growth started more than 100 months ago, and cited state investments in higher education and high technology. Other gauges of growth the council cited were a 5.8 percent increase in personal income and a 7 percent increase in retail sales.
George R. Nagle, executive director of the council, warned that low unemployment could mean some companies might leave the state to find skilled workers or to take advantage of lower wages. He said there was not much the state could do to encourage a continuation of the boom. "That's Alan Greenspan's area," he said.

HEADLINE: Governor's Involvement In the Global Economy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The Jan. 30 "On Politics" column discussing Governor Whitman's participation in the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, ignored, for reasons that escape me, several important points about the importance of international trade to New Jersey's economic well being. 
 Over the past six years New Jersey's economy has been transformed from the economic laggard of the Northeast to the regional leader in economic expansion and job growth. Since Governor Whitman took office, we have created a record-breaking 390,000 new jobs in the Garden State. Many of those jobs are the result of an economic growth spurred by $11 billion in tax cuts. Credit must also be given to the aggressive pursuit of foreign trade opportunities for New Jersey businesses and to the steady growth of foreign investment in our state by partners around the globe.
In fact, New Jersey is one of the nation's premier sites for foreign trade. We rank fifth in the nation in direct foreign investment and we are America's ninth leading state in foreign exports. Last year a total of more than $24 billion in manufactured exports left our ports for markets overseas. More than 1,200 foreign firms are situated in New Jersey and more than 600,000 jobs in New Jersey are directly related to foreign trade.
The Governor's Economic Master Plan Commission identified foreign trade as one of four sectors where our economy is poised for growth, and last year's 12 percent expansion in foreign trade bears out their analysis.
Governor Whitman has put an emphasis on encouraging global businesses to do business in New Jersey. She fully recognizes that governors have an obligation to understand the world economy and to take part in it. Her hands-on approach to encouraging foreign trade and investment is guided by the knowledge that the competition for trade dollars grows more fierce every day.
It is deeply troubling that despite being provided with the governor's itinerary for the World Economic Forum, which included some 24 meetings with corporate and government leaders from around the world, and all of the above-cited information about the importance of foreign trade to New Jersey, your writer chose not to include it in his analysis of the governor's reasons for participating in the meetings.
Had he done so, your readers would have received the information and enlightenment we have all come to expect from The New York Times.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS: OFF THE SHELF;
When Home Is a Foreign Notion

BYLINE: By ALECIA SWASY 

 BODY:
YOU know it's time to go home when you turn giddy over a new issue of Delta Air Lines' in-flight magazine. You find yourself muttering about seat-back trays in the upright and locked position and eating 12 peanuts for dinner.
You are on yet another airplane full of sleepwalking globetrotters like yourself -- here a rumpled gray suit and I.B.M. luggage tags, there multiply pierced body parts and a marked-up draft prospectus for a dot-com I.P.O., and seemingly everywhere management consultants from Andersen or McKinsey. 
 But that fellow with the notebook and the British accent is up to something perhaps a bit more profound: trying to locate "home" in a rootless age. He is Pico Iyer, who chronicles his search in "The Global Soul: Jet Lag, Shopping Malls and the Search for Home" (Knopf, $25). Mr. Iyer circles the planet as a writer for Time magazine, making occasional pit stops at his family's home in Santa Barbara, Calif., and his own near Kyoto, Japan, and frequent visits to modern crossroads of civilization like Los Angeles International Airport and Atlanta's Olympic village.
But first, he endures a few natural disasters, starting with a raging fire that consumed his parents' house; he escaped with a coughing cat and a manuscript. Then came earthquakes and mudslides. By Page 7, you want to summon the Red Cross.
Losing one's shelter must be jarring, but getting rid of all that stuff could be liberating -- less to dust, for one thing. The loss left Mr. Iyer searching for something beyond a building and furniture, perhaps something invisible, to anchor him.
Joining him on this trip can be discombobulating. He often starts his day in one continent, then dozes off in another, at a pace he likens to a childhood game of spinning around until he collapsed in a "dizzy heap on the floor." He concludes that modern lives are just "joy-riding in somebody else's Porsche, at 90 miles an hour, around blind curves."
Well, some of us are tooling through a school zone in a Honda. Everyone knows the experience of waking up on Monday, blinking and finding that it's already Friday. I myself misplaced all of last May through July. But that is a different kind of busy than Mr. Iyer's. My own former days as a frequent flier led me to the epiphany about the in-flight magazine and an urgent desire to get a life.
Not Mr. Iyer, who clearly enjoys a lifestyle that has racked up 1.5 million frequent-flier miles and a stamp-filled passport. Born to Indian parents and brought up in England and California, he writes that the very notion of home is foreign to him.
The book captures people in the layovers of life, beginning at LAX, a hub for the Global Soul, full of people from somewhere else. It may have a $10 million post office and a 23,000-space parking lot, he writes, but the airport is a "centerless mess with no real defining principle or heart." He describes a bit too much of that mess when he visits an adults-only establishment near the airport Hilton.
He likes Toronto better, finding New York's intelligence without its neuroses. But pity Atlanta, he writes, because the South rising again has turned the place into a "center of emptiness," a city of freeways leading to off-ramps leading to generic suburbs. Here, too, he manages to find the lap-dancing joint, this time one with a "corporate atmosphere."
Traveling to Atlanta offers the opportunity for a few jabs at a corporate sibling of his employer, Time Warner. At the CNN Center, he writes, a bumpkin tour guide who clearly isn't aware that CNN is a Global Soul embarrasses a visitor from Iraq with rude questions. Mr. Iyer finds the same lack of global brotherhood in the confused aftermath of the Centennial Park bombing during the 1996 Olympics, when a white man yells at a visitor from the Middle East: "You see what happens when we let you people in?"
What Mr. Iyer discerns in this is not so much provincialism and bigotry as a strong case for slowing life down a bit and understanding the people around us. When there are people around us at all, that is: everyone is busy sending e-mail, but a smiley emoticon can hardly replace a good laugh in a friend's company. In a similar vein, a friend of mine wrote recently that dinner tables ought to get more use than just Thanksgiving Day. (And while we're at it, let's agree to be sillier among strangers in elevators.)
SOME of Mr. Iyer's best moments come in talking to strangers. At the Olympic village in Barcelona, Spain, in 1992, he finds an archery team from Bhutan that had never seen a stadium before. His writing is most graceful in simple description, as when the temple bells ring on the Philosopher's Path in Kyoto. His pace slows in the final pages -- at last! -- and a reader can almost hear the clumps of snow falling from the dark trees.
Mr. Iyer does find a place to call home when his personal life draws him to rural Japan. But even there he is treated as a gaijin, an alien. He endures customs checks that would send most of us screaming for the American Embassy; he describes being strip-searched after agents found a Sudafed tablet in his bags.
For all the relative serenity of the final pages, though, a reader cannot count on Mr. Iyer's staying home, wherever that is, for long. In the book's acknowledgments, he thanks his travel agent.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Ford Excursion;
Camping With the Incredible Hulk

BYLINE: By DAN NEIL 

DATELINE: PILOT MOUNTAIN, N.C.

 BODY:
OR all the cargo capacity of the 2000 Ford Excursion, it enters the market carrying almost more baggage than it can handle. Ford's introduction last year of its uber-utility provoked protests and galvanized a coalition of sport utility haters -- from environmentalists to intimidated drivers of small cars -- for whom the 7,000-pound Excursion was a big, fat bete noire.
There, its critics said, behold what lies at the bottom of America's slippery-slope love affair with huge S.U.V.'s. 
 Perhaps, perhaps not. Certainly there are heavy-hauling types like ranchers and boaters who can actually use its bulk, its muscle and its five-ton towing capacity; Ford insists that it is serving this market.
For those outside that demographic, the Excursion may pass a threshold of practicality. At almost 19 feet long and 80 inches wide, it cannot gain entry to many garages and car washes. It hangs out of an ordinary parking space like a fat man in a Speedo. Considering the urban aggravation factor, you might as well commute in a Zamboni.
If dimestore cowboys and urban poseurs buy the Excursion just to make a larger-than-thou statement, they will be getting what they deserve.
 Tellingly, General Motors, which builds what had previously been the largest sport utility, the Suburban, will not try to out-gross its new rival. Indeed, it has called the redesigned Suburban, with an almost straight face, "the sensible S.U.V."
Built on Ford's Super Duty pickup platform, the Excursion is available with three engines: a 5.4-liter, 255-horsepower V-8, which is standard with two-wheel drive; a 6.8-liter, 310-horse V-10, standard on 4-by-4's; and a 7.3-liter, 235-horsepower diesel V-8 that generates a globe-turning 500 foot-pounds of torque. With the larger engines, maximum towing capacity is 10,000 pounds, plus almost a ton of cargo in the truck. Like all of Ford's sport utilities, the Excursion meets federal low-emission standards.
My test vehicle was a loden-green Excursion Limited 4-by-4 with the V-10, which offers a shade less towing (9,600 pounds) and cargo capacity (1,710 pounds) than two-wheel-drive models. This configuration, at $41,665, is likely to be the bedrock of the line.
When it came to testing this behemoth, it was clear that the ordinary drive over hill and dale would not suffice. We would have to tow something -- something big. We found it in a 30-foot, 3-axle Airstream travel trailer, the descendent of those capsule-shaped aluminum campers made famous in the 1950's. Weighing in at more than 7,500 pounds and costing $57,133 (loaded with everything plus a kitchen sink, this one of Corian), the Airstream is just the kind of Paul Bunyan load the Excursion was designed to transport.
On the appointed Friday, my wife and I and another couple piled a weekend's worth of gear, plus a high-strung Weimaraner, into the capacious interior and headed for Jameokee campground.
Among the first things you notice are the outsized doors, any one of which would do justice to the abbey at Rouen. The three cargo doors (an upper liftgate and two lower doors) swing fully out of the way for unobstructed access to the hold. We removed the third-row bench, which is on rollers, to create a warehouse of 100 cubic feet. This space was so large that we could dispense with packing altogether and just shovel in our belongings, and the dog, too.
Full-length running boards are standard, to aid in the almost two-foot climb up into the cabin. Once seated, the driver has a view that is panoramic, in the sense that guides at Niagara Falls use the word. You simply tower over other traffic, coming nearly eye-to-eye with long-haul truckers. The front doors have cut-downs in the window sills so the driver can have a better view of the oversized and heated outside mirrors. Even so, it's easy to lose sight of smaller fry, like Cadillacs, swimming alongside.
Compared with the Suburban, the Excursion interior feels more refined. The seats were amply cushioned and upholstered with supple leather. Ford used lots of sound-deadening material, and it ended up with a vast volume of amniotic quiet.
All of Ford's experience at creating comfy S.U.V.'s has been brought to bear. There are 10 strategically situated cup holders and many shrewdly placed cubbyholes. The second row of seats not only recline, they also fold forward to create a flat-bed cargo area measuring 146.4 cubic feet. It looks like a carpeted squash court.
On the road, the unladen Excursion drives like the gigantic truck it started life as, jouncing merrily on heavy-duty leaf springs. Nothing could improve the ride so much as a quarter-ton of sandbags. The steering is light and reasonably direct. But the brakes -- four discs with an antilock system -- seemed inadequate to haul the 7,190-pound vehicle down from 60 m.p.h.
Whatever vices the Excursion may have as a passenger wagon become virtues when you attach a big trailer. As a matter of simple leverage, a vehicle with a long wheelbase is more stable when towing. Likewise, sheer physics mean that the heavier the towing vehicle, relative to what is being towed, the more stable and secure the ride.
Nonetheless, you can't simply plug an Airstream into the Excursion's Class IV hitch and drive off. In the interests of safety, Airstream Inc. insisted that we use a dual sway-bar rig, a spidery steel apparatus that helps to prevent the trailer from weaving. We also required an adjustable towing head as well as an auxiliary brake-control module. This device, wired under the dash, connects the truck's brakes to the trailer's. Without it, the trailer would tend to push even the Excursion off the road.
After an hour of installation, Grady Kilby, owner of Out-of-Doors Mart in Kernersville, N.C., pronounced the Excursion fit to travel. "The biggest mistake people make in trailering is having too small a tow vehicle," he said. No danger of that here.
For casual users, the 425 foot-pounds of torque is wasted. Given the weight and gearing, that power cannot make the truck hustle any quicker to 60 m.p.h. (10.6 seconds, according to Automobile magazine). Where torque comes in handy is under load. Leaving Out-of-Doors Mart, the Excursion accelerated as smoothly and crisply as ever, as if it were pulling nothing at all. At highway speeds, the engine relaxed into an effortless hum. Only on uphill grades of 4 percent or more did the truck begin to exert.
The purpose of the load-leveling hitch is to distribute the trailer's weight evenly on the truck's chassis, so that the front end doesn't rise off the ground. Even so, the Excursion felt light and the steering was a little vague, though not so much as to affect control.
In fact, the really difficult part of the trailering experience was the touchiness of the brakes. If I even breathed on the pedal, the auxiliary controller seized the trailer's drum brakes, jerking the truck back alarmingly. I learned to use engine braking to slow down, and to plan well ahead when stopping.
Our experiment in heavy trailering was, alas, not without incident. Backing down an incline of wet grass, trying to angle toward the dump station -- the mysteries of gray water and brown water are just as well unplumbed, as far as I'm concerned -- I pressed the brakes too hard. Both vehicles' brakes locked, and I folded the rig like a pocketknife, putting a nasty dent in the Airstream and an unsightly scratch on the Excursion. What an awful sound!
We returned the Airstream to the dealership and sighed in relief that more damage had not been done. Meanwhile, our calculations showed that the Excursion's fuel economy was, oddly, about the same with and without the trailer: 10 miles per gallon.
Numbers like that infuriate Excursion critics and no doubt cause chagrin for Ford's chairman, William C. Ford Jr., who is trying to put a green face on the company. At the Detroit auto show last month, as Ford announced its new Think division of environmentally friendly bikes, carts and electric cars, it was hard not view the effort as an attempt to atone for the Excursion.
Still, with more than 36,000 already sold, demand is likely to outstrip the production limit of 60,000 a year. With Ford pocketing an estimated $15,000 to $20,000 of profit on each sale, the Excursion may turn out to be one of the most successful public relations disasters in corporate history.

HEADLINE: Gas Prices Rise: Will Guzzlers Pay?

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

 BODY:
ALES of big, thirsty pickups and sport utility vehicles have boomed in recent years as the economy hummed and gasoline prices sagged to record lows.
But this winter, gas prices have surged to all-time highs. Will gas-pump sticker shock start to affect sales of large sport utilities? 
 Economists who work for Detroit automakers say there is no reason to think so. They say truck sales are affected more by factors like low unemployment, rising incomes, high consumer confidence, stable vehicle prices and record corporate profits.
But David Littmann, chief economist for Comerica Bank in Detroit, predicts that gas prices will bite into auto sales this year. Auto economists say the increase so far -- to a national average of more than $1.30 a gallon for unleaded regular -- could cost each consumer about $300 more a year.
"Higher gas prices, combined with higher interest rates, will hit consumers' wallets, and that will slow -- not stop -- auto sales and probably cause a shift in the vehicle mix," Mr. Littmann said.
 He expects buyers to take notice by the second half of this year. In response, he predicts, automakers will offer sales incentives on large, high-profit vehicles.
Still, Mr. Littmann is among many economists who predict an unprecedented seventh year of vehicle sales topping 15 million. And he expects trucks to outsell cars for a second consecutive year.
Indeed, so far, higher gas prices have not depressed sales and have not brought a shift to smaller vehicles. Vehicle sales ran at a sizzling annual rate of 18 million in January; sales for all of 1999 set a record of just under 17 million. Sales of full-size pickups and sport utilities remain strong while small, fuel-efficient cars go wanting.
Economists say there is no single price that will suddenly cause preferences to shift. Rather, they say, buying habits change only because of bad economic news, sustained high gas prices or shortages.
Some economists predict gas prices to rise further and stay there for the next year. W. Van Bussmann, corporate economist for DaimlerChrysler, expects prices to peak this summer at $1.40 a gallon and gradually come down. But he predicts that vehicle sales will be only slightly below last year's.
 Environmentalists, meantime, hope higher prices will benefit efficient vehicles. "We are not for increased gas prices per se," said Charles Griffith, director of auto projects for the Ecology Center in Ann Arbor, Mich., an advocacy group for cleaner, more fuel-efficient transportation. "But higher gas prices might well cause manufacturers and consumers to reflect on the cost of the automobile on the environment."

HEADLINE: What It Takes

BYLINE: By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
ACROSS the street from the American Museum of Natural History, Betsy Gotbaum, director of the New-York Historical Society, has been watching the construction of the dazzling, hugely trumpeted $210 million planetarium with great interest and strong emotions.
"Ellen took a place that was moribund and has done something spectacular," Ms. Gotbaum said of Ellen V. Futter, the museum's director. "Actually, I feel an enormous amount of envy." 
 Ms. Gotbaum, who started her job in 1994, a year after Ms. Futter joined the Natural History Museum, has been trying to do something spectacular on a smaller scale. Her task is far more daunting, since the historical society was nearly bankrupt and had spent its entire endowment. It was within a hair's breadth of folding when she stepped in.
But meanwhile, she is eyeing the success of her neighbor to see if she can find a way to share its success. The talk of long lines of impatiently waiting visitors gave her a brainstorm.
"We're trying to figure out a way to bring over some of the 500, 600 people who can't get in," Ms. Gotbaum said. "Like, for 50 cents, come to the historical society, look around, and you won't lose your place in line."
New York City is blessed with richly stocked cultural institutions. But while New Yorkers love their venerable institutions, they take them for granted. They see them as mountains, solid, self-sustaining and self-reliant. Making dramatic changes at century-old public institutions can seem as unthinkable as sculpturing the Adirondacks.
But in the last few decades, several individuals have stepped into major but neglected institutions and shot electricity through them: among them, Thomas Hoving at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Harvey Lichtenstein at the Brooklyn Academy of Music; Vartan Gregorian at the New York Public Library; and most recently, Ms. Futter at the Natural History Museum.
Although these people have different backgrounds and personalities, they share the ability to transform a lackluster place, give it a prominent spot on the cultural radar screen and infuse it with money, powerful board members, visitors and social panache. They also have in common an ability to redefine the nature of an institution in profound ways, a willingness to take on entrenched forces and a deep awareness of the importance of image and publicity, not to mention great reservoirs of personal charm and charisma.
A vital requirement is the ability to garner support from board members and other donors, to make partners of the money people and by doing so pull them into the action.
"You can't ever be a one-person show," said Randy Bourscheidt, director of the Alliance for the Arts, a nonprofit advocacy group. "You need somebody brilliant to start, but that person doesn't stay alone long."
These individuals also have to be confident enough to push ahead when insiders, like employees and board members, dismiss their plans as overreaching and unrealistic. By nurturing, nudging, coaxing and nagging board members, employees, politicians, journalists and the public, they turn their sometimes creaky institutions into living, vibrant centers that serve, please, surprise and teach all kinds of people: tourists, children, scholars, dabblers.
Suddenly, their institutions are in the news. Gossip columns mention the celebrities who attend their after-hours parties. Their accomplishments are touted not just in arts pages but also in the news columns.
Those who seek to achieve such things do not always succeed, and sometimes making even a little progress may seem to take forever. Ms. Gotbaum has yet to make waves at the historical society, largely, she says, because it was in such bad financial trouble when she took over.
"This place was pathetic," she said. "It was closed, with its collections in storage costing $500,000 a year. It had huge internal fights and a board that was dispirited and exhausted. But it was something that could really be fixed."
 
At the Met Museum, Displays Worthy of the Riches Within
Before the arrival of Thomas Hoving, the patrician, energetic former Parks Commissioner and curator of the Cloisters, crowds and controversy were unknown at the Metropolitan Museum. It was famous for its vast, diverse collections, spanning thousands of years. But when Mr. Hoving arrived in 1966, even the museum's fans said the displays were unimaginative and the walls grimy.
To some in the art world, the Met was a temple of high-minded aesthetics and scholarship. To others, it was stuffy, dull and snobbish, indifferent to the public and to the new art flourishing outside its doors.
"The place was slowly dying in a very elegant way," Mr. Hoving said in an interview the other day. He said he was hired by a handful of board members, "an unofficial cabal," who altered the museum bylaws to allow him to make big changes.
When Mr. Hoving left the Met 11 years later, blockbusters, corporate sponsorship and splashy promotional campaigns, previously unknown in this country, were staples at New York museums. An annual total of 3.4 million New Yorkers and tourists were visiting the Met, compared with 2 million in 1970, the last year for which figures are available.
Mr. Hoving achieved his goals by being willing to popularize the museum, to make shows sound as tantalizing as hit movies, to open doors wider, to seek a more diverse audience. He also had to ignore accusations that he was vulgarizing the place.
"The great fear was that he would lower standards," Mr. Bourscheidt said. "He was communicating with the press and creating buzz. The arts economic impact studies were especially shocking."
Mr. Bourscheidt was referring to Mr. Hoving's pioneering analyses of how much money the museum's visitors spent in the city. These studies were attacked as devices that debased art, sullying its purity. In 1971, Hilton Kramer, art critic of The New York Times, accused Mr. Hoving of having a "box office mentality."
Mr. Hoving took special heat for his practice of acquiring corporate sponsors for major shows and prominently displaying their logos, now routine practice at museums. He was criticized for selling floral patterns on vintage wallpaper in the American wing to Springs Industries for sheet and pillowcase designs. An attempt to persuade the makers of Fresca, a soft drink, to sponsor an exhibition of Florentine frescoes failed.
But most of his efforts succeeded. By the time he left in 1977, his innovations had become mainstream.
 
A Vision Grows in Brooklyn: Avant-Garde Art for the People
During the years Mr. Hoving was transforming the Met's treasures into really big shows, Harvey Lichtenstein was riding the subway to Lower Manhattan in search of remarkable but unknown creative artists. Mr. Lichtenstein, a former dancer and a passionate devotee of the arts who had been named director of the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1967, was haunting downtown clubs and loft theaters to find his treasures.
"First you have to have the goods," said Mr. Lichtenstein, who left the academy in June and now heads BAM Local Development Corporation, which seeks to revive downtown Brooklyn. "You can only fool people so long."
When he took over at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, it was little more than a borough cultural center where performances by the Brooklyn Philharmonic were regularly punctuated by grunts from the judo classes renting the rooms upstairs.
"I had to do things that were singular, unique in the city, that Lincoln Center wasn't doing," said Mr. Lichtenstein, an effusive bear of a man. "I had great ambitions to do things that were really important."
In the process, mostly through the Next Wave Festival, the annual umbrella series of avant-garde events that became his signature achievement, he gave artists like Merce Cunningham, Twyla Tharp, Peter Brook and Philip Glass a stage and an audience long before they were in popular demand. He made it hip to take the train to Brooklyn to see their work. (He also provided shuttle buses.)
"He delivered great stuff," said Jonathan Rose, a longtime board member of the academy. "He delivered amazing goods. BAM built an audience that trusted Harvey's taste so much, every year he'd present things people never heard of and they'd come. He didn't hit 100 percent -- he took a lot of risks -- but the peaks were so high."
As an ambitious visionary with a tendency to spend more than he had, Mr. Lichtenstein needed a strong financial deputy by his side, and Karen Hopkins, who had held administrative jobs in small theaters and who joined the academy in 1980 as a development assistant, became that person.
"I would always push her," Mr. Lichtenstein said of Ms. Hopkins, who is now president of the academy. "She was conservative in what she said could raise. But she always got it." His last-minute decision to spend $500,000 the academy did not have for an ambitious production by the French director Ariane Mnouchkine pushed her to the edge, he said. "It was the only time I made her cry. We went out on the street and she burst into tears.
"I didn't know anything about money," he continued. "I didn't know anything about money or unions or budgets or publicity or press or board relations. It was murder, war. I was under tremendous pressure to keep things going, to keep visible, to draw audiences. When there was no money, I had to manufacture it. Many times we made payroll at the very last minute."
But Mr. Lichtenstein had a superb touch for cultivating wealthy donors and board members. A particular lure were memorable parties at which big-money people could mingle with the artists.
"Harvey was developing operas with Peter Sellars," Mr. Rose recalled of one gathering. "And Peter Sellars told us: 'I'm going to walk you through the piece I'm working on.' He had us sit on chairs, on the floor. Everybody was very quiet, and he said: 'I'm going to tell you a story. I can see it. It's not written yet, but I can see the vision.' We were completely engaged."
Without money to advertise, Mr. Lichtenstein relied on critics and arts writers. He knew they needed material, and he gave them performances unlike anything they were seeing in mainstream arts spaces.
"The press heard that something new was happening in Brooklyn," he said. "They came to see. I got their support, and word got around."
Last year, 300,000 people attended performances at the once-provincial institution.
 
Raising Voices and Money At the Library
In the 1970's and early 1980's, the New York Public Library was the polar opposite of Brooklyn Academy of Music. Where the academy was freewheeling, thrilling and erratically brilliant, the library was grimly utilitarian, with spartan decor, a penny-pinching mentality and a $50 million deficit.
Vartan Gregorian, a powerhouse provost at the University of Pennsylvania, became president in 1981. In a recent conversation, he listed items covered at his first board meeting: "Closing the branches. Charging fees to take out books. Selling the books."
Mr. Gregorian disagreed with this approach. To him, the problem was not lack of money but lack of pride. Under no conditions, he said, should the library beg.
"The New York Public Library is not a charity case," he remembered saying. "It is already great. The city cannot claim to be a center of culture without it. There is no way anybody can even think about it not existing."
To realize his vision, he approached law firms, universities and corporations to persuade them to support the library, whose free services they depended on, and suggesting that those services could come to an end if they did not provide help. He added up all the money donated over several months, including $1 bills from children, and announced that the library had received a gift of hundreds of thousands of dollars. He erected a fence to keep out Bryant Park's drug dealers and posted signs that said, "Future Site of Renovations of the New York Public Library," when plans existed only in his head. His aim was to give a sense of momentum before anything concrete had happened.
When he did raise money, much of it from private donors, he spent lavishly on repairs and cleaning to make the rundown building shine. With the help of Brooke Astor, the powerful philanthropist, he created a group called the Literary Lions, which more than any other single initiative gave the dowdy library an image of glitter, wealth and high culture. Monthly dinner parties were held in sumptuous upstairs rooms. Each of the 21 tables cost $10,000 to sponsor -- the tab later rose considerably -- and was headed by the contributor's choice of a famous author. Within a year or two, Mr. Gregorian recalled, The Washington Post had ranked the sponsorship of a Literary Lions table No. 2 in social cachet, just after an invitation to a private dinner with Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace.
Although major improvements like the renovation of the reading room occurred after he left in 1989, during his tenure the budget more than doubled, from $57 million to $136 million.
"He knew what he valued, the written word," said Peter Carzasty, a publicist with the Kreisberg Group, a New York public relations firm that represents many cultural institutions. "He made literature sexy."
 
Taking a Wealthy Dinosaur Into the Space Age
When Ellen Futter took over the Natural History Museum in 1993, it was one of the city's wealthiest cultural institutions, with a $220 million endowment and three million visitors a year.
But most of the visitors were schoolchildren on field trips. It was a place to take the youngsters once or twice a year, to show them the dinosaurs and the blue whale. Adults might remember it with nostalgia, but many were bored by the thought of actually spending an afternoon there. The place was ignored by the philanthropic and cultural elite.
"They'd do better if they charged to get out," Mr. Bourscheidt said.
But when Ms. Futter arrived, she did not talk about the need to overcome its dreary image. The museum was already full of fascinating collections and exhibits, she insisted.
"It was overwhelming," she said in an interview shortly before the opening of the new planetarium. "It had so much stuff. Real stuff, that could be points of entry to cover the topics people are mostly acutely interested in."
Ms. Futter is not a scientist. She is a corporate lawyer who as president of Barnard College from 1980 to 1993 saved it from being absorbed into Columbia College. At Natural History, she had an even more ambitious mission: to draw crowds and donations, to position the museum at the forefront of the city's jostling cultural shrines; in short, to make science sexy.
By all accounts, she has succeeded. The special exhibitions acquired zip, notably "The Nature of Diamonds" in 1998 and, currently, "Body Art: Marks of Identity," a display of tattoos, piercings and body paintings through the centuries. Hundreds of dinosaur bones were pulled out of storage and displayed in bright new halls. A room containing tropical plants and live butterflies enthralled visitors and press alike.
One of her most pressing problems had been the rundown, obsolete Hayden Planetarium. Ms. Futter initially considered refurbishing it on the cheap, but was persuaded to try something more ambitious. According to Mr. Rose, whose parents, Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose, gave both $20 million and their names to the project, the creation of the Earth and Space Center and its sophisticated new planetarium was an example of ideas and enthusiasm bouncing among Ms. Futter, board members and staff.
"It's part of the personality" of people like Ms. Futter, Jonathan Rose said.
"They bring you in," he added. "They don't just want your money. They want your time and your expertise."
 
Faces Pressed to the Glass, Others Hope Their Turn Is Next
Although some New York institutions have been able to transform themselves and establish a premier place in the city's cultural landscape, for others the jury is still out.
A major example is the Brooklyn Museum of Art, which like BAM had the disadvantage of its location, despite its renowned collections and the ambitious plans of previous directors. In an effort to lure art lovers across the East River, Arnold L. Lehman, who became head of the Brooklyn Museum in 1997, embarked on several strategies. Among them was a program called First Saturdays, which features swing music, dancing, exhibitions and movies, which have been crowded with hundreds and even thousands of people from Brooklyn, and occasionally from beyond.
Mr. Lehman and the board added "entertain" to "educate" in the museum's mission statement. Since then, he has made big waves with Sensation, an exhibition of provocative British art that incurred the wrath of Mayor Giuliani, produced endless headlines and is now being played out in court.
Sometimes institutions simply fall off the public radar screen. That was the case with the New-York Historical Society, which in the early 90's was in such dire financial shape that it closed its doors for two years.
Ms. Gotbaum has managed to ensure the immediate survival of the 196-year-old society, which is renowned for treasures like its original Audubon watercolors. During the last five years, she has eliminated its $1 million debt and built an endowment of $29 million. She has also put together a new 35-member board practically from scratch.
In November, the museum plans to open a renovated 17,000-square-foot space on the fourth floor to house much of its eclectic collection, from Hudson River School paintings to George Washington's Revolutionary War cot.
Ms. Gotbaum's fingers are crossed.
"I have a penchant for trying to do things with places that aren't performing the way they could," she said. "Maybe I'm crazy."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: WEST SIDE;
Stiffening Resistance to a Planned Megamarket

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
For weeks, community groups and elected officials in Clinton say, they have not been adequately informed about Costco's plan to build what would be Manhattan's largest supermarket.
Construction of the two-level store along the entire blockfront on the west side of Tenth Avenue between 55th and 56th Streets is scheduled to begin next year. 
 Last week, many local officials became even more upset when Costco confirmed rumors that it is applying for a zoning change to build apartments over the store.
Assemblyman Scott Stringer called the revision a "classic bait-and-switch tactic that we had to hear about through the grapevine." Although Costco did not need any zoning change to build the store, the company agreed to meet in December with local elected officials, Mr. Stringer said, but company officials never provided any further response to community concerns.
"This takes a big development to mega status," he said. "It's time for Costco to be forthcoming about their plans. If they're going to build a residential tower, they should have gotten their act together and told us."
Jeff Brotman, chairman of Costco, would not furnish details about the apartments at the December meeting because it was added later, when the company decided that the project would not be economically feasible otherwise.
Construction costs are higher than anticipated, he said. "In Manhattan over the last six months, they've gone up 30 percent for our projects."
Opponents say the West Side neighborhood is an inappropriate location for the 75,000 square-foot store, which would not have a parking lot or garage, because, they say, it would likely attract bulk buyers who would arrive by car.
Also, they say, delivery trucks and garbage trucks serving the store would further clog local streets. "We're at a breaking point already; there's no more room," said John Fisher, president of the Clinton Special District Coalition.
Owners of small stores in the area fear that the Costco would drive them out of business, he added.
Katherine Gray, the chairwoman of Community Board 4, said local leaders told Costco that there are several public housing developments near the site, and asked if Costco would waive for lower-income shoppers the annual $35 membership fee it charges at its stores, and whether it would accept all food stamps. Mr. Brotman said the store would not waive the fee and was undecided about food stamps.
As for traffic, Mr. Brotman said, "You're always going to have people who say they don't want any traffic, but either way, you're going to have development there." COREY KILGANNON

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Peter A. Vlachos;
Forum Austin Global Equity Fund

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
IN the 1950's, during the cold war, Peter A. Vlachos traveled the world as a sergeant in the United States Air Force Strategic Air Command, repairing advanced electronics. His interest in such gadgetry continues today as he buys shares of communications and electronics companies for his $38.3 million mutual fund, Forum Austin Global Equity. Such stocks account for 42 percent of the portfolio.
Of late, he has guided his fund to impressive results. Austin Global returned 33.3 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Feb. 4, compared with 19.5 percent for its peer group of world stock funds, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher. 
 Mr. Vlachos, 62, takes a top-down approach at the fund, using macroeconomic strategies to choose regions of the world for investing. "We look for growth in the gross domestic product and a modernizing economy," he said, "and we like to see that inflation is under control."
Right now, that approach is leading him to the Pacific Rim, including Japan. The region accounts for 30 percent of the fund's holdings, up from 6 percent just two years ago. "Japan is the second-largest economy in the world," he said from his office in Midtown Manhattan. "It's vitally important that it be not only viable but vibrant. We think it's recovering nicely from the 1998 monetary crisis."
An additional 35 percent is in Europe. "We like Europe, even though it is still lagging behind the U.S. in its drive to restructure," he said. "But it's on the right path."
He is not worried that the euro has fallen 42 percent against the dollar since the beginning of last year. "We think it should appreciate to above parity" with the dollar, he said. The euro now trades at 98.75 cents.
Mr. Vlachos is less sanguine about the domestic stock market, having trimmed the fund's United States holdings to about 30 percent, from more than 40 percent. "Near term, we expect the U.S. market to be pretty bumpy," he said. "We think the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates another quarter-point this spring, which means a little pause in the market."
The remaining 5 percent is in Latin America, though he plans to increase that share. "It's gone through a rough period," he said of the region, "but earnings will probably start to show up later this year."
Mr. Vlachos focuses on companies that are being privatized by governments and have strong long-term growth prospects. He looks particularly at those involved in infrastructure, like telecommunications companies, as well as electronics and financial services concerns.
"Privatized companies usually come out at attractive valuations because there's an awful lot to sell," he said. "These companies usually have an entrenched position in the industry; they are well-financed and have interesting growth prospects."
He also looks for undervalued companies whose share prices can be helped by mergers, spinoffs or reorganizations.
While he has no hard-and-fast rules, he likes companies with strong balance sheets and minimal debt. Depending on the industry, he wants annual earnings and revenue growth of 15 to 40 percent. Mr. Vlachos says he is willing to pay for good growth opportunities. "We don't shy away from paying high multiples," he said, "as long as we see growth and a good operating history." The forward price-to-earnings multiple of the portfolio is currently 30.
WE recently bought shares in Corning Inc., which makes components for fiber optic cable and which holds some of the basic patents in the telecommunications industry. "They're streamlining their business to focus on telecommunications," he said, noting that Corning had recently acquired Oak Industries, a maker of amplifiers and cable TV set-top boxes.
Because of high demand for its fiber optic products, he said, Corning is building new factories. The shares have returned 238 percent in the last 12 months, but the price is justified by his anticipated three-year earnings growth rate of 20 to 25 percent a year, Mr. Vlachos said.
He bought shares last December at $114; the stock now trades at $165.75, or 71 to 69 times his earnings estimate of $2.35 to $2.40 a share for this year.
Another favorite is Murata Manufacturing of Japan, which makes components for telecommunications equipment, digital television and hand-held wireless devices. The company has "U.S.-style" management, he said, meaning that it is willing to pare assets and reorganize its work force to increase profits. He sees earnings growth of 20 percent a year, on average, over three years.
Mr. Vlachos bought shares in December at 18,300 yen. The stock now trades at 21,010 yen, or 90 to 72 times forecast 2000 earnings of 234 to 290 yen a share.
Telecom Italia Mobile is the fund's third-largest holding, at 4.38 percent of the portfolio. The company is the second largest mobile telephone provider in Europe, after Vodafone Airtouch, with a customer base of nearly 18 million.
The company's shares are expensive, he added, but valued in line withsimilar companies worldwide. "There's been a lot of talk about the company merging with its parent," he said, referring to Telecom Italia, which owns 60 percent of the shares. "Anyone who wants to take it over, whether its parent company or an outsider, will have to pay a premium to market."
Earnings growth should exceed 20 percent a year, on average, over three years, he said. He bought shares in 1995 for the equivalent of $1.24. The stock now trades at 13.752 euros, or $13.5437; that is 71 times his forecast earnings this year of $0.19, or 0.193 euros.

Weighing the Value of Corporate Largess

BYLINE: By JULIE FLAHERTY 

 BODY:
AT a time when the traditional bonds between employees and companies are loosening and a growing share of the economy's work is done by freelance, part-time and temporary workers, the Ford Motor Company took a giant step in the other direction when it announced that it would offer each of its 350,000 employees a computer, printer and unlimited Internet access for $5 a month. Delta Air Lines followed with a similar though less heavily subsidized plan for its 80,000 workers.
Beyond Ford's stated goal of increasing computer literacy, the computers-for-everyone policy may have deeper ramifications. Here are three perspectives. JULIE FLAHERTY
 
HARLEY SHAIKEN
Professor of social and cultural studies at the University of California, specializing in labor issues.
This will link up employees in some new, unexplored ways. The home page is designed by Ford, so the company can get its message out on a host of issues it thinks are important. It has new access to its workers worldwide.
Yet it gets into uncharted territory, because the same technology that allows you to buy a Ford Explorer on the Internet also allows you to organize demonstrations in Seattle. Ford workers in Sao Paulo can talk to Ford workers in Cleveland. This brings the possibility of worker interaction in a very far-reaching, electronic way. How this powerful tool will be used is an open question.
Ford obviously wants to underscore the connection between the $5-a-month charge for the computer and Henry Ford's doubling of assembly-line wages in 1913 -- to $5 a day. Originally, that money came with a heavy dose of paternalism: Ford judged your moral worth to get that wage.
This time around, Ford is saying that is not the intent, and employees will be able to use the computers as they see fit. It would be disastrous public relations to break that promise, so it is likely Ford won't do anything heavy-handed. But that's Ford -- what about the next company?
As we move into the Internet age more forcefully, all these kinds of issues will be there, whether it's putting up with advertising or corporate propaganda to get a free computer, or having companies track your every move on the Net. There is going to be a new mix between what is job-related and what relates to one's private life.
 
THOMAS KOCHAN
Co-director of the Institute for Work and Employment Research at M.I.T.
As long as employees have a voice in how these kinds of benefits are utilized -- and by that I mean a positive but independent voice -- it will serve everyone's interest. If employers approach it in a paternalistic or a self-interested fashion, then it could turn into an intrusion and backfire.
I think Ford has got the right institutional setting to make this work. Auto workers know how to take care of their own time and guard their personal and family responsibilities. They traditionally have negotiated for more time off. The kind of positive relationship that Ford and the U.A.W. have will help them find the right balance between the advantages in this opportunity and the intrusion on personal time.
The key lesson from research on family benefits is that when employees have a voice in shaping how they are administered day to day, then the benefits are utilized effectively, and it serves everyone well. But when they are announced from the top down, and there isn't a workplace culture that helps employees control the use of these services, there are problems.
To employees, it clearly sends a strong message that lifelong learning is important, for all workers and their families. Perhaps a broader cross-section of the work force will be now able to benefit from the new economy and make educational resources available to their children.
 
ROBERT DRAGO
Professor of labor studies at Pennsylvania State University and moderator of the Work/Family Newsgroup on the Internet.
For most Americans now, access to the Internet allows us to be good citizens, to participate in society and to know what's going on. Children are coming home from school with assignments that can only be completed on the Internet. It's crucial.
One worry is that, given modern technology, communications is a more important component of all jobs today. If you can shift that communication from work to home, you've got people working more.
That may not be the case here. But I worry that the company will start presuming that all employees have Internet access, and people will be required to be on the Internet to get important information. That's a danger even if it is not the official policy, because supervisors will assume that people have access. That could potentially be a problem.

As Mergers Get Bigger, So Does The Danger

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
MERGERS today are something to behold. The big ones are four or five times pricier than the biggest in the 1980's, and the number keeps climbing like an airliner gaining altitude. Giant companies on different continents come together as easily as neighborhood stores, and hardly a week goes by without another huge deal. The time has come to stop gawking at this spectacle and to figure out what is happening to so many of the corporations that shape our lives.
We read with amazement that America Online is buying Time Warner to get material to transmit over the Internet. Daimler and Chrysler have merged to gain greater access to each other's markets, creating a giant that is neither European nor American. And just last week, Pfizer said it would buy another pharmaceutical powerhouse, Warner Lambert, in part to get hold of Lipitor, a hot-selling anti-cholesterol drug. 
 Seldom since the late 19th century, when corporate trusts dominated oil, steel, copper and railroads in the United States, has there been such a march toward concentration, this time on a global scale. And the process is gathering speed. Companies around the world agreed last year to pay $3.4 trillion to acquire other companies, Thomson Securities Data reports. The total has skyrocketed from less than $1 trillion in 1995, when the current merger wave took off.
The action was very different in the 1980's, when leveraged buyouts prevailed. Companies were bought, typically with borrowed money, and broken into pieces thought to be worth more apart than together. Today, companies are merging to multiply their size.
The danger is that two or three huge corporations will come to dominate each industry and gain the power to shove up prices. As effective competition disappears, so will the innovation and striving for quality that it fosters. The American auto industry fell into that state after World War II, until Japan broke the Big Three's dominance in the 1970's. If the merger wave now unfolding across the globe goes too far, who will be the spoilers?
"There is pressure to make very diverse industries less diverse," said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's DRI. "That is because in nearly every country today, it is hard for more than two or three companies in any industry to make money."
Concentration is the natural drift in a market system, but it lay dormant or was held in check through most of the last century. Now it is unchained again, for a laundry list of reasons. One is the booming stock market: AOL's surging stock price allowed it to swallow the much bigger Time Warner. Deregulation also plays a big role: Not long ago, the joining of Citibank, Travelers and Salomon Smith Barney, for example, would have been illegal. So would many of the mergers in telecommunications, before Congress changed the rules in 1996. And there are fewer obstacles to cross-border combinations today.
Technology is both a means and a motive. New information networks allow managers to oversee bigger operations than before. Breakthroughs in delivering phone calls, TV signals and Internet data over a single line have companies scrambling for position through mergers. And e-commerce is not likely to be very profitable until a few companies emerge in dominant positions.
Excess capacity pushes mergers in established industries, to eliminate duplication and achieve economies of scale. Even the Asian financial crisis has played a role. United Technologies, for example, which makes Otis elevators among other products, acquired control last month of a big South Korean elevator maker, extending United's reach into that lively market.
"We could not have done that just a few years ago," said Ruth Harkin, United's senior vice president for international affairs and government relations. "The foreign investment rules would not have been favorable to us. And prior to the Asian crisis, there would not have been a willingness in Korea to let us merge."
The concentration of corporate power is still in a very early stage. Nothing like the trusts that dominated American industry a century ago have emerged in the global marketplace. Teddy Roosevelt's spirit is not forgotten. The antitrust structure survives and lately has been pointedly invoked, as when the Justice Department challenged BP Amoco's proposed acquisition of Atlantic Richfield. There is also talk of coordinating antitrust rules globally.
The goal, as economists put it, is an optimal balance in which some concentration is allowed, but government steps in before price-fixing develops and innovation is killed off. That's not an easy balance to strike when the pressure is on to make government smaller while mergers make industry ever more concentrated.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS;
Again, It's Microsoft vs. the World

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: REDMOND, Wash.

 BODY:
STEVEN BALLMER, the president of the Microsoft Corporation, returned again and again to a single question. "What is the soul of MSN?" he asked, referring to Microsoft's consumer Internet business by its three-letter logo.
A pressing question indeed for the 70 Microsoft managers summoned last June to Building No. 27 here for a searching review of the business. They had come from "Red West," a cluster of five buildings more than a mile from the main corporate campus and home to MSN Web sites like Expedia, Carpoint and MoneyCentral, and the MSN online service. Even within Microsoft, it was derided -- dubbed "Red Vest," a place to hide from real work while waiting for one's lucrative stock options to vest. Outside Microsoft, it was regarded as a laboratory of failure, called "Red Ink West," running up losses of as much as $1.5 billion since 1995, much of it squandered on a wayward effort to become a production studio for new media. 
 During the five-hour review, product teams showed off new ideas being worked on for the MSN Web site. One, a collaboration tool, was demonstrated with a community Web page for running a children's soccer team. The page could be created and the team's schedule listed, changed and sorted, all on a site within MSN that combined elements of a word processor, a spreadsheet and calendar software.
"The lights went up," Yusuf Mehdi, a marketing executive, recalled. "Heads nodded and we all kind of agreed: Now this is what Microsoft does well -- software that allows people to be more productive."
That realization soon became the touchstone of the company's new strategy for MSN -- the latest of several over the last five years, as Microsoft has struggled, uncharacteristically, to find its place on the Web.
The strategy, honed in recent months, boils down to this: We're going back to our roots as a software company. MSN will be pitched to consumers as the best technology tool kit for the Internet, one that makes online shopping, searching, communicating and managing personal finances on the Web easier and more productive. After all, "end-user productivity" is the jargonized shorthand that Mr. Ballmer, now Microsoft's chief executive, uses for the company's mission statement.
Whether that message will work in the consumer market remains to be seen. The test begins tonight, when Microsoft starts a yearlong, $150 million advertising campaign with sitcom-style television spots showing four characters -- two men, two women -- using MSN as their favorite Internet problem solver.
In the online business, Microsoft trails well behind the industry leader, America Online. But its catch-up strategy is plucked from the same playbook it used in the Internet browser market against Netscape Communications, the early front-runner in browsing software and now owned by AOL.
AS it did with its Internet Explorer browsing software, Microsoft is setting out to improve its Web technology, market aggressively, cut distribution deals with industry partners -- and, ultimately, change the economics of the online business. Some of the key executives behind the browser campaign -- the "A team," as one manager put it -- are now in place at MSN. Another sign that the MSN house is in order: At the start of this month, Mr. Ballmer moved back to the main Microsoft campus from "Red West." He had first moved into an office in Building D of Red West on Thanksgiving weekend of 1998, when losses were mounting.
Microsoft has not entirely showed its hand yet. And its track record on the Web is uninspiring, from mistaking the Internet for television (hence its failed foray into entertainment programming for the Web) to its costly drive to create a collection of city arts and entertainment sites, Sidewalk, which was sold off to Ticketmaster last year.
But executives here are encouraged by signs of improvement in the last few months -- rising traffic at MSN, favorable trade-press reviews for recently improved features and, last December, the second-highest monthly increase in five years in new subscribers to the MSN Internet access service. MSN now has two million subscribers; the goal for this year is to grow more than America Online, which analysts predict will add roughly four million new users in the United States.
"This is starting to feel like the early days of Internet Explorer," observed Mr. Mehdi, a former product and marketing manager for the browsing software.
Outside Microsoft, there are many people who will find the comparison unnerving. Microsoft's business practices in the browser market are the focus of the government's sweeping antitrust suit against the company. United States District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has not made a final ruling, but in November he issued findings of fact that sided almost entirely with the government's portrayal of Microsoft as a monopolist that used its market power to bend other companies to its will and stifle competition.
The business of Web sites and online services is not the browser market, and there is no suggestion that any of MSN's moves raise antitrust issues. It seems doubtful, moreover, that Microsoft will have the kind of market power in the emerging Internet era of computing -- in which a proliferation of computing devices can be used to tap into the Web -- that the company's Windows operating system has given it during the personal computer era.
What is clear, however, is that Microsoft's culture and its business practices have not changed as a result of the antitrust case. At the Redmond campus, Microsoft workers seem to regard the case as just one more competitive challenge, a suit manufactured by their corporate enemies and hardly an accurate portrayal of the company for which they work. Microsoft is neither chastened nor humbled.
"We haven't changed anything we do in dealing with other companies," said Brad Chase, a senior vice president Mr. Ballmer brought to MSN last year, soon after Mr. Chase testified in the Microsoft trial. "We are good business partners, and we are moral partners."
The antitrust case has raised few qualms at Ford Motor, Best Buy and Tandy, all of which have forged e-commerce and distribution deals with Microsoft. In November, for example, Microsoft agreed to a deal with the Tandy Corporation in which Microsoft invested $100 million in RadioShack.com, Tandy's new online store.
For its part, Tandy will create a Microsoft area in each of its 7,000 Radio Shack stores, offering MSN Internet Access, Web TV, Windows CE-based hand-held devices, phones using MSN mobile software and Microsoft home networking software. The deal offers Microsoft a formidable bulkhead in the consumer market: There is a Radio Shack store within a five-minute drive of 94 percent of American households, and the chain is a huge seller of consumer technology.
Microsoft and America Online competed head-to-head for the Radio Shack deal. Len Roberts, the chairman of Tandy, says he chose Microsoft mainly because of its software strategy for tying together all the different Internet devices in the home. "We needed someone who could provide the technology glue -- the operating system for home integration -- and that's something Microsoft can do best," Mr. Roberts explained. "There's no question that AOL is a stronger Internet brand than MSN. But this deal is with Microsoft, and we're tying into its strategy."
In recent months, Microsoft's consumer group has become a vital leg in the company's wider Internet strategy in a way that was not apparent earlier. Industry analysts have argued that Microsoft should get out of the consumer business and focus instead on providing software for the Internet's infrastructure -- the operating systems, like Windows 2000, which is being introduced Thursday, that run big server computers serving up Web pages and e-commerce applications to desktop machines.
But that is not the view at Microsoft. Richard Belluzzo, who was recruited last September to become the group vice president of the consumer unit, recalled his early talks with William H. Gates, the chairman, Mr. Ballmer, Mr. Chase and other executives. They spoke, he said, of the evolution of software into Web-based services that people access by using cell phones, television set-top boxes and handheld devices as well as PC's.
IN the world of Web services, Mr. Belluzzo observed, a relationship with the consumer will be crucial -- to control the distribution of your underlying technology, if nothing else. (That, of course, is why Microsoft fought so hard in the browser wars. The Netscape browser could be the layer on top of Windows that would "commoditize" the underlying operating system, as Mr. Gates warned in a 1995 internal memo, "The Internet Tidal Wave.")
"It's going to be branded Web services that become the new face to the consumer, not the Windows desktop and how its icons are arranged on the screen," said Mr. Belluzzo, who came to Microsoft from Silicon Graphics, where he was chief executive, after running the consumer PC and printer business for years at Hewlett-Packard.
Mr. Chase added, "If you're not in the consumer business, you're not in the Web business, period."
Alongside MSN, the company's biggest branded Web service, is an effort that was recently dubbed "Next Generation Windows Services." It amounts to developing technology standards for the Internet in the same way Windows is a PC technology standard. One such service, Passport, is software that enables consumers to enter billing and shipping information once and not have to do it again while shopping on any e-commerce site that supports Passport. (One hundred companies, from Dell Computer to Buy.com, have signed up.)
Such Microsoft services are intended to save time for consumers and money for e-commerce sites, which do not have to write their own software. They are accessible without using any Microsoft software, but the broadest range of functions and smoothest integration are expected to come from using Microsoft products, from MSN to Windows 2000.
"What Microsoft is doing is taking the essence of its Windows strategy to the Web," said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard business school.
It is Microsoft's umbrella software plans for the Internet -- far more than the new marketing push or new features on MSN -- that cause anxiety at America Online. After its planned merger with Time Warner, AOL will suddenly be much more a media company -- the opposite course from Microsoft's. Even so, AOL executives say Microsoft is the company they most fear.
They have seen the pattern before, as Microsoft moves relentlessly up the computing ladder, stepping from one technology platform to the next. Microsoft started with the PC operating system, then added software development tools, then software applications like word processing and spreadsheets, then Internet browsing software. The next step up is Internet services, and AOL stands atop that business.
AOL's lead appears to be huge. Its 20 million online subscribers are 10 times more than MSN's Internet Access service. AOL is the most-trafficked Internet portal site, while Microsoft ranks third; Yahoo is second. Yet at different times, Lotus 1-2-3 had a commanding lead in spreadsheets, as did WordPerfect in word processing and Netscape in browsing software.
"Microsoft has done it again and again," observed Barry Schuler, who runs most of the online services at AOL. "Microsoft sits back, waits for rivals to make mistakes; it improves its product and then it leverages its platform advantage into new markets."
AOL executives are intent on avoiding the same fate. "AOL won't be mentioned someday in the same breath with Lotus 1-2-3, WordPerfect and others," Mr. Schuler added.
Microsoft executives say that making inroads against AOL will be a long uphill climb. "There is no silver bullet," Mr. Chase conceded.
Yet they point to market research that suggests AOL has vulnerabilities. The data shows that more than 3 percent of AOL subscribers quit the service each month, an annual churn rate of more than eight million subscribers. About 15 percent of AOL subscribers get a busy signal during the most popular evening hours while the failure rate for MSN is 6 percent. A survey commissioned by Microsoft concluded that half of AOL subscribers might switch if they saw there was a "credible contender."
"The churn rate is still very high in this industry," Mr. Belluzzo said. "Nothing is really settled yet."
AOL replies that the rate at which subscribers leave its service is at "historical lows" and, based on its research, customer satisfaction has never been higher.
In the markets where Microsoft has come from way behind to win, it has improved its technology, but it has also changed the economics of the business. In office productivity software, it bundled spreadsheets, word processing and database software and sold them as a suite, charging little more than rivals charged for a single application program. In the browser market, it folded its browsing software into Windows and gave it away.
Last year, Microsoft began offering a $400 rebate to PC buyers who agreed to take the MSN Internet Access service for three years. AOL responded within a month, but only with a rebate on its CompuServe service, not the main AOL service.
Still, Microsoft is offering the rebate solely on the purchase of a PC through certain manufacturers or retailers like Radio Shack and Office Depot. The more aggressive approach would be to offer the rebates directly to consumers, not just PC buyers -- a bold and expensive bid to grab market share, if Microsoft did it.
Microsoft is apparently considering that option. "We want to change the rules, and we will," Mr. Chase said. "But just how we plan to do that is part of the fun."
Whether Microsoft's new consumer Web strategy will succeed is unclear. And it has plenty of rivals besides AOL, including Web sites that compete with one of the "personal productivity" services under the MSN umbrella -- from travel to personal finance to shopping.
Microsoft's consumer business is expected to grow nearly 40 percent this year, to more than $3 billion in revenue -- and to lose roughly $300 million, estimates David Readerman, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners. That loss, however, would be well below an estimated $500 million in 1998. "That's Ballmer's influence," Mr. Readerman said.
At Microsoft, that $300 million loss would be regarded as an investment in the future. But perhaps the surest sign of faith in the new consumer strategy is the people it has attracted to the business, both newcomers and executives drawn from elsewhere in the company. Two veterans of the browser wars, Mr. Mehdi and Mr. Chase, are examples.
Mr. Mehdi, 32, joined Microsoft in 1992, and given his yearly option grants is probably worth tens of millions of dollars. Mr. Chase, 39, has been at the company since 1987 and is likely worth more than $100 million. Neither will comment on those estimates, but Mr. Chase acknowledged, "We don't have to work if we don't want to."
Like some of their peers, they could have left to run Internet start-ups; Mr. Mehdi says he gets about one such offer a week. But he says he is staying in Redmond, where he now is director of MSN marketing, because he believes in the strategy, and in Microsoft. Mr. Chase echoes those sentiments, adding that he relishes the come-from-behind challenge. "We're underdogs, but we're starting to bark," he said.
Members of Microsoft's class of 1999, the 700 employees who joined the company from computer science programs and business schools last year, are also convinced that Redmond is still the place to make a difference in computing -- and a personal fortune in the bargain. Most of them declined jobs at Internet start-ups or at one of Microsoft's big rivals.
Andrew Olson, a graduate of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, passed up offers from both start-ups and from Sun Microsystems. He speaks of the "amazingly high quotient of really smart people" at Microsoft and the "exciting challenge" of trying to help MSN rebound.
Other newcomers compare a talk with Mr. Gates or Mr. Ballmer to an encounter with a "Zen master." They see a big company with extraordinary entrepreneurial energy, run from the bottom up, where every project is a venture, where if you ship the "right bag of bits" it can have a "huge impact."
"You have to be here to get it," said Ori Amiga, 22, a computer science graduate of Macalester College who is working on an Internet software project.
Others may doubt, or fear, but at Microsoft they still believe.

HEADLINE: Whose Prosperity?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re your Feb. 8 Business Day article about whose administration can claim credit for the economic expansion: It is true that President Clinton sold his 1993 tax increase as a deficit-reduction necessity. However, the president never followed the increase with a serious effort to reduce the growth of spending. 
 It was only after the Democrats failed to retake the House in 1996 and polling continued to show huge public support for balancing the budget that President Clinton came to the table and signed the 1997 balanced-budget agreement. Now that the budget is in surplus and popular with the voters, the president is trying to take credit for something in which he reluctantly became a participant and beneficiary. He was no more serious about reducing the deficit than he was about a middle-class tax cut or welfare reform.

HEADLINE: Dangerous Plans for Colombia

 BODY:
Colombia is Latin America's most complex and troubled country. Its two overwhelming problems -- a booming trade in cocaine and heroin, and a vicious, nearly 40-year-old civil war -- are intertwined and getting worse. Increasingly they threaten not just Colombia, but neighboring countries as well, including Venezuela, one of the largest suppliers of oil to the United States.
Now the Clinton administration has unveiled a $1.3 billion plan to help Colombia, including $955 million in security assistance. Colombia is already the largest recipient of American security aid after Israel and Egypt. The plan reflects neither a realistic strategy to fight illegal drugs nor an effective long-term approach to establish peace and stability. Instead it risks dragging the United States into a costly counterinsurgency war. 
 Both the drug trade and Colombia's stability are legitimate American concerns. The administration and supporters of the plan in Congress have concluded that the most effective American response is to increase military assistance and forge a close alliance with Colombia's armed forces. Washington should have learned long ago that partnership with an abusive and ineffective Latin American military rarely produces positive results and often undermines democracy in the region.
Colombia produces 80 percent of the world's cocaine and about two-thirds of the heroin consumed in the United States. Administration officials insist that the security assistance would be aimed primarily at fighting drug trafficking and not at counterinsurgency operations against leftist guerrilla groups. But in many areas of Colombia the distinction is meaningless. In recent years both the guerrillas and murderous right-wing paramilitary squads associated with the army have earned millions of dollars from the drug trade.
President Andres Pastrana is well intentioned and deserves American support. But this plan is overwhelmingly skewed toward a military approach to problems that for years have stubbornly resisted military solutions. Washington should be devoting a far greater share of its support to the Pastrana government's own admirable efforts to strengthen civil institutions and address social and economic inequities that fuel the war and the drug economy. They include reorganizing and strengthening the judiciary, as well as alternative development strategies that would help farmers grow conventional crops, like coffee and cotton, and subsidize the construction of roads and schools. Colombia's security problems cannot be ignored, and there may be ways for the United States to work with the Pastrana government to strengthen the Colombian military. But this should be done with stricter conditions and an emphasis on reforming the armed forces rather than on equipping them to fight a protracted civil war in which civilians are the main casualties.
Peace talks aimed at a negotiated settlement represent the best solution to both the drug problem and the war. The Clinton administration has provided intermittent support for Mr. Pastrana's early efforts to talk peace with guerrilla leaders. He has had little success thus far. But in recent days key rebel leaders have signaled a new interest in negotiations, agreeing to meet with government representatives in Sweden. Washington should redouble its support for these talks. Throwing its weight behind Colombia's military at this stage will only escalate a war that neither side can win.

A Pillar of Harlem Gets Lift From Teenagers

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL 

 BODY:
The teenagers who write, edit and produce the online newspaper HarlemLive report stories, create Web pages and devise promotions for their site. But they had not been exposed to deadlines until last month, when a famous Harlem institution asked for their help on its own Internet project.
In mid-January, the Institute for Learning Technologies at Columbia University asked the youths to help develop a Web site for the Abyssinian Development Corporation (www.adcorp.org), which is affiliated with the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. Financed with a $20,000 grant from the Bell Atlantic Foundation, the site had already been designed by Saman Dashti, a Web site developer. 
 About 10 teenagers signed on to help build it, and each was paid $10 to $15 an hour for their work, said Richard Carlton, the founder and director of HarlemLive. But the students had just a few weeks before the scheduled debut of the site on Feb. 3 (HarlemLive's own Web site is www.harlemlive.org).
Clifton Taylor, 14, a freshman at Central Park East High School in East Harlem, was one of a handful who did the final heavy lifting. Clifton, who grew up in Jamaica, said he was cured of an addiction to video games when he learned how to design Web sites through HarlemLive. Working on the Abyssinian site, he said, cemented his aspiration to become a professional Web designer -- as opposed to a carpenter, his previous career goal -- because it gave him a sense of what it takes to work under fire.
"I learned that when you're doing something professional you have to try not to make any mistakes," he said.
WHAT YOU SEE -- The graphic content of the Abyssinian site is minimal, but there is a great deal of helpful information: a primer on the history of Harlem, an outline of the missions of the development corporation and the church, a depiction of the organization's efforts to transform the neighborhood, and a resource directory listing agencies and groups that provide community services.
Visually, the most interesting aspect of the Abyssinian site is the Housing Initiatives section (to get to it, click on Community Building Programs on the home page), featuring before-and-after photographs of Harlem brownstones and other buildings that have been restored in recent years by Abyssinian. Another section, called Flagship Programs, tells about the development of the Pathmark supermarket and shopping center on 125th Street and Lexington Avenue, which some credit with helping to start Harlem's recent economic boom. The Abyssinian Development Corporation was one of the project's developers.
The most notable thing about the site may be its very existence. The Abyssinian Development Corporation is one of just a few major Harlem organizations, including the Studio Museum in Harlem and the Frederick Douglass Creative Arts Center, with an Internet presence.
Bruce Lincoln, manager of community outreach for the Institute for Learning Technologies at Columbia and the executive producer of the site, said it is part of an effort to bridge the neighborhood's digital divide.
WHAT YOU GET -- An inside look at one of the major groups behind the economic revitalization of Harlem.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD: HEADS UP;
The Melting-Pot Politics of 2000 Are Truly Soupy

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
PITY the poor presidential campaign strategists. With make-or-break primaries fast approaching, they're frantically trying to cobble together winning strategies to appeal to an electorate so diverse, cacophonous and in flux as to make the folks trying to build the Tower of Babel sound like a harmonious glee club. With no big issue like war, recession or incumbency to give the 2000 race some shape, America looks more than ever like an indistinct montage of contending groups -- some new, some old standbys.
This time around, there are hero-admiring dads to take into consideration along with angry white males, single moms along with soccer moms. There are seniors whose politics are shifting ever rightward and -- perhaps most important -- a growing number of independents who, as their name suggests, are hardly a monolith. Cutting across everything is a schizophrenic view of President Clinton, who is both loved and loathed at the same time -- sometimes by the same people. 
 It's a niche marketer's dream, and a pundit's nightmare.
"There's a lot going on out there," said David Axelrod, a Democratic political consultant in Chicago. "There is no one thing that was driving everything as there was in '92 or '80 or '84. There are times when single issues overwhelm everything else. This isn't one of those times."
Handicapping the key electoral demographics is a tricky business, but here goes anyway:
The Guy's Guy. In some ways, the last few years have been tough for white guys. Sure, they're making money, either through overtime at the auto plant or overdrive in the stock market. They've got SUV's and IPO's. But in the political arena, they've had nobody to look up to. Four years ago the thought of a Colin Powell candidacy made many weak in the knees. But he took a hike on them. Now they've suddenly got two straight-talking heroes -- John McCain and Bill Bradley -- from the realms of war and sport.
Exit polls conducted by the Los Angeles Times during the New Hampshire primary illustrate what could be the makings of a gender gap involving both Mr. McCain and Mr. Bradley. According to the polls, 50 percent of men voting in the Republican primary backed Mr. McCain while only 29 percent went for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Among men voting Democratic, Mr. Bradley beat Vice President Al Gore among men by about four points (while he trailed Mr. Gore by five points among women).
"It's all those guilty male boomers who didn't go to Nam," Lou DiNatali, a senior fellow with the John W. McCormack Institute, a Boston-based research organization, said of Mr. McCain's appeal to men. "First, they went with Clinton, the anti-war guy. Now they go for the P.O.W."
So far, the gender gap has helped Mr. McCain more than Mr. Bradley. That's because so many more men vote in Republican primaries than in Democratic ones.
Should Mr. McCain win the Republican nomination, his male-based appeal will probably widen the already cavernous gender gap between the Republicans and Democrats, since Mr. Gore draws much of his strength from women. That situation might favor the Democrat, since there were 7 million more eligible female voters than eligible male voters in 1998. And women tend to register and vote in higher proportions than men.
Independents' Day. In the New Hampshire primary, unaffiliated voters helped power Mr. McCain to a 19-point victory over Mr. Bush, and kept Mr. Bradley close enough to Mr. Gore to remain in the race. The independents' role there has stirred interest in how much of a force they will be in other primaries and the general election. After all, they make up about 13 percent of the electorate nationally, 25 percent in the Rocky Mountain states and 34 percent of registered voters in New England.
But the independents are hardly a bloc. There are so-called "prosperity independents," affluent, generally white, college-educated, Internet-savvy, stock-buying voters who tend to be pro-environment and socially liberal yet fiscally conservative. They were a hefty slice of Mr. McCain's support in New Hampshire, but in national polls they also tend to like Mr. Gore.
Mr. Bradley also roped in his share of independents in New Hampshire as well. But his independents, while also well educated, tended to be less affluent, earning less than $50,000 annually, according to polls conducted by R.K.M. Researchers Inc. of Portsmouth, N.H. These voters tend to be more liberal when it comes to government spending.
There is a third large group of independents: people who aren't particularly interested in politics. More than 7.1 million people were added to the voter rolls in 1997 and 1998, as a result of the so-called "motor voter" law, which made it possible to register to vote when renewing a driver's license, applying for welfare and conducting business with other government agencies. Many of these new voters have registered as independents. Who these disaffected voters will vote for -- if they vote at all -- is an open question.
Bifurcated Blacks. The black vote, as always, will be critical for Democrats. But while 55 percent of blacks live in the South, they tend to turn out in lower proportions than Northern blacks, who tend to be more affluent and better educated and are less likely to live in hard-to-organize rural areas. Indeed, except for 1992, Northern blacks have voted in higher proportions than Southern blacks in every Presidential election since the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965.
Some political strategists say that unless this changes, the black vote may be more of a factor in closely fought states in the industrial Midwest like Michigan, Illinois and Ohio than in Deep South states like Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi, where Republicans have had a lock.
The Giants Sleeps Tonight. For years Hispanics have been described as the sleeping giant of American politics, and George W. Bush has trumpeted the fact that he can appeal to this group. Yet when it comes to Presidential races, there are no signs this giant is stirring or that Hispanics will have much of an impact on the race.
Hispanics make up about 10 percent of the voting age population. But half of that group is concentrated in two states -- California and Texas. In 1996, Bill Clinton got 71 percent of the Hispanic vote in California and won the state. He got 76 percent of that vote in Texas and lost. Most strategists do not expect a markedly different result this year.
Besides, about 40 percent of Hispanics of voting age are not United States citizens and only 26 percent of those eligible to vote did so in 1996 -- far fewer than non-Hispanic whites and blacks -- despite a major effort by the Democratic Party and Hispanic leaders to get out the vote.
The one state where Hispanics may be crucial is Florida. Four years ago, Bob Dole, the Republican Presidential nominee, won only 46 percent of the Hispanics who voted there, mainly conservative Cuban-Americans. That was the lowest draw of any Republican candidate in recent memory. Vowing not to let that happen again, the Republicans -- particularly Mr. Bush, whose brother, Jeb, is the Governor -- are vigorously courting Cuban-American voters. But Democrats, noting that the Cuban-American community is younger and less vehemently anti-Castro, sense an opening.
Old Story. It used to be that the band would strike up the Roosevelt-era anthem "Happy Days Are Here Again" and elderly voters would feel all nostalgic and troop off to vote Democratic. No more. Quite simply, many of those seniors who remember the New Deal have passed away, and many more of the voters now over 65 are people who were swept up in the Reagan Revolution and have remained Republicans.
"The senior vote today is a different group of people than it was four years ago and eight years ago," said John Rother, director of Legislation and Public Policy for the American Association of Retired Persons, who is not publicly supporting any candidate. "They didn't go through a life experience like the Depression that brought everybody together and they don't have the same view of government."
The Young and The Listless. Despite efforts like MTV's "Rock the Vote," young people continue to be among the most politically apathetic groups in the country. In 1996, only 32.4 percent of people 18 to 24 years old cast a ballot -- the lowest level since 1972, when the voting age was lowered to 18.
A close race and a maverick candidate like Mr. Bradley or Mr. McCain might bring out more young voters. But it's unclear if anything can break through this group's lack of interest.
Still Angry After All. The angry white males are still around. They tend to be college grads, relatively affluent and over 50 years old. They are more likely married, living in the South and are often ex-Democrats turned Republican. They hate Mr. Clinton with a passion. According to Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Center for People and the Press, they make up about 10 percent of the population and 12 percent of registered voters.
They had a moment in the sun in 1994, when they helped power the Republicans to control of Congress. But even as their economic status has improved and their influence has waned, their anger has not diminished. "Many still feel that the cultural winds are blowing against them," said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster in Atlanta. "That creates the sense that the forces of political correctness are working against them and what they believe."
I Do, I Do. The gender gap has been a hardy perennial in analyses of the electorate. But perhaps as important in determining who is wed to which party is a voter's marital status. Exit polls indicate that married men supported the Republican over the Democrat in every Presidential race since 1984, and that except for 1996, when they backed Mr. Clinton over Bob Dole, married women did the same.
Unmarried men have a more checkered recent history, backing Ronald Reagan in 1984 and George Bush in 1988, and flocking to Mr. Clinton in 1992 and 1996. On the other hand, Democrats since 1984 have set single women's hearts aflutter. And in Mr. Kohut's survey, 60.7 percent of unmarried women with children -- so-called waitress moms -- said they supported Mr. Gore.
"They talk about soccer moms, but, really, for Clinton and Gore, it's single moms," Mr. Kohut said.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Campus Politics Young and Anarchic, the Angry Left Is Reborn in Mexico

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
DURING the cold war, when Latin American leftists gravitated toward Communism, it was easy for them to identify their enemies: local military dictators or American corporate imperialists. They had an economic system to demonize -- capitalism -- and an alternative -- socialism --- to put in its place. And they had a playbook, written by Marx and Lenin and Fidel Castro, to guide their thinking and strategy.
But times are different. There still is an activist left in Latin America, and it still does battle with inequality and poverty and undemocratic government. But the recent nine-month strike at Mexico's national university revealed a new kind of leftist movement, one whose new foe is the global economy. The strike, which devastated Mexico's most important university and divided its society, gave a preview of the vexing challenges the new leftists may pose to the region's young democracies. 
 The striking students at the National Autonomous University of Mexico declared that their fundamental purpose was to oppose the worldwide spread of free trade and the lean government, pro-business policies that promote it. But the conundrum for their movement was that the new adversary -- globalism -- was faceless. It was a product of commerce and technology more than of government or guns. It was emerging everywhere at once, with no clear alternative in sight.
If the students were confronting anarchic change, they met it with an anarchic movement. The strike steering committee took over the campus, using barbed wire to keep other students out. They elected no outstanding leaders and took their decisions in chaotic all-night assemblies. Over the months the university conceded demand after demand, but the strikers only upped the ante.
The strikers confounded everyone who dealt with them, from conciliatory university administrators to conservative intellectuals to lifelong leftists. In the end, after the federal police marched in on Feb. 6 and hauled the remaining strikers away to jail, it seemed that the strike had been an end in itself, a form of complete resistance against social and economic changes they could never hope to control.
The new leftism probably emerged in Mexico because this country has led the charge in Latin America into the globalized age. Since signing on to the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexico has seen its international trade explode, its business middle class rise like a phoenix and the country's northern half become an industrial export powerhouse.
BUT the student strikers were also a product of globalization -- of two decades of policies that laid the foundations for Mexico's recent leap into the global economy. The government has stimulated growth by restraining inflation, mainly by depressing workers' wages. Official figures show that the minimum wage today buys 48 percent of what it did in 1982. So, while export enclaves have thrived, workers elsewhere have been drawn into a spiral of downward mobility.
The national university, with 275,000 students, was once Mexico's main avenue of social ascent. Today many students graduate wondering if they will be able to earn a living. Alfonso Zarate, a political analyst, said the strike revealed how much Mexico has become "a nation of winners and losers."
The strike was not radical at the start. It began last April, as a protest against a plan to charge tuition -- about $150 a year -- for the first time in decades. The university president, Francisco Barnes de Castro, cast the plan as an effort to get resources for a critically underfunded institution. But in today's increasinly impoverished urban working class, even small tuition costs can break a family's budget.
The new left gave the students a rationale for rejecting the plan. It was a vast plot by the business-friendly government to impose private sector logic on a public university, and deny working class youth the education they deserved.
OVER time, a faction of strikers, dubbed "ultras" by their companions because of their intolerance for dissent, gained the upper hand through nasty purges. A central demand was for face-to-face negotiations with the university president. But the movement, once it was in the hands of the ultras, did not really negotiate. The strikers never moved an inch from their original demands. Administrators dropped the tuition plan, agreed to direct talks, agreed even to hold a congress to reform how the whole university was organized.
But the strikers, true to their anarchist core and lacking vision of an alternative, continued to resist.
"Rebellion is our only leader, our one true cause and the reason for everything we do," read one banner.
Alejandro Alvarez, an economics professor, at first supported the strike but fell out with the ultras. "They made distrust into a form of politics," he said.
In the end, the strike divided Mexico, which is in the midst of a delicate move from authoritarianism to democracy. While the general public applauded the police action to end the strike, many intellectuals, journalists and democratic leaders saw it as an extension of the bloody repression with which the student movement of 1968 was broken. The result was some of the most vigorous street protests Mexico has seen in years.
The damage to education and the division among Mexicans could serve as a cautionary tale to anyone who thinks the changes that globalization brings will only reinforce democratic institutions.

That's Alan, With an A, The Guy Who Sets Rates

BYLINE: By ROY FURCHGOTT 

 BODY:
As interest rates creep up, it is only natural for investors to keep a sharp eye on Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman.
An online financial planning service, WealthHound.com, wants to help them do just that. It has started a page dedicated to Greenspan news, intended to help Fed watchers track the chairman's every move and provide them with a growing archive of articles about Mr. Greenspan, culled from financial news wires. 
 On its Feb. 1 debut, however, the Web page furnished more Greenspans than some visitors had bargained for. During its opening week, it included articles that mentioned Bud Greenspan, chairman of the entertainment portal eUniverse; Ron Greenspan, webmaster for GoCancun.com, a travel site, and Sharon Greenspan, a spokeswoman for Amazon.com, the online retailer.
But, alas, none about Alan Greenspan.
The glitch was corrected in a late-night programming session, according to Scott Mager, a WealthHound.com principal. "We are just adding his first name to the search," he said. "It will only find news if it says 'Alan' and 'Greenspan.' " ROY FURCHGOTT

HEADLINE: INVESTING: FUNDS WATCH;
Buying at Markdown?

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The Franklin Mutual group of funds has been buying the stocks of department store companies like Saks and J. C. Penney, arguing that investors have beaten down such shares to bargain levels.
Many department store stocks fell sharply last year and now trade near 52-week lows. Such declines have attracted Franklin Mutual, a Short Hills, N.J., investment adviser owned by Franklin Resources of San Mateo, Calif., that is known for buying out-of-favor stocks. 
 These investments are risky -- even at deflated prices -- because department stores are vulnerable to problems if the United States economy falters, ending a record-breaking expansion that has lasted almost nine years, analysts said. But Larry Sondike, the Franklin Mutual portfolio manager who follows department stores, said he was undeterred by those and other concerns.
"There are dot-com fears, interest rate fears, cyclical fears that the economy is going to weaken," Mr. Sondike said. "The stocks have declined on overblown fears, resulting in share prices we think are very attractive."
The mutual fund group bought seven million shares in Saks and 3.5 million in J. C. Penney last year, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It also bought 2.4 million shares of Sears, Roebuck and 1.4 million of May Department Stores in 1999, and raised its stake in Federated Department Stores to 2.9 million shares from 2.2 million.

HEADLINE: A Politician Sees Future Of Japan In Its Past

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 12

 BODY:
By midday, the visitors were spilling out of the waiting room and into the corridor outside the office of Shizuka Kamei, the longtime machine politician who has suddenly become one of this country's most powerful and solicited figures.
"This is a very critical moment in Japan's history, that will decide whether we have a good 21st century or not," said Mr. Kamei, who is the policy chief in the governing Liberal Democratic Party. 
 What many of Mr. Kamei's critics question, though -- and they abound not only in the opposition and in business circles but also in his own party -- is whether this staunchly conservative former policeman is in fact trying to steer Japan into the present century or back into the last.
Take, for example, Mr. Kamei's scornful views on efficiency and competition. "The competitive market principle, which made the United States affluent and made its people happy, cannot necessarily be applied to Japan," he says.
"Mr. Kamei is an old-time politician, and he is trying very hard to keep old-time Japan going, its industries, its society," said Taro Kono, a 37-year-old member of Parliament from the Liberal Democratic Party frustrated by Mr. Kamei's powerful influence. "We lag behind the U.S. because too many people like him are trying to keep Japan the way it is, rather than adapt to our new circumstances."
Indeed, with each tentative step that Japan takes toward economic recovery, after a decade of slow growth, Mr. Kamei has emerged increasingly resolute -- and usually successful -- in his opposition to the liberalizing reforms that many say are badly needed to ensure future prosperity.
His influence was most recently on display over the New Year holidays, when, in the midst of the traditional news lull, he prevailed upon the government to scuttle quietly an important component of its longstanding plans to reform the banking sector.
The move -- decried by Japan's leading business association, the Keidanren, editorial writers and many economists -- was seen as a costly sop to the country's thrift institutions and other small banks, many of which would fail without protection. 
As the leader of a loose band of Liberal Democratic Party figures and Parliament members who unabashedly call themselves the "anti-deregulation committee," Mr. Kamei is the unapologetic champion of troubled businesses, and of a Japan whose past glories are now fast fading. His is the land of high trade barriers protecting deeply inefficient businesses, from steel and textile manufacturers to the small retail sector, while relentlessly promoting Japan's sleeker exports.
Indeed, while the government of Keizo Obuchi, the prime minister who appointed him, often preaches the gospel of competitiveness, the importance of the Internet and internationalization, for Mr. Kamei globalization stands out as a real menace.
"Japan has a long history, just like America," Mr. Kamei said in his large office, which is filled with expensive orchids and every manner of the animal that is his namesake, the turtle. "Our society is based on villages and towns which have been in existence for hundreds of years. During that time, a certain lifestyle has formed, and we should attach some importance to these traditional ways."
Many, however, see Mr. Kamei's championing of the little man and of depressed industries as driven not so much by principle as political and financial calculations.
The Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed Japan for all but two years since the end of World War II, is above all a vote-getting machine whose wheels are greased through patronage and endless fundraising.
Mr. Kamei has excelled in this world, and charges of numerous financial irregularities have dogged him throughout his political life, including involvement with the Japanese mobs that operate the country's ubiquitous pachinko game parlors.
Kaoru Ogawa, a well-known corporate gadfly, who has himself often been accused of associating with gangsters, recently called Mr. Kamei the "dirtiest in Japan."
Mr. Kamei gave an impassioned but nuanced defense of his reputation.
"I am a former police officer, and have never touched dirty money," he said. "My fund-raising comes from small- and medium-size businesses, and I have done nothing which could be reproached me."
"I am a politician, however," he added. "And I am sometimes asked to take care of certain people. Some of them have sometimes been convicted of crimes, but I have nothing to be ashamed of."

When Jon Tara first heard that unknown vandals with unclear motives had managed to sabotage several of the Internet's most prominent businesses last week, the San Diego software engineer posted a probing message to an online investing forum that he frequents.
"Is this the end of Internet innocence? Is the house of cards about to crumble?" Mr. Tara, 45, wondered. "Can we move to an Internet-based economy while the potential exists for a group of hackers to bring it to its knees at any time?" 
 Yet by Friday, Mr. Tara had settled back into his normal Internet routine, which includes trading stocks, exchanging e-mail with clients all day, and checking traffic conditions before he drives home from work. "I could see discontinuing trading online if the instances of this were accelerated, but it would be a very difficult decision." Mr. Tara said. "We're going to be dependent on the Internet, and I don't think you can stop that."
While the assaults hobbled popular Web sites like Yahoo, Amazon and eBay for only a few hours, the ensuing consternation underscored how heavily both businesses and consumers have come to rely on the Internet for everything from paying bills to planning vacations.
But as Internet executives beef up security and public attention turns to the F.B.I. pursuit of the culprits, some network experts -- and at least a few lay Internet users -- contend that last week's electronic attacks should sound an alarm. As people are enticed to put their personal, political, financial and even medical lives online, those who counsel caution see a need for a more gradual pace.
They say that the kind of mischief that today might merely cause delays and frustrations could eventually have more serious and far-reaching consequences. Being blocked from an eBay auction for four hours may be only a nuisance. But being shut out from E*Trade, the online brokerage firm that was also hit last week, had a more direct financial impact on those affected. And what would happen if, as many planners hope, all of a person's medical history was someday stored on a Web site? A Netscape error message may provide little solace to the next of kin.
"This should give us pause," said Lauren Weinstein, co-founder of a group called People for Internet Responsibility. "With all the dot-com hype that's been going on, not enough attention has been given to the fact that the Internet is not like the older technologies on which we have built our commerce over the last century. It has vulnerabilities that need to be factored into decisions about all these important applications."
Yu Sun, a computer science student in Seattle, had another suggestion for the Internet industry. "Maybe they should stop wasting huge amounts of money on Super Bowl advertising and spend more on improving their security," said Mr. Sun, who was unable to compare homework with a fellow student by e-mail last week while Yahoo, their e-mail provider, was recovering from the attack.
Spoilsport views are, of course, not popular among e-commerce executives, who have sought to cast the vandalism as an unfortunate cost of doing business online. Nor are many frequent Internet users or technology investors receptive to the notion of downsizing digitization.
Traffic at the compromised sites returned to normal almost immediately after the attacks. Online Valentine's Day shoppers also seemed unfazed, with reports showing traffic spikes at sites like 1800Flowers.com and VictoriasSecret.com last week.
As for investor confidence, while the share price of some of the affected companies dipped this week, all of them had recovered by the close of trading Friday.
"There's going to be problems with the Internet here and there," said Donna Pelletier, 45, of Harrisville, R.I., echoing the sentiments of many others on the eBay Cafe discussion group. "This only lasted for a couple of hours, so I don't think it's that big a deal."
Perhaps not, or at least not now. Only a tiny fraction of consumer sales -- 1.2 percent -- currently take place over the Internet, according to the Boston Consulting Group.
But several million military personnel will cast their presidential ballots via Internet this year. Online banks and bank services are proliferating. And online transactions, while still small, more than doubled last year.
The security of such transactions has already proved shaky. Last month, for instance, an extortionist disclosed some of the 300,000 customer credit cards he said he had stolen from CD Universe, an online music retailer. Days later, a new online bank, X.com, a division of the La Jara, Colo., community bank First Western National Bank, discovered that for almost a month, its customers had been able to transfer funds from any other account in the nation's banking system to accounts at the bank.
Moreover, as businesses transfer more of their internal operations online, the potential toll rises. "The biggest risk is not what we've seen so far, it's if hackers start to attack business-to-business sites," said David Pecaut, head of Boston Consulting's e-commerce practice.
That's partly why consultants urge their Internet clients to go the "clicks and mortar" route, operating through multiple channels. Charles Schwab, the brokerage firm, which has call centers and physical branches as well as a Web service, is often held up as a model.
Whether confidence in the Internet as an economic engine declines at all after last week's brazen attacks may depend on whether law enforcement authorities are able to apprehend whoever orchestrated the electronic incursions. Yet even if the rule of law prevails in this instance, Internet executives acknowledge that there is little they can do to prevent similar assaults in the future.
"There's no way today to stop the attack from occurring if it gets launched," said Greg Hawkins, chief executive of Buy.com, one of the sites disabled by a deluge of data on Tuesday, the day it went public. "All we believe we can really do is to ensure that we can deal with it as rapidly and efficiently as possible."
The form of assault on the sites last week, known as denial of service, is particularly difficult to defend against. Essentially, intruders use third-party machines to overwhelm the victim's servers, preventing customers from gaining access to the site.
As a result, lax security on any of the millions of computers connected to the Internet leaves every other one exposed.
E-commerce executives prefer to compare their security risks to those of real-world retailers. On the Internet, they note, stores are open all day, they do not worry about shoplifting, and they can operate much more efficiently. Occasional interruptions of service are unfortunate, but hardly cataclysmic.
But Web retailers offer vandals a single target to attack instead of a series of separate stores. Critics argue that such attacks are likely to increase both because of the network's inherent security flaws and because vandals will discover they are able to achieve a dramatic effect with comparatively little effort.
"The French farmers blockading the McDonald's were not that effective," said Tom Eisenmann, who teaches e-commerce at the Harvard Business School. 'What's different here is the scale.'
The Internet's scale -- and its sheer ubiquity -- are why even disgruntled Internet users are hanging tough. After being shut out of Yahoo last week, Mr. Sun and his friend briefly contemplated faxing their homework. But instead, they signed up for free e-mail accounts at another Web site. "E-mail," Mr. Sun said, "is so much easier."

HEADLINE: Nuclear Rivals Marshal Armies of Lobbyists in Washington

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Pakistan and India, the world's newest nuclear rivals, have brought their battles to Washington, where each country has assembled a bevy of highly paid lobbyists already tested in one fight -- Pakistan won -- and now engaged in another: whether President Clinton should visit Pakistan as well as India next month.
Mr. Clinton's foreign policy team will give him persuasive pros and cons. But in the end, the decision may hinge on the power of the Washington lobbyists who are being increasingly sought out by foreign countries that believe that they need professional help, whether it is to get a piece of the foreign policy pie or just to polish their image here. 
 Some countries, such as Israel, Greece and Taiwan, have always had a strong presence in the parlors of policy making in the capital, and some issues -- the Vietnam war in the 1960's; intervention in Central America in the early 1980's -- have generated vocal constituencies. But the depth and breadth of lobbying by individual countries has grown in recent years, and foreign governments are now paying out tens of thousands of dollars a month.
In the case of India and Pakistan and Mr. Clinton's travels, each side has already begun to lobby the White House, the State Department and Congress.
Traditionally, India shunned lobbyists, relying on its distinguished foreign service to make the nation's case in State Department meetings with Indian diplomats. These days, however, India is paying $50,000 a month for the lobbying services of Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand, where the heavy hitters include two former Senate majority leaders, Democrat George Mitchell and Republican Bob Dole, and a former governor of Texas, Ann Richards. (Verner, Liipfert also lobbies for Ethiopia, the Marshall Islands, Slovenia, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay.)
Adding to some grumbling at home about the use of lobbyists, the Indian government is paying an additional $25,000 a month for the clout of former Democratic Congressman Stephen J. Solarz, a New Yorker who was viewed as a friendly voice for India when he was a lawmaker.
Meanwhile, Pakistan is shelling out $30,000 a month for the services of Charlie Wilson, a former Democratic Congressman from Texas who was a staunch ally of the country when he served in the House. Even though Mr. Wilson cautioned the Pakistani government last year about hiring another lobbyist -- given that "Pakistan's resources are limited," Mr. Wilson wrote in a memorandum -- just this month, Pakistan signed a contract with the politically connected law firm of Patton, Boggs & Blow for $22,500 a month. (Other countries that are paying Patton, Boggs for help include Benin, Croatia, Oman, Paraguay and Qatar.)
The person handling Pakistan's account is a former Clinton special counsel, Lanny J. Davis, who helped the White House navigate the 1996 Democratic fund-raising imbroglio.
Mr. Davis said in an interview that he had talked to the White House and the State Department, although he would not reveal which officials he had approached, about adding a stop in Pakistan when Mr. Clinton visits the Indian subcontinent next month. To spurn a visit, Mr. Davis said, "would be conveying a message of hostility, and pushing Pakistan in a dangerous direction away from the West and toward the Taliban."
"They keep thinking it's just a matter of hiring the right lobbyist, that the right lobbyist will be their salvation," Robert Oakley, a retired American diplomat, said about Pakistan, where he served as ambassador from 1988-1991.
And sometimes the right lobbyist may indeed make a difference.
Consider the battle last fall over legislation that would allow for the resumption of United States military aid to Pakistan. Since 1990, military assistance had been suspended because of Pakistan's nuclear program. On top of that, economic sanctions were imposed on Pakistan after it tested nuclear bombs in 1998.
Last year, the Senate's defense appropriations bill had a provision that would allow the president to waive the sanctions against Pakistan; the House bill did not have a similar provision. When the bill went to conference committee, Mr. Wilson went to work.
"I worked day and night," Mr. Wilson said. "I moved to the Hill," he added, passing time on a park bench, waiting to catch members.
The odds were against him. The Indian-American population is politically active, and growing, seeking to build a lobby on the model of the American lobby for Israel, lawmakers and diplomats say. And in Congress, as a reflection of that activism and of generous campaign contributions, there is an India caucus, with more than 100 members. Given its size, it is listened to at the State Department, diplomats there say.
The co-chairman of the India Caucus, Rep. Frank Pallone, a New Jersey Democrat who has received significant campaign contributions from Indian-Americans outside his district, has publicly urged President Clinton not to go to Pakistan.
By contrast, the Pakistani caucus, never had more than a dozen or so members, and is largely dormant now.
And Mr. Wilson was up against a few negatives on the Pakistan side of the ledger: Pakistan had recently tested its nuclear weapons; Pakistani-backed guerrillas had crossed into the Kargil region of the disputed territory of Kashmir last year, bringing international condemnation and the threat of outright war with India; then, in the midst of the Congressional deliberations, came the military coup -- or "political sea change," as Mr. Wilson carefully depicts it.
In arguing his client's cause during the congressional fight, Mr. Wilson hurled some tough charges. India had been "virtually a Soviet satellite," during the cold war, Mr. Wilson said he told representatives, a depiction he repeated with emphasis for use in the current row. Another aspersion was that "Indians hate Americans," he said, a charge most Indians would probably dispute.
But Mr. Wilson had something else going for him. While a member of Congress, he had served for 20 years on the defense subcommittee of the House appropriations committee. The members of this subcommittee were on the conference committee.
"I was extremely lucky," Mr. Wilson said. "They were all friends."
Mr. Wilson, and his client, won that day.
Now, the challenge for Mr. Wilson is to keep Pakistan off the State Department's list of terrorist nations, and to persuade Mr. Clinton that he must stop in Pakistan, however briefly, during the India trip. Once again, his colleague for 20 years in the House, Mr. Solarz, is on the other side, as is Verner, Liipfert.
Mr. Wilson and Mr. Solarz both granted lengthy interviews, as did Mr. Davis. Brenda Meister, who handles the India account at Verner, Liipfert, declined to be interviewed, saying that it was the firm's policy to maintain a low profile.
On one thing, Mr. Wilson and Mr. Solarz agree: Mr. Clinton would like to make the stop. Mr. Wilson's mission is to give him the political cover to do it; Mr. Solarz's is to stop it.
That would be "inappropriate and counterproductive," Mr. Solarz said. He minces no words. Pakistan is a "terrorist state," and now it has a military government. Mr. Solarz has already made these views known to the White House and the State Department, as well as to his former colleagues in Congress.
Mr. Wilson is equally busy, trying to generate a letter from enough members of Congress urging the president to make the stop.
Is he also talking to State Department officials? "Not more than four or five times a day," he answers.

HEADLINE: Amid Campaign Hoopla, One Region Feels Left Out

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: DENVER, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Ethanol plays so large a role in the agricultural economy of Iowa that candidates campaigning before the January caucuses there, the first test of presidential aspirations, ignored the issue at their peril.
Yet huge regional issues in what is loosely defined as the Interior West -- eight states that account for nearly a quarter of the country's land mass but only 40 of its 538 electoral votes -- have been all but ignored this year because of the marginal role these states play in the nomination process. Little is heard from the stump about land management, water rights, nuclear waste cleanup or endangered species. 
 By the time the polls close on Super Tuesday, March 7, more than two dozen states and American territories will have held primaries or caucuses that could well determine the major parties' nominees. But among the Interior eight -- Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming -- Arizona alone will have voted by then (in a primary for Republicans only).
In a further reflection of the region's scant influence, for the fifth straight election not one of the presidential or vice-presidential debates is to be held in any of the eight states.
In fact, the rarity of such debates anywhere in the West prompted the Western Governors' Association to ask the Commission on Presidential Debates last week to add a fourth presidential debate or a second vice-presidential debate, to be held in a Western state. In a letter to the commission, the governors expressed concern that it "has again overlooked the fastest-growing region in the country," with issues different from those in states to the east.
"It's just insane," Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, Republican of Utah, said of what many here regard as the Interior West's status as an afterthought, a result in part of the tendency of big states like California and New York to gain greater influence in the nomination process by moving up the dates of their primaries. "Everybody races to the front, and the more it's front-loaded, lots of areas in the United States get completely left out of the process."
No region so vast has been more frequently overlooked than the Interior West, whose eight states rank from 4th to 12th in land mass but from 24th to 50th in population. And in addition to their low population, most of the eight are so heavily Republican that the party's nominee can take them for granted. Only in Colorado and Nevada do Democrats have nearly equal strength.
The lack of attention has been especially noted by environmental organizations that focus much of their efforts on the West and rely on public awareness to get their issues before Congress and the administration.
"Gays in the military -- that is an important issue, but it affects a very small portion of the populace," said Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity in Tucson. "Clean air and clean water affect every single American."
Tom Marshall, coordinator of the disarmament program for the Rocky Mountain Peace and Justice Center in Boulder, Colo., said the cleanup of nuclear waste from cold-war weapons programs, an enormous problem in the West, "is an issue that rarely shows up, if at all, in presidential campaigns."
The same can be said for many other Western issues. "Any kind of public debate would focus on policies of the West," said Gov. Jim Geringer, Republican of Wyoming. "Like protection of national forest lands. Who wouldn't be for that? But if you don't talk about areas for grazing and areas for logging, then you've not taken everybody into consideration. And without debates, that part of it gets lost."
To increase the influence of the Interior West and shine a spotlight on Western issues, Governor Leavitt led an effort two years ago to create a Western presidential primary in early March that would have enabled voters in all eight states to cast votes on the same day. But the effort failed for a variety of reasons, and a chance for the region to broaden its influence was lost.
Nor has the West had much success attracting presidential debates. In recent years, only Los Angeles, in 1988, and San Diego, in 1996, have been host to any held in the region.
James M. Souby, executive director of the Western Governors' Association, said many universities, civic groups and other likely hosts "are not aware of the process" of applying. But the debate commission's executive director, Janet Brown, said that was not necessarily so.
This year, Ms. Brown said, the commission received dozens of inquiries but, finally, just 12 formal bids, only 3 from prospective hosts in the West. No bid, she said, came from the Interior West, and the three Pacific Coast bids were eliminated when the commission selected St. Louis, Boston and Winston-Salem, N.C., for the presidential debates and Danville, Ky., for the vice-presidential debate.
That prompted the Western governors to ask for the additional debate.
A commission co-chairman, Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., a Nevadan who is a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said that he sympathized with the Western states but that at this late date, he could not hold out much hope for the request.

HEADLINE: I.R.S. IS BOLSTERING EFFORTS TO CURB CHEATING ON TAXES

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Warning that continuing cuts at the Internal Revenue Service threaten the nation's tax system, the Clinton administration is proposing more money to find cheaters and make them pay up. And the agency's top official has begun emphasizing that catching cheaters is as important as helping honest taxpayers.
The administration is seeking a 9 percent increase in the agency's budget, the largest increase, adjusted for inflation, in 13 years. That would allow the I.R.S., whose auditing staff is down one-fourth since 1995, to raise the number of auditors for the first time in 6 years. 
 Republicans in Congress who have criticized the I.R.S. said they were open to the idea that more money might be needed.
Even before the request for an increased budget is taken up by Congress, the I.R.S. commissioner, Charles O. Rossotti, is moving to ensure that the agency does a better job of collecting taxes owed by companies and individuals, he said in an interview last week. For example, he has summoned all managers in the collections department to a three-day meeting in Chicago next month to insist that they act when taxpayers do not pay.
If the budget request is approved, part of it would pay for 633 more auditors, a 5 percent increase. They would hunt for cheating by people with incomes over $100,000, especially business owners, professionals and investors in partnerships. In the last three years, audit rates among such taxpayers have fallen by two-thirds, to about one in 131 returns.
The I.R.S. said it would also focus on illegitimate business tax shelters that make profits invisible to the I.R.S. These shelters are growing so fast, I.R.S. officials say, that despite soaring profits the taxes paid by large companies have actually begun to decline. These officials say that less than 70 cents of each dollar of profit reported to shareholders in 1998 was reported by companies as taxable, down from 91 cents in 1991.
The administration also wants to hire more people to answer telephone calls to the agency, allowing about 300 auditors detailed to this kind of customer service work to resume examining questionable returns.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said that "we need to begin increasing capacity" to enforce the tax laws "to maintain people's confidence that this is a tax system that works."
He said enforcement must go hand in hand with improving service to cooperative taxpayers. "Better customer service and greater collection volumes go together," he said.
Congress and the president have kept such a tight rein on spending that the I.R.S. has hired only 20 new auditors even as more than 2,000 have quit or retired since 1997.
One result is that this year fewer than one in 300 personal returns is expected to be audited, down from one in 63 two decades ago.
The decline in enforcement has become so significant that Mr. Rossotti now warns that it threatens to "undermine our entire system of voluntary tax compliance."
Mr. Rossotti and others worry that understaffing and a growing timidity by front-line auditors and tax collectors have allowed more Americans and businesses to get away with not paying what they owe.
Indeed, the I.R.S. has fallen down at the job of collecting from those who fail to turn over taxes due, mostly small businesses and the self-employed. Since hitting a record $38 billion in 1996, taxes collected through enforcement actions like audits and levies on bank accounts have fallen by 13 percent, or $5 billion.
Mr. Rossotti has summoned 665 collection managers to the meeting in Chicago next month to drive home the message that they cannot allow delinquent taxpayers, especially those who flout the law, to get away without paying. It is the first such meeting of collection managers in the agency's history, said Jody Patterson, an I.R.S. spokeswoman.
"We need to stanch the decline in collection activity," Mr. Rossotti said in an interview.
The I.R.S. came under fire in Congress two years ago, in hearings at which taxpayers said they had been bullied and harassed. Congress answered with, and President Clinton signed, legislation intended to give taxpayers more protection against overzealous tax agents.
After the law was passed, Mr. Rossotti, a wealthy businessman brought in to fix the agency, made improving service to customers -- as he calls taxpayers -- his theme.
Last year, the mission statement -- "to collect the proper amount of tax due" -- was replaced by "provide America's taxpayers top quality service by helping them understand and meet their tax responsibilities and by applying the tax law with integrity and fairness for all."
But recently Mr. Rossotti has increasingly emphasized the catching of cheaters as much as helping taxpayers. Earlier this month, for example, he told the Senate Finance Committee, "Customer satisfaction is not achieved by failing to collect taxes that are properly due."
And he has spoken out about the agency's weaknesses in enforcing the law.
He talks about shrinking resources, for one thing. The full-time I.R.S. payroll has fallen nearly 16,000, to 81,834 employees, this year, a 16 percent decline since 1993.
Yet in the last five years the number of income tax returns has grown 11 percent and the number of complex returns filed by people making $1 million or more is doubling every three years. About 250,000 households will report an income of $1 million or more for 1999.
And this at a time when the agency has had to comply with more than 1,200 changes imposed by Congress that essentially make its job more demanding. Some of those changes make it easier for taxpayers to get answers from the I.R.S., such as having people available around the clock to answer telephone inquiries. Others require the agency to take many more steps in the audit and collection process to make sure that taxpayers are not abused.
The equivalent of 3,000 more workers have been assigned to comply with the changes.
But beyond the shrinking size of the work force has been its attitude toward pursuing tax cheats. Many I.R.S. employees are now operating extremely cautiously for fear that under the new rules they can be fired for the way they once did their jobs. In interviews with The New York Times in the last year, collection officers across the country, all of whom insisted on anonymity, said that even in cases where they had followed the rules faithfully their managers were unwilling to approve seizures and levies.
"The real problem," Mr. Rossotti said, "is that there is a lot of confusion and sometimes managers are backing off to the point where they are not managing."
Over all, tax revenues have been soaring in recent years as the economy has boomed and profits have jumped. But I.R.S. officials say many forms of cheating have proliferated and tax revenues should be even higher. Their concern is that if people think they can cheat without being caught, many more people will do it and honest taxpayers will sour on the system.
"Our entire tax system depends on the vast majority of taxpayers who attempt to pay their taxes that are due having confidence that they are being treated fairly and that their competitors and neighbors are also paying what is due," Mr. Rossotti told the Senate Finance Committee earlier this month. "If the public concludes over a period of time that the I.R.S. cannot meet these basic expectations, the risk to the tax system will become very high and the effects very difficult and extraordinarily expensive to reverse."
Mr. Clinton, in his new budget proposal earlier this month, has asked for $8.84 billion for the I.R.S. in 2001, up 9 percent from the $8.11 billion Congress approved for this year. The $729 million increase includes $174 million this year and next to hire 1,633 more people, including 633 more auditors and 33 more tax collectors.
The extra money would allow the I.R.S. to replace about one-sixth of the auditors, collectors and related personnel it has lost since Mr. Clinton took office. It would also allow the hiring of more people to answer telephone inquiries from taxpayers, a job that diverted 3 percent of auditors and collectors from their primary work last year.
A spokeswoman for the Republicans who control the House Appropriations Committee said that adding a total of 2,800 full-time employees, as proposed in the budget, is a rather large request, one that will be discussed in hearings next month. Republicans have long held a suspicious view of the I.R.S. and have criticized the agency for what they call its plodding pace and its emphasis on catching tax cheats.
"We're going to have to look very closely at this request," said Elizabeth Mora, the spokeswoman, adding that Congress has had a different set of priorities for the I.R.S. in the past. "We have been concerned and remain concerned about modernization. We are also very concerned about a balance between law enforcement and customer service. We need to make sure there is a correct balance between the two."
Two architects of the recent laws overhauling the I.R.S. said they were open to the idea that more money may be needed for enforcement.
Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, said he "will do what's necessary so the I.R.S. can serve the taxpayer."
And Senator William V. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, said, "It's important that the I.R.S. have sufficient funding to ensure successful execution of the current reorganization plan in order to make tax collection more efficient, and provide better service to taxpayers."
The I.R.S. has also backed away from an interpretation of the new tax act that required collectors to demand full payment of taxes past due -- or nothing at all.
Under that new approach, tax delinquents who did not pay in full were having their cases put aside. Tax experts said that many people who owed money would bet that the statute of limitations would expire before the I.R.S. pursued them, and that therefore people who could have paid something would no longer do so.
The new policy directs agents to collect as much as possible from such taxpayers, just as was done previously.

HEADLINE: U.N. Chief Blames Rich Nations for Failure of Trade Talks

BYLINE: Agence France-Presse 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, today blamed the world's most powerful nations for the breakdown of last year's world trade talks and called for a "Global New Deal" to remedy the imbalances between rich and poor countries.
Mr. Annan described as a "popular myth" the belief that the World Trade Organization talks in Seattle were derailed by days of the violent protests that paralyzed the meeting's program. 
 Instead, he said at a United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, that their failure was the fault of the world's leading economic powers, which, he said, "could not agree on their priorities."
Developing nations played a more "active and united role" in the Seattle talks than ever before, he said, while the industrial powers bickered among themselves and showed that they did not have the will to carry out reforms in the rules that govern the international trading system.
The United Nations conference, which has earned a reputation as an advocate of poor nations, aims to bring developing nations into the global economic fold and calm fierce anti-trade sentiment.
But even before Mr. Annan could open the meeting today, some 1,000 protesters marched on the conference site in central Bangkok, demanding immediate action to share the spoils of globalization more fairly. The protesters, carried through the Thai capital on trucks laden with hundreds of balloons, were eventually blocked by riot policemen.
Mr. Annan said trade barriers put in place by industrialized countries were helping to exclude developing nations from the benefits of global trade. He called for a "Global New Deal," to spread the advantages of the freer flow of goods, jobs and capital among all countries that were open to investment.
"Can we not attempt on a global level what any successful industrialized country does to help its most disadvantaged or underdeveloped regions catch up?" he asked.
The head of the World Trade Organization, Michael Moore, said today that he was working on a plan to offer poorer countries better access to lucrative markets.
"We have agreed to try and negotiate free market access for least developed countries," he said, adding that envoys to the trade group have said they would discuss how to enact such changes. "I think confidence is back," he said.
That did not stop one of the biggest critics of Western-style globalization, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia, from issuing another stinging critique of the global system when he addressed the conference today.
Branding himself a "heretic," Mr. Mahathir renewed his attacks on financial speculators and questioned whether the current wave of world economic expansion would ever benefit developing nations.
He confessed, too, that he was "frightened" at the growing power of global corporations, some of which he said "are more powerful than mid-sized countries."
On the sidelines of today's conference, Mr. Annan also worked to settle another issue that has trouble the United Nations: a proper trial for the leaders of the former Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, who are blamed for the deaths of more than a million people from 1975 to 1979.
He met today with the Cambodian prime minister, Hun Sen, and said afterward that he was confident an agreement could be reached to allow the United Nations to endorse a trial of Khmer Rouge leaders.
Negotiations over a trial have been deadlocked for months over who should control the courtroom, Cambodia or the United Nations.
Mr. Annan said he would send a team of legal experts to Phnom Penh soon to iron out differences with Cambodian officials.
"We both hope that at that meeting all the outstanding issues will be concluded and we can move on and establish a tribunal," Mr. Annan said.
His meeting with Mr. Hun Sen came one day after the prime minister accused the United Nations of treating Cambodia like a "dog" for insisting that his government's plan did not meet international standards.
Today, Mr. Hun Sen was visibly more upbeat after his meeting with Mr. Annan and said, "We are working to have a credible trial of the Khmer Rouge leaders, so I think it was a good meeting."

HEADLINE: Executives Make Trade With China a Moral Issue

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE, Fla.

 BODY:
When a group of Florida businessmen paid a visit one recent afternoon to Corrine Brown, their Congresswoman, they put her on notice that they consider trading with China a moral crusade.
"The only way we're going to undermine that regime is to infiltrate it," Frank Pearce, a business consultant and local Chamber of Commerce leader, told Ms. Brown in a meeting. "You can't moralize across the ocean."
Wayne Nash, who runs his own import-export company, said missionaries and businessmen will work together to change China, unless Congress interferes. "The missionaries are over there doing the dangerous stuff," he told Ms. Brown, "but trade is what opens the doors." 
 The Clinton administration and corporate America have a great deal riding on whether such pitches persuade Ms. Brown, a four-term Democrat who calls herself a leader in human rights causes, to vote in favor of extending new, permanent trading rights to China. She is among 70-odd wavering lawmakers whose votes are seen as crucial.
Congress must decide, as early as spring, whether to give up its annual review of China's trading rights. In a landmark agreement last year paving the way for China to join the World Trade Organization, the Clinton administration promised that China would be guaranteed the same low-tariff access to the United States market that most countries have. But Congress has the final say.
President Clinton argues that the choice is clear. The often tense relationship with China and America's global leadership in trade would get a significant boost with a yes vote. Rejecting the agreement would deal a serious blow on both fronts.
Yet the decision is being hotly contested, and the outcome is uncertain. Trade, in the final year of the Clinton presidency, has become a tough sell. The failure of global trade talks in Seattle late last year emboldened a coalition of labor, environmental and consumer groups that now want to derail or at least delay trade liberalization with China.
"This is going to be the toughest fight we face this year on Capitol Hill," White House chief of staff John Podesta told a friendly group of farm lobbyists this week. "There are people who have strong views who don't agree with us."
Congressional leaders say they will not schedule a vote until Europe closes its own deal with China, and the timing of that remains uncertain. Yet nearly everyone agrees that the vote must take place by June, before the election year pressures become any more intense.
Congress has not rallied to the cause. Republican leaders back China trade. But, facing some ideological opposition in their party, they say that they will not push the measure through unless they get support from 90 or so Democrats, roughly half that party's number in the House.
Already, 53 members of the Democrats' left-leaning Congressional Progressive Caucus have announced that they will vote no. Pro-trade Democrats worry that the United Auto Workers and the Teamsters, two unions determined to defeat the China accord, could make this an excruciating choice for liberals facing re-election.
To turn the tide, the administration and big business, which strongly supports a China trade deal, have begun what they are billing as the largest lobbying effort on a foreign-policy vote since the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993.
America Online leads a coalition of computer and Internet companies trying to give the China vote a high-tech spin, arguing that free trade opens China's promising telecommunications and Internet industries. Michael Eisner of the Walt Disney Company, Sumner Redstone of Viacom and Rupert Murdoch of the News Corporation are pushing the accord because it would increase how many films they can market in China.
The two biggest business lobbying groups, the United States Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, have vowed to try to whip up support for the China trade agreement in several dozen swing Congressional districts with a $12 million campaign.
Jacksonville, the northern Florida port city, is viewed as a test of whether business can stoke pro-trade enthusiasm at the local level. Spurred by the national Chamber of Commerce, local business leaders hold regular meetings with Jacksonville's port authorities and the city's economic development board to plot ways of persuading the city's representatives in the House, Ms. Brown and Tillie K. Fowler, a Republican, to vote for China trade. Both have opposed extending normal trade privileges to China in the past.
The pro-trade forces are emphasizing the city's vested interest in expanding economic ties. Its port employs 35,000. With sparkling Toyotas and Hyundais parked bumper to bumper on acres of asphalt, the port is also thriving on Asian cargo. It recently struck an alliance with Hong Kong-based Hutchinson-Whampoa, a cargo handler that specializes in China trade, to serve as a way station for goods that pass through Hutchinson's new deep-water container port in the Bahamas.
"I wish the downtown were just a bit further upriver so people could see all the traffic going through here," said Kenneth R. Krauter, president of the port, which is about 15 miles from the city center.
Ms. Brown said she was ready to listen. She joined 800 local executives for a Chamber of Commerce lunch late last month. After the Pledge of Allegiance, a video tribute to Jacksonville's N.F.L. Jaguars and a pro-trade speech by a prominent local leader, businessmen tried to pin Ms. Brown down on her views on China.
They mixed testimonials about how important trade had been to their own businesses with appeals to her human rights concerns. They spoke of their passion for spreading democracy and Christianity.
"How do you change a totalitarian system?" Mr. Pearce asked her, stressing each syllable in a slow Southern rhythm. He answered his own question. "You get it exposed."
Ms. Brown gave them scant comfort. "China has always been a struggle for me," she said, describing how she had changed her mind about whether expanding trade with China was a good thing.
"We have tried to have discussions with those people for seven or eight years," she said. "What have they tangibly done in terms of human rights?"
Some local business executives said they thought they had more success converting Ms. Fowler. Over lunch, six executives of Jacksonville companies described how their own business depended on imports and exports. Hy W. Kliman, president of Global Sourcing & Trading, described how he built a thriving multinational business on the strength of a single bowling shoe contract he reached with a Chinese company in 1973, five years before the two countries had formal diplomatic relations.
Several of the business executives said that Ms. Fowler called the session an "education" and told them after the lunch that she would support the China accord. But her chief of staff said Ms. Fowler had yet to decide how to vote.
Leslie Schweitzer, an official of the national Chamber of Commerce who led the Jacksonville organization drive, said there is clearly a deep reservoir of pro-trade sentiment to be tapped. But she acknowledged that the process demands patience.
"This has to be sustained long-term every place we try it to be effective," Ms. Schweitzer said. "The problem is that the most important policy issue we face -- China -- is here right now."

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL: NOTEBOOK;
N.F.L.'s Newest Line Is the Unemployment Line

BYLINE: By MIKE FREEMAN 

 BODY:
It was late in the regular season, and the Buffalo Bills wide receiver Andre Reed, in one of many frustrating outbursts, said something prophetic to a small group of reporters. His words may be remembered for decades.
"You will never see players like Bruce, Thurman and me again," Reed said. "Never." 
 Reed was referring to the great trio, who along with the quarterback Jim Kelly transformed the Bills into one of the top franchises in football. Bruce Smith is going into the Hall of Fame as one of the best defensive linemen of all time. Thurman Thomas was one of the greatest offensive weapons ever, and some would argue that Reed was the most crucial piece of the franchise.
Last week, on what can only be called traumatic Thursday, the Bills, because of salary-cap reasons, in one swift, brutal move, cut Reed, Smith and Thomas, ending one of the most productive, and sometimes emotional, player-team relationships in sports. The three men were key reasons that the Bills made four Super Bowl appearances.
In fact, all across the league, teams were making hard decisions to get under the $62.172 million salary cap. Such stresses produced the single most stunning day of player cuts ever. Pro Bowlers and future Hall of Famers found themselves in the unemployment line. The Vikings released the 11-time Pro Bowl guard Randall McDaniel. The Giants released center Brian Williams, who is irritated that the team said he planned to retire. Williams plans on playing for another team next season. Offensive tackle Bruce Armstrong was let go by the New England Patriots.
In Miami, quarterback Dan Marino voided the last two years of his contract, and the Dolphins made perhaps the saddest cut of all. Marino was miffed that when he recently talked to team officials, few expressed interest in keeping him. Marino told friends that when he met with the new coach, Dave Wannstedt, Wannstedt rarely looked him in the eye. So Marino figured it was time to go.
Marino is strongly considering retiring, but wants to explore his options, and will meet with Tampa Bay, Seattle and Oakland. If Marino hears the right thing from any of those teams, such as he can have a chance to earn his way into the starting lineup, he will probably play again. If not, he will retire.
The Buccaneers denied any interest in Marino, but they have to play coy, at least for now, because they do not want to get into a bidding war for Marino's services. Marino's agent, Marvin Demoff, met with at least one Tampa Bay official at the Pro Bowl, where the team's coaching staff was leading the National Football Conference squad, and the Bucs expressed slight interest.
Buffalo had its own emotional mess to deal with. What happened to Smith, Reed and Thomas proves that an accomplished veteran N.F.L. player, because of a hardened salary cap, can no longer retire gracefully.
Smith is second on the career sack list to Reggie White. Reed and Jerry Rice entered this season tied for first with 12 seasons of 50 or more pass receptions. Thomas is seventh in combined yards from scrimmage. Only Smith has one or two seasons left, mainly because Smith takes good care of himself. Yesterday, Smith signed a five-year, $23 million contract with the Washington Redskins.
The three men have had a love-hate affair with the city of Buffalo, the Bills and the news media there. In some ways, Reed and Thomas became bitter in the end. Especially Reed. In his last few years, he often complained about his role in the offense, and this season he lashed out at quarterback Doug Flutie, saying the success Flutie was having swelled his ego. And he never forgave some teammates who questioned his physical courage at the end of the 1995 season.
Thomas scowled a lot and sometimes cursed at reporters, and Smith was always thought of as selfish by the Buffalo beat writers, though with the national media, Smith was always pleasant and gracious.
But nothing should take away from the accomplishments of Reed, Smith and Thomas. Reed is right: the Bills may never see a group of special players like them again.
 
Franchise Tag Saves Money
If you want to understand why players hate the franchise tag, and teams love it, look no further than the Detroit Lions and the sticky situation involving their star defensive lineman, Robert Porcher.
Porcher is considered one of the top three defensive linemen in the game. He is blessed with great speed, power and a tremendous work ethic. In the locker room, he is respected and a team leader.
Shortly before the 4 p.m. Thursday deadline teams had to meet to declare their franchise players, the Lions offered Porcher a contract worth $35 million over five years, which included a $13 million signing bonus. Sounds like too much money for a lineman, and the offer could indeed fuel the economy of a small country. But consider that Porcher's 49 sacks in the past four years are the most among defensive linemen. Because teams rarely get a player of his caliber, they will do whatever it takes to keep someone like Porcher, even if it means offering him the largest deal in Lions history.
"Largest contract. Largest average per year and largest signing bonus," the team's general manager, Chuck Schmidt, said. "Largest period."
Porcher countered with a $41.5 million, five-year proposal that included a $15 million signing bonus. Detroit respectfully declined.
The Lions, fearing an agreement might never be reached, tagged him as their franchise player, meaning he would receive the average of the top five highest salaries at his position, which is $4.235 million. So Porcher will make his millions next season, and no one should cry for him. But on the free-agent market, Porcher would have made $7 million to $8 million a year.
So the franchise tag may, in the end, cost Porcher up to $4 million. That is something to cry about. And no team is likely to trade for Porcher because of the tag, since to trade for the player, a team would have to give the Lions two first-round picks.
Nine players were tagged with the franchise label by their individual teams, and few players were happy about it. Among them are the Miami offensive tackle Richmond Webb ($4.081 million franchise number), Kansas City guard Will Shields ($4.081 million), Jacksonville defensive end Tony Brackens ($4.253 million), San Diego defensive tackle Norman Hand ($4.727 million), Washington running back Stephen Davis ($3.532 million), and the Jets' Mo Lewis ($4.187 million). Lewis is believed to be extremely irritated by the designation, since he may have been able to earn $7 million a season as an unrestricted free agent.
Several general managers said that they expected this to be the thinnest free-agent field in years, mainly because so many top potential free agents have been franchised.
But at least one of the franchise players may find his off-season to be interesting. Rumors persist that the Redskins are considering trading Davis to Detroit for the rights to Barry Sanders, who various team officials believe may soon announce his return to football. The Redskins have denied any interest in Sanders.
 
Galloway to Cowboys
Another franchise player, the Seahawks' Joey Galloway, found a new home yesterday in a trade with the Cowboys. Seattle received Dallas's first-round draft picks this year and next.
Galloway, who missed all of the preseason and the first eight games last year because of a contract dispute, set up the trade by signing a contract with the Seahawks yesterday. Minutes later, Seattle traded him to the Cowboys, who had already come to terms with him on a seven-year, $42 million deal that included a $12.5 million signing bonus.
The Seahawks named Galloway their exclusive franchise player last Thursday after an arbitrator ruled him an unrestricted free agent.

HEADLINE: Los Angeles Tests Its Limits in Quest to Grow

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: SANTA CLARITA, Calif.

 BODY:
This is the last frontier, the place where the suburban sprawl of Los Angeles meets a peaceful patch of live oaks, rolling hills and quiet back roads along the Santa Clara River, one of a tiny handful of wild waterways left in Southern California. It is also a battle zone, the future home of Newhall Ranch, the largest housing development ever approved by Los Angeles County, with 21,600 units for 70,000 people to be built over the next 20 years.
To its critics, including neighboring Ventura County, which has filed a lawsuit seeking to block it, Newhall Ranch is a symbol of all that is wrong with California's decades of catch-as-catch-can development, in which suburbs sprang up in ever-widening, ill-considered rings. 
 To its backers, Newhall Ranch is a sensitively planned community, the vision of a responsible developer with a long track record of building affordable slices of the American dream.
But big and controversial as it may be, Newhall Ranch is nothing compared with the projected need for new housing in Los Angeles County: about 25,000 units a year, according to the Southern California Association of Governments.
By 2025, the state's population of 34 million is projected to grow by 18 million more (a New York State) and that of the Los Angeles region by 6 million (or two Chicagos).
That pace would exceed the boom years of the 1950's, 60's and 70's combined in absolute numbers, though not in percentage. New Californians are being born or moving into the state at the rate of 1,700 a day, or roughly 1 every 50 seconds.
"L.A.'s so big that you can take the biggest project anybody's ever conceived of and it is, in regional terms, only a drop in the bucket," said William Fulton, an urban planner, "which shows you how hard it is to meet the need with traditional suburban development.
"What are you going to do?" asked Mr. Fulton, the author of "The Reluctant Metropolis: The Politics of Urban Growth in Los Angeles." "Build 200 Newhall Ranches? The truth is, with six million people, growth has got to be both up and out."
That is easier said than done in a place where even residents of modest means have long viewed a patch of yard and sky, a lemon tree and maybe even a swimming pool as all but a birthright, and the fight over Newhall Ranch is proof positive of how hard it will be to change the paradigm. Planners and politicians may talk of "urban infill" and "downtown redevelopment," but Los Angeles has been steadily sprawling for more than 80 years.
Since at least the mid-70's, residents of established neighborhoods have consistently opposed construction of apartment complexes, leaving developers little choice but to build in fringe areas like those near Santa Clarita, a collection of old farming towns northwest of Los Angeles that have been consolidated into the fourth largest city in the county, with nearly 150,000 people.
"In Los Angeles, it's part of our culture to aspire to live in open spaces in single-family homes," said Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky of Los Angeles County, a Democrat who acknowledged that it pained him to vote for a project as big as Newhall last year but who felt he had little choice, given his own constituents' opposition to living any closer together.
"People don't want to live in skyscrapers like New York," Mr. Yaroslavsky said. "People fled New York to come here, and once you've lived in a single-family house with your own backyard, you're basically not interested in moving back to what amounts to a Holiday Inn-like existence."
The population of Riverside and San Bernardino Counties, which make up the "Inland Empire" east of Los Angeles, has roughly doubled since 1980, making the area the fastest growing part of the region, and the population there is expect to double again in the next 20 years.
Such explosive growth has ignited widespread anxiety, and a recent statewide survey by the Public Policy Institute of California found that 4 in 10 residents said they believed the state will be a worse place to live in 20 years.
The fight over Newhall Ranch, to be built in an unincorporated area of Los Angeles County, has put the debate over urban sprawl into particularly sharp relief because the project abuts the border of Ventura County, an agricultural enclave that is Southern California's least populated.
For years, Ventura has looked askance at growth and recently adopted some of the most stringent antigrowth measures in the nation, which generally require voter approval to rezone farmland or open space for development, or to expand cities beyond their existing boundaries. Mr. Fulton, the planner, calls this conflict the region's Kosovo.
The Newhall Land & Farming Company, the 117-year-old real estate and ranching concern that is developing the project, says it is merely keeping pace with realities and demand by building Newhall Ranch, to be roughly divided between single-family houses with prices up to $1 million and town houses and rental apartments. New hall began developing some of the 36,000 acres it owns in the area more than 30 years ago after county tax assessors, watching the northward growth from the San Fernando Valley, raised assessments on what had long been agricultural land.
The result was the planned town of Valencia, a still-growing leafy haven that boasts two office parks, two industrial parks and a pedestrian-friendly Town Center mall that is the shopping and entertainment hub for the Santa Clarita Valley.
This suburb, first settled by workers in the aerospace industry who were attracted by the short commute to places like the Lockheed plant in Burbank, is now home to many support workers and technicians in the entertainment industry, and to high-tech types who work in the office parks of the San Fernando and Santa Clarita Valleys.
"Despite all that you would hear, and the outcries about development," a house "is still the American dream," said Thomas L. Lee, chairman and chief executive of Newhall, which expects that about half the buyers for new Newhall Ranch houses will come from the Santa Clarita Valley itself.
"We're providing homes to people who just want a piece of the American dream like everybody else," Mr. Lee said. "The large majority of people want to live that way."
Mr. Lee added: "The people are going to be here, whether the housing is here or not. They already have a serious problem in Los Angeles."
But critics of Newhall's plans point out that much of the demand for housing in the region is actually among the growing Hispanic and immigrant populations of urban Los Angeles, where families are doubled up in apartments and can not yet afford suburban houses. (Hispanic residents were the only group in the recent Public Policy Institute survey that said the state would be a better place to live in 20 years).
At the same time, Newhall's opponents note that some 40,000 additional housing units have already been approved but not built in Santa Clarita, and they would like to see these developed before builders encroach on pristine land.
"You're just vaporizing your open space and watershed and indiscriminately paving it over for something that I can't see as a genuine need," said Lynne Plambeck, first vice president of the Santa Clarita Organization for Planning and Environment, part of a coalition of several environmental groups and Ventura County and the State Attorney General's office, which challenged New hall's environmental review as inadequate, especially in its analysis of water supplies for the new development. A trial in the case is set for next month in a state court.
In the face of opposition, Newhall scaled back the project from the originally planned 25,000 units, and it has set aside about 10 percent of the units as lower-income housing and promised to preserve about 9 square miles of the 19-square-mile project as open space.
But the critics have dismissed the concessions and contend that New hall Ranch would damage the delicate ecosystem of the Santa Clara River and threaten birds and other wildlife, as well as the flood plain.
"I sort of feel like sometimes it's a situation where if you don't build it, they won't come," Ms. Plambeck said, reversing the "Field of Dreams" formulation.
The reality is not quite so simple, of course, and whatever the fate of Newhall, the growing population's demands on state roads, schools, bridges and public transportation are already a huge concern. Newhall itself expects to pay tens of millions of dollars in the coming years for highway improvements. But statewide investment in public facilities has lagged since the 70's, which was itself fostered in part by local opposition to apartment construction.
That caused housing shortages that led real estate prices -- and, eventually, property tax assessments -- to rise.
"If you build fences around communities in areas that are adjacent to the high job growth areas of the state, you're not going to meet your housing needs, period," said Tim Coyle, the California Building Industry Association's chief lobbyist. "The politics of antigrowth initiatives not only limit housing, but ultimately they're hostile to the economic and social interests of the citizenry."
Some politicians, like Philip Angelides, the state treasurer, have proposed investments aimed at rebuilding neighborhoods.
As a member of state public employee pension boards, for example, Mr. Angelides has voted to invest $1 billion in pension funds in urban real estate development, and he has restructured tax credits to make $450 million a year available for construction and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing.
"I don't take the view that even the most robust of public policies is really powerful enough to shape growth patterns," Mr. Angelides said.
"But clearly, their absence will result in a situation in which we're the victims of unplanned growth. As long as we remain productive and attractive, we will have that growth demographic," he said. "Our challenge is how do we maintain the livability and quality of life that brought residents and economic vitality in the first place. Because if California becomes unlivable then we won't really be economically viable either."

1990's Productivity Makes It Best Decade Since 1960's

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The 1990's economic expansion, now the longest expansion in the nation's history, draws its staying power from various wells -- the two most important being the booming stock market and labor's rising efficiency.
The stock market makes people feel wealthy, encouraging them to spend. To help satisfy this rising demand, America's workers are managing to produce more goods and services in each hour of work. Their rising output keeps the economy growing and plays a big role in extending the expansion. 
 No one really knows just why workers have become more productive in recent years, or for how long they will continue to grow more efficient, as they did in the last six months of 1999. The Labor Department announced last week that productivity, or output per hour, had risen at an annual rate of 5 percent from June through December, the best performance in seven years. And the expansion marches on. LOUIS UCHITELLE

HEADLINE: What's a Nice Liberal Multimillionaire Doing In a Race Like This?

BYLINE: By James Traub; James Traub is a contributing writer for the magazine. He last wrote about schools and poverty.

 BODY:
Jon S. Corzine has spent the last several months learning the difference between office politics and politics. In his previous line of work, at the investment firm of Goldman, Sachs, where he served as chairman and C.E.O. until early last year, Corzine was counted a master politician -- the kind of executive who understood the secret ambitions and fears of everyone around him. On Wall Street, being a good politician had a lot to do with being likable. Now, however, Corzine is running for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate in New Jersey, a state whose politics do not typically reward amiability. Corzine's opponent is Jim Florio, the former governor of the state and a man who is, for good reason, invariably referred to as "an ex-boxer." Last month, according to a news account, Florio fired his media adviser when the adviser refused to follow Florio's "scorched-earth policy."
One day last month, I sat with Corzine through an interminable ceremony marking the opening of the 209th session of the New Jersey Legislature. During a lull between the skirling of the bagpipes and the nomination of the clerk of the Assembly, Corzine handed me a copy of a Florio news release. Like a number of leading Democrats, Corzine advocates investing up to 15 percent of the Social Security Trust Fund in the stock market. In the release, Florio not only claimed that Corzine was threatening the stability of Social Security -- arguable, though fair game -- but also went on to declare that the proposal was "clearly in Jon Corzine's self-interest" since Goldman and other Wall Street firms would benefit from the trading activity. That was a low blow. Corzine whispered: "He's saying that I'm going to benefit from this personally. That just makes no sense." Corzine was plainly scandalized, though a less self-contained person might have found a more vehement way of expressing it. 
 There is a good reason why members of the upper managerial elite, which is to say bankers, corporate lawyers, C.E.O.'s, foundation heads and the like, don't usually run for office. These people live in a chaste and polished world limited to themselves and a large class of servitors and facilitators. Why lower yourself to the tacky level of Elks Clubs and church suppers? Why make a public dartboard of yourself? If you have a yen for "public service," as it is invariably known in this stratum, you can satisfy it by accepting an appointment in the relevant federal body. For the perfect model, you need look no further than Robert Rubin, Corzine's predecessor's predecessor at Goldman, who reached the zenith of bankerly glory as secretary of the Treasury.
Well, nobody asked Jon Corzine (pronounced with a long "i") to be secretary of the Treasury. Still, Corzine believes that he can conduct the campaign with the same fine moral tone he and his colleagues maintained at Goldman. "As standards get lowered," he says of Florio, "I think it will rub to his detriment." That may be so, though other candidates have lived to rue that calculation. Indeed, with the primary looming June 6, the central battle of the campaign just now is not between Corzine and Florio but between Corzine and his own aides and advisers, who are urging him to behave in a way that runs against the grain of his nature and his experience.
Jon Corzine, who is 53, has the balding pate, rimless spectacles, mild gaze and fuzzy beard of an English professor in a small private college. He is a good listener, a slow ruminator, a modest man who takes up less space than any zillionaire you've ever met. (He insists on anonymity for his very sizable charitable gifts.) Corzine's personality comes into clearer focus if you think of him not as Wall Street Man but as Midwestern Man. Corzine grew up on a farm in Willey's Station, a tiny town in southern Illinois; his mother was a schoolteacher and his father, besides farming, sold insurance. Corzine met his wife, Joanne, when they were both in kindergarten, married her as soon as he graduated from college and stayed married to her thereafter. (They have three children.) He was a plugger rather than a star. He made the University of Illinois basketball team as a walk-on. He hoped to get a Ph.D. in urban planning, but when his draft number came up, he joined the Marine Reserve. Ultimately, he enrolled at the University of Chicago Business School.
In 1975, Corzine joined Goldman, Sachs as a bond trader and in very short order was made a partner and then a member of the executive committee. Certain themes recur when people talk about Corzine's career at Goldman: he was a very good trader, which is to say that he has more of an appetite for risk, and more self-confidence, than his tamped-down surface discloses; absolutely everybody liked him; and he was very driven, even by Goldman standards. his gifts were political ones, at least as the business world understands them. "He never stood out here in terms of being brilliant," says one Goldman partner. "But he's off the charts in terms of getting people to trust him or putting people at ease." Goldman appears to represent the kind of Darwinian environment that offers the perfect training school for political combat. But it is not; Goldman was, until recently, a partnership in which earnings depended on group success and the ethos of the team was paramount. And Corzine believed devoutly in the team. "There is, and has been in most of my life," he says, "a desire for people, where things are competitive, to try to keep them civil and to try to define things in the interest of the greater good or the widest community."
Corzine became senior partner of Goldman in 1994. He got the job because he was widely liked and respected, because he wanted it more than others did and because a breach had to be quickly filled when the previous senior partner abruptly quit. There are various accounts of what happened over the next few years, but it is clear both that the firm flourished during Corzine's tenure and that the executive committee became increasingly disenchanted with his leadership. Among other things, Corzine wanted to take Goldman, Sachs public; many of the bankers at first did not. Corzine won that battle, but lost the war: the firm agreed to issue shares to the public, but without Corzine at the helm. On Jan. 11 last year, in an act virtually unprecedented in the history of the firm, Corzine was forced out. Some of his closest colleagues voted against him; it must have been just about the worst day in his life, but a close friend says that he could "only guess" at Corzine's feelings of humiliation. When I asked, I got name, rank and serial number. "I think in a public company you need fairly tight coherence at the top of the house," he said, a sign of company loyalty as much as stoicism.
Corzine cashed out when the firm went public, and just like that, he was worth $300 million to $400 million. His plans for life after Goldman all involved making yet more money. And then sheer accident intruded into what had been a very orderly life. In mid-February of last year, Senator Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat, announced that he would not run for re-election. Jim Florio immediately declared his own candidacy. This, in turn, triggered an "anyone but Florio" movement among the county leaders who effectively control the party. Florio is a talented politician and a serious student of policy who nevertheless has a gift for making himself disliked. Both his temperament and a decision he made in 1990 to raise taxes in order to pay for a court-ordered increase in the state's education budget contributed to making him a highly unpopular governor. And Florio brought the whole party down with him. By 1993, when Christine Whitman defeated him to become the new governor, the Democrats had lost 600 seats at the state and local level -- a rout that party leaders have neither forgotten nor forgiven.
The party leaders outside of Florio's stronghold in South Jersey decided that they must act together and began auditioning potential nominees. When none of the available candidates gained a consensus, a party activist and friend of Corzine's called up to ask if he would like to run. Corzine had long lived in New Jersey, was a major donor to the national Democratic Party and had always expressed a powerful if vague yearning for political office. Like many ex-partners at investment banks, he wanted to use his fantastic wealth to do something interesting and worthwhile. So he agreed.
The party bosses were beguiled by this plutocrat with the antiplutocratic personality. Robert Janiszewski, the executive of Hudson County as well as the head of the county party, says that he was expecting Gordon Gekko and was startled to meet "the professor from 'Gilligan's Island."' But Janiszewski also says that he wouldn't have been talking to Corzine at all if it weren't for Corzine's money. New Jersey is an incredibly expensive state in which to run for office -- you have to buy television time in New York City and Philadelphia. In order to raise his own profile and to counteract Florio's popularity among core Democrats, Corzine would have to spend a minimum of $5 million, and possibly quite a bit more, on media alone. And Corzine was willing to spend whatever was necessary.
Corzine never, ever, talks about his money, an act of reticence that one pundit has likened to Cyrano's imagining that he can make his nose disappear by refusing to call attention to it. Yet Corzine's deep pockets have already scattered the opposition. With the exception of Florio, the other Democratic candidates withdrew soon after Corzine entered the race. Governor Whitman chose not to run, a decision widely attributed to a fear of Corzine's money. The remaining Republicans, principal among them Representative Bob Franks and State Senator William L. Gormley, are not considered particularly formidable.
A recent filing shows that Corzine has already spent $3.6 million, a staggering sum this early in the campaign. Florio, whose own fund-raising has been anemic, will do his best to turn Corzine's wealth against him. "Should Steve Forbes be our role model for public office in the future?" Florio asks. "There's clearly nothing illegal in spending untold millions of your own money to purchase office. But the people of this state and the people of this country should think through whether it's good for democracy or not." Of course, the popularity of Frank Lautenberg, Christie Whitman and others implies that New Jersey voters may actually like their candidates rich.
Corzine is hoping that voters will pay attention to his views rather than to his money. And Corzine's position papers make amazing reading. He is almost certainly to the left of the entire United States Senate, including Ted Kennedy and Paul Wellstone, and he doesn't have many competitors even in the House. He opposes welfare reform and mandatory sentencing and strongly favors affirmative action, for women as well as minorities. Indeed, you would have a hard time finding any room between Corzine and either the N.A.A.C.P. or the National Organization for Women.
Corzine favors "universal quality preschool," which is to say something better and more expensive than Head Start, and "universal after-school programs" and free college tuition for all high-school students with a B average. He argues that we need to substitute a "living wage" of $8 an hour for the current minimum wage of $5.15. He advocates "universal gun registration" and "universal health care coverage," to be provided through employer mandates and tax credits. He opposes the death penalty. He believes in a stronger voice for organized labor, and he uses a phrase you don't hear often from Democratic officeholders, much less Wall Street executives: "Economic power is out of whack in America."
One of the people who helped Corzine with his platform is Susan Estrich, the former Dukakis campaign manager. Estrich was startled to discover that this living symbol of Wall Street was both more liberal and less "political" than she was. "I went round and round with him on affirmative action," she says. "I told him that if I'm skeptical, you're never going to find 51 percent of voters to my left." But Corzine wouldn't budge. Estrich says that she finds his contempt for focus-group politics highly refreshing; he has even refused to shave his beard. Corzine believes that voters will reward him for his ideological purity and political nonconformity. This may be a sign of navete rather than courage.
I spent a day hopscotching across New Jersey with Corzine early last month. The high point of the day was a restaurant meeting at the Jersey Shore in which Corzine accepted the endorsement of the Ocean County Democratic Organization. After spreading his money all over the state, Corzine has now been endorsed by most of the county leaders in Central and North Jersey -- which makes him, oddly enough, the machine candidate. Al Santoro, the Ocean County chairman, introduced Corzine as "a person who has no baggage," which is shorthand for, "He isn't Jim Florio."
Corzine's speech was not very edifying. He seems to think that the way to elevate the discourse is to increase its level of abstraction, and so he talked about "community" and "excellence" and "high standards" as if he were delivering a commencement address. There were no applause lines, and very little applause. At the same time, Corzine has precisely the gift you wouldn't expect from a Wall Street baron, which is the common touch. After the speech, he squeezed biceps and draped an arm over shoulders; he grinned and guffawed and gave every impression of having a swell time. Voters who expect to encounter J.P. Morgan or Gordon Gekko are pleasantly surprised to meet Mr. Ordinary. Marena Agnoli, the municipal chairman of the Democratic Party of Dover Township, told me: "He's just so rich that when you hear about him, all you can think is, Rich, rich, rich. But you meet him, and he could be the guy who cuts your lawn or something."
Corzine believes that voters are yearning for decency, but decency alone won't get him elected (though decency and money might). In recent polling data, Florio is leading Corzine 51 to 18 among voters in North Jersey's Hudson County -- which is probably a reflection of Corzine's low name recognition. Corzine had his first direct encounter with Florio several weeks after I met him when both men addressed the Princeton County Democratic Organization. Corzine, slow and earnest and soft-spoken, made his usual fine remarks about raising the standards of debate and then ran down his list of issues at his usual lofty level of generality. Florio advanced to the lectern and said curtly, "You have to go beyond the general principle of things." Florio then delivered an extremely polished and hard-edged recitation of his achievements and his views.
The first questioner asked how the two men expected to appeal to moderate Republicans. This is the perfect Jon Corzine question. Corzine could have said that Robert Rubin would vouch for him, that he knew more about the economy than the Republicans did and that Jim Florio had, well, some baggage. But what he said was: "I go back to the concept that people want the same thing. They want quality education. . . . Moderates are very concerned that we protect social liberties in this country. . . ."
It was a painful moment. Corzine apparently thought that his audience wanted another uplifting sermon, not political calculation. Florio took over and said in his machine-gun style, "Republicans have always tagged Democrats as believing in comprehensive, universal everything." He talked about the death penalty, which he supports, and the need to be tough on crime. And he ended by observing, with barely masked condescension, "We've got to be aware that not everybody thinks the same as everyone in this room."
Florio has accused Corzine of dodging debates, and he is right -- Corzine is simply not yet ready to go head to head with him. Some of the people around Corzine were appalled by the Princeton event. And when I asked one of New Jersey's leading political analysts how he thought Corzine was faring as a campaigner, he said: "He's absolutely awful. It's not that he's not ready for prime time; he's not ready for daytime."
The Princeton debate may in fact have been a necessary low point in the Corzine campaign. Corzine finally surrendered to his staff's entreaties, permitting them to launch a counterattack, including the revelation that Florio himself had proposed investing a portion of the Social Security Trust Fund. A new, peppery John Corzine was being born, or so said his backers. In a subsequent speech to another county group that had endorsed him, he stabbed the air with his index finger, talked about winning and said, "If I might be so bold, I think you made the right decision." That was his applause line. And he still didn't criticize Florio.
Corzine has imbibed the high-minded scorn for hardscrabble politics that is widespread throughout the educated elite. He doesn't want to lower himself to the muck and mire of attack and counterattack, as Bill Clinton did with such shameless bravura in 1992 and as Al Gore began to do this winter. Corzine, who is a thoughtful and supremely decent man, might make an excellent senator; but he may not want the job enough to do what needs to be done to get it. Five hundred years ago, Machiavelli wrote that Italy needed a good man who is willing to act badly. He could have been talking about New Jersey.

The Internet relieson networks' passing data to one another. But what happens if one of them refuses?

BYLINE: By Denise Caruso 

 BODY:
LAST week's Web site attacks were a vivid reminder that technology's sword of individual empowerment has a wicked double edge. But the term for the attack technique -- denial of service -- has the potential to assume an equally ominous meaning as telecommunications giants continue to merge their large holdings.
As we know, the Internet is a network of networks. In the beginning of its commercial ascendancy in 1995, this meant that the largest of the Internet service companies -- known as backbone providers -- had to interconnect with their competitors. 
 Using the network access points, or NAP's, that were formerly financed by the federal government, they built businesses delivering data among networks. And in the early days, not much more than a handshake between backbone engineers was needed to ensure that these companies would pass along one another's data, all for the greater good (and growth) of the market.
This "you scratch mine, I'll scratch yours" arrangement is known as peering.
"The assumption in the old days was always, 'I'm going to send you as much data as you send me,' " says David Farber, one of the scientists who helped build the original Arpanet -- the Internet progenitor -- and who is now the chief technologist at the Federal Communications Commission.
And when the two main NAP's became impossibly clogged with traffic, the busiest Internet service providers, or I.S.P.'s, formed private peering arrangements to interconnect and exchange data directly with one another.
The global Internet is still defined by the exchange of data between networks. But today, in place of back-scratchy handshakes are book-size contracts drawn up by phalanxes of corporate lawyers.
The backbone provider with by far the largest number of physical connections is UUNET, now owned by MCI Worldcom, which is on its way to becoming Worldcom Sprint. In rough descending order, UUNET is followed by Sprint; Cable and Wireless USA, which acquired MCI Internet as a result of the 1998 MCI-Worldcom merger; GTE Internetworking (after its acquisition of BBN Planet in 1997) and, depending on whom you ask, either PSI Net or AT&T Network Services.
According to prevailing wisdom, a peer is a backbone service provider that agrees to exchange roughly equivalent amounts of data with another provider without requiring that money change hands.
But how exactly does one become a peer? Under what circumstances is a peer a paying customer, and vice versa? Who decides, and how?
"There are no rules for peering," says Fred Goldstein, a network and information technology consultant with Arthur D. Little in Cambridge, Mass. "No one knows what the currency is. It's more a matter of, 'I'll see who blinks first.' "
One might consider this to be an overly loose arrangement upon which to base the New Global Economy.
In the early days of the Internet, self-interest forced backbone providers into peering. Back then, as Mr. Farber says, "without the exchange points, nobody would have any traffic."
But that is scarcely true today. It may be even less true tomorrow: upon completion of the Worldcom-Sprint merger, a single company would control nearly half of the Internet's backbone -- making it, literally and figuratively, without peer.
Given the furious pace and high stakes of the telecommunications industry today, some fear that it is only a matter of time before one big backbone provider or another refuses to exchange data traffic with one of its peers.
What happens then?
"Well, they would have a legitimate excuse," says Hal Varian, dean of the school of information management at the University of California at Berkeley. "An I.S.P. could complain, and rightly so, that another I.S.P. was sending them huge amounts of traffic and putting a load on their system."
But then, Mr. Varian says, they could also decrease the capacity of "their side of the network so their own traffic is getting swamped." "That's an excuse to say, 'We can't handle this guy's packets; we aren't going to connect with him,' " he added.
The problem, says Mr. Varian, is that there is no way to prove who is zooming whom and no way to resolve such disputes outside the courtroom. And remarkably, there is no rule that requires peers to provide this most basic function of the Internet: what he calls "fair, open and nondiscriminatory" interconnection.
Indeed, says John Nakahata, a partner with the law firm Harris Wiltshire & Grannis in Washington, the kinds of tactics Mr. Varian describes are what led to requirements for interconnections and rate regulations in the telephone world of yore.
Mr. Nakahata is the former chief of staff for the F.C.C. chairman, William E. Kennard, and was the senior legal adviser to Mr. Kennard's predecessor, Reed E. Hundt. Mr. Nakahata now represents one of the smaller backbone providers living in the shadow of the proposed Worldcom-Sprint merger.
"The Internet is growing tremendously quickly, thus competition is very fragile," he says. "If a company can start diverting growth through these different tactics, then it becomes a self-perpetuating cycle."
It is easy to fear the worst, for example, when one sees from public filings that Sprint's original merger application to the F.C.C. did not include a mention of its Internet backbone business. Because the F.C.C. would not accept the application without that information, Sprint has since amended and resubmitted it.
"We had already stated to Justice we'd be willing to do a divestiture if necessary," says J. Richard Devlin, Sprint's general counsel, explaining the omission. The company is now in premerger discussions with the Justice Department about peering and other Internet-related issues, "helping them understand the market," Mr. Devlin said.
Despite the unsettled state of affairs, backbone regulation is not yet on the table for discussion.
"My general attitude toward regulation is that you let things go until they require adult supervision," says Mr. Farber of the F.C.C. "In Japanese, the idea translates to 'the sacred sword of last resort.' That's exactly it; that's its proper place."
In other words, Mr. Farber says, "If you can't get companies to behave in their own self-interest -- and it is good self-interest to have a vibrant, growing Internet; none of these companies would exist if there wasn't one -- then this sacred sword can be used if necessary."
Growth in the Internet economy depends on robust competition. That is a fact that many companies, particularly network companies, which live and die by scale, conveniently seem to forget after their urge to merge creates a behemoth or two.
"The natural structure in this industry is for there to be only a few backbone providers," Mr. Varian says. "The challenge is to see that there are more than one."

AT&T's Consumer Chief Is Expected to Resign
H. Eugene Lockhart, president of the core consumer unit at AT&T, intends to step down barely a year after joining the company, executives close to the company said.
Mr. Lockhart's future plans are unclear. His departure would probably not be seen as a significant operational blow to AT&T. But it could raise questions about the ability of C. Michael Armstrong, AT&T's chairman, to identify and retain key executive talent. Page C2. 

Beardstown Ladies Go to Court
Courts in New York and California have made diametrically opposing judgments in lawsuits that challenge dust-jacket claims on the "The Beardstown Ladies' Common-Sense Investment Guide." The guide claimed returns from the ladies' investment approach that were much higher than actual returns. The publisher now faces several legal challenges stemming from those claims. Those suits, and others like them, question whether some of the standard puffery on a book jacket amounts to free speech protected by the First Amendment. C15.
 
Zagat to Announce Investment
Zagat Survey, the restaurant guides published by Tim and Nina Zagat, in a bid to expand into cyberspace, intends to announce today that it has sold a $31 million equity stake to a group that includes some of the digital economy's most prominent individuals and institutional investors. C17.
 
World Bank to Form Internet Fund
The World Bank's International Finance Corporation unit will announce today that it has teamed up with Softbank of Japan to create a $200 million fund that will finance Internet start-ups in 100 developing countries. C6.
 
A New Season for Gift Certificates
Companies that sell gift certificates online report that weekly revenues, so far this year, are actually increasing, despite the fact that postholiday sales to consumers have leveled off. The companies are apparently benefiting from the nation's labor shortage: As companies struggle to attract and retain workers, many are turning to corporate gift programs -- and online gift certificates, they say, are a cheap and easy way to award perks. C12.
 
Teligent-Mannesmann Deal Seen
The American company Teligent, a leader in providing high-capacity communications links using wireless technology, intends to announce today that it has formed a partnership with a unit of Mannesmann of Germany, executives close to the deal said. C2.
 
Fewer Internet Backbone Providers
Last week's Web site attacks were a reminder that technology's sword of individual empowerment has a double edge. But the term for the attack technique -- denial of service -- has the potential to assume an equally ominous meaning as telecommunications giants continue to merge their holdings: for example, upon completion of the Worldcom-Sprint merger, a single company would control nearly half of the Internet's backbone. Denise Caruso: Digital Commerce. C4.
 
This Guinness Is for You
The Guinness Bass Import Company, the unit of Diageo that distributes and markets Guinness stout in the United States, is overhauling its sales pitch in substantive ways meant to make the brand seem less intimidating to those Americans, particularly in their mid-20's, who typically favor imported beers. That demographic group is often put off by the iconic, even imperial, image of Guinness. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. C18.

HEADLINE: World Bank Unit to Join In Internet Start-Up Finance

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
The Internet, with English as its dominant language and the United States its dominant backer and beneficiary, has created a digital divide, with some poor nations watching from afar as the World Wide Web transforms commerce and creates vast new sources of wealth in the developed countries.
One of the first major efforts to bridge the gap is to be announced today in Tokyo. The World Bank's International Finance Corporation unit has teamed up with Softbank of Japan to create a $200 million fund that will finance Internet start-ups in 100 developing countries. The International Finance Corporation will also join Softbank's existing plan to invest $300 million in Internet companies in China and Latin America, bringing the total amount they are devoting to third world Internet development to $500 million. 
 The new venture, named Softbank Emerging Markets, will provide seed capital to entrepreneurs building Internet businesses in poor countries. It will also seek to transfer successful e-commerce business models and train managers to apply them, World Bank officials said.
"The digital divide is one of the greatest impediments to development, and it is growing exponentially," the World Bank's president, James D. Wolfensohn, said in a statement. "We are taking a lead in the effort to close the gap. This investment will accelerate the inclusion of the developing countries in the information revolution."
Softbank is one of the most successful backers of Internet businesses in the United States. It has provided seed capital for Yahoo, E*Trade and Buy.com, among others. The International Finance Corporation is the for-profit investment banking arm of the World Bank, the Washington-based institution that aims to promote economic development in poor countries.
Softbank Emerging Markets, based in Silicon Valley, plans to make its first investments this spring. In addition to providing capital, the fund will become a joint venture partner with companies it finances. Some back-office and strategic planning services will be centralized in Silicon Valley, according to a description of the business plan provided by the World Bank and Softbank.

HEADLINE: Taking Virgin's Brand Into Internet Territory;
Richard Branson Says the Web Is Ready for His Style of Business

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Richard Branson was fiddling with one of his new Virgin-branded mobile telephones in the living room of his Notting Hill town house here last week.
"I'm trying to think how it works," he said, staring at a special button on the phone -- a red button, with the Virgin logo. The button connects customers by voice to operators who also handle distribution for the Virgin.com Web site. With such a call, customers can order plane tickets, CD's and an assortment of other products at a discount that Mr. Branson usually hawks by nondigital means. After trying fitfully to explain the red-button function, he finally conceded that he wasn't sure how it worked, and gave up. 
 "I was one of those anti-mobile phone guys before we did Virgin Mobile," he explained, referring to the cellular phone service that he started in November and that has already signed up 300,000 subscribers.
Hands-on technical savvy or not, Mr. Branson is diving head first into the digital economy. Call it the dot-comming of the Virgin Group P.L.C.
He is the brash, 48-year-old British billionaire, who founded Virgin Atlantic Airways 15 years ago with one jumbo jet plying the London-New York route and who now owns a hodgepodge of more than 200 Virgin-branded businesses. Now he intends to turn his tarmac-and-mortar world into something a bit more virtual.
Having slapped the Virgin logo on planes, trains, soda, vodka, clothing, movie theaters, music stores, a radio station, a financial services company and even a wedding coordinator, Mr. Branson means to expand his year-old Virgin.com Web site into a worldwide e-commerce portal that he hopes will take on some of the qualities of Amazon.com.
The skeptics say he is already too late to the Internet market and will surely stumble. "A lot of traditional businesses have made these kinds of plans and they've never worked out," said Noah Yasskin, an analyst at Jupiter Communications in London.
But Mr. Branson sees himself as specially suited for an entrepreneurial leap onto the Web.
For one thing, unlike Amazon.com -- which began as a book distributor and is now a diversified digital middleman -- the Virgin Group has many of its own products to sell. That doesn't mean, though, that Mr. Branson plans to hold his Web customers hostage to the Virgin brand.
"If British Airways is selling better products than Virgin Atlantic, we'll sell the British Airways product," he said. "If Fidelity is offering a better financial product than Virgin Direct, we'll recommend the Fidelity product."
Mr. Branson says he will not get snagged on the sticking point that has caused other brand-name companies to stumble on their way to cyberspace -- the fear of cannibalizing the established offline brands. "It's a fact of life," he said, "that the Internet will kill off some of our business and severely damage a lot of conventional industry."
And then there's the matter of management and money, which in the case of the privately held Virgin Group resides chiefly in one man: Richard Branson, boss and banker, rolled into one -- even if he does have big money men as personal investors.
Having sold 49 percent of his Virgin Atlantic unit to Singapore Airlines for $965 million right before Christmas, Mr. Branson has cash to burn. And unlike most dot-com's, he notes, his money is real -- not the paper wealth of newly minted Internet stock.
But whatever the advantages Mr. Branson describes, Virgin is entering the Internet arena too late to claim the "first mover" edge that Web executives like.
Mr. Yasskin, the Jupiter analyst, says that most of the major sectors of the World Wide Web are already carved up by companies like Yahoo and Amazon.com. "At least in the U.S. market, Virgin will have a very hard time competing," he said, adding that outside the United States "Virgin still has a little time to grab some market share."
For his part, Mr. Branson maintains that the Virgin brand is so strong internationally -- the company is already Britain's biggest advertiser -- that his relatively late Internet move will not hurt his chances. In fact, he said his timing might present an advantage.
"We have not lost hundreds of millions of pounds on the Net in the few years the Net was developing," he said, a not-so-veiled reference to companies like Amazon.com that have spent and lost large amounts of money building their clientele. "Our approach is to come on the Net when the amount of people who are logging on to the Net are considerable, and where we can actually see real profits reasonably quickly."
His remarks may be self-serving, but for Mr. Branson and his privately held company, it is crucial to quickly turn a profit. Otherwise, he may find it necessary to relinquish some control over the Virgin Group by raising money in the public stock market -- in order to compete for big-time capital with the likes of Amazon.
While he says that an initial public offering is on his mind, he has no immediate plans for one, predicting that he can break into the European Internet market without a major cash outlay for a brand-building campaign. But the United States market is another matter.
"In America we're well ahead in the major cities," he said of Virgin's brand recognition. "But out in the sticks, we've still got some way to go. America will be the toughest nut to crack. We will have to spend big bucks in America."
Unlike many of the Internet pioneers who have paid handsomely to simply get their name out, Virgin already has dozens of branded products to help keep its name in the public eye. Mr. Branson said, for example, that he intends to have "Virgin.com" painted onto the sides of his planes in place of the "No Way BA/AA" slogan that has adorned Virgin's fleet since his nemesis, British Airways, announced an abortive plan for a far-reaching alliance with American Airlines.
Without the dot-com money of a publicly traded company, Mr. Branson seeks attention for himself and his company in ways beyond paid advertising. Virgin generates press releases on an almost daily basis, and he is not above publicity stunts like the Virgin Mobile rollout in November. Creating a stir widely chronicled in the British tabloids, he held a parade of sorts in the West End of London, riding a float on which he surrounded himself with nude models talking on Virgin Mobile phones. The slogan for the new company: "What you see is what you get."
He also primes the publicity pump by making himself freely available for interviews. "It's cheaper than buying a full-page ad in The New York Times," he joked.
Still, wielding his brand identity against Internet upstarts is one thing. Taking on one of Europe's fasting-growing communications powers is another. And that is precisely the collision course he has set for himself with Virgin Mobile, a joint venture with the Deutsche Telekom unit One2One. Despite its 300,000 subscribers in Britain, Virgin Mobile will be up against a combined 42 million European subscribers of Vodafone AirTouch and Mannesmann, which announced plans for the biggest industrial merger ever the week before last.
Mr. Branson predicts that Virgin Mobile will be able to gain ground on Vodafone when the licensing begins this spring for Britain's next generation of wireless telephones -- digital devices that are to combine voice, Internet access and other digital features. Toward that end, he has put together a group of investors that include the Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and the venture capitalist George Soros.
But again, Mr. Branson may be a bit late, some contend. "It's going to take Virgin years to build a network," Mr. Yasskin said. "And by the time they do, they will have missed the huge growth period. Anyway, the incumbents always have an advantage."
Mr. Branson nonetheless says that he will be able to compete with established players like Vodafone. "There is no reason we can't offer anything that Vodafone can," he said. "We will by no means be as big as them, but we will have a slice of the market."
All of his businesses that have succeeded so far have done so by carving out a niche in a mainstream industry by emphasizing service and style -- whether it be Virgin Atlantic, with its interactive movie and game system in every seat in economy class, or Virgin Bride, a one-stop shop for weddings.
Virgin's philosophy, Mr. Branson said, is to improve upon established businesses by adding a Virginesque sensibility.
With Virgin Mobile, for example, he is taking the unusual step of giving away an earpiece with a built-in microphone with each of the company's mobile phones, so users do not have to hold them to their heads.
"A friend of mine got a brain tumor, and before he died we had dinner and he said his surgeon was convinced that using a mobile phone may have been a factor," Mr. Branson said, raising a product-liability specter that the head of a public company might be likely to suppress.
And the Virgin Web site will cater to Mr. Branson's digital naivete. "Any jargon that I don't understand" will be stripped out, he said. "I assume that I am representative of the vast majority of the people out there."
That thinking may explain why for Mr. Branson -- who in the past has attempted a solo, round-the-world balloon flight and who owns an island in the Caribbean -- taking his business onto the Internet does not seem as as much fun as some of his previous endeavors.
"It doesn't excite me in the same way that starting Virgin Atlantic did," he admitted. "It's because I could deal with people. And with the Internet, you're one step removed from the people."

HEADLINE: At Edges of Elian's Spotlight Are Other Divided Families

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
Lazara Brito and her three children huddled over the kitchen table in their Havana apartment on a recent day and thumbed through a pile of letters and drawings. These scraps of paper have been the only physical link to Ms. Brito's husband, Jose Cohen, who left Cuba on a raft in 1994 and has been waiting in vain for them to join him in Miami.
"The important thing in life is not what you know or who you know," Ms. Brito read from one letter, "but who you are." 
 That may be the cause of her family's plight, since her husband used to work for the Ministry of the Interior gathering intelligence on foreign investors interested in doing business in Cuba. And so the government considers him a deserter, or worse.
Although Ms. Brito and her children have had United States visas since 1998, she said the Cuban government had retaliated against her husband by not allowing them to emigrate and subjecting them to harassment and intimidation.
The Cohens are among hundreds of Cuban families stuck in a limbo of politics and bureaucracy, holding travel documents that remain useless without exit visas from the government. Many of them had become even more frustrated over the situation in recent months as they watched the daily Cuban protests demanding the return of Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba.
"It has been almost six years since he left," Ms. Brito said of her husband. "Since then, the whole family has felt the full rancor of the officials. I see all the worry over the child Elian and I ask, where is the love for my children, because for six years my children have been paying for the rancor against my husband."
State Department officials had no exact figures on how many families were being kept apart, but they said that last year approximately 1,700 people with valid travel documents for the United States were unable to leave Cuba.
For some, like the Cohens, the delay is political. Many are held up by what foreign diplomats said were excessive Cuban fees for medical exams and administrative costs -- as much as $1,000 a person in an economy in which the average salary is $10 a month. Other cases languish because a noncustodial parent refuses to give permission for his child to leave the country, or because the would-be immigrant is a professional who must first fulfill a work commitment in return for education.
"It is a big aspect of this whole Cuban trauma," said Max Castro, a senior research analyst at the University of Miami. "This is a good moment to reflect on it and for the various parties to be more consistent. There is no doubt that the Cuban government in the past has not been as solicitous as it is now on the issue of family unification."
Mr. Cohen, who now lives in a suburb north of Miami and runs an Internet business, said in an interview: "The regime gives you no option but to be with them or against them. People ask me, did I not know what would happen? Yes. But I did not know the regime would have such a strong reprisal."
Since her family obtained the United States visas, Ms. Brito said, she has written direct appeals to Fidel Castro and other high-ranking officials, asking that her children not be forced to pay for their father's actions. All she has had in return, she said, are letters saying her pleas have been sent to other government agencies.
Once, several years ago, security agents roused her from bed, searched her apartment and, as her children and another relative watched, whisked her off to jail for two days. One of her daughters found a note under the front door that said: "You will never leave. Forget it."
More recently, Ms. Brito's younger daughter, Yamila, 13, was sent from her school to take part in one of the large public rallies the government organized to call for Elian's return. Her older daughter, Yanelis, who is now 16, was asked to leave school last year when administrators discovered she had a visa for the United States.
Cuban officials said they had not forced anyone to leave Cuba, so they could not be accused of splitting up families. Ricardo Alarcon, the leader of Cuba's National Assembly, said the Cohen case involved a political defector who knew what he was doing.
"I imagine he left his children here," he said. "Nobody took them away from him. He left them here."
State Department officials said the delays were a continuing topic during the regular migration talks they held with their Cuban counterparts. They are also raised in individual complaints lodged by American diplomats in Havana, who seldom receive answers.
"It can be a long time," said one State Department official familiar with several cases. "It sort of compounds the tragedy, too, because when these people go to apply for exit permits, they lose their jobs, or their kids have problems getting into college preparatory schools."
That was what Estella Natal, a language teacher in New York, discovered while waiting for her Cuban husband, Joel Prince, a doctor, to join her. She had met Dr. Prince on a trip to Cuba in 1996, and they married two years later. At the time he was working as a prison doctor.
"He was fired from that job days after we were married," Ms. Natal said. "Then he got a job doing medical surveys, then at a neighborhood clinic and then as a paramedic. The thing is, a lot of places do not want to hire him or he does not get good training because they know he is going to leave eventually. So, he gets the leftover jobs."
Ms. Natal said her husband might have to work for several more years before he would be allowed to leave. She added that recent appointments he had been given to process his documents had been postponed because workers at the immigration office had to attend the public rallies for Elian.
"This whole custody battle is hampering everything," she said. "It's not just Elian. Elian is a symbol for the rest of us. He is really a symbol of families being divided, of a lot of politics coming between families."
That symbolism was the impetus for a recently formed Miami exile group, New Generation Cuba, which includes Mr. Cohen among its founders. The group, which portrays itself as a mix of American- and Cuban-raised exiles, met with State Department officials recently to press the cases of 14 separated families.
The group's leaders said they knew of about 200 cases, but had yet to document them all. They said some other families were reluctant to have contact with the group because they feared reprisals against relatives in Cuba.
"Fidel Castro has separated families for 41 years through death and bureaucracy," said Bettina Rodriguez Aguilera, the group's president, whose own father was imprisoned in Cuba for 14 years while she was growing up in the United States. "The only person destroying families in and out of Cuba is Fidel Castro."
But some political analysts said that while family unification was an important issue, it was different from the issue in the Elian Gonzalez case. In the boy's case, they say, the issue is the rights of a surviving parent rather than the political control of immigration.
"There is a relation, but they are not identical," said Mr. Castro of the University of Miami. "There is reason to question the Cuban government on these cases and ask them to reflect and be consistent on their view of families."
But he also said that efforts like those of New Generation Cuba appeared to be hastily organized and that the group risked losing credibility if it was seen as manipulating Elian's plight for political purposes.
"They are taking a real issue and using it in a way that may be more of a disservice to the cause because it is taken as something very opportunistic," Mr. Castro said. "It should be a continuing conversation and a demand, not something that is all of a sudden deployed."
But for Mr. Cohen's family, there is a sense of hope that someone has taken up their cause. In the family's spartan apartment -- Ms. Brito started giving away their belongings in anticipation of a move -- his children practice English, just as their father asks them to in his letters.
"I am far from you now," he wrote in English to Yanelis, his oldest daughter. "But my soul is with you and you are in my heart." He added in Spanish, "Learn this."
Yanelis said, but in Spanish: "Once we are together, that will be the greatest. Here we are feeling different from all the others because we do not have the family that all human beings want. We ask, when will it reach the hearts of those men who stop us from being with our father?"

HEADLINE: Council Democrats Plan To Dare a Giuliani Veto

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Over the next few weeks, Democrats in the City Council, led by Speaker Peter F. Vallone, are planning to approve a barrage of legislative initiatives that have been strongly opposed by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, all but daring the mayor to use his veto powers.
In pushing the bills, some of which have been in committee for years, the Democratic majority in the Council is deliberately putting itself on a collision course with Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, at a time when he is eager to portray himself as collaborative and well suited to the United States Senate. 
 Democrats, including some Council members and Mr. Giuliani's Senate campaign opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, have been just as eager to portray him otherwise: as an angry autocrat who would be out of place in the Senate, where political compromise is essential.
The administration maintains that Mr. Giuliani's success as a Republican mayor in a heavily Democratic city is evidence that he can work cooperatively.
But the Council's legislative blitz also reflects a changed political landscape. As Mr. Giuliani runs for Senate and Mr. Vallone prepares to run for mayor next year, the interests of the city's two most powerful officials have diverged sharply and policy differences between them have become more stark.
Among the Council initiatives are bills that would establish grievance procedures for workfare participants and create a new transitional jobs program, change some rules that govern the city's public markets and begin an intense voter registration drive.
Council officials said they were left with no choice but to challenge the mayor head-on. "It's out of frustration with negotiating in good faith for the last six or seven months and coming up nowhere," said Bruce R. Bender, Mr. Vallone's chief of staff.
Supporters say the bills would protect workfare recipients from losing benefits over petty disputes, offer a strong mechanism for job training and bring more equity to public markets, including the Hunts Point Produce Market in the Bronx.
But Mr. Giuliani has expressed outspoken opposition to most of the measures, calling the grievance procedures unnecessary, the transitional jobs program a reversal of welfare reform, and the public markets bill an effort to soften his stance against organized crime.
And one senior mayoral aide charged yesterday that the coordinated action on the bills had been orchestrated by Harold M. Ickes, the former White House deputy chief of staff who is Mrs. Clinton's top political adviser and also a paid political consultant for the City Council.
Council officials rejected the charge, saying the bills were good government policy and pointing out that the measures had been in the works long before anyone knew who was running for Senate. And, they said, the measures have been amended to address some of the mayor's objections.
Senior Council officials said yesterday that they were still hoping to reach a deal with the mayor, but that they were committed to the legislation and were prepared to override a veto if necessary. Giuliani administration officials declined to speculate on whether the mayor would issue any vetoes, saying they doubted the the bills would even come out of committee.
But the administration officials did not react with the vehement anger toward the Council that they had expressed in the past, suggesting that Mr. Giuliani was not looking for a fight and that they might be willing to talk. The question is whether the Council will give them time.
Council hearings on the bills are scheduled this week -- transitional jobs tomorrow in the General Welfare Committee, workfare grievance on Wednesday in the Governmental Operations Committee and public markets on Thursday in the Economic Development Committee.
All three hearings are timed to allow the committees to approve the bills and get them on the agenda for votes by the entire Council at its next full meeting on Feb. 29. Several Council officials said they expected the bills to pass with the support of Mr. Vallone.
Councilman Stephen DiBrienza, a Brooklyn Democrat who has been heavily involved in supporting all three measures, said of the mayor's past opposition: "We are attempting to move good strong pieces of legislation, and if his lack of cooperation or his trumpeting of his cooperation with us has forced our hand -- well, be careful what you wish for. He has no one to blame but himself."
And while a fight with the Council might bode ill for Mr. Giuliani's Senate campaign, one administration official suggested that the transitional jobs bill could do just as little for Mr. Vallone's mayoral ambitions.
"It is hard to believe why a moderate Democrat like Peter Vallone, the odds-on favorite to be the next full-term mayor, would support a bill that would reverse the welfare reform that New York City has experienced," a senior mayoral adviser said. "He should be embracing the welfare reforms."
There are other political implications. The grievance procedures and the transitional jobs program are strongly favored by labor unions, whose support Mr. Vallone courted when he ran for governor in 1998 and will need again to win the Democratic primary when he runs for mayor.
Mr. Giuliani, however, expects little or no support from local labor unions in the Senate race and is facing a series of contentious contract negotiations later this year.
The result of this sort of conflicting interests has been a cooling of the political relationship between the mayor and the speaker, making negotiations increasingly difficult.
In 1998, when Mr. Vallone ran for governor, politics similarly intruded on the operations of city government and for the first time in modern history the mayor and the Council failed to reach a deal on the city budget. The Council approved the budget over the mayor's veto, leading to a court battle.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Diplomat Picks Up the Pieces of Austria's Broken Image

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
DESPITE the diplomat's smile, the fatigue showed on the face of Ambassador Peter Moser, Austria's representative to the United States, the lack of sleep etched beneath his eyes.
He had been up since 4 a.m., just as he had every morning for most of the last two weeks, making urgent telephone calls to the Foreign Ministry in Vienna. He dispatched his wife to her sister's home in New York, knowing that it would be impossible to find time for her for days. 
 "This is a nightmare," he said of what has gone on since Feb. 4, with the swearing-in of a new government that includes the far-right Freedom Party led by Jorg Haider, who has praised policies of Austria's Nazi rulers in World War II. "You think of the job of a diplomat as a dream under usual circumstances," Mr. Moser said. "Well, what is going on now is the reverse.
"It does not feel real. It is surreal."
Every day the embassy's mailbag bulges with scores of letters from Americans condemning Austria; some are filled with obscenities. "There are serious letters, and then others are just offensive," said Mr. Moser, a 58-year-old career diplomat. "Maybe people get a personal relief if they call us names."
The creation of a coalition government that includes Mr. Haider's party has turned Austria into a pariah within the 15-nation European Union, which has severed routine contacts with Vienna. The Clinton administration has protested by withdrawing the American ambassador, and Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, has been warning of the possible emergence of "the extreme hateful right" in Europe.
The crisis has forced Ambassador Moser to dive into the whirlpool of Washington's 24-hour news cycle, as he tries to convince Americans, and the large foreign press corps based here, that Austria is being unfairly tarred.
In the last 10 days, he has appeared on CNN and on PBS's "NewsHour," as well as at a news conference on Friday at the National Press Club, the first solo news conference in Mr. Moser's 33-year career in the Austrian diplomatic service.
"Haider is not Austria, and Austria is not Haider," he said at the press club in an awkward effort to distance the people of Austria from the government that they put in place -- and that he must now represent.
He insisted that although the Freedom Party might be xenophobic, it was not fascist, and that while Mr. Haider might be an opportunist prone to outrageous remarks (praise for Nazi labor policies and for SS veterans), he was not a Nazi. "We from the diplomatic establishment have to walk behind him, after him, and pick up the pieces," Mr. Moser said.
Later, in his embassy office, Mr. Moser slowly sipped from a glass of water. Behind his desk was a stack of papers, topped by a book by Mr. Haider outlining his right-wing politics. On the cover is a photo of the well-tanned, carefully coiffed politician, who could easily pass for an American television anchorman.
"It was given to me," Mr. Moser said. "I don't think I will read it." He resisted an appraisal of Mr. Haider's character. "My personal feelings, I am not being paid for," he said.
Trying to salvage Austria's reputation was certainly not the assignment Mr. Moser expected when he arrived in Washington last year. His initial goal, he said, was to expand trade and to encourage Americans to think of his nation of eight million people as the economic hub of central Europe.
"I'm very sad and sorry because what we built up over the years is now being questioned," he said of Austria's efforts to portray itself as a peace-loving member of the European community, and to distance itself from its Nazi past, when Austria embraced German rule under the Austrian-born Hitler.
He said it was unfair to single out Austria for condemnation when parties similar to Mr. Haider's exist across Europe and could, like the Freedom Party, enter government someday soon. "One day they will wake up and find that they have similar problems," he said. "All of these remarks of Haider, which remember the Nazi history, are a wonderful instrument to distract attention from this fact."
He does not deny that his job is made more difficult by the perception that Austria is unwilling to confront its history, a view that grew stronger outside Austria after voters elected Kurt Waldheim president in 1986 despite revelations about his service in Hitler's army. "Yes, I think there are many people -- not only in the Freedom Party, but many, particularly older people -- who have not done this process of atonement," Mr. Moser conceded.
THE ambassador could be considered another victim of the war. He never knew his father, an Austrian soldier in the German Army, who was sent off to the front two days after his only child was born in Vienna in June 1941. His father was killed in 1943.
Mr. Moser did well in school and entered Austria's diplomatic academy in 1965. His career as a diplomat has taken him to posts as diverse as New Delhi, Seoul and Sofia. His favorite posting was in Los Angeles, where he was consul general from 1979 to 1985. "We lived in a house with a swimming pool in a wonderful neighborhood," he said.
But the carefree sunshine of Southern California is far from his thoughts as Mr. Moser rushes through Washington's winter chill from one interview to another, trying to limit the damage to Austria's reputation.
"When the dust settles," he said, "it will be a lot of work for us to get back what we have lost."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Tries to Soothe Concerns of Sharpton

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Seeking to solidify his support among black New Yorkers, Vice President Al Gore met yesterday for the first time with the Rev. Al Sharpton and received the endorsement of the Rev. Floyd B. Flake, a former congressman and now the pastor of a prominent African-American church in Queens.
The two sessions began a week-long drive by the vice president to highlight his support among blacks, which is derived in large part from his association with President Clinton. And they are signs of an accelerated strategy from a campaign increasingly confident that the Democratic presidential nomination is within Mr. Gore's grasp. 
 But the two sessions differed markedly in style, reflecting caution on Mr. Gore's part after his buzz-saw encounter with New York's ethnic politics in his failed 1988 presidential bid. He was open and voluble with Mr. Flake, prancing up and down the aisles of Mr. Flake's church, but met with Mr. Sharpton in private.
A buoyant Mr. Gore, with microphone in hand and a choir behind him, addressed hundreds of congregants at Mr. Flake's church, the Allen A.M.E. church in southeast Queens. He referred to the Scripture and he raced up and down the aisles asking the people how many years they had been married and how many grandchildren they had.
Then he heard these surprising words from the pastor himself:
"I don't do endorsements from across the pulpit because I never know who's out there watching the types of laws that govern separation of church and state," Mr. Flake said, draped in a flowing, gold-embroidered white robe and standing next to the blue-suited Mr. Gore. "But I will say to you this morning, and you read it well: this should be the next president of the United States."
Just a week before, Mr. Flake had been host to Mr. Gore's sole rival, former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, and given him a warm welcome but no endorsement.
 Mr. Flake's embrace of Mr. Gore was significant because of the influence of Mr. Flake and his church within the black middle class. Mr. Flake joins many of New York's other black leaders, including Representative Charles B. Rangel and state comptroller H. Carl McCall, in backing Mr. Gore over Mr. Bradley.
But not on that list of endorsees, at least so far, is Mr. Sharpton, whose meeting with Mr. Gore was hidden from public view. Some of Mr. Gore's top staff were not even aware of the meeting, while others, including Donna Brazile, Mr. Gore's campaign manager, were arranging it and then attended the session, which lasted about an hour and took place at the East Side apartment of Karenna Gore Schiff, Mr. Gore's oldest daughter.
The press corps that normally follows Mr. Gore were told by aides that the meeting with Mr. Sharpton was not happening and that his visit to his daughter's apartment was strictly personal.
While Mr. Sharpton said in an interview afterward that he had not yet decided whom he might endorse, he said the discussion with the vice president had been "extremely positive" and that the meeting "included a frank and honest discussion of the concerns of the people in the areas that we come from."
"Although we don't agree on everything, he showed a willingness to talk and a willingness to listen," Mr. Sharpton said. "I was impressed with a lot of what he had to say."
Mr. Sharpton has been urged by supporters of both candidates to make an endorsement. He initially considered supporting Mr. Bradley but came under pressure from political leaders like the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, who urged him to endorse the vice president (although Mr. Jackson has yet to make an endorsement).
Yesterday's meeting followed some tension between Mr. Sharpton and the Gore campaign. A week ago, Mr. Sharpton complained that he had perceived indifference from the vice president's campaign on racial issues. And he said Mr. Gore needed to make amends with blacks in New York over his 1988 presidential campaign. That year, Mr. Gore was competing against Mr. Jackson, among others, and during the New York primary Mr. Gore's ally, Mayor Edward I. Koch, was engaged in an ugly public feud with Mr. Jackson.
Gore advisers said the campaign wanted to acknowledge Mr. Sharpton's influence as a political leader but hesitated to fully legitimize him. Mr. Gore has a horror of getting entangled in New York's local political cross-currents, and did not ask Mr. Sharpton for his endorsement. Nor did Mr. Sharpton offer it.
But the two -- along with Ms. Brazile, Roberto Ramirez, the Democratic Party chairman in the Bronx, and Eric Eve, Mr. Gore's New York campaign manager -- discussed several matters concerning economic development in heavily black areas, including access to media ownership, Gore aides said.
Mr. Sharpton did ask Mr. Gore to hold a debate with Mr. Bradley on minority issues, Mr. Sharpton and Gore aides said. A week earlier, Mr. Sharpton had hinted that he would encourage black voters to support Mr. Bradley unless such a debate took place. Mr. Gore noted that the campaigns had already agreed to a debate at the Apollo Theater in Harlem on Feb. 21.
Mr. Gore's events in New York yesterday marked the beginning of a week aimed squarely at black voters, who make up one of the party's most reliable core constituencies. Mr. Gore's campaign has always perceived the black vote as its insurance policy or "fire wall" if Mr. Gore stumbled in the early primaries.
The fact that the Gore campaign is making a major pitch to black voters now, before the collection of primaries on March 7, is a clear sign of the Gore camp's growing confidence.
The schedule tells much of the story. The vice president is planning a string of events in heavily black areas of the country.
He is to speak about education at Medgar Evars College in Brooklyn today. On Tuesday in Baltimore, he plans to address the economic plight of blacks in the information age. That night he begins a southern swing through North Carolina, Macon, Ga., New Orleans, Jackson, Miss., St. Louis, Cleveland and Springfield, Mass.
Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York is to travel with Mr. Gore in the state today and endorse him.

HEADLINE: Owners to Scale Back Ratner's, a Lower East Side Landmark

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
Ratner's may not be dead, but to some customers, after hearing the owners' plans for the nearly century-old Lower East Side landmark restaurant, it may as well be.
The Delancey Street kosher dairy restaurant, a virtual time capsule of the neighborhood's Jewish roots, will close in May for a three-month, $1 million renovation. 
 But just as old-timers lament that the Delancey Street neighborhood will never be the same, neither will the new Ratner's.
For one thing, it will be about half its size -- shrinking to about 100 seats. The other half will go to the Lansky Lounge, the backroom nightclub also owned by the Harmatz family, which has run Ratner's since 1905.
The nearly three-year-old lounge, named for the 1930's gangster Meyer Lansky, who dined at a back table in what is now the club, caters to the young, urban and hip who have made the neighborhood something of a hot spot.
But what most troubles some of Ratner's fans is the prospect that it may no longer be kosher -- a rabbi in the kitchen oversees food preparation -- or honor the Sabbath by closing sundown Friday to sundown Saturday, as it has done for 10 years. Fred Harmatz, who owns the restaurant with his brother Robert -- their grandfather Jacob Harmatz founded it with his brother-in-law Morris Ratner -- said yesterday that they would decide by spring whether to make such changes, which would allow the lounge to open Friday nights and expand its liquor offerings to include nonkosher drinks.
The restaurant has been kosher since it opened and began honoring the sabbath a decade ago. But a few years ago, business from Orthodox Jews began dropping off and the nightclub grew in popularity, Mr. Harmatz said. "This neighborhood is becoming young," he said. "Friday is a big bar night."
Ratner's still draws a big Sunday brunch crowd, but business during the week is half what it was just five years ago, he said.
Mr. Harmatz said simple economics may dictate the change. "It's the bottom line," he said.
In another five years or so, he said, the restaurant may close for good.

HEADLINE: Britain's Health Care, and Ours

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A Feb. 10 front-page article about Britain's National Health Service didn't mention a key factor in the difficulties faced by Jackie O'Donnell, a British cancer patient who had to pay for chemotherapy out of her own pocket. It was the pharmaceutical company that supplied the drug she needed, using the monopoly conferred by patent protection, that set the price at $16,000.
Similar practices have priced AIDS therapy beyond the reach of most of the world. Less critical is the situation in which recent billion-dollar drugs for less severe conditions are in the "blockbuster" category because of high protected prices, not the numbers of prescriptions. 
 There may still be some economic limits on how high these prices can be set, but if prescription insurance became universal, the sky would become the limit.

HEADLINE: As the Pariah of Europe, Austria Seems Unbowed

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: VIENNA, Feb. 13

 BODY:
As a political entity turned pack of would-be toughs, Europe is proving unimpressive; it is slapping Austria around a bit, but is unable to bring it to its diplomatic knees.
France, Belgium and tiny Andorra boycotted a speech here last Thursday by the new Austrian foreign minister. But they stayed to take part in the meeting of the Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe that she was presiding over. 
 The next day, Austria's new social affairs minister was allowed to attend a meeting on unemployment in Lisbon. But only the host would shake her hand, and the others refused to pose for the usual ministerial family photo.
Later, the German minister seemed to regret his rudeness; the Belgian and French ministers, who also walked out during her speech, reveled in theirs.
The conservative caucus in the European Parliament heard a motion to kick out Austria's People's Party for inviting Mr. Haider's Freedom Party into government with it. But members said the motion would not be voted on until April and had no chance of passing anyway.
Prince Charles postponed a planned summer visit, and the actress Claudia Cardinale said she would not attend the Opera Ball, the height of the Vienna social season. But Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands took her annual Austrian skiing vacation as she has for 30 years.
Belgium theatrically canceled an order for seven Austrian armored cars. But Sweden said it still hoped to sell Austria a squadron of fighter-bombers.
And the French finance minister, a Socialist, may have split the diplomatic hair of the week when he discovered that his Austrian counterpart is from Mr. Haider's party. "I'm not sure I'll be talking much with him," the minister told journalists.
Europe is in a quandary. Fourteen of the continent's foreign ministers threatened to isolate Austria if it let Mr. Haider's xenophobic party into government. Austria promptly called its bluff. Now Europe is divided and confused and falling back largely on bad manners.
"This is an unprecedented situation, and there is no uniform front," said Hans Rauscher, a columnist for Der Standard here. "It's not a massive, concerted action, but it's pretty strong."
Europe is not alone in having divided reactions. Israel's ambassador, the first to leave, is still gone. The American ambassador returned this weekend after the State Department tentatively accepted assurances that Austria would hew to the democratic path. But the Argentine ambassador was just recalled to Buenos Aires for consultations after a letter he wrote last October describing Mr. Haider as neither "an extremist nor a neo-Nazi" but rather "a democrat" was leaked to an Argentine paper.
Mr. Haider has predicted that any censure effort would quickly crumble. He may be proved right. It isn't just smaller European countries like Greece and Denmark that are already skeptical. Even the big powers are subdividing: Bavaria broke with Berlin over isolating its Alpine neighbor and Italy's provinces around Trieste, abutting Austria, criticized Rome.
Also, the union has discovered that it needs to be stable more than it needs to punish. After the euro slipped this week on rumors that Austria might be forced out of the monetary union, the European Union issue a hasty denial that it would impose such a harsh sentence.
And the fight has strengthened anti-Europe forces. Isolationist groups in Switzerland and Denmark have gained ground in opinion polls, citing anger at the drubbing of Austria. Britain's anti-euro conservatives are crowing their we-told-you-sos.
"It is hard to see how the E.U can now get out of the hole that its leaders have dug," Peter Ludlow, the director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels wrote in a scathing essay in Britain's Financial Times this week.
By aggressive posturing, the other European countries "exposed themselves to the risk of a series of humiliating and very public compromises."
Part of the predicament is systemic: The union is bound by treaties, not a constitution, and its important decisions, like a common currency or admitting new members, are made by consensus. It is not a congress, and cannot just freeze out or vote down members. Ministers meet in order to talk.
The other problem is haste. Austria called Europe's bluff so fast that there was no time to plan a response. With careful timing, European ministers might have embarrassed Mr. Haider over weaknesses newly revealed: one of his new cabinet ministers is accused of bankrolling a right-wing paper that denied the Holocaust; another once supposedly said that any businesses that hire more than 10 percent foreigners should not get government contracts. Instead, the Europeans ended up snubbing Elisabeth Sickl, the new social affairs minister, a friendly middle-aged former school principal who says her values are "humanist."
Meanwhile, the foreign media, which for weeks whipped up images of Nazism in Austria, are beginning to turn around and suggest that someone was indulging in hyperbole. For example, the same BBC radio anchorman who on Feb. 1 asked an Austrian theater director if he planned to flee the country (the answer was a puzzled "No") by Feb. 10 was asking a European Union spokesman if his organization had been in the grip of anti-Nazi hysteria (the answer was a defensive "No").
Within Austria itself, protests against the new government, which were buoyed by the European Union response, continue, although with less vigor than in the first days. About 15,000 demonstrators shouting "Resist Racism and Fascism!" marched in Vienna on Saturday. Smaller demonstrations were held in cities throughout the country. Today a discussion at Vienna's main theater about artistic freedom under the new government was packed an hour before it even started.
A march that may be swelled by the trade union allies of the Social Democratic Party, which was forced into opposition by the new ruling coalition, is planned for Feb. 18.
More interesting will be to see what happens when Mr. Haider defies the advice of his party and goes to Brussels on Feb. 17. As governor of Carinthia Province, he is on the European Union committee on regional government.
His advisers urged missing the meeting. But Mr. Haider answered them this week with his characteristic mix of cheek and limelight-love: "I'm not going to cancel my trip just because someone wants to hit me with a tomato."

HEADLINE: Shortage in Clergy Leaves Pulpits Unfilled

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN 

 BODY:
Congregation B'nai Israel in Hattiesburg, Miss., has been without a rabbi for more than three years. Every other week, a student rabbi flies in from Cincinnati. At other times, congregants lead Sabbath services, run the Sunday school and even conduct funerals.
It is not for lack of effort that the 110-year-old synagogue has failed to attract a rabbi. It has listed its opening with the placement office of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, the Reform movement seminary, since its last rabbi left, and it usually sends a representative to Cincinnati in the spring to recruit at the college. 
 "We go to interview even when no one signs up," said Steve Doblin, president of B'nai Israel and a dean at the University of Southern Mississippi.
The temple's plight is not unusual. Not only are synagogues finding it increasingly difficult to hire clergy members, so too are Roman Catholic and Protestant churches.
In the Roman Catholic Church, according to the National Pastoral Life Center, an independent organization in New York that helps local parishes, the number of parish priests declined by 12 percent from 1992 to 1997, and churches are increasingly relying on lay people.
In the Episcopal Church, "the situation is grave," said the Rev. Hugh Magers, a member of the congregational ministries cluster at the denomination's national headquarters in Manhattan. "As best as I can tell, we have under 300 members of the clergy out of 15,000 who were born after 1964."
In Reform Judaism, about 200 out 895 congregations are without a full-time rabbi. The modern Orthodox wing of Judaism has the same problem.
"There are more jobs open now, due to the growth, thank God, of the Orthodox community, and filling positions in smaller communities can be extremely difficult," said Rabbi Steven Dworken, executive vice president of the Rabbinical Council of America.
The shortage in the ranks of the Jewish clergy began about five years ago. Before then, there were more rabbis than synagogues. "The issue of the glut was raised with the college in 1993," said Rabbi Sheldon Zimmerman, president of Hebrew Union College. "As a result, recruitment was not emphasized and was not considered an imperative."
Though enrollment at the college has remained stable, the number of congregations has grown. Fifteen years ago 764 synagogues belonged to the Union of American Hebrew Congregations; today 895 do. So not only are there new pulpits to fill, but, Rabbi Zimmerman said, "large congregations need more rabbis."
Rural areas have always had difficulty attracting clergy, no matter the denomination. Now, urban congregations are feeling the pinch.
"What used to be a problem for Wyoming and Montana is now a problem for everybody," said the Rev. James G. Wilson, executive director of the church deployment office at the Episcopal Church Center.
In part, the robust economy is being blamed, with many people who might have entered the ministry attracted to more lucrative fields.
"We have done too good a job educating our children and giving them banking, legal, business and medical opportunities. Years ago, many fellows became rabbis because they had no other choices," Rabbi Dworken said.
As a professor of religion at Columbia University for 21 years, Peter Awn said he had seen only four students majoring in religion at Columbia pursue careers in the clergy. In his view, the declining appeal of a life in ministry is more a result of the rejection of authority than of the lure of more lucrative jobs.
"People who might once have gone into the clergy as an avenue toward social change now see it as confining rather than liberating," Professor Awn said.
Among those who do seek jobs in the clergy, quality of life plays an increasingly decisive role as they question the long hours and unrelenting demands.
Though some experts think the decline in the clergy is cyclical, others think that failure to stem the tide would have serious implications.
"Unless we somehow increase the number of those choosing religious professional life, ultimately this will be a disaster for organized religious life," Rabbi Zimmerman said.

HEADLINE: For Women in Astronomy, a Glass Ceiling in the Sky

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER 

 BODY:
Before they could even vote or control their own property, women had reached for the stars -- and rigorously picked them apart. For more than a century, they have earned at least 10 percent of the doctorates in astronomy, often to luminous ends. In 1908, for example, Henrietta Leavitt discovered Cepheid variable stars, which have proved crucial to the measurement of cosmic distances. Some 25 years later, Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin determined that stars are composed mainly of hydrogen -- a finding that her colleagues at first refused to believe.
Yet with all that history and momentum behind them, female astronomers still have not soared to professional heights in the numbers that might be expected. At a recent meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Atlanta, researchers presented results from new surveys of the status of women in astronomy, including one that canvassed virtually all astronomy departments in the United States and another that focused on 36 of the nation's larger and more prominent astronomy graduate programs. They compared the latest data with similar surveys taken in 1992, and thus were able to assess women's progress during a span that has been a boom time for astronomy as much as it has for the economy over all. 
 "With the Hubble Space Telescope and other advances, there's a lot of excitement in the field now, and a lot of stuff for people to do," said Dr. C. Megan Urry, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, who conducted the surveys and presented the data in Georgia. "We're in a golden age of astronomy and cosmology." As a result, she said, the total number of people with Ph.D.'s in astronomy rose 40 percent in the last seven years.
Unfortunately for aspiring female astronomers, even the golden age appears to be alloyed with disparities. And though many observers have the impression that affirmative action programs in particular, and academic "political correctness" in general, unfairly give women the edge when it comes to hiring and promotion decisions, the new survey results suggest otherwise.
"Young men, and some young women, often think that women are being preferentially hired these days," Dr. Urry said. "Our data show that's not the case. If anything, it's the opposite." Women at the highest levels of the field remain a rarity: only 5 percent of the nation's full professors in astronomy are female. Among newcomers, though, women abound, currently accounting for 25 percent of the doctorates awarded in astronomy each year.
But women start leaking out of the career pipeline early on. About 43 percent of the men who were in graduate school in 1992 managed to obtain postdoctoral fellowships in the institution of their choice, compared with only 26 percent of the women. Among the elite universities, 60 percent of the male graduate students won coveted postdoctoral appointments in the same school, while only 50 percent of the female Ph.D.'s were selected to stay on as postgraduates.
When young astronomers seek tenure-track faculty positions, a few more women vanish; they go from being 17 percent of the nation's postdoctoral fellows to 15 percent of the new assistant professors.
Nobody knows why women are not advancing swiftly in a discipline that has long attracted them. Conference presenters admitted that conditions for women are vastly better today than they were 50 years ago, when the great astronomer Margaret Burbidge was refused a Carnegie fellowship because women were not allowed to use the Mount Wilson telescope or any of the other Carnegie observatories.
And astronomy is hardly alone among the sciences in its poor showing of women at the top. According to a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine last week, women who teach in medical schools are less likely than men to be promoted at each step along the path from assistant to full professor, even though they are more likely to go into academic medicine to begin with.
Some believe that any effort to push women ahead even faster is doomed to fail, because, they say, the female talent and desire just is not there. In the January issue of Status, a biannual report on women in astronomy published by the American Astronomical Society, the editors reprinted an article by David Gelernter, a professor of computer science at Yale University, which originally appeared in the conservative Weekly Standard.
"If women aren't being kept out of science by force, they must be choosing not to enter, presumably because they don't want to," Dr. Gelernter wrote, "presumably because (by and large) they don't like these fields or (on average) don't tend to excel in them, which is nearly the same thing."
"They're also less prone to the intense, cut-throat aggressiveness that usually marks the successful research scientist or engineer," he wrote.
Dr. Urry does not buy either the free choice or the wilting lily arguments. "Getting a Ph.D. in a science like astronomy is very, very difficult," she said. "You have to be in love with it, and be really interested in it and dedicated to finish. The notion that after spending five, six, seven grinding years working like dog, and then saying, 'oh, that was fun, now I choose to do something else' -- well, I don't believe it."
Overt discrimination is rare or absent, Dr. Urry and others said. Instead, they point to small slights and acts of benign neglect as the likeliest culprits in women's career lag -- the molehills that, as Virginia Valian put it in her book, "Why So Slow? The Advancement of Women," (M.I.T. Press, 1999) gradually accrete into mountains.
The publication Status presented some women's testimony in its two most recent issues, which can be found online at www.aas.org:
 *"I am on a postdoctoral search committee at a university astronomy department. I read about 100 applications, each of which has typically three letters of recommendation. One letter, written by a male faculty member for a female applicant, emphasizes twice how tiny, sweet and charming the applicant is, and gives a specific example of how amusing and cute it is to watch the applicant in the laboratory wrestling with astronomical equipment larger than she."
*"A new chair has been hired for our physics and astronomy department. Three of the 40 faculty members are women. He addresses his very first faculty memo to 'Dear Gentlemen . . .' "
*"A senior scientist and fellow Italian citizen, whom I know well but have not seen in several years, visits the institution where I am on the faculty. I say hello, and he replies, asking if I could take his clothes to the dry cleaner. . . . I declined to run his errand."
*"At a conference I approach two male colleagues in my field, wanting to introduce myself to the senior astronomer whose work closely parallels mine. I hope to join their conversation about a science issue with which I am very familiar. After continuing their conversation for a few minutes, the senior astronomer finally turns from his counterpart and addresses me, saying, 'Ah, but we are boring this sweet young girl. What can I do for you, dear?' "
*"I have just passed my Ph.D. oral exam, a follow-up to the written exam which was taken days earlier. A well-intentioned senior male faculty member approaches me with a handshake and remarks, 'I am very proud of your accomplishment, knowing how hard astronomy and physics is, especially for a woman . . .' "
*"As a young postdoc in a high-powered physics department, I attend a colloquium by a famous French man in which the opening slide is a topless dancer in a grass skirt on a Hawaiian beach. Some guys laugh and one female graduate student leaves quietly from the back. I myself am torn -- I do not want to appear humorless or to overreact (cultural norms being different in France, for one thing), and I want very much to hear the talk, but after 20 minutes I realize I have not heard a word he said after that awful picture. . . . The speaker, by the way, later wins a prestigious prize named for a famous woman scientist."
 None of this surprises Dr. Urry. Recently, she said, as she was putting together materials to bolster the case for her promotion to full astronomer, Dr. Urry was advised by a colleague to exclude mention of her work on behalf of women in astronomy. "Normally, taking a leadership position is seen as a plus," she said. "It's good to be a leader in anything but this."
Dr. Urry ignored the advice.

HEADLINE: Flashing Diamonds, and Hungry Children

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Bigger Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" (Week in Review, Feb. 13): You report that "engagement rings of four carats or more are not uncommon in Upper East Side social circles."
Though Jerry Seinfeld's purchase of a two-carat diamond for his bride "horrified" Tiffany insiders, I admire his restraint. 
 When a woman, like one in your article, is disappointed with a six-carat diamond that is priced at about $75,000, we are really in the middle of a long-running economic expansion.
Every day, thousands of children die of preventable diseases and malnutrition. The 13-carat diamond pictured in the photograph accompanying your article could save some children from starvation.
Where are our priorities? If only there were status in an Upper East Side socialite's flashing a bare ring finger and saying, "My husband donated the money instead to help save the children of the world."

HEADLINE: Hostile Takeover Bid in Japan Ends on an Educational Note

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 14

 BODY:
A deal described as Japan's first indigenous hostile takeover attempt ended in what Americans would call a failure today.
But here, the effort by Yoshiaki Murakami, a former bureaucrat who had made a bid to take over the Shoei Company, a little-known real estate and electronic parts company, is seen as the most striking effort so far to challenge longstanding practices. 
 Mr. Murakami's bid, to buy Shoei's shares for 1,000 yen, or about $9.17, apiece, expired today. He increased his stake to 6.52 percent from 2.78 percent, far less than needed to veto any management decisions, but he said he considered it a victory.
"I'm very, very happy," Mr. Mu rakami said in an interview this evening. "I created a debate about shareholder value and management's responsibility for creating shareholder value, and that was what I wanted to achieve."
The acquisition fund established by Mr. Murakami, a 40-year-old former official of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, has been widely followed as a barometer of corporate Japan's willingness to change. His effort to acquire a controlling stake in Shoei is considered the first instance of a Japanese investor's having tried a hostile takeover of a Japanese company.
The outcome of his bid raises questions about the prognosis for another unsolicited takeover effort under way in Japan, a tender offer by Boehringer Ingelheim, a German drug manufacturer, for a controlling stake in SS Pharmaceuticals, which is set to expire Tuesday.
Mr. Murakami's bid for Shoei exposed the impediments that Japan's system of cross-shareholding among banks and corporations pose for investors. Shoei is a member company of the Fuyo Group, a cluster of companies, or keiretsu, that orbit around Fuji Bank and its related financial institutions, which together control 60 percent of Shoei's shares.
The keiretsu system has been long seen as one of the biggest barriers to foreign investment in Japan, as well as a significant contributor to Japan's lack of global competitiveness. Inside the keiretsu, companies are not forced to compete for financing and have little incentive to make decisions based on profitability.
Many investment strategists and analysts have assured investors that global market forces are pressuring the keiretsu to disband. Yet the Shoei case suggests that keiretsu power is still strong. Although the president of Fuji Bank has been widely quoted as saying that he intended to sell off Fuji's stakes in various group companies, Fuji and its sister insurance companies and trust banks refused to sell their shares in Shoei.
Mr. Murakami demonstrated that Shoei served as a place to give former directors of Fuji and its sister financial companies, the Yasuda Trust and Banking Company, the Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Company and the Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance Company, a second job and a means of maintaining their golf club memberships and chauffeured car service after retirement.
He also exposed the longstanding Japanese practice of undervaluing assets, finding 70 billion yen, or more than $648 million, in value over book value in Shoei's real estate holdings. He cites that as evidence that the company could turn a far better profit than it has in recent years.
"My motivation in this was not to seize management control but to increase shareholder value," he said. "I want the existing management to do its job."
Mr. Murakami said he planned to take his case to the March annual shareholders' meeting. He said several shareholders, including the fund management company Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder, which has a 7.7 percent stake in Shoei, have asked him to serve as their proxy.

HEADLINE: Surge in Sales Far Outpaces Rise in Business Inventories

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
American companies bolstered their inventories by a modest 0.5 percent in December but their sales vaulted ahead at more than twice that pace, a sign that businesses are struggling to keep up with hardy demand, economists said.
For the 12th consecutive month, companies added to their stockpiles of goods, pushing total business inventories in December to a seasonally adjusted $1.14 trillion, the Commerce Department said today. 
 Sales grew 1.1 percent in December, to $868.8 billion.
That increase brought the inventory-to-sales ratio to a record low of 1.32, meaning it would take 1.32 months to exhaust inventories at the December sales pace.
"All of this reflects a struggle by companies to keep up with strong consumer demand," said Clifford Waldman, an economist at Waldman Associates. "The strength in consumption is almost overpowering the business world."
The Federal Reserve, which has raised interest rates four times since June to slow the roaring economy, is always on the lookout for signs that demand is outpacing supply, a condition that can lead to a sharp increase in prices.
"Businesses are hard pressed to keep up with strong demand," said Mark Vitner, an economist at First Union. "Some retailers and wholesalers have shown a little more pricing power, but it's still pretty small."
The Fed's rate increases have raised borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. But many analysts still say the central bank will increase rates again in March because the economy is growing too rapidly.
Retailers, who last year posted their best holiday shopping season since 1992, reported a 1 percent increase in inventories in December, to $369.2 billion. That followed a 1.4 percent rise in November.
At wholesalers, inventories rose 0.4 percent in December, to $305 billion after a 1.3 percent jump the month before. And, at factories, inventories grew 0.2 percent, to $470.9 billion after a 0.5 percent increase in November.

Fashion Week parties go to the dogs Bonnie Cashin's instant legacy The anti-fur faction's new target is leather.

BYLINE: By Ginia Bellafante 

 BODY:

Fashion Week: So Much for Socializing
At a quarter past midnight last Wednesday, as models in artfully soiled jeans tried to ascend to the Rainbow Room from the ground floor of the G.E. Building, a curious thing happened: they were told no. It wasn't that they were inappropriately attired -- after all, they were heading to the Visionaire party, generally Fashion Week's edgiest event. It was simply too late to let any more people up, the elevator guards announced. Time to go home. 
 Although there were nearly 10 parties given to coincide with the fall 2000 runway collections in New York last week, they were marked by an absence of any real raucousness and, in most instances, an absence of actual fashion people. As one editor put it, "Fashion people don't go to fashion parties." Indeed, they were hard to spot among the 2,000 in attendance at The New York Post's Page Six party held at Gustavino's on Wednesday night. Arie L. Kopelman, the president of Chanel, turned up, but was out the door by 8:30 p.m.
Ever since the New York shows slipped in ahead of the European ones on the semiannual runway calendar, explained Marin Hopper, Elle's fashion director, those in the business have pared down their New York partygoing to save energy for the three weeks of foreign shows, and all the attendant hoopla, ahead.
Ms. Hopper did attend a dinner for Donatella Girombelli, the owner of the Genny and Byblos lines, at the lavish East Side home of Marina Galesi on Tuesday evening. And she showed up at a party at Barneys New York on Thursday evening given by her magazine for a small dog named Sweetie, who arrived, diva style, more than an hour after the party began. Sweetie, a mutt belonging to the designer John Bartlett and Mark Welsh, a former advertising director, has recently been given a humor column in Elle. (Mr. Welsh does the actual writing.) Many people, including Julie Gilhart, the fashion director of Barneys, brought their own dogs to the event. (She has a Jack Russell named Nora.) Others, like Anne Slowey, the fashion news director of Elle, borrowed. Pointing to an albino Jack Russell, Ms. Slowey said, "He's my date."
 
Bonnie Cashin Lives!
Last week, editors could not help remarking at the uncanniness exhibited by certain designers who had references to Bonnie Cashin in their fall 2000 collections.
Ms. Cashin, the revered sportswear designer, died on Feb. 3, an event marked not only by standard newspaper obituaries but also by a page-long appreciation in The Economist. Allusions to Ms. Cashin's work came up in the brass closures Anna Sui used on garments in her show and in the thin, decorative leather strips Marc Jacobs applied to the coats he showed.
The Cashin revival has not been limited to the runways however. Recently, Cesar Padilla and Radford Brown, owners of the downtown vintage shop Cherry, came into possession of a large stock of never-used Bonnie Cashin handbags. Designers have been buying them up, Mr. Brown said. The bags, displayed at the Cherry booth at the Metropolitan Vintage Show in New York last month, completely sold out.
And the Museum of the Fashion Institute of Technology has long been planning a Bonnie Cashin retrospective. It will begin in September of this year and run until January 2001.
 
Throwing Down the Anti-Leather Gauntlet
Despite the paint and tofu throwing by anti-fur protesters that interrupted the New York collections, Ingrid Newkirk, the London-based director of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which took responsibility, maintains that her organization's war on fur is more or less over.
"That was our last hurrah," she said of the protests against three designers last week. Ms. Newkirk believes that the group has won the battle against fur, even though mink has continued to turn up all over runways. No matter. She said that starting today, it will begin a new chapter, with a battle against leather. "This is akin to the environmental movement's launch on toxins years ago," Ms. Newkirk said.
"The new fur war is the leather war," she added. "There's far more leather than fur on the catwalk."
Coinciding with London Fashion Week, which began on Sunday and continues through Thursday, Ms. Newkirk is releasing a documentary on the cruelties suffered by cows in the leather-making process. "The average person will be sickened," she said. Perhaps, or he just may go on eating his hamburger.

HEADLINE: W. A. Andres, 73, Executive Who Led Growth of Dayton Hudson

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
William A. Andres, who led the Dayton Hudson Corporation's expansion from a regional department store chain to a national retailing powerhouse, died Wednesday of lymphoma in Fort Myers, Fla. He was 73.
Under the leadership of Mr. Andres from 1976 through the sharp recession of the early 1980's, Dayton Hudson grew from 400 stores to more than 1,000, and its revenues tripled to $5.6 billion. 
 In 1978, a Forbes cover article said Mr. Andres was "analytical and has a reputation for getting to the heart of matters quickly and decisively." He was the company's first chief executive who was not a member of the Dayton family.
In his boldest bet, Mr. Andres quickly expanded Dayton Hudson's Target chain, correctly predicting that the future of retailing lay in large discount retailers situated mostly outside cities rather than full-priced urban department stores.
Target now provides most of the company's more than $30 billion in annual sales, and on Jan. 30, Dayton Hudson changed its name to the Target Corporation.
Mr. Andres rose rapidly through the ranks at Dayton Hudson. After joining the company as a management trainee selling robes in August 1958, he became a department manager in three months and a vice president less than five years later. By 1968 he was chairman and chief executive of Dayton. He gave up that post when the company bought the J. L. Hudson department store chain one year later.
But his move aside was only temporary. He became president of the combined company in 1974, chief executive in 1976 and chairman in 1977.
Outside the office, Mr. Andres was an avid golfer and gardener, his son Richard said. He was also an accomplished amateur magician.
"He actually put himself through undergraduate school doing magic" in Fayette, Iowa, Richard Andres said. "Magic ran through his whole life." His most memorable trick involved chopping the head off a volunteer with a mock guillotine.
Mr. Andres graduated from Upper Iowa University in 1948 and earned a master's degree at the University of Pittsburgh one year later.
He is survived by Betty, his wife of 52 years; three sons, Robert, of San Diego; Charles, of Brainerd, Minn.; and Richard, of Minnetonka, Minn.; and five grandchildren.
"They had a very strong partnership. It was always, 'Betty and Bill did this. Betty and Bill did that,' " Richard said of his mother and father.

Europeans Move Toward Backing German to Lead the I.M.F.

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14

 BODY:
The European Union appears set to back a German finance ministry official to head the International Monetary Fund, giving a boost to a candidate Clinton administration officials privately argue is ill-suited for the job.
European foreign ministers, meeting in Brussels today, reached an informal consensus that Caio Koch-Weser, 55, a longtime World Bank official who currently serves as a state secretary in the German finance ministry, should succeed Michel Camdessus as director of the monetary fund, German and European Union officials said after the meeting. 
 The French, who had been viewed as cool to Mr. Koch-Weser, issued a statement saying that they would not block a European choice.
The Brussels meeting was a success for Germany, which has sought to foster a sense of inevitability about Mr. Koch-Weser's bid to take over the I.M.F.'s leadership. Though European foreign ministers sent signals today that they had rallied around the German choice, they put off until at least Feb. 28 any official declaration that the European Union would put its political muscle behind his candidacy. That gives Germany two weeks to rally support for him without risking a loss of face by the Europeans if it were unable to do so.
The turn of events is considered a setback for the Clinton administration. It publicly remains neutral on Mr. Koch-Weser. But the administration has made clear that it would prefer that Europe, which has customarily named the head of the monetary fund, find someone who is better known internationally and who has more experience managing currencies and setting overall economic strategy. The quiet disagreement has persisted for four months.
The leadership change at the monetary fund comes at a sensitive time. The fund, which is based in Washington, has more influences than ever before over capitalist-oriented economies worldwide. From Indonesia to Russia, the I.M.F. not only provides billions of dollars in aid and helps shape economic policies, but can also affect the political fortunes of leaders who defy its lending conditions.
Its operations have been under a microscope. The fund has been criticized for mismanaging multibillion-dollar aid programs for Russia and, most recently, Ukraine. Members of Congress have expressed concern that money provided by the fund feeds corruption in those countries.
The Clinton administration has also pushed for changes at the I.M.F. Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers has argued that the fund should focus more on preventing or combating financial emergencies and less on alleviating poverty, a task he says is better handled by the World Bank. Mr. Koch-Weser, who spent 25 years at the World Bank as a specialist in poverty relief, is not regarded as having the right resume to carry out such changes.
Still, the United States and many developing countries are watching from the sidelines as Europe fumbles its way toward nominating a successor to Mr. Camdessus. While there is no ground swell of support for Mr. Koch-Weser, he remains the only public European candidate for the job after months of debate. Germany's steadfast campaign to put him in office appears to be wearing down the French, who had earlier declined to offer any signal they would back Mr. Koch-Weser.
He has also spoken out in his own cause, blaming an arcane political process in Europe for harming his candidacy. In a recent interview, Mr. Koch-Weser said his fluent English and leadership experience at the World Bank made him a good choice to increase political support for the monetary fund at a time it is under pressure to become more responsive to social and environmental issues.
"What the fund needs is a chief executive who can get its message across and increase support," he said. "I do not think it needs a technocrat who is more like a chief financial officer."
While the outcome is still uncertain, it seems increasingly likely that the United States will have to choose between accepting Mr. Koch-Weser or using its standing at the I.M.F. to oppose him, perhaps in alliance with some developing countries. Washington would have to weigh the importance of finding what it considers an ideal candidate for the post against the costs of straining relations with European allies.
A senior administration official said today that the United States would in principle back a European choice for the job, provided that person enjoyed broad support not just in Europe but also in the developing countries.
The signal from Brussels came the same day that Mr. Camdessus, the Frenchman who has led the monetary fund for 13 years, formally retired as managing director. Stanley Fischer, the American who served as the No. 2 I.M.F. official, automatically became acting director.
Mr. Fischer, 56, who has taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has long managed the daily operations of the I.M.F. and has shaped its financial-bailout packages for Asian and Latin American countries in recent years.
"You should not be worried at all about the health and the efficiency of the I.M.F. during this interim period," said Mr. Camdessus, speaking at a conference in Bangkok, Thailand, during his final day on the job.

Investors Scour for Bargains After Last Week's Sell-Off

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks ended higher yesterday as Wall Street scouted for bargains, notably among cyclical stocks, after a sharp sell-off last week that sent the blue-chip Dow index reeling into a correction.
"After all, the Dow is an industrial index and I think the selling last week has prompted a little bargain hunting," said Joseph Barthel, chief investment strategist at Fahnestock & Company in Great Neck, N.Y. "We have had a number of hard down Fridays to be followed on Monday by some bargain hunting." 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 94.63 points, or 0.90 percent, to 10,519.84 after the 30-stock average fell 218.42 points, to 10,425.21 on Friday, losing 538.59 points, or 4.9 percent, for the week.
The slide put the index in what is known as a correction as it fell more than 10 percent -- 11.07 percent to be exact -- from its closing high of 11,722.98 of Jan. 14.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed up 2.82 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,389.94.
The Nasdaq composite index climbed 23.10 points, or 0.52 percent, to 4,418.55, after seesawing most of the session.
"Big blue-chip Dow names are so oversold, they're starting to attract some money away from the Nasdaq," said Harry Laubscher, market analyst at Tucker Anthony. "We're getting a little nibbling."
The Dow's top gainer was the aluminum producer Alcoa, which rose 4 9/6, to 72 1/4, after Reynolds Metals said its shareholders had approved its merger with Alcoa. Reynolds Metals added 5 9/16, to 69 1/8.
Another big Dow mover was Intel, which advanced 4, to 109 7/8, after Dell Computer said it would offer its first desktop personal computer using long-awaited Intel memory chips.
Dell, the second most active stock on the Nasdaq, eased 7/16, to 36 7/16.
Interest-rate sensitive financial stocks mostly ended down at the start of a week that promised several important economic reports and a Congressional appearance by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, on Thursday.
In the Dow, American Express inched up 1/2, to 154, while J. P. Morgan slipped 1/2, to 112 1/8.
The market, which is on interest-rate alert ahead of Mr. Greenspan's comments, did not seem too fazed by news that crude oil futures in New York broke above $30 a barrel, the highest since the Persian Gulf war in January 1991.
In general, Internet and health care companies were down while utilities, automakers, heavy machinery companies and coal producers advanced. Buyouts fueled some of the gains. Shares of the business software provider Computer Associates International dropped 7/16, to 69 5/16, after saying it would pay $4 billion in stock for the business software developer Sterling Software. Sterling rose 1 13/16, to 36 1/4.
Among initial offerings, shares of Diversa shot up 51, to 75, in their first day of trading on Nasdaq after the biotechnology company's shares were priced at $24.

Treasuries Up Again
By The Associated Press
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday for a second consecutive session in lackluster trading.
Investors remained relatively quiet ahead of Mr. Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, scheduled for Thursday before the House Banking Committee.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 18/32, to 100 12/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 6.22 percent from 6.26 percent on Friday.

HEADLINE: Sao Paulo Journal;
Rich Brazilians Rise Above Rush-Hour Jams

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Feb. 14

 BODY:
At night the skyline in this city of 16 million is a dazzling display of lights that can easily remind visitors of Manhattan.
But something is different. Many of the lights are moving. 
 The skies of Sao Paulo, Latin America's financial capital and the richest big city in the developing world, are filled with helicopters.
Like a fleet of airborne limousines, the helicopters are increasingly used by privileged Paulistanos to commute, attend meetings, even run errands and go to church. Helicopter landing pads are now standard features of many of Sao Paulo's guarded residential compounds and high-rise roofs.
Illustrating what may be a Blade Runner-esque glimpse of the future in metropolises where rich and poor are crammed together, helicopters are the vehicle of choice for more than just their convenience. Many of the roads here are hopelessly clogged with traffic. Carjackings, kidnappings of executives and roadside robberies have become a part of the risks of daily life for anyone perceived to have money.
So the demand for private helicopters in Sao Paulo has turned the city into one of the most vibrant markets for helicopter dealers.
For pilots, navigating the city by air is like flying through an endless concrete maze. "My favorite time to fly is at night, because the sensation is equaled only in movies or in dreams," said Moacir da Silva, the president of the Sao Paulo Helicopter Pilots Association. "The lights are everywhere, as if I were flying within a Christmas tree."
At 400 and growing, the total fleet of private helicopters in Sao Paulo is the biggest of any city in the developing world. Although the fleets in New York and Tokyo are larger, the helicopters in those cities are owned mostly by corporations, not rich individuals.
Moreover, the growth of the Sao Paulo fleet has quickened in recent years, even with the slowdown in Brazil's economy after the currency devaluation crisis a year ago.
While Brazil's economy grew less than 1 percent in 1999, the nation's helicopter fleet rose more than 7 percent, to nearly 800. Most of that growth was here.
"Sao Paulo commands the most favorable characteristics of any city in the world for the civil helicopter industry," said Fabrice Cagnat, the president of the Brazilian subsidiary of Eurocopter, a venture between DaimlerChrysler and Aerospatiale of France.
The most favorable is the traffic, a byproduct of Sao Paulo's haphazard expansion in recent decades as millions of migrants from poorer parts of Brazil moved here in search of work. Roads were never sufficiently expanded to accommodate the swelling population. Subway lines can barely handle a fraction of the residents, and an efficient freeway system remains a distant dream.
With the city's crazy-quilt layout that is part Los Angeles, because of sheer horizontal breadth, and part Manhattan, because skyscrapers are so numerous, navigating by car is daunting.
"Money is time, and the time lost in traffic is substantial," said Marco Antonio Audi, the Brazil representative for Robinson Helicopters, which is based in Torrance, Calif.
The use of helicopters to avoid traffic has grown to the point where some people use their choppers to commute daily to work or to retreat to their country estates or beach homes every few days.
"One member of my congregation regularly comes to Sabbath service by helicopter to escape the horrendous Friday night traffic," said Henry Sobel, the senior rabbi of Sao Paulo's largest synagogue.
The most affordable and best-selling helicopter in Brazil is the Robinson R44, which can comfortably seat three or four people. It costs about $380,000, or roughly 90 times the average annual income of a Sao Paulo resident. Another popular model is the Bell 407, which seats as many as seven people and costs about $1.5 million.
"Why settle for an armored BMW when you can afford a helicopter?" said Eric Wasson, a Latin American sales representative for Bell Helicopter of Fort Worth, Tex.
The helicopters of Sao Paulo are not universally admired. Critics consider them an obscene barometer of the financial power enjoyed by the affluent few in a sea of poverty. According to the World Bank, Brazil's richest 10 percent control more than 50 percent of the country's wealth while the poorest 10 percent control less than 1 percent.
It is easier for a wealthy person to buy a helicopter than it is for a working-class person to buy a car. Rich Paulistanos have access to financing that often is substantially cheaper than domestic lending rates, and more financing options are emerging. Debis, the financing arm of DaimlerChrysler, recently opened an office here that will largely focus on helicopter deals.
The contrasts are not lost on the vast majority of people in Sao Paulo who cannot afford a helicopter.
"One of the contradictions of the Brazilian character is the capacity for great warmth to coexist with an extreme individualism," said Renato Janine Ribeiro, a professor of political philosophy at the University of Sao Paulo. "The desire for a helicopter is a result of a complete lack of concern for other people."
Others see the helicopters as a symbol of a worsening class distinction in Brazil.
"That there is an archipelago of wealthy consumers that is able to use helicopters just as their counterparts do in Manhattan or Bombay or wherever doesn't surprise me," said Jorge Wilheim, an urban planner. "But the ocean of people surrounding this archipelago should be getting the transportation services they need, and they are not."
Compared with the several hundred people in the city who are able to commute by helicopter, about 3.7 million residents resort to the city's precarious bus system each day, according to municipal figures. Riding the city's 10,400 buses is not only uncomfortable but often dangerous, because of the high risk of muggings. So unlicensed minivans have grown popular as a way to get around.
Earlier this month, when three people were killed and eight injured when a minivan driver fled from the police and hit a tree, one newspaper said in a front-page editorial, "No one controls the city."
While travel on the ground remains quite dangerous, there have been few accidents involving helicopters in the city.
Mr. Wilheim said Sao Paulo would need to extend its subway by six miles each year in the next decade for the public transportation system to approach those of Paris or New York. Yet there is little impetus from the authorities to make such plans when spending is restricted. A result of Sao Paulo's lackadaisical approach to public transportation is an assault on the ears of residents.
In some parts of the city, the honking horns of bottlenecks and sirens of police vehicles weaving through traffic is joined by the almost incessant sound of helicopters whizzing by. The Sao Paulo Helicopter Pilots Association says about 100 helicopters fly above the city at any given time during the day.
"I can't stand helicopters," said Paula Doria, a 21-year-old student, "because I live next to an apartment building with a heliport, and the noise is incredible." Still, she said, "If I had enough money to buy a helicopter I would, because it's a way to escape from crime."
Visually, the helicopter traffic is an added feature that can make some of Sao Paulo's more crowded districts, already adorned with huge television advertising screens and multilingual billboards, resemble a scene from "Blade Runner," the 1982 movie about a rain-soaked, futuristic Los Angeles.
Just as a wealthy elite seeks private-sector solutions for its problems in "Blade Runner," Sao Paulo's powerful are increasingly turning to private companies for services normally in the public sphere, like security, education and transportation.
James Thurston Lynch, a former banker at Chase Manhattan, understands this well. Mr. Lynch, a Brazilian who now has his own investment firm, plans to buy 100 helicopters for a part ownership program similar to the system that people use to share private jets in the United States.
Mr. Lynch, who intends to sign up 1,000 people to buy shares in his fleet, said, "I hope to democratize use of the helicopter."

HEADLINE: 3 Charged in Kickback Scheme At Long Island Housing Agency

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: UNIONDALE, N.Y., Feb. 14

 BODY:
A former maintenance supervisor for the Hempstead Housing Authority was charged today with forcing companies to pay kickbacks totaling more than $35,000 in return for contracts to repair the agency's buildings.
In Federal District Court here, prosecutors charged the ex-supervisor, James W. Graydon, 61, and two others, James McKay, 53, the former director of public information for the Economic Opportunity Commission of Nassau County, and David Delvalle, 43, a contractor from Valley Stream who did repairs and maintenance work at the village of Hempstead's public housing developments. 
 The three are accused of submitting inflated bills totaling $159,000 to the Housing Authority that included the cash kickbacks, said Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York.
Investigators said Mr. Graydon, who was arrested by federal agents this morning at his Uniondale home, had told contractors that if they wanted to do any work for the Housing Authority, they had to pay him.
Ms. Lynch said the contractors would then inflate their bills to the Housing Authority by the amount that they needed to pay off Mr. Graydon. The kickbacks, which began in 1994 and continued for two years, usually ranged from $1,500 to $2,000 per contract, but some were as high as $5,100, Ms. Lynch said.
Mr. McKay, a Roslyn Heights resident who was arrested several weeks ago on a related complaint charging him and Mr. Graydon with conspiring to solicit bribes, has since been charged with conspiracy to commit extortion. If convicted, he faces a maximum prison term of 20 years and a fine of $250,000.
Mr. Graydon faces a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He and Mr. McKay were charged today with soliciting bribes.
Mr. Delvalle, who surrendered for today's arraignment, is charged with making unlawful bribe payments and filing a false tax return. He faces 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. All three defendants have pleaded not guilty and remain free on their own recognizance.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
Oil Price Exceeds $30 a Barrel For the First Time Since 1991

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The price of crude oil jumped to more than $30 a barrel yesterday for the first time since the 1991 Persian Gulf war, and a sharp run-up in gasoline prices looks increasingly likely this summer.
The price of crude oil neared $30 in mid-January, slipped and then rallied again last week. All the time, traders were weighing concerns about declining inventories of crude oil, home heating oil and gasoline against the possibility of a production increase from major oil producers when they meet at the end of March. 
 As new data showed some inventories tightening last week, only promises of increased production by unnamed OPEC officials kept the price of crude oil from piercing $30. But several reports yesterday put a damper on the prospect of a production increase, and the $30 barrier was breached. The price of crude oil for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped 81 cents, to $30.25 a barrel.
Of course, new comments from OPEC officials holding out the hope of production increases could depress the price again. In fact, yesterday's comments contradicted what appeared to be clear signals last week that Venezuela and Saudi Arabia would ask for an increase by June at a meeting of OPEC countries at the end of next month.
Even if the producers relent, the production cuts that began last March -- equal to 4.3 million barrels a day -- may have already set the stage for a sharp rise in gasoline prices later this year and a stronger political response from the United States and Europe.
"If OPEC eases in June, it's too late," said Irene King, senior oil markets analyst for J. P. Morgan & Company, referring to peak gasoline demand in the summer. Because of the lag time between increased crude oil production and the refining of gasoline, she said, "we will have to go through the early summer driving season with very low gasoline inventories; that would make the heating oil squeeze we had a few weeks ago look like a piece of cake."
Retail gasoline prices, according to the Department of Energy, rose to $1.356 a gallon this week, up 48 percent in the last year and the highest since late 1990.
In the futures market, the price of unleaded gasoline for March delivery rose 2.3 cents yesterday, to 83.41 cents a gallon. Gasoline is now above the price of home heating oil, which rose 1.5 cents, to 75.70 cents a gallon yesterday. But it is far below the 95.20 cents a gallon price of Jan. 31.
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has no plans now to dip into the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, although he is being pressed to do so by Northeastern politicians, including Sen. Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. A spokesman for the Energy Department said yesterday that this was "not an option in the current environment and the last four words are key." The weather has moderated in the Northeast, reducing concern about home heating oil inventories. But in California, where gasoline prices are a concern to the state's many drivers, the prices could be thrust into the spotlight as its presidential primary nears.
Mr. Richardson is scheduled to meet with energy officials in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait at the end of the month, but had to cancel a meeting with Venezuelan oil officials because of a scheduling conflict.
Anticipating what OPEC and the price of oil are going to do is complex in part because of politics, both in OPEC and the United States. The Iranian elections are this week, and some analysts have said that OPEC wants to look determined to bolster oil prices to help moderates win there. An OPEC that bowed to the West by increasing production, analysts argue, could be used against the moderates. In addition, the United States does not want to threaten Saudi Arabia and lose its support, which could happen if the Clinton administration dipped into the the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
It is also possible that OPEC members would argue for a production increase only after the price of crude topped $30 a barrel and world inventories fell. At this point, they may find it easier to persuade members that a modest production increase of about a million barrels a day would not send crude oil prices tumbling.
But even if this is the goal, analysts say, OPEC leaders like Saudi Arabia do not want oil prices to climb too quickly. A sharp rise could prompt a stronger reaction from United States and European leaders who have to worry about the impact of higher prices on consumers, voters and the economy. So the recent comments from OPEC officials may have been intended to keep the price of crude oil from rising too fast.
A report from Venezuela helped jar the oil market yesterday, said James R. Steel, an energy analyst at Refco Inc. Alvaro Silva, the vice oil minister of Venezuela, told Dow Jones newswires that there were no plans to ask for a crude oil production increase at the March OPEC meeting. His comments contradicted the signal Friday of a production increase from an unnamed Venezuelan official. Dow Jones also reported that Shokri Ghanem, the director of OPEC's research division, said that "support is growing among OPEC members for an extension of the cuts" beyond March. And over the weekend, Iraq repeated its threats to cut its oil production.
"This is really pouring cold water on this idea that took hold last week that Saudi Arabia would allow a production increase," Mr. Steel said.
The sharp decline in inventories of crude oil and products showed up in a report by the International Energy Agency on Friday.
The report said inventories among the 29 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were the lowest since February 1997.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: MICHIGAN;
Trail Leads to a Transformed State

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: TROY, Mich., Feb. 14

 BODY:
The popular perception that Michigan elections are still dominated by legions of auto workers toting lunch pails is as dated as a Chevrolet Citation.
Here, as in New Hampshire and South Carolina, a new economy, in which auto workers wear white collars, has generated a new electorate, whose party affiliations are loose and whose votes are hard to predict. Those voters have already helped change Michigan politics in recent years, and, according to the latest polls, they could be crucial in determining who wins the state's Republican presidential primary on Tuesday of next week. 
 The new, high-tech professionals are people like Joel Gibson, a 26-year-old car-engine software programmer whose father, grandfather and great-grandmother were all auto factory workers and staunch Democrats.
"I lean Republican, but I like to look at each individual candidate," said Mr. Gibson, who is taken with former Senator Bill Bradley and Senator John McCain.
The new workers tend to vote Republican in state and local elections, but they have proved unpredictable in contests for national office.
"They may identify themselves as Republicans, but when they pull that curtain, the independent streak kicks in, much to my chagrin," said one Republican officeholder, L. Brooks Patterson, the Oakland County executive.
Mr. Patterson knows those voters well, because it is here in Oakland County, in Detroit's northwestern suburbs, that they tend to make their homes. Macomb County, which lies along Oakland's eastern boundary and is characterized by strip malls and small ranch-style houses, remains the home of the so-called Reagan Democrats -- union workers attracted to the Republicans' appeal to traditional values. But Oakland County has dozens of auto engineering centers that have sprung up in rows of new, tinted-glass office towers as starkly anonymous as any in Silicon Valley, and tens of thousands of the new workers live here.
Dotted with small lakes surrounded by beautiful homes, crisscrossed by freeways increasingly lined by those engineering centers, Oakland County has 1.2 million people to Macomb's 770,000, and is growing twice as fast.
"Oakland is where many of these people live, and is going to be a battleground going into the future," said Jennifer Granholm, a Democrat who won election as state attorney general in 1998, partly by doing well in the county.
Ms. Granholm is a fairly recent arrival, having grown up in San Francisco. Other recent arrivals, including many engineers, have more than offset the constant stream of retirees moving south and have raised the state's population to almost 10 million, from 9.3 million in 1990.
Politicians and pollsters from across the political spectrum describe the new workers similarly: conservative on economic issues, particularly in their skepticism about government regulation, but moderate on social policy. They have helped Republicans take control of both houses of the Legislature as well as the governor's mansion.
But they have also been willing to vote for some Democrats in national elections: Bill Clinton beat former Senator Bob Dole in Oakland County in 1996, and nearly beat President George Bush here in 1992. That inclination has increasingly made them the swing voters in a state that is among the nation's most evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans.
"They're the ones who come across and vote for the Democrats who win in Michigan," said Robert Teeter, a Republican pollster in Ann Arbor.
To be sure, Macomb County, with its Reagan Democrats, was once regarded as the capital of Michigan's swing voter. But the changing face of the work force has brought a changing face to the electorate. The number of unionized industrial workers as a proportion of all voters in the state has dropped by nearly half in the last two decades, to between 6 and 9 percent, pollsters say.
Auto production remains the state's dominant industry, but auto makers and auto parts companies are changing the way they do business. For instance, while much of the actual manufacturing has either been automated or moved to Southern states and overseas, to take advantage of lower wages elsewhere, all but 8 of the nation's 200 auto parts engineering centers are now in Michigan instead of being scattered across the Midwest.
The nation's long economic expansion has been particularly good to the highly cyclical auto industry, like a prolonged return to the early 1960's, before auto makers' profits were crippled by foreign competition and, arguably, government safety and environmental regulations. The arts are flourishing in Detroit, with the opening of a cavernous opera house and the restoration of a magnificent symphony hall. Housing prices have been rising faster across this metropolitan area than almost anywhere else in the country.
Further, an acute shortage of skilled labor has kept Michigan's unemployment rate below the national average since 1995. The state's rate was just 3.6 percent in December, and the state government plans to start spending as much money advertising for engineers to move here from other states as it previously spent persuading businesses to locate here.
Michigan's shift in employment toward white-collar jobs has occurred on a massive scale. The number of unionized auto workers in Michigan has plunged to fewer than 250,000 now from 479,000 in 1980. But total employment in the auto industry, the state says, has only inched down, to 471,000 from 507,000 two decades ago, and actually grew in the 1990's.
In Pontiac, several miles west of here, General Motors recently gutted and remodeled two assembly plants with the combined floor space of the Empire State Building, turning them into offices and laboratories for 8,500 engineers. G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler can afford such grandiose undertakings: they were the world's three largest companies in 1998, in terms of sales and share of global economic output.
A statewide poll by The Detroit Free Press a week ago found that in the race for the Republican primary next week -- the Democrats are holding presidential nominating caucuses in March -- Senator McCain and Gov. George W. Bush were evenly matched if Democrats and independents voted in fairly large numbers, while Governor Bush was ahead among Republicans alone.
The poll also showed that Senator McCain enjoyed a sizable advantage in Macomb County, partly because of Reagan Democrats, while Governor Bush commanded strong support in western Michigan, where abortion opponents are numerous and active and have been leery of the senator. Oakland County was a tossup if Democrats and independents were included, while Governor Bush prevailed if only Republicans were counted.
One issue on which Mr. Bush could ultimately prove vulnerable here is government regulation. Michigan Republicans regularly deride Vice President Al Gore for saying in his book, "Earth in the Balance," that the internal combustion engine's contribution to global warming is "a mortal threat to the security of every nation that is more deadly than that of any military enemy we are ever again likely to confront." The Republicans are eager to attack Mr. Gore relentlessly on the issue should he win the Democratic nomination.
But whether they would be much able to do so with Mr. Bush as the Republican nominee is uncertain. Criticized by environmentalists in New England television advertisements this autumn, Mr. Bush announced in New Hampshire in December that he had asked Texas regulators to consider adopting California's new auto pollution rules, which are stricter than the federal government's and are particularly tough on high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.
The regulators held hearings on the idea during the week of the New Hampshire primary, and the conservative Detroit News sent a reporter to Texas to cover them. The resulting article emphasized that G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler sold 90 percent of Texas' sport utilities and pickup trucks, and ran under a big headline that said, "Bush Cleanup Plan to Cut Truck Sales."
But beyond environmental regulation lies the broader landscape of a changing work force and changing politics here. Dwayne F. Davidson, a 41-year-old G.M. manager of computer-aided design, is a Republican leaning toward Governor Bush, trusting him to keep government small. Mr. Davidson agrees on few political issues with his father, a lifelong Democrat who spent 30 years welding car body panels in the same giant building in Pontiac where the son now oversees the design of sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.
"I've hung out with Republicans, I golf with Republicans," Mr. Davidson said. "It has kind of rubbed off."

HEADLINE: State Power Authority in $800 Million Deal to Sell 2 Nuclear Power Plants

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
The New York Power Authority announced yesterday that it had tentatively agreed to sell the only two nuclear power plants owned by the state to Entergy Corporation.
The Power Authority plants are the Indian Point 3 power station in Buchanan, 35 miles north of Manhattan on the east bank of the Hudson River, and the James A. FitzPatrick plant on Lake Ontario. 
 The planned sale is the latest in a string of moves in the nuclear power industry that is leading a rising proportion of the country's 103 operating nuclear plants to be operated or owned by just a few companies.
The shift has some environmental groups and New York legislators concerned that intensified cost cutting, as the industry consolidates, could lead to safety problems. Officials at the Power Authority and at Entergy said the plants' sale would help lower the cost of electricity and not increase risks.
Entergy, a private company in New Orleans, is also in a tentative deal to lease and operate two other nuclear plants in New York, Nine Mile Point 1 and 2, and is seeking to buy other plants in the Northeast.
The company has agreed to pay $638 million over seven years for the Power Authority's two plants, as well as another $168 million, also spread over seven years, for nuclear fuel stockpiles.
Under the deal, the Power Authority, a quasi-independent agency, would pay for most of the costs of decommissioning the plants when Entergy officials felt they had reached the end of their useful, or profitable life, Power Authority officials said.
A fund of $630 million has been set aside for closing the plants, which is projected to grow to $1.9 billion before the plants are shut down, said Jack Murphy, a spokesman for the authority. Any additional decommissioning costs would be the responsibility of the buyer, he said.
Experts in nuclear safety had a mixed reaction to the announcement, which had been expected for several months. Environmental Advocates, a private lobbying group in Albany, released a statement criticizing Entergy for cutting corners in maintenance and inspection programs at its Southern plants, and incurring federal fines in several cases.
But David Lochbaum, a nuclear safety engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private group in Washington, said, "I don't think the sale of the plant is a safety issue."
Mr. Lochbaum said that the pressures to cut costs at power plants are rising regardless of ownership, and that Entergy had a good record of reliability and safety.
"The real issue is that these plants are going to have to produce electricity at economical rates or they won't survive," he said. In many cases, he added, that may not be possible, and the pressure to cut costs may result in safety problems.
Richard L. Brodsky, the Westchester Democrat who chairs the State Assembly's Environmental Conservation Committee, said he planned to convene hearings to examine the proposed deal.
The sale needs the approval of the Power Authority's trustees, who are appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki, as well as the approval of Entergy's board, the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other government agencies.

HEADLINE: At Sugar Refinery, A Melting-Pot Strike;
Workers of Many Nations Besiege Brooklyn Relic of Industrial Age

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
They call themselves a league of nations, this group of workers who trudge day after day outside the Domino Sugar refinery, a Brooklyn landmark that towers like a fortress over the East River, a monument to New York's great industrial past.
The workers, 300 men and women from Poland, Italy, Jamaica and a dozen other nations, have defied the scorching summer sun and winter winds since going on strike eight months ago, resisting concessions demanded by the refinery, one of the last large manufacturing plants in Brooklyn. 
As the strikers march down the largely deserted sidewalks of Brooklyn's once-thriving waterfront, they often complain of being forgotten, of becoming orphans of the labor movement. They say their parent union, the International Longshoremen's Association, has done little to draw attention to their cause, while New York City's labor leaders, with their focus on Manhattan and on faster-growing fields like health care, have provided scant support.
Despite this perceived lack of help and despite their differing backgrounds, ages and accents, the strikers have stuck it out and stuck together. In an extraordinary show of solidarity, not one of them has crossed the picket line, although one worker, a Russian immigrant, killed himself.
Although the number of strikers is not large, the Domino dispute has turned into a classic labor standoff between a blue-collar work force intent on defending the protections and benefits it took decades to gain and a company that insists it needs to cut costs to remain competitive.
Domino's parent, Tate & Lyle of London, one of the world's largest producers of sweeteners, says that to keep costs down it needs to lay off 100 workers, weaken seniority rules and end a guarantee of full-time work. Managers are also insisting on reducing the sick days allowed and taking away many holidays.
"I hate them," said Migdonia Espinosa, a refinery worker for 25 years, while walking the picket line. "Dedication means nothing to them. We're just numbers to them. They act like we're asking for the world. We're asking for nothing. We just want job security and seniority."
From the Williamsburg Bridge, two blocks south, the strikers look like placard-carrying ants as they huddle next to the refinery, an 11-story brick mass built in 1858 and described by one architectural guidebook as a "bulky, bold and brutal" behemoth. With its rooftop sign, which screams "Domino" in large red neon letters, the building seems to boast of a time when New York City, led by this refinery, dominated the nation's sugar trade, refining most of the sugar for American households.
Along the refinery's massive eastern wall, a makeshift tent protects the strikers from rain, and a poorly heated trailer gives them some semblance of warmth during breaks from picketing. Nonetheless, Robert Shelton, a utility laborer, said that when the temperature fell to single digits in January, there was no escaping the cold, despite layers of clothing.
"We were out there, and we were cold," Mr. Shelton said. "Our feet were cold. Our hands were cold. Sometimes the way the wind whips off the river, it feels like 35 below. The only thing that kept us going was we didn't want them to think the cold was going to stop us. They're always looking for weakness."
As he talked, his face had an eerie, almost summery glow. But then he explained that he slathers his face with Vaseline each morning to prevent windburn.
Even worse than the cold, Mr. Shelton said, was having to celebrate Christmas while on strike. "My 13-year-old girl told me, 'I hope you can go back to work so we can have a nice Christmas,' " he said. "It was the first time in my life I couldn't afford a Christmas tree. I just couldn't afford the $20, $30 for that."
The strikers, whose base pay is $600 a week, are getting by with weekly unemployment insurance checks of $360, but mostly through the moral support they give each other. (The parent union provides no strike benefits.) But they dread the day late this month when their unemployment checks will run out.
"We can sure use some more support from the outside," said Albert Maddox, 59, a mechanic. He stood a few yards from a tombstone-like marker, labeled "R.I.P. John Alschen," that the workers erected in memory of a 62-year-old striker. The man committed suicide in December, convinced that he would be laid off by Domino and would never find another job, his son said.
One factor that has perhaps encouraged the strikers, most of whom have worked at Domino for more than 15 years, to dig in is the realization that finding other jobs, especially jobs that pay as well, will not be easy in light of their limited education and skills.
The New York City Central Labor Council, the city's union federation, recently began taking steps to help the strikers. To sustain them, it has raised money, $9,000 so far, and set up a food bank, although some strikers wonder what took so long. Brian McLaughlin, the labor council's president, said the city's labor leaders had not done more because Longshoremen officials had not asked them to, but union officials said they had. "We will do anything and everything possible to help them," Mr. McLaughlin said.
Officials from the parent Longshoremen's union said they were already helping, by providing the trailer and expertise in the negotiations.
"It's a shame that a strike of this size in New York City is going on with barely a ripple," said Greg Tarpinian, president of the Labor Research Association, a New York consulting group. "For a group of workers to be on strike for this long without becoming a cause celebre in New York, the stronghold of the nation's labor movement, that's a problem."
The workers have a hard time explaining the chemistry that has held them together like glue.
"We're practically a United Nations," said Charles Milan, 59, a mechanic and shop steward. "We've got people from the Caribbean, Europe, Poland, Yugoslavia, Italy, Hispanics, blacks, Southern blacks. We have a Rainbow Coalition here. May I add that we get along beautifully. If the outside world got along the way we get along, it would be a much better world."
But the workers do not get along with Tate & Lyle's management. For months, the negotiations, despite the help of federal mediators, have been stuck in neutral, although union leaders say they occasionally slide into reverse.
Management has repeatedly told the union that it needs to shrink its work force because industry profits are down and import quotas are limiting the amount of sugar the refinery can get to process. In addition, Tate & Lyle says it will need far fewer workers because the company is starting to ship semiprocessed sugar in liquid containers to the Brooklyn refinery, rather than the traditional unrefined sugar.
"We're one of the last remaining manufacturing companies in Brooklyn, and we need to make changes and update our refining operations in order to remain a viable company on the Brooklyn waterfront," said Margaret Blamberg, a spokeswoman for Tate & Lyle.
Joe Crimi, the union's chief negotiator, said the Longshoremen would accept some layoffs or cost-cutting measures, but he insisted that any layoffs had to be by seniority. What he objects to most, he said, is that Tate & Lyle seems to be coming at the union with a meat cleaver.
"They want to take our 59-page contract and delete it down to 5 pages," said Mr. Crimi, vice president of Local 1814. "They're trying to eliminate everything we've gained at the bargaining table over 50 years. It's a disgrace. They want to get rid of seniority. Under the scenario the company has painted, the workers don't have a choice but to hold out."
He said Tate & Lyle's bargaining demands were so aggressive that they suggested that the management was trying to break the union. Tate & Lyle developed a hard-line reputation during a three-year labor dispute that began in 1992, when it locked out 750 workers at a corn sweetener plant in Decatur, Ill. Ultimately, the company broke the union there.
But Ms. Blamberg said the Brooklyn dispute was different. "It's absolutely not true that Tate & Lyle is out to break the union," she said. "Our goal is to work with the union to accomplish change and to make our facility more viable." She added that the company was not seeking to end all seniority.
This is the second grueling strike at the refinery since 1988, when Tate & Lyle bought Domino and its parent company, Amstar. The Domino factory was built by the Havemeyer family, which gave the dazzling Havemeyer collection to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. They grew fabulously wealthy in the decades after the Civil War because New York, led by the family's Brooklyn refinery, processed more than 60 percent of the nation's sugar, filling the vacuum left by the North's destruction of most of the refineries in the South.
The workers proudly assert that their strike has taken a toll on Tate & Lyle. They say the refinery, which continues to be operated by managers and some temporary replacement workers, is processing only about one-tenth of its normal output of four million pounds of sugar a day.
Mr. Crimi said a surprising development last week might push Tate & Lyle to settle. Workers at its Louisiana refinery, one of its three American cane refineries, went on strike, further straining the company's ability to meet its customers' demands.
Assessing the Brooklyn situation, Ms. Blamberg said, "We continue to be hopeful it will be resolved as soon as possible."
But Bruno Zub, a mechanic from Poland, was more pessimistic. "Things are getting worse and worse," he said. "But we can hold out to the end. We have to do this to the end."

HEADLINE: George Jackson, Movie Producer, Dies at 42

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
George Jackson, who grew up in Harlem to become a movie producer, record company executive and Internet company founder, died yesterday at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital. He was 42.
Mr. Jackson died after a stroke a week earlier, said Frank Cooper, his business partner. 
 For the last year, Mr. Jackson and his partners had been working in a loft on West 26th Street in Manhattan to create a series of Web sites, called the Urban Box Office Network, aimed at minorities. The first of the Internet sites is expected to go online on Feb. 29. An article in the company's newsletter said that Mr. Jackson had a "25-hour-a-day dedication" to the Internet venture.
Mr. Jackson helped produce "New Jack City," a 1991 movie that portrayed the rise and fall of a drug dealer in Harlem. When fights among youths broke out at movie theaters around the country where the film was playing, Mr. Jackson and his partner, Doug McHenry, defended their movie, saying it carried an antidrug, antiviolence message. In an opinion article in The New York Times, the two men wrote, "The real cause of violence at the theaters is not cinematic images of drug culture but decades of poverty in our communities."
"New Jack City," which brought in $50 million in box office sales in the United States, was the most successful film produced by Jackson-McHenry Entertainment. The company produced 12 films in the late 1980's and early 1990's. Others included "A Thin Line Between Love and Hate" and "Krush Groove," the first major movie to focus on hip-hop and rap.
In 1997, Polygram hired Mr. Jackson to be president and chief executive of Motown Records. At the record company, Mr. Jackson helped promote such artists as 98 Degrees and the Temptations. He left Motown after about a year when the Seagram Company bought Polygram.
In January 1999, Mr. Jackson had dinner with two friends, Mr. Cooper and Adam Kidron, at the Mayflower Hotel in Manhattan. The three came up with an idea for an Internet company aimed at urban minorities, a group they felt was not being served by other start-ups. They wrote out their plan on a napkin.
A year later, Urban Box Office Network has 175 employees and plans 30 Web sites, ranging from one devoted to hip-hop music to another catering to young Latinos.
On the morning of Feb. 2, Mr. Jackson, an energetic man who weighed more than 300 pounds, attended a meeting at the company, but then left because he did not feel well. On his way home, Mr. Jackson asked the cab driver to take him to the hospital, said David Jaye, the company's spokesman. He fell unconscious and never woke up.
Mr. Jackson was born in Harlem on Jan. 6, 1958. He attended the Monsignor Kelly School, a private school for talented children, many of whom came from poor families. He graduated from Fordham Preparatory School in 1976, and obtained a degree in sociology and economics from Harvard College in 1980. At Harvard, Mr. Jackson played football.
He began his career at Procter & Gamble, where he worked for two years in marketing and sales. He then went to Universal Pictures. And from 1984 to 1986 he worked for Richard Pryor's production company, Indigo, which was part of Columbia Pictures, where he was executive vice president of production.
He also worked on projects with, among others, LL Cool J, Russell Simmons, Ice-T, Wesley Snipes and Mario Van Peebles.
Mr. Jackson was on the board at De La Salle Academy, a private school for children in the sixth to eighth grades. He helped found the academy on West 97th Street with his former teacher, Brother Brian Carty, and other alumni from Monsignor Kelly School. The school accepts 135 talented children from low-income families.
Mr. Jackson is survived by his wife, Yuko; a daughter, Kona Rose; his mother, Henrietta Hogan Jackson Stancil; a sister, Dr. Sharon Jackson, of Silver Spring, Md.; and a brother, Bobbie E. Stancil, of Boston.
Clarence Avant, the former chairman of Motown Records, said Mr. Jackson never lost sight of where he grew up.
"He never forgot Harlem," Mr. Avant said. "Sometimes guys can go to Harvard and forget. George understood the street."

HEADLINE: Their Way: Short, but Straight Down the Fairway

BYLINE: By CHARLES McGRATH 

 BODY:
SOME of the happiest people I know are the retired folks who have made a home-away-from-home, a sort of earthly Valhalla, at their local golf course. I hope to join them one day, and though I haven't asked, I'm pretty sure they'll have me. They're not choosy.
The people I have in mind are not country club types; nor are they the well-heeled snowbirds who have taken up roosts along the fairways of Hilton Head or Palm Springs, or even those hordes of savvy pensioners who unloaded the family homestead at the top of the market and got a good deal on a Myrtle Beach condo with a greenside view and a golf cart in the driveway. Those people are all happy, too, but I suspect they take their happiness for granted. 
 The people I'm talking about beam with contentment. "It's like dying and going to heaven," one of them, a retired chauffeur named Vin, explained to me once. "I never wait for a tee time." (Well, of course he never waits for a tee time; he gets to play on weekdays. Even heaven is crowded on Saturday and Sunday.)
You find my kind of retirees at municipal courses and scruffy nine-holers; at my favorite haunts in southeastern Massachusetts, for example: Wampanoag, a k a Swampanoag, where, I have sometimes heard it claimed, mosquito repellent was developed; Hidden Hollow, a time capsule from the 1950's, where drives from the first tee sometimes ricochet off a fossilized gravel mound; and Pine Valley, the other Pine Valley, where some of the most challenging hazards are the giant pylons holding up high-tension wires.
The golfers I have in mind are the ones you see in the clubhouse -- golf caps pushed back on their seamed and tanned foreheads -- playing pinochle and rummy late into the afternoon, without a cell phone or a pager in sight. They always seem to know the starter and the rangers, because in many cases they are the starter and the rangers, willing to put in a few part-time hours in exchange for a break on greens fees.
They also economize by never, ever paying for a golf ball. Their eyes may be going, but they can still disappear into the woods and emerge 50 yards later with pockets bulging. They will find your ball for you when you have given up, and they will throw in a couple of extras. Many of them also have extra-long aluminum ball retrievers, which they patiently dip into the drink, like herons probing for minnows; they never fail to turn up a shiny morsel or two.
When they open their car trunks at the end of the day to stow their gear, you can see, stashed behind the spare tire, buckets and buckets of barely used Titleists, Top-Flites, Wilsons, even some of those extra-costly Nike balls -- the ones guaranteed to fly straight. Imagine what's in their basements: coffee cans, laundry baskets, trash barrels -- all brimming with dimpled white eggs. They're like underground hatcheries.
Have I mentioned that these golfers seldom lose a ball of their own? That's because, with time on their hands, calmness in their hearts and mellowness sluicing through their brainpans, they have made the discovery that only comes with maturity: straight is better than long. Though self-taught, most of them, retired players are good. At a little nine-holer, I once went around twice with a retired electrician so old and frail-seeming that I thought he might evaporate in the heat -- just vanish, leaving a puddle of golf clothes on the fairway. He wound up shooting a 73, which could easily have been a 71 had he not missed a couple of two-footers I tried to give him. (That's another thing: retired golfers don't cheat; they don't need to.)
Here is how you know you're not ready to become a retired golfer: you are so stupid, so filled with rage and yearning and delusion, that you still want to crush the ball. You know it's wrong, but you do it anyway. Good sense will come, as surely as the Social Security checks will. In the meantime, I have been studying and classifying some of the basic retiree golf swings:
1. The Propeller. Actually, I have seen this only once, used by a guy named Ralph, but it was so remarkable that it deserves special mention. Ralph wristed his club around so that it passed right in front of his head and was pointing, upside down, back at the target; then, as if powered by a rubber band, he unwound the club back the other way. Rrrrrp -- 150 yards, right down the middle.
2. The Phone Booth. Probably the most familiar of all retired swing patterns. The backswing and the follow-through are almost equidistant, about 18 inches on each side. No matter what club is used, all shots hit this way tend to go the same distance, but so what -- they are straight as string.
3. The Folding Ruler. Often used by women, this is a sound technique for men as well. Contrary to the preachments of Hogan, Harmon, Ledbetter et al., the left side is allowed to collapse, in pieces -- leg, arm, wrists -- until the club is neatly stashed away, out of sight and out of mind; then, click, click, click, the process is reversed and there the club head is again, squarely smacking the ball.
4. The Sneak Attack. Good for golfers whose paunches get in the way. The club is taken back slowly, out and around the distended area, and then, before the rest of the body knows what's going on, the canny retired brain instructs the hands to lash the club down and under the radar, so to speak. The ball is already on its way, a missile that cannot be recalled -- not that you'd want to take back a stinger like that.
None of these techniques look particularly good, it must be said; neither, for that matter, does the standard retiree's uniform of Bermuda shorts, knobby knees and hairless shanks. But retirement is about what works. Only connect, E. M. Forster wrote; he said nothing about form.
SOME of the retirees I have played with have achieved a level of wisdom that transcends the golf course. A few years ago, for example, I played a couple of rounds at Wampanoag with a threesome that had been together so long they routinely finished one another's sentences. Talking in a kind of interrupted chorus, they gave me stock tips; they instructed me in how to get better gas mileage; they told me which local restaurants served the best Wednesday evening all-you-can-eat buffets. At the seventh tee, while we were waiting for the group ahead -- a ladies' foursome, as it happened -- to get out of range, one of them asked me how long I had been married. Thirty years, I said.
"A rookie!" the chorus began.
"A novice!"
"A kid!"
They then proceeded to deliver almost two centuries' worth of collective wisdom about relations between the sexes. Some of what they said was unprintable. Much of it, now that I try to recall specifics, was variations on the old theme: can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em. But it all seemed profound at the time. These guys were living proof. Here they were, still married -- more than a hundred years of connubial experience striding up the fairway -- and still playing golf together. They would be the first to tell you that they were having the best years of their lives.

HEADLINE: Tenure Gridlock: When Professors Choose Not to Retire

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
LIKE many college presidents, Arthur Taylor has strong feelings about tenure.
"It's a decided problem," said Mr. Taylor, a former president of CBS who since 1992 has been president of Muhlenberg College, a 1,900-student liberal arts institution in Allentown, Pa. "We have no way of asking someone to retire. They literally can go on forever -- and some do." 
 And not just at Muhlenberg. In recent years, as mandatory retirement policies have become illegal -- first in government and private industry, later at colleges and universities -- faculty retirement rates have plummeted, said Robert L. Clark, a professor of economics and business management at North Carolina State University who has studied retirement patterns on the 15 campuses in the state university system.
Dr. Clark found that after 1982, when the federal mandatory retirement age was raised to 70 from 65, retirement rates for professors ages 65 to 69 dropped to 25 percent from 81 percent. When mandatory retirement was eliminated in 1994, the retirement rate for faculty members ages 70 and older fell to 33 percent from 100 percent.
"And if we look down the road, that may be an even bigger deal," Dr. Clark said. Colleges did a great deal of hiring in the late 1960's and early 70's, and those professors are approaching traditional retirement age. Most new tenure-track positions are created when older professors retire. If they decide to stay, there will be few positions for younger professors.
Administrators have some options, of course. In 1998, Congress approved legislation giving universities the right to use certain age-based retirement incentives.
But Mr. Taylor said that had not solved the problem of older, less productive faculty members. "We can try to make it highly attractive for them to go," he said. "But the only way we can get them to go if they don't want to is if they collapse physically and can't come into the classroom."
So, drawing on his corporate background, experience that made him attractive to Muhlenberg's board of trustees, Mr. Taylor has instituted several measures that he believes give Muhlenberg an edge in planning for faculty turnover.
Unusual for academia, these strategies -- the use of merit pay, fixed-term contracts and phased-in retirement -- are straight out of the boardrooms of companies like CBS, where he was president from 1972 to 1976, and International Paper, where he was president for two years before that. He was also dean of the graduate school of business administration at Fordham University for seven years and owned an investment firm.
Mr. Taylor said his methods had a clear objective. "I like to see younger people getting the chance to come along faster," he said.
Tuition, fees and room and board total about $25,475 per student this year at Muhlenberg, but as with most colleges, that covers only part of expenses: personnel costs make up the biggest part of the budget.
When Mr. Taylor took over, Muhlenberg's $32 million endowment was about equal to its debt. At the end of June, the endowment stood at $82 million, while debt had fallen to $18 million.
MUHLENBERG'S faculty appears to have gotten younger in recent years, perhaps because of Mr. Taylor's emphasis on the value of youth. Nearly half of the 140 full-time faculty members have been hired since he took over in 1992. About 18 percent were hired before 1980.
But Mr. Taylor's programs have angered some faculty members, who say that older professors are being denied benefits in favor of younger ones and that a central benefit of tenure -- its promise of freedom from retirement pressure -- is being undermined.
"He makes it quite plain that he views older faculty members as an encumbrance," said Richard C. Hatch, 63, a chemistry professor who has been on the faculty since 1962. "He would just as well see those nearing retirement get out as soon as possible, and I guess I'm one of those."
Dr. Hatch says he is looking forward to retirement at the end of the next academic year, thanks to what he calls "a very good retirement package" offered by Muhlenberg and managed by the pension fund TIAA-CREF. But he adds that he does not appreciate the feeling that he and other senior colleagues are being pushed toward the door.
"I feel more and more like a dinosaur," he said. "It is more difficult to keep up with developments in the discipline, but I also find myself out of step with the attitudes that the newer faculty has towards what a college like this should be."
Some of Mr. Taylor's programs are more familiar in a corporate setting than in a university. One, a merit pay plan, ties every Muhlenberg employee's annual salary increase to a performance evaluation. That has greatly expanded the range of faculty salaries, allowing Mr. Taylor to funnel money to professors he wants to stay and away from those he would rather see go.
But Ludwig F. Schlecht, a 60-year-old professor of philosophy at Muhlenberg, says that as a result, salaries overall at the college are falling behind those at similar four-year private liberal arts colleges. Data from the American Association of University Professors seem to bear him out: full professors at Muhlenberg earned 94 percent of the national average for similar colleges last year, down from 104.5 percent just five years ago. (Associate and assistant professors, who are generally younger, have also seen declines, though not as steep.)
Mr. Taylor has also championed a program to hire some faculty members on contract for a fixed number of years, renewable at the college's option but with no prospect of tenure. That allows the college to know exactly when those professors will be off the payroll. And it gives the college the flexibility to hire a professional in a field like acting who wants to spend a couple of years teaching, or to gauge student demand for a new academic program without making a long-term commitment.
SOME professors are unhappy with these contracts, saying they undermine tenure, and even some administrators acknowledge that the system is unusual. "Depending on how much of a purist you are, it is a system that raises eyebrows because it's not a pure tenure system for faculty," said Curtis G. Dretsch, the dean of the College for Faculty. "We see it not as an erosion of tenure, but as a creative way to deal with certain situations."
Since Mr. Taylor arrived, the number of tenured and tenure-track faculty members has risen to 109 from 95. But in two cases, which Mr. Dretsch described as "very special and unusual circumstances," contracts were used to retain professors who had been denied tenure.
Mr. Taylor has also used phased-in retirements, which gradually lighten an older professor's class load and salary over two or more years, a voluntary easing into retirement that can lighten the college's payroll.
The rate at which faculty members retire can be affected by many factors, researchers have found. Professors enrolled in a traditional defined-benefit pension plan, for example, where the expected value of future benefits begins to decline once a certain age is passed, tend to retire earlier than those in defined-contribution plans, which offer employees more flexibility to control how the money is invested and typically have fewer restrictions on withdrawals.
That could have a significant effect on retirement rates in the future. When offered a choice, most younger professors opt for defined-contribution plans, perhaps making them more likely to work longer.
One variable in that equation, of course, is the unexpectedly high rates of return in defined-contribution plans in the last several years. Professors enrolled in such plans may well have substantially more money than they had anticipated. How those gains will affect retirement decisions remains to be seen.
"Since the elimination of mandatory retirement, the whole playing field has changed," said Eric Kingson, a professor of social work and public administration at Syracuse University. "It raises major questions about how a university assumes orderly turnover of faculty and deals with the demographic bubbles within the faculty as professors age."
One unanswered question is just how the aging of the faculty will affect the financial conditions of American colleges and universities.
But at Muhlenberg, Mr. Taylor thinks his incentives for early retirement have helped create a younger faculty. "I can't think of anybody who is so old that we want him to go," he said.
"I am in favor of people retiring and going on to something else before they get too old to go on to something else," he added. "I'm in my 65th year. I think that is a moment when a woman or a man should stop what they're doing and remake themselves. I truly believe that at age 65, whether you go fishing or become a writer or a painter or a craftsman, you should leave a position open for a younger person. I'm planning to retire -- well, I'd better not say when, because they're betting on it here. But not at a disgraceful age."

HEADLINE: You Don't Have to Be Old to Sue for Age Discrimination

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE nation's courts may have spent years issuing opinions that make it harder for older workers to sue their employers for age discrimination, but that has not discouraged a younger generation of employees from using the antidiscrimination laws more often to challenge being fired or not being promoted fast enough.
And while corporations still win the vast majority of age-discrimination claims, the litigation is forcing many companies to rethink their policies and offer more generous retirement incentives. 
 Lawyers expect that demographic and economic trends could lead to an explosion of age-discrimination cases. The average age of the work force has been steadily increasing. By some estimates, more than 56 million workers will be 45 or older by 2005, an increase of 40 percent since 1994.
That trend probably will collide with another: the gains in productivity that are allowing companies to make more products with fewer workers. Many industries are consolidating, and economic downturns and sweeping layoffs generally lead to more discrimination lawsuits.
"We've got this glut of older workers, many more people in their middle years who are eligible for mid-level and upper-level jobs than are actually available," said Howard C. Eglit, a professor at the Chicago-Kent College of Law and the author of a three-volume treatise, "Age Discrimination."
Mr. Eglit said, "Demographics and the inescapable process of aging that affects every individual, as well as well-entrenched views, assumptions and stereotypes that all of us entertain, ensure that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act is going to continue to play a significant role in the workplace in the next 30 years and beyond."
Mr. Eglit's research shows that the age of the typical age-discrimination claimant has declined steadily, from the 50's to the 40's, and that the number of women filing claims has risen significantly. But even as lawyers anticipate more claims, they say it will not be easy for employees to prevail.
Since Congress and the White House outlawed age discrimination 33 years ago, the courts have chipped away at the law, helping corporate America defend itself.
The courts have raised the burden of proof and limited the use by employees of certain evidence that often correlates with age, saying that while it is unlawful to fire a worker for his or her age, it may be lawful to dismiss an employee for having too high a salary or pension.
They have also restricted the use of class actions, and made it easier to dismiss cases long before jury selection. Last month the Supreme Court decided that millions of state employees could not sue their employers in federal court. Moreover, the cost of litigating age claims has more than tripled in recent years, discouraging many who suspect they are victims from filing claims in the courts. Only a tiny percentage of those complaints that are filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission lead to government-sponsored lawsuits or settlements.
DESPITE the trends and court decisions, workers won important court victories last year, and defense lawyers say many corporations that may have considered age in hiring, promotion and dismissal decisions have become more sensitive to the issue.
In recent months, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reached a $28 million settlement with Johnson & Higgins, an insurance company, which had imposed a mandatory retirement age.
The commission also resolved a $7 million lawsuit with Thomson Consumer Electronics and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, whose jobs were moved to Mexico. And the commission filed a class-action suit against F. W. Woolworth, accusing it of dismissing 300 workers on the basis of age.
"Our level of activity in this area has remained quite high," said Ida L. Castro, the chairwoman of the E.E.O.C., the federal agency that enforces the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.
Ms. Castro said that a new area of age discrimination had begun to arise over changes in pension programs to cash-balance plans, which often benefit younger workers at the expense of their older colleagues. The commission recently announced the formation of a panel of experts to help the agency decide how to handle more than 250 complaints lodged against companies recently for converting their pension plans.
Whether the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which covers most workers over 40, applies in such situations "is certainly the hot button question now," she said.
The act was adopted after Congress passed landmark legislation in other civil rights areas. Its impetus was discrimination in hiring practices. "Before the law was passed, age discrimination was rampant and obvious," said Laurie A. McCann, a lawyer at the AARP. "There were vast numbers of advertisements for jobs saying no one over 35 or 40 need apply."
While recent studies show that employers still strongly prefer younger workers to older ones with comparable resumes, most cases now brought under the law are about discrimination in firing, not in hiring.
"When you apply for a job, the most you usually find out is that you weren't hired," Mr. Eglit said. "You're not told who was hired or why you weren't hired, and you don't know who the other applicants are. When you're fired, however, you can see if there was a pattern, and you know how you've performed."

HEADLINE: WEIGHING THE OPTIONS/FINANCE;
Extra-Credit Class: Figure Out 401(k)'s

BYLINE: By DAVID J. WALLACE; David J. Wallace is a Philadelphia writer on business and technology.

 BODY:
FOR a growing number of entrepreneurs, demographics are now destiny, as millions of workers worldwide see retirement looming less than a decade before them. Responding to the needs of these future retirees, a generation of financial educators has sprung up to offer money counseling for the days ahead. But these new services are not just for older people: younger workers are keeping a watchful eye on their retirement accounts as well.
Determining how many years until retirement is easier than identifying the number of dollars needed to pay for it. More than 38 million people are turning to their 401(k) providers, the Internet and other sources for help in covering the costs of retirement, making retirement planning a skill as crucial as software training was in the last decade. 
 The reasons are many: some employers want to provide as much information as possible to their workers. Others are seeking a haven from potential lawsuits initiated by workers for low-performing, company-sponsored funds or from claims by workers that they were not well informed about the uses of retirement or investment plans.
Employers also might be handicapped by workers who think they cannot afford to retire, leaving employers unable to replace older workers with lower-paid younger ones.
"The 401(k) plan was never designed to be a primary retirement vehicle, but increasingly it will be," said William F. Sharpe, a 1990 Nobel laureate in economics and the chairman of Financial Engines, a Palo Alto, Calif., company that offers online analytical tools to help people review their portfolios. "People need help and there are two models: teach them enough to make decisions themselves, or give them advice from people who are experts."
Mr. Sharpe, a professor emeritus of finance at Stanford University, said people now have to provide for themselves instead of relying on family support or Social Security benefits. The Internet and corporate intranets allow active investors to see more than quarterly results and let companies offer their employees a broader selection of investment choices without raising expenses, Mr. Sharpe said.
For Dorothy and John Siegfried, of Greenville, Del., a recent workshop on retirement planning sponsored by her employer turned the abstract idea of retirement into an exercise in budget forecasting. About 25 of Ms. Siegfried's co-workers at Delaware Health Management spent part of their weekend going over their spending and saving patterns.
"We're trying to calculate when we can retire without cutting back our lifestyle," Ms. Siegfried said. "It's just like preparing a budget. Thinking about where you want to be in 5 or 10 years gives you a better idea of how to make that happen."
The EDSA Group, of Baton Rouge, La., found that planning ahead while avoiding credit-card debt can be important to future retirees. Edward L. Shobe and William R. Pomeroy started the company in 1986 when the Exxon Corporation was seeking proposals to present a retirement planning seminar to its employees.
The company's instructors, who do not solicit individuals for brokerage services, use real numbers in their calculations, which enables the employees to identify their specific needs for retirement, college funds, medical expenses or debt reductions.
"You can never look at just one aspect of it," Mr. Shobe, the EDSA Group's chairman, said. "If we're successful doing our jobs, employees can retire three to five years sooner than expected, and workers like that. But the employer can replace that worker with someone who is paid less, receives less vacation and benefits. It saves the company $52,000 a year, on average."
Fee-based financial planners offer similar courses to companies, but might take the opportunity to solicit within for personal- portfolio management customers, Mr. Shobe said. That can open up an employer to liability if an adviser introduced by the company to a worker jeopardizes that nest egg, another reason EDSA's advisers promise not to solicit private business.
The Vanguard Group, Fidelity Investments and other money-management companies offer educational programs with no sales pitches, too, though they can seek additional business from the company itself.
Demand for investment education has spawned online software programs. Take the one produced by Rational Investors, of Peabody, Mass. Through its Web site (www.rvest.com), visitors can monitor, forecast and enhance their investment choices. Rational Investors was acquired last year by Standard & Poor's. Another Web site, called Understanding and Controlling Your Finances -- www.bygpub.com -- was created by BYG Publishing, of Raleigh, N.C.
Financial education raises the same issues for workers on the shop floor as it does for people in a corner office, said Michelle Owens, a financial consultant with Salomon Smith Barney in Bethesda, Md.
"Loss-aversion is far stronger than the joy of winning, and the learning curve for individual investing is huge," said Ms. Owens, who spoke to about 50 people at a recent conference of business school students at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. "My worst clients are business school graduates or people in the financial industry. They're overconfident."
Curtis Brown, a vice president of Merrill Lynch Private Client Group in New York, sees people using 401(k) money for a second home or other indulgences, assuming they can finance their retirement on rapid short-term stock appreciation.
"Companies are not taking the responsibility of educating their people in terms of the risks and responsibilities," Mr. Brown said. "Yes, the individual is empowered now that information has become a commodity. But in a bull market, with Internet stocks, you see a genius mentality where people think they can do no wrong."
Employers have been shifting to 401(k)'s to reduce their liability in the event that a pension plan is underfinanced. Yet the specter of lawsuits might rise if investments fail to appreciate, or if investments lose money and workers claim they were not suitably advised of risks.
"There's a tremendous amount of misinformation in the financial marketplace," said Fred Reish, a Los Angeles lawyer with an expertise in retirement and financial planning. "There have been two lawsuits that have become well known. At the heart of both cases is the duty of the employer to prudently select the investment options and to monitor them on an ongoing basis. That's going to be the most common basis for a suit by employees."
In both cases, one involving retirees from the Unisys Corporation and a second by workers at First Union Corporation, employees claimed that company officials breached their fiduciary duty by offering unsuitable investments to the work force. Employers who fear similar suits have added a wider array of investment options to satisfy a range of workers that includes young, single new hires and long-time workers with large families.
For employers, the benefits of educating employees include a greater number of workers participating in tax-advantage retirement plans. The benefits in terms of time lost in the workplace or in greater peace of mind cannot be measured, said Richard Volpe, a financial planner from suburban Philadelphia whose company is an EDSA Group affiliate.
"Individuals tend to buy low and sell high because of panic," Mr. Volpe said. "And we haven't experienced a real bear market since 401(k) programs were introduced. People are emotional and you can never predict what they'll do."

HEADLINE: Enjoying the Ex-Presidency? Never Been Better

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
JIMMY CARTER calls it his involuntary retirement.
In 1981, after only four years on the job, he lost the presidency to his chief critic, Ronald Reagan. The voters rejected Mr. Carter as inept and weak, a man unable to secure the release of the American hostages in Iran or to stem double-digit inflation and soaring oil prices and interest rates. 
 Dismissed as a nonentity by his own party, Mr. Carter, a former governor of Georgia, went home to Plains with his wife, Rosalynn, and their teenage daughter, Amy. He was 56 years old, one of the youngest ex-presidents in history. In his book "Everything to Gain: Making the Most of the Rest of Your Life," which he wrote with his wife in 1987, he described awakening to "an altogether new, unwanted and potentially empty life." And he did not feel any better about things when he took a statistical look at his future.
"I realized shortly after I got home that according to the life expectancy tables I had 25 years to go," Mr. Carter recalled in a recent interview in his office at the Carter Center here. "What was I going to do with 25 more years? I was in a little town with 600 people and no job opportunities."
And he needed money. Mr. Carter, who liked to portray himself as a simple peanut farmer, but in fact had a highly successful agricultural business before he went to the White House, discovered shortly after the election that he was broke. The family's farm-supply business, which had been placed in a blind trust while he was president, had been hurt by a severe drought and a lack of personal supervision. The debt came to more than $1 million.
"I didn't have any way to repay a million dollars," Mr. Carter said. "We hoped we could keep our house. We had to honor our debts."
Today, at age 75, as a global humanitarian, writer, professor and multimillionaire landowner, Mr. Carter has a schedule so packed that his close friend and former press secretary, Jody Powell, who is 19 years younger, says he could never keep up. The former president has thrown himself into retirement -- or, more accurately, nonretirement -- with the zeal he once gave to his careers as a Navy submariner, nuclear engineer, farmer and politician.
In 1982 he and Mrs. Carter founded the nonprofit, nonpartisan Carter Center, which promotes peace, human rights and better health care around the world. As the unpaid chairman and vice chairwoman of the board, they travel throughout Asia, Africa and Latin America, negotiating peace, monitoring elections and working to eradicate disease, increase harvests and ease hunger.
In December, Mr. Carter was in Nairobi, Kenya, negotiating an agreement between Uganda and Sudan. The same month, he was in Panama representing the United States in the ceremony marking the handoff of the Panama Canal. In November, he monitored his 29th election, in Mozambique. In October, he made a 13-day trip to Europe and Africa. He met with the prime ministers of Norway and the Netherlands, addressed the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs in Oslo, received an honorary degree from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine for his work in disease prevention in the third world and toured remote villages in Mali that are using agricultural techniques taught to them by the Carter Center.
And that is just his work abroad. As a distinguished professor at Emory University, he lectures on everything from politics to health care. He builds houses for Habitat for Humanity. He has written 14 books since leaving the presidency and recently completed a memoir of his childhood among the black sharecroppers in tiny Archery, near Plains. He is more than halfway through his first novel, set in Georgia during the Revolutionary War.
Though he no longer farms, Mr. Carter still oversees the timber that grows on his land. He makes all the repairs around his house. He relaxes by building furniture. He makes his own wine. When in Plains, he teaches Sunday school at the Maranatha Baptist Church, where he sometimes mows the lawn and Mrs. Carter scrubs the bathrooms when it is her turn.
On a Sunday in January, out-of-towners packed the small church for one of Mr. Carter's regular lessons. Quoting from the Book of Matthew, the former president told the congregation that Jesus would judge them according to how they shared their time and money with the poor and the less fortunate. After the lesson and the minister's sermon, in another part of the ritual, the Carters stood at the front of the church for more than half an hour, posing for pictures with each visitor who wanted one.
This is retirement?
Mr. Carter's life since the White House has been so overfull and so distinguished -- he has been nominated for the Nobel Prize seven times, and in August he and his wife were both awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom -- that Douglas Brinkley, a historian at the University of New Orleans, wrote a 480-page book about it, "The Unfinished Presidency."
"He burns out Secret Service agents," said Mr. Brinkley, who traveled extensively with Mr. Carter from 1994 to 1996. "They can't keep up with him." Mr. Brinkley compares Mr. Carter's post-presidency with that of John Quincy Adams, who carried his crusade against slavery to Congress, where he served 16 years after leaving the White House, and died at his desk.
President Clinton has begun talking about emulating his predecessor's work at the Carter Center when he retires next year. (After years of cool relations, the two men appear to be more cordial now. When he awarded the Carters the Freedom Medal, Mr. Clinton said they had "done more good things for more people than any other couple on the face of the earth.")
Although Mr. Carter's constant efforts for world peace have generally won him admiration, they have sometimes exasperated diplomats and administration officials. "It can be a problem when you have this freelance peace negotiator parachuting into the world's trouble spots," Professor Brinkley said. "Jimmy Carter has a valid intellectual stance in these situations, which is, 'Let's stop fighting and then negotiate.' But he wants to duplicate the Camp David accords, so sometimes the hubris factor overflows."
 AT a stage of life when most people are easing up, why does this former president push himself with what Professor Brinkley calls a missionary zeal? "His faith teaches him that the haves of the world must help the have-nots," Professor Brinkley said. "As a born-again Christian, it's his duty to put every bit of time and energy he can into both his family, and into helping the less fortunate."
So how does Mr. Carter define retirement? As "a liberation from mandatory duties," he said.
At 62, he started skiing. At 64, he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro; at 70, he climbed Mount Fuji. He still pitches seven innings in the Plains softball games. He and Mrs. Carter enjoy fly fishing, tennis, bicycling, bird watching and jogging. During layovers on plane trips, they jog around the airport.
When he turned 70, Mr. Carter was asked by Barbara Walters which were the best years of his life. He answered, "Now is the best time of all." Five years later, the answer is the same -- "The best time is now."
His approach to late life, which he describes in his book, "The Virtues of Aging," has inspired other retirees who want to remain active and engaged. When he gave the keynote address at the American Society on Aging conference last year in Orlando, he received a standing ovation. In polls, Americans rate him as one of the older people they most admire.
In his office in mid-January, dressed in a gray suit, Mr. Carter looked trim, vigorous and youthful. It was 7:30 a.m. He had risen at 5, as usual, to read, write and prepare for a full day of meetings on everything from nuclear disarmament to health care. He showed no signs of having slept on the sofa in the living room of his apartment at the Carter Center. An ice storm had cut power throughout Atlanta, and his daughter, Amy, who lives nearby and had been left without electricity, had moved in temporarily with her husband, Jim Wentzel, and their six-month-old son, Hugo. Delighted by the unexpected visit, the grandparents had given Jim and Amy the Murphy bed they normally sleep on when they are in town.
The arrival of Hugo, Amy's first child, in July made 11 grandchildren for the Carters. The youngest of their four children, Amy, 32, has a master's degree in art history from Tulane University, but is currently staying home with her baby. Two of the Carters' three sons, Chip, 49, and Jeff, 47, also live in the Atlanta area with their wives and children. Jack Carter, 52, lives in Bermuda with his family.
Like a lot of people, Mr. Carter never planned for retirement. "I never thought about it," he said. "I fully expected to serve four more years in the White House and during those second four years to make plans for what I would do, which really was to live a more dormant life, and maybe write one volume of memoirs. I didn't anticipate the things that we're doing."
He was very clear, however, about the sort of ex-president he did not want to be. "The day after I was defeated in November of 1980, I met with the press and told them I was disappointed, that I was not going to utilize my having been president to make money for myself," recalled Mr. Carter, who donates his lecture fees to the Carter Center. "It was a kind of naive but sincere commitment that I have honored."
Mr. Carter paid off his debts by selling the family peanut warehouse to the Archer Daniels Midland Company. In addition, both Carters signed generous contracts to write their memoirs. Today, Mr. Carter said, they earn much of their income by writing books, most of which have been best sellers. In addition, he said, the 3,000 acres he owns, along with the timber on it, generate a substantial amount of money.
STILL, the Carters live frugally in the modest ranch house they built in 1961, when Mr. Carter gave up his post as a Navy nuclear submarine officer to become a farmer in Plains, surrounded by woods and flanked by a tennis court. Mr. Carter has made much of the furniture himself, including the four-poster walnut bed he and his wife sleep in.
When it came to carving out a new life in postmiddle age, Mr. Carter had a role model in his own family. His mother, known as Miss Lillian, was 55 and working as a registered nurse when her husband, James Earl Carter, died in 1953 at age 59. "After Daddy died, Mother blossomed forth, and she became more herself," Mr. Carter said.
She spent six years as a housemother to a group of hard-partying fraternity students at Auburn University, and ran a nursing home in Blakely, Ga. At 68, she joined the Peace Corps, serving in a small town near Bombay for two years.
"She came back when she was 70," Mr. Carter said. "She made 500 speeches about 'Don't let age limit you,' and about the Peace Corps." His mother died at 85.
Though he is the eldest son, Jimmy Carter has outlived his brother, Billy, and his sisters, Ruth and Gloria. All three, as well as their father, died of pancreatic cancer. As a result, Jimmy Carter, the only one among them who never smoked, is vigilant about his diet, and gets frequent checkups.
Mr. Carter talked in a comfortable armchair, with his foot on the coffee table in front of the sofa. On the opposite wall was a painting of Mrs. Carter and a young Amy that had hung in the White House. Across the room was his large, carved oak desk, a replica of the one that Mr. Carter used in the White House. On either side of the bookcase behind the desk were the American flag, and the presidential flag, which had been in the Oval Office during Mr. Carter's tenure. The bookcases were filled with biographies of everyone from Winston Churchill and Thomas Jefferson to Bach and Beethoven, as well as many volumes about the Middle East, and the work of Mr. Carter's favorite poet, Dylan Thomas.
The office, the Secret Service agents outside the door and the former president's discussion of things like the Carter Center's commitment to eradicating guinea worm disease all combined to create a formal mood. But then, from the Carters' nearby apartment, came the unmistakable sound of a baby crying. The proud grandfather flashed a grin. "That's Hugo," he said. Hugo sleeps in a cradle made by his grandfather. Mr. Carter has made cradles for almost all of his grandchildren.
One perk of the Carters' international work is the frequent- flier miles they accumulate. They use the miles to take their extended family -- 21, counting Hugo -- on Christmas vacations.
They have been to Disneyland, Mexico, Belize and Colorado. Last year, they went to Costa Rica. "Our children get to know each other better," said Mr. Carter, who acknowledged that he, like his father, was an extremely demanding parent. "Our grandchildren get to know each other better."
He teaches his grandchildren to fly fish, starting when they are about 7 or 8 -- "as soon as they can hold a fly rod," he said. One of his greatest pleasures, he writes in "The Virtues of Aging," has been showing his grandson Joshua, who is 15, how to tie flies. "Joshua has really adopted it as a commitment," he said.
At the end of the hour, Mr. Carter's personal secretary, Nancy Konigsmark, came in carrying Hugo, a blue-eyed, round-cheeked blond in a navy blue sweater. Smiling broadly, Mr. Carter reached out for his grandson. Moments later, Mrs. Carter entered the room. At 72, she was slender in a gray pantsuit, with her light brown hair in soft waves around her face.
In the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum, which adjoins the Carter Center, there is a photograph of a young Mr. Carter in his Navy uniform, with an inscription to his bride, "Darling, I love you with all my heart for all my life, Jimmy." They have been married for 53 years and, Mr. Carter writes in "The Virtues of Aging," they are closer than ever.
In a brief section of the book about sexuality among older people, he writes about their relationship. "When I was married at the age of 22 and relishing an active sex life," he writes, "I assumed that this was a pleasure that my middle-aged parents rarely, if ever, enjoyed. Now, well past 70, Rosalynn and I have learned to accommodate each other's desires more accurately and generously, and have never had a more complete and enjoyable relationship."
"Rosalynn made me tone that down a little," Mr. Carter said.
Though Mrs. Carter writes her own books, and has her own projects in the subjects of mental health and aging, they are partners in most other pursuits. "There is a much more intimate and gratifying partnership now," Mr. Carter said. "When we first got married, I was dominant, like my father was."
It was not until he got into politics that they became equals, he said. "When I decided to run for the state Senate, my first venture into political office, I got up one morning -- this is amazing to me in retrospect -- instead of putting on my work clothes, I put on my Sunday trousers," Mr. Carter said, recalling his successful bid for Georgia State Senate in 1962. "Rosalynn asked me if there was a funeral. I said, 'I'm going to go and qualify for the Senate.' I hadn't discussed it with her in advance, which to me now is inconceivable. I still can't believe I did it then."
LIKE many couples in retirement, the Carters have had to renegotiate aspects of their relationship. "When we first came home from the White House, I didn't know what we were going to do," said Mrs. Carter, talking in her office later in the morning. "We'd never been at home together."
They set up separate offices, his in the former garage, hers in one of their sons' bedrooms. "We were way apart," Mrs. Carter said. "We did it on purpose."
While her husband would get up at 5 and start working, Mrs. Carter said that she would not arrive at her office until 8:30 or 9, just when he was ready to take a break. "He'd come in and say, 'Let's have a cup of coffee,' " she said. "Well, I had just started to work. We finally put a sign on my door that said 'Do not interrupt, working hours from 9 to 12.' He was the one who suggested it."
So, is Jimmy Carter mellowing? "I wouldn't get carried away with that," said Jody Powell, who now runs a public relations firm in Washington. "The folks that work down there say he hasn't gotten any less hardheaded."
There are signs that Mr. Powell's former boss has had to accommodate to the advancing years. "I used to run seven miles a day," Mr. Carter said. "Now, I run three miles. I don't think at my age I want to climb Mount Kilimanjaro." He did add, however, that he "could probably do it."
He talked about putting in fewer hours at the Carter Center so he could spend more time with his family. "I can see the time when I would like to be in Plains more, at home," he said. "There are some things that I would like to continue to do myself -- the last phases of mediating a peace agreement or a cease-fire, or attending the actual voting in a national election and my personally certifying whether the election was legitimate or fraudulent.
"But the daily administration of the Carter Center," he went on, "the hiring and firing, the choosing of leaders, the identification of interns, the arrangement of conferences, I'm withdrawing from those things."
That seems to be news to everyone around him. Asked about what her husband had said, Mrs. Carter laughed. "We talk about it all the time," she said. "We talked about it a couple years ago. We were going to cut back. But nothing happens."
She cannot imagine her husband sitting around. "If he doesn't have a project, I'm miserable," she said. "I can't get anything done."

HEADLINE: WEIGHING THE OPTIONS/HEALTH CARE;
The Insurance You Really Hope You Will Never Need

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
ALONG with the good news that Americans are living longer comes the sobering prospect that many will lose the ability to take care of themselves. And long-term care -- whether in a nursing home, in an assisted-living center or in one's own home -- can be frightfully expensive.
A year in a nursing home, for example, can cost more than $100,000 in New York City; the national average is almost $50,000. An apartment or room in an assisted living center, with health professionals on hand, can easily run to $30,000, and care at home can be even more costly. 
 While Medicare and conventional health insurance policies do not cover these costs, many companies offer policies that do. For people who buy them relatively early, in their 40's through their early 60's, the premiums can be surprisingly modest, starting at a few hundred dollars a year.
But buying such insurance can be tricky.
For starters, it is a gamble, because most people will never use it. Only about 10 percent of people now in their 60's will ever need long-term care, said Robert Atchley, the chairman of the gerontology department at Naropa University in Boulder, Colo., who bases the estimate on data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Even for people who reach their 80's, he said, the figure is less than half.
This does not mean that long-term-care insurance is necessarily a bad idea. "You're buying coverage against a catastrophe," said Melissa Gannon, a senior researcher at Weiss Ratings in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., a firm that evaluates the financial strength of insurance companies and advises on health insurance. "If the catastrophe happens, it was money well spent."
Dr. Atchley notes that any kind of insurance is something of a gamble. "When you buy car insurance, do you hope you're going to cash in on it?" he asked. "No, you hope you don't need it."
Still, deciding whether to buy long-term-care insurance, how much to buy and from whom requires careful balancing of costs and benefits.
DO YOU NEED IT? -- Strictly speaking, nobody needs long-term-care insurance because there is a safety net: Medicaid, the federal and state program that covers health care for people with low incomes. Nearly 40 percent of all long-term care is financed by Medicaid; many beneficiaries are formerly middle-class people whose savings have been drained by the high cost of care.
But many experts advise against relying on Medicaid. "In lots of parts of the country there aren't many Medicaid spaces," Dr. Atchley said, "and places that have space are often places you wouldn't want to live."
Still, people who cannot afford the premiums for long-term-care insurance do have Medicaid to fall back on. By contrast, wealthy people who could easily afford the premiums might decide to do without the insurance because they can reach into their own pockets if disaster strikes.
The most likely candidates for long-term-care insurance, experts say, are neither rich nor poor but relatively comfortable: couples with savings of $150,000 to $450,000, and annual retirement incomes of $70,000 or more. For these people, the right kind of long-term-care insurance could be a good bet: the benefits can reach several times the premiums paid and can protect an estate from heavy losses.
Under one plan, a 64-year-old New Jersey resident could buy a very basic long-term-care policy at a fixed premium of $460 a year. If after 20 years he needed nursing care, the premiums would have totaled $9,200 but the benefits could reach $73,000 -- $100 a day for up to two years in a nursing home or assisted-living center. With most policies, the companies stop collecting premiums when they start paying benefits.
Coverage is relatively inexpensive for people in their 40's and 50's, then rises steeply, especially for a comprehensive policy -- one that pays a wide range of expenses in almost any kind of institution, as well as care at home. The United Seniors Health Cooperative, a nonprofit organization in Washington, says comprehensive coverage for a 75-year-old can cost more than $6,000 a year.
Some experts point out that insurance is not the only way to deal with long-term care. Some families, for instance, may decide to take care of elderly relatives themselves. "Parents and children ought to sit down and talk about whether anybody wants to take care of Mom and Dad and whether they should spend the inheritance on themselves," said Robert Hunter, the director of insurance at the Consumer Federation of America.
And there are other ways of setting money aside for long-term care, including a reverse mortgage, in which a bank advances you the value of your home, then claims it when you die. The loan does not have to be repaid as long as you live in your home.
WHERE TO BUY IT? -- Many companies sell long-term-care insurance, and experts say some policies are barely worth the paper they are printed on. "There are lots of loopholes and provisos," Mr. Hunter said. "Make sure you understand any kind of limitations and exclusions."
It is important to shop around, because premiums can vary as much as $1,000 a year for essentially the same coverage. And experts strongly recommend sticking to the dozen or so companies that have cornered 80 percent of the business.
Smaller, newer companies may offer coverage that sounds wonderful at amazingly low prices, but experts say they may well raise premiums later. While premiums are theoretically fixed from start to finish, state regulators will permit insurers to raise rates -- perhaps astronomically -- if their expenses increase.
HOW MUCH TO BUY? -- One guiding rule, the experts say, is to make sure you can afford the premiums for the rest of your life. If you drop the coverage after 15 years, you will generally have nothing to show for it.
Experts say those who can afford it should buy comprehensive coverage. "People say, 'I don't want to go into a nursing home,' and therefore won't buy any policy with nursing home in it," said Nancy P. Morith, the owner of N. P. Morith, a brokerage firm in Princeton, N.J., that specializes in long-term-care insurance. But then, she said, if they have to go into a nursing home, they are out of luck.
Likewise, cheaper policies may cover nursing-home care only, leaving policyholders stuck with the bills for care at home or with assisted living, which might be their first choice. The approaches to care for older people are changing rapidly, so you want a policy flexible enough to cover services that are developed in the future.
To figure out the daily benefit you might need, find out what nursing homes charge where you expect to be. The rates will rise with inflation, of course; experts recommend a policy that offers inflation protection. It typically provides for a 5 percent increase in benefits, compounded annually. At that rate, a $73,000 benefit would grow to $193,644 in 20 years.
With the best policies, you can begin receiving benefits when you begin needing help with two out of six essential daily activities, like getting dressed and bathing, or when you need supervision for the protection of yourself or others.
HOW TO SAVE MONEY? -- Even though older people rarely spend more than two or three years in a nursing home, experts recommend unlimited or lifetime benefits. But if you need to reduce costs, the experts say, cut the length of coverage to two to five years and stick with the full range of services. When the policy expires, you may need to fall back on Medicaid.
If you think you will be able to afford some of the costs, and are looking for a policy that will cover only a catastrophically long-term illness, consider signing up for the longest possible deductible (what insurers call the elimination period). Premiums for policies with a 90-day deductible, meaning that you pay the first 90 days out of pocket, are lower than for those that pay from the first day you need help.
The premiums for some kinds of policies are tax-deductible. But before the deduction can be taken, total health expenses must exceed 7.5 percent of gross adjusted income. And these policies typically require patients to be quite frail before they can qualify for benefits.
Some policies offer other features that are probably not worth the extra cost. "Nonforfeiture," for example, gives you a partial refund or delivers partial benefits if you cancel your policy. Martin Weiss, the chief executive of Weiss Ratings, said this feature is rarely used and increases the premium.
He also advises against the feature that permits you to stop and start benefits, turning the clock back to full benefit status if you go six months without drawing on the policy. Once people start drawing benefits, Mr. Weiss said, they seldom stop.

What to Pay
Annual premiums for long-term-care insurance vary widely. Weiss Ratings, a private company that evaluates insurers, calculates that a hypothetical 64-year-old New Jerseyan could expect to pay the following.
Basic: Up to two years in a nursing home or assisted-living center; first 90 days not covered. $460 to $750 a year.
Comprehensive: Unlimited period for any kind of care. $1,306 to $2,543 a year.
 
Where to Shop
More than 100 companies sell long-term-care insurance. Experts recommend sticking with the largest, which are considered least likely to raise premiums to cover unexpected expenses. As of 1998, these were the 10 largest by market share, according to A. M. Best, the insurance rating company.

HEADLINE: 3 Retirees Rate Life After Work

BYLINE: By SHELLY FREIERMAN 

 BODY:
How's retirement? Here is what a few retirees have to say about how they are managing, especially financially.
 
HWillie Ed Morgan, 73
Willie Ed and Ethel Morgan, both retired teachers, will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary on April 11. They live in South Bend, Ind.
I retired when I was 62 in 1988. Ethel retired two years later. I started thinking about retirement in my late 40's. I knew I wanted to be completely out of debt and have the house paid for. I bought an apartment building in Jackson, Miss., and we're still getting income from it.
We helped the kids financially until I was about 55. Then we started putting the money into annuities. Now, both of us are retired, with income from Social Security and pensions from the state. We own the house, which we've been in for 23 years. We're earning about the same income as when we were teaching.
I don't have too many regrets about our careers, even though I had problems with racism. Ethel earned her degree in library science after she graduated from college. I worked as a merchant marine and a Chicago transit worker before I earned my teaching degree. We wanted to have time to spend with the kids, who are all grown now. We have two doctors, a lawyer and a C.P.A.
My wife spends a lot of time with the Links, a social service organization run by black professional women. I'm a delegate to the United Methodist assemblies for our church, and I serve on two mayoral boards.
Now, we have two grandchildren in college. We see the process go on with our children like it went with us. I offer advice, unsolicited, of course. They never take it.
 
Renee Shapiro, 69
Mrs. Shapiro retired in 1998 and moved from River Edge, N.J., to Cranbury, N.J., where she lives in the Ponds, a retirement community.
I have two boys. I didn't start working until my youngest son was 11 because my husband wanted me to stay home. I worked in a pediatric doctor's office, and even after I moved down here, I worked twice a week, then once a week. I have a pension and a 401(k) plan from work. When they started the plans, I thought I could use that money to spend on something, but now I'm glad I took part.
I really miss my husband. He died about a year after we moved here in 1996. I thought I'd be working and living in River Edge forever. My husband probably was not feeling so good when we left. Now I'm glad we moved.
At first, I said to myself, What am I going to do if I'm not getting up and dressing for work? Now I go to the gym about four or five times a week, and I belong to the women's club, the computer club and the singles club. And I'm captain of the speedwalkers club, which is a sort of Olympics for about a dozen senior developments. The race is a relay of a quarter mile, and last year we won a silver medal.
 
Jim Schroff, 68
Mr. Schroff, who is single, lives in Manhattan.
I go to the Manhattan Bridge Club about three or four afternoons a week. Bridge requires concentration and skill, and it's fascinating to try and beat your opponents. When you get older you have to have something that occupies your mind and something that occupies your body.
I grew up in the Bronx during the Depression. We were dirt poor. My father was a building superintendent when he wasn't unemployed. He had no retirement. He was in his early 70's when he died, and he was still working. All I ever wanted was 10 good years of health after I retired. Now my doctor says, "You're going to live a long time." Then you begin wondering if you'll run out of money.
I was one of nine children, only the second child to graduate from high school and the first to graduate from college. I'm very conservative when it comes to spending because I grew up with no money.
I retired from my job as a corporate lawyer when I was 58, and did some consulting work for four years after that. I'm living on my pensions, my savings and my Social Security.
I'm not hurting now, but I wish I had taken more advantage of investment opportunities. All of the advisers suggest you start thinking about retirement in your 30's or early 40's. I didn't start until my late 40's. I didn't take advantage of the maximum allowed in the deferred savings plans.
My advice to people today: If you can afford it, stash away as much as you can while you are still working. You never can tell what's going to happen.

HEADLINE: WEIGHING THE OPTIONS/FINANCIAL;
America's Nest Egg Is: a. Big b. Paltry c. All of the Above

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
BY some measures, Americans are growing increasingly profligate, choosing to spend everything they have, and more, on big-screen televisions, restaurant meals and vacations. How many will spend it all by the time they retire?
Looking at the question in the broadest sense, there is little doubt that Americans are putting today ahead of tomorrow. 
 The personal savings rate, for one, has plummeted over the last seven years, declining to 2.4 percent of disposable income in 1999 from 8.7 percent in 1992.
Meanwhile, many households have run up their debts to dangerous levels; the Federal Reserve Board reported recently that in 1998, 12.7 percent of families -- up from 10.5 percent three years earlier -- were carrying debt payments of more than 40 percent of income, a traditional benchmark for imprudent borrowing.
"The one thing that no one seems to know how to fix in America is how we get the personal savings rate back up," President Clinton said in an interview.
Yet the talk of gloom and doom does not reflect the experience of many people in recent years. Americans may not be saving as much, but they are growing wealthier nonetheless, largely because of the stock market. To the extent that their net worth is increasing, they are better prepared for the future, including retirement.
The proportion of households that own stock directly or indirectly (through mutual funds and retirement plans) rose to 48.8 percent in 1998 from 40.4 percent three years earlier and 31.6 percent in 1989, according to the Fed. The net worth of the median family rose to $71,600 in 1998 from $60,900 in 1995, a 17.6 percent increase.
The percentage of families that reported saving anything has bounced up and down in the last decade: in 1998, it stood at 55.9, according to the Fed. But among those households that do save, the proportion reporting that putting away money for retirement was their main goal in saving rose to 34.7 percent in 1998 from 25.5 percent in 1995 and 20.4 percent in 1989.
"The situation is not as bad as it looks on the surface," said Paul Yakoboski, a senior research associate at the Employment Benefits Research Institute in Washington. "Since the savings statistics are not capturing the wealth run-up in existing savings, it makes things look worse than they are."
The question of whether the good news outweighs the bad hangs heavily over efforts to analyze how adequately Americans, and especially the 76-million-strong baby boom generation, are preparing for a retirement that could come sooner and last longer than many people expect.
TO the degree that there is an answer, it is that some people are doing quite well and others abysmally, and that everyone will be greatly affected by how the stock market performs in the years and decades to come.
"We have a very split nation when it comes to a lot of these issues," said David M. Certner, the senior coordinator for economic issues at the AARP.
In some ways, the situation is a manifestation of the broader division of society between rich and poor, haves and have-nots.
"About half the population is covered in pension plans of one sort or another, and most of them have a 401(k) and are contributing to it," said Sylvester J. Schieber, the vice president for research and information at Watson Wyatt Worldwide, a consulting firm.
"Of the half not covered by a pension plan," Mr. Schieber said, "some we don't need to worry about too much -- young people just starting out, people working part time by choice, self-employed people accumulating value in their business. But then there is a group of people who aren't covered by any plans and for the most part are not doing any savings outside of them."
But even among people who have a retirement program, analysts say there is a divide between those who have the knowledge and sophistication to handle their money well over the long run and those who are basically winging it.
That divide, they say, is increasingly important as the nation leaves behind the days of traditional defined-benefit corporate pensions, where the only variables were length of employment and retirement age. The 401(k) program and the possibility that Social Security could be overhauled to include private investment accounts have put a premium on knowing how much to save and how to invest it.
"More and more what we're doing is putting the responsibility for accumulating sufficient assets for retirement on the backs of workers, but not educating workers as to what their responsibility is," Mr. Schieber said.
An entire generation of savers now takes for granted double-digit annual returns from Wall Street -- and has never experienced a protracted downturn in the market.
"What happens if the market corrects 25 percent and all of a sudden we're not as wealthy as we were?" asked Mr. Yakoboski, of the Employment Benefits Research Institute. "How will people respond? Will they increase savings out of personal income? That's a wait-and-see issue."
Of course, research into the adequacy of savings is often not conclusive, because so much depends on assumptions about investment returns and other factors like inflation and expanding life spans.
For all the risks inherent in the market these days, analysts have been fretting for years that savers are too timid in allocating their money, favoring lower-risk investments like government bonds at the price of giving up the historically higher rates of return from stock.
A new study by the Employee Benefit Research Institute and the Investment Company Institute concluded that most people with 401(k) plans allocate their money appropriately, with younger people willing to take more risk and older people more likely to protect the capital they have amassed.
The study found that people in their 20's, for example, invested 62.1 percent of their assets in stock funds, 4.7 percent in guaranteed investment contracts (like an annuity) and 4.7 percent in bond funds. People in their 60's, by contrast, put 39.8 percent of their assets in equities, 20.6 percent in guaranteed investment contracts and 9 percent in bonds. Each age group put the rest of its assets in a variety of other investment options.
But the wealth of a substantial part of the population is not in the market.
"The bad news is that many households are not well informed about savings and investment vehicles," said Stephen Brobeck, the executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, an advocacy group. "That is offset by the fact that savings for most families is primarily still through Social Security, employment-related retirement programs and their home equity. There is less opportunity to make very poor decisions in those areas than if you're e-trading."
FOR many people, even those who have saved diligently and intelligently, the biggest risk may not be financial but demographic. Retirees are living longer and outliving their wealth, a phenomenon that some analysts think could become a much bigger problem as biomedical advances continue.
"There is a substantial risk, if you want to look at it that way, that we will see substantial improvements in mortality among the old," said Chris Carroll, an economics professor at the Johns Hopkins University. "That would have a big effect on the adequacy of people's retirement savings outside Social Security."

Chart: "Social Security May Need Social Security"
Since its inception in 1935, Social Security has become the largest income-maintenance program in the United States. For most retirees, it is essential: 3 out of 5 beneficiaries aged 65 or older rely on it for at least half their annual income. Yet despite the current budget surpluses, several worrisome trends are putting Social Security at risk.

HEADLINE: In Tribute To Your Year Of Service

BYLINE: By BRENT BOWERS 

 BODY:
A GOLD watch as a retirement gift? A hopeless anachronism, snorted Edward L. Hansen, a former director of marketing at William M. Mercer, a consulting firm in New York.
No, what is called for in this day and age is the personal touch, said Mr. Hansen, who retired last summer at age 63 and moved to San Diego. That was the approach his colleagues took, at least, showering thoughtful gifts on him. Knowing that he is an avid cyclist, they bought him a gift certificate to a local bike shop as well as an ergonomic bike saddle and a guidebook to California bike routes. Knowing that he likes to go to the beach, they also bought him a beach umbrella, a beach blanket and an insulated snack kit. And knowing that he is addicted to two national newspapers, they bought him two-year subscriptions to both. "If I had gotten a gold watch," Mr. Hansen said, "I would've put it in my bureau drawer, and at some point, when my estate was being sorted out, one of my heirs would say: 'Oh, look. Here's this gold watch. Who gets it?' " 
 Most companies, in fact, abandoned the tradition of doling out precious-metal watches to retiring workers long ago, and even lovers of gold watches say the reasons for the change are obvious. People change jobs more than they used to, meaning that timepieces have lost their luster as a token of a company's gratitude for employee loyalty. People also retire in more robust health, meaning they have more pressing preoccupations than keeping track of time. The influx of women into the workplace in the last few decades has also eroded the very male-oriented practice.
Now just hold on one minute, responded Max S. Beschloss, a 72-year-old former vice president for advertising at Longines-Wittnauer and now a consultant for the New York maker of luxury watches, which has been renamed Wittnauer International.
When Mr. Beschloss retired from Wittnauer in January 1996 after 25 years, he was given a solid-gold Lifetime Plus watch, guaranteed to be repaired free until the death of a designated heir, which he figured would be his 40-year-old middle son, Adam. Gold watches passe? "Most jewelers would disagree," Mr. Beschloss said. "It's something you see every day of your life, a reminder of the company's gratitude."
For Mr. Hansen, Mr. Beschloss had these thoughts: "What's a bike? God bless you, you're an enthusiast. Don't break your neck. But a watch? I need it."
So, what has replaced the gold watch as a retirement gift?
"Money!" declared Sam Zell, the Chicago real estate magnate, whose vast holdings employ thousands of people. "It's called severance. It's called 401(k)." Mr. Zell admitted to a fondness for gold watches -- he owns four or five -- but said that their days as retirement-dinner mainstays were gone.
"Wearing a gold watch is like wearing a badge that says, 'I worked in one place for 35 years,' " he said. "Nobody wants to wear that badge anymore."
Ah, but they used to, in a big way, too. John F. Gelson, 68, a former president of the Hamilton Watch Company, now a brand of the Swiss-based Swatch Group, remembered how General Motors, AT&T and most Fortune 500 companies had contracts with Hamilton or other luxury-watch makers to provide retirement-gift watches to employees. "The option we gave was a gold watch or a mahogany mantel clock," said Mr. Gelson, who lives in Lancaster, Pa.
Such luxury gifts were easy for corporations to chop when the cost of their health care plans soared in the 1980's, Mr. Gelson said. Chop they did. When he retired in 1991 after 11 years at Hamilton, he said, "I got zilch."
It is not as if the premium watchmakers are hurting. Imports of watches with gold, platinum or silver cases surged to 2,020,000 in 1998 from 1,190,000 in 1997, according to government statistics on imports. (Almost all such watches are made overseas.) Why the surge? "As James Carville said, 'It's the economy, stupid,' " replied Toby Collado, a lobbyist for the American Watch Association, an industry group in Washington.
If there is one place where the old ways survive, it must be Switzerland, the heartland of fine watchmaking. Right?
Well, sort of.
IT goes without saying that Rene Castella, a Swiss business executive whose family has owned and sold two precious-metal watch companies, loves precious-metal watches.
Mr. Castella, 46, who manages the American operations of the family business, DIXI Le Locle Holding, a Swiss maker of high-precision machine tools, out of Elmsford, N.Y., owns a bunch of them. His favorite is a Zenith with El Primero movement, the best watch in the world, he said, which he wears every day.
The traditional retirement gift in Switzerland was actually an elaborate clock, not a watch, he said. But now, most big Swiss companies give cash instead of clocks, and the recipients "won't buy a Swiss clock with it," Mr. Castella said.
Still, there are holdouts, and DIXI Le Locle Holding is one. In deference to modern sensibilities, the company offers cash or a gold watch to its retiring employees at its home base. But, Mr. Castella boasted that 90 percent of them take the watch. "This is Switzerland, after all," he said. "The Swiss people have money in the bank. They save money. Here in America, they spend it."

HEADLINE: Imagining a Ticket Booth As a Stairway to the Stars;
A New Design for the TKTS Booth Off Times Square

BYLINE: By JULIE V. IOVINE 

 BODY:
A familiar New York landmark, the ramshackle pipe-and-canvas TKTS booth at the northern end of Times Square, will be transformed into a bright red grand staircase that will provide visitors to the city with front-row seats to one of the best shows in town.
The stairs will rise gently from the base of the statue of Father Duffy, for whom the TKTS traffic island is named, and reach a height of 16 feet. The new sales booth for marked-down theater tickets will be tucked beneath the high end of the stairs. After buying a ticket, theatergoers will be able to sit on the steps, bask in the sun and take in the ever-changing public theater that is Times Square itself. 
 The design, by the Australian architects John Choi and Tai Ropiha, was announced yesterday by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. Construction is to begin later this year.
The existing TKTS booth, an aging trailer adorned with bright red initials, was installed in Duffy Square 27 years ago. It sells more than $1.7 million in discount tickets annually and is operated by the Theater Development Fund, a nonprofit performing arts organization. In June the fund said it would sponsor a design competition to replace the old booth.
"It will add some beauty and some usefulness," said Mayor Giuliani.
Mr. Choi, 28, and Mr. Ropiha, 36, both of Sydney, had visited New York just once before coming to the city to receive their $5,000 award for the design. They said they had based their impressions of Times Square on films, magazines and television coverage of New Year's Eve celebrations. "We were reacting to the visual buzz," Mr. Ropiha said, "and tried to create a strong singular image in contrast."
"We wanted something quiet that would act as a foil to all that energy," said Mr. Choi.
The staircase will be made of red resin planks. The TKTS logo, which is under copyright to the Theater Development Fund, will be emblazoned in black letters about five feet tall on the east and west sides of the structure. The ticket-buyers line will snake along the sidewalk around the statue of the Rev. Francis Patrick Duffy, the Roman Catholic priest, army chaplain and World War I hero.
Jack L. Goldstein, the executive director of the Theater Development Fund, said of the competition: "We wanted an image that was up-to-date and elastic and not so ad hoc. We were looking for something that had cleverness, visual economy and force."
The new design also had to provide a few more sales windows than the current eight and offer reasonable comfort for the ticket sellers within the artificially lit, no-frills space. The Theater Development Fund is also considering adding a public bathroom. The project is expected to cost as much as $2 million, to be raised by the fund.
Prizes went to other designs selected from among 683 entries from 31 countries. The jury was made up of architects, designers, officials representing the Times Square business improvement district, and theater industry experts.
Second prize went to Thomas Phifer, a New York architect in association with the local engineering firm Ove Aup. His design calls for a raked glass roof extending over the entire square as well as over the statues of Father Duffy and George M. Cohan, who is also commemorated in the square. A raised platform will include concealed heating and air conditioning ducts for the comfort of ticket buyers as they wait.
Third place was shared by Piero Lissoni Associates, a group of 16 architects from Milan who proposed a minimalist box with a translucent wall etched with a ghostly logo and with L.E.D. panels inlaid into the pavement, and Leo Mieles, a Toronto architect who proposed a performance space on the roof. There were four honorable mentions: Rahman Polk and Byron Terrell of Chicago; Mauk Design of San Francisco; Lippincott and Margulies of New York; and U-Arc Studio of Seattle.
"There wasn't much room for an entirely radical solution," said Raymond Gastil, executive director of the competition's organizer, the Van Alen Institute, a civic organization committed to improving the public realm through architecture. "But the entries say a lot about the raw energy and talent that's out there."
The range of the designs was considerable, from a booth conceived as twin green crystals to a three-dimensional rendition of Mondrian's painting "Broadway Boogie Woogie."
Marion Weiss, a New York architect who served on the jury, remarked on "the outpouring of innovation" reflected in the design entries. An exhibition of the top designs and 32 other entries will open tomorrow at the Van Alen Institute, at 30 West 22nd Street. The institute has arranged for 200 more images to go on display today at the Urban Center at 457 Madison Avenue, between 50th and 51st Streets.
The search for a new TKTS booth did not go off without a hitch. No sooner was the competition announced than the Coalition for Father Duffy protested the very existence of the booth in Duffy Square. Maj. Gen. Joseph A. Healey, co-chairman of the coalition, wanted to ensure that any new booth would not stand taller than Father Duffy. He rallied his membership, "vets from Buffalo to Montauk," he said, who inundated the mayor's office with more than 7,000 postcards.
Representatives of the coalition was thus allowed to view the winning entries in advance of the announcement and to meet with Mayor Giuliani "to make sure we didn't make a flap" at the official announcement, General Healey said. He added that he liked the winning proposal. "The statue is singularly placed and totally visible and identifiable within a very busy setting, " he said.
Mr. Choi and Mr. Ropiha will soon return to Sydney and their jobs as designers at Hassell, one of Australia's largest architectural firms. While visiting this week, they said, they did attend a couple of plays but never waited in line at TKTS: the Theater Development Fund supplied them with tickets.

HEADLINE: Rise in Ads Gives a Lift To CBS Profit

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The CBS Corporation, which is being bought by Viacom Inc. for about $37 billion, said fourth-quarter profit rose, fueled by higher advertising revenue at the television and radio operations.
Profit from continuing operations rose to $19 million, or 3 cents a share, from $3 million, or break-even, in last year's fourth quarter. The company, owner of the CBS television network and a controlling stake in the Infinity Broadcasting Corporation, said revenue jumped 24 percent to $2.22 billion from $1.79 billion. 
 CBS's recent acquisitions of King World Productions Inc., the No. 1 television-show distributor, and Outdoor Systems Inc., the largest United States billboard company, helped lift revenue. Rising demand for ads, driven by a booming economy and spending by Internet companies, allowed CBS to charge higher ad rates at its No. 2-rated TV network and at its TV and radio stations, particularly in large cities.
"The network and TV stations had a tremendous quarter," said Niraj Gupta, a Schroder & Company analyst who has an "outperform significantly" rating on CBS. "And clearly the large-market radio stations are benefiting disproportionately from dot-com spending."
CBS said cash flow jumped 85 percent, to $523 million from $282 million. CBS defines operating cash flow as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, minority interests and equity losses. Cash flow is used by many analysts and investors to measure the performance of broadcasting companies because it focuses on operations and excludes interest payments and noncash charges like depreciation.
CBS was expected to earn 2 cents a share, the average estimate of five analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. CBS shares fell $1.75, to $62.50. The stock had risen 75 percent over the last 12 months.
Mel Karmazin, the chief executive, said the earnings report was probably the last that CBS would issue as a stand-alone company.
Mr. Karmazin said he hoped that Viacom, the world's fifth-largest media company, would complete its acquisition of CBS by the end of next month or in early April. The merger still needs the approval of the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission.
Ad sales at Infinity Broadcasting, CBS's radio and billboard arm, increased 32 percent, to $759 million from $573 million. CBS gets about 60 percent of its revenue and cash flow from Infinity, home to the Howard Stern and Don Imus national radio shows. Shares of Infinity fell $1.6875, to $36.3125.

Kremlin Insiders Acquire Big Siberian Aluminum Plants

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Boris A. Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich, financiers with close ties to the Kremlin, have acquired three important Russian aluminum smelters in eastern Siberia in deals that would give them nearly full control over the country's enormous aluminum industry.
Mr. Abramovich is already the principal owner of Sibneft, a leading Russian oil conglomerate. Mr. Berezovsky is widely believed to have a stake in the company as well, though Sibneft has never confirmed it. 
 But a company spokesman said on Monday that some of Sibneft's major shareholders acquired controlling interests last week in the Bratsk aluminum plant and the Krasnoyarsk aluminum plant from Lev Cherny, a Russian emigre business executive with extensive interests in the metals industry, and in Trans-World Metals Ltd., a British trading company that is heavily engaged in Russian mining and smelting.
A spokesman for Mr. Cherny said the sales have almost been completed, while a Trans-World representative confirmed only that his company is negotiating with Sibneft shareholders. Those involved declined to disclose the size of the stakes sold or the value of the transaction.
Last Thursday, the owners of the Novokuznetsk aluminum plant announced that they had sold their 70 percent stake in the smelter to LogoVaz, a company controlled by Mr. Berezovsky.
The Bratsk, Krasnoyarsk and Novokuznetsk factories together accounted for about two-thirds of the 3.4 million tons Russia produced in 1999, its output second only to that of the United States. The Bratsk plant, which by itself produced nearly 960,000 tons last year, is considered the largest smelter in the world.
The Sibneft spokesman said the shareholders would announce their development plans for the smelters they had acquired later this week.
"This is part of a general trend in Russian industry for companies to stake out more and more of the economy while they can," said Ivan Mazalov, oil analyst for the Russian brokerage firm Troika Dialog.
The period between the tenure of Russia's former president, Boris N. Yeltsin, and early elections on March 26 proved an astute time for Mr. Abramovich and Mr. Berezovsky to act. Oil prices, at the highest level in nearly a decade, have brought a windfall to Russian oil companies and helped give the Sibneft shareholders the resources to acquire the smelters.
By expanding their holdings into aluminum, the Sibneft stock owners, once part of the Yeltsin inner circle, may be trying to preserve their influence in the new political cluster around the acting Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, who is the leading candidate in next month's elections.
"Presidential elections always need money," said Aleksandr Konovalov, head of the Institute for Strategic Assessments in Moscow, adding that "having lots of money means there is more of a chance" they will be regarded as sources of support before the election and after.
But it is unclear why Mr. Cherny and Trans-World chose to reduce their holdings in Russian aluminum at a time when favorable world prices have also helped improve the prospects of the smelters, which export most of their production.
Since the mid-1990's, investigators with the interior ministry have been looking into whether Mr. Cherny was part of a wide-scale bank fraud that the police say he used to finance deals with the smelters in the early days of post-Soviet Russia. Mr. Cherny and Trans-World, through their lawyers, have repeatedly denied accusations of wrongdoing.
The business activities of Sibneft and Mr. Berezovsky have also been called into question. Minority shareholders at a Sibneft production unit have for years accused company management of spiriting away millions in revenue from the unit into offshore accounts. Sibneft has denied any wrongdoing.
Mr. Berezovsky is under investigation by the Swiss prosecutor's office on evidence that he used two Geneva companies to channel revenue out of Russia from Aeroflot, the national airline, in which he owns a stake. He, too, has denied wrongdoing.

An American Pie

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Talk about globalization. Michel Camdessus probably knew that his last speech as managing director of the International Monetary Fund might be accompanied by some protests. But he surely did not expect an American activist to follow him to Bangkok and throw a cream pie in his face.
The American represented one of the groups hoping to make April's I.M.F.-World Bank meeting in Washington a second Seattle. Sunday's pie-throwing was, of course, a publicity stunt. But the symbolism -- an American traveling to Asia to save Asians from globalization, whether they want to be saved or not -- is too apt to pass up. 
 Let's admit that there were some actual Thai protesters outside the lecture hall. And let's also admit that the I.M.F. is a more plausible villain than the World Trade Organization, the bizarrely demonized target of the Seattle protests. The I.M.F. is no more a world government than the W.T.O. is; but through the conditions that it imposes in return for loans the I.M.F. does, at least in times of crisis, get to dictate policies to sovereign states.
The W.T.O., by contrast, is basically a commercial court; all it does is determine when countries are violating the agreements they have already made. (Example: The U.S. can set whatever environmental standards it likes, but having agreed to the principle of non-discrimination, it cannot hold imported gasoline to a higher standard than the domestic product.)
The protesters of Seattle past and Washington future, however, don't make such fine distinctions. They are as opposed to free trade in goods as they are to speculative movements of short-term capital; they view the longer-term trends in the world economy, not just the short-term crises, with dismay. And that is why the spectacle of an American going to Thailand, of all places, to protest globalization is so remarkable. For Thailand is one of those export-led success stories that are the best advertisement for the W.T.O. and its free-trade agenda.
Now wait a second, you say. Wasn't there a terrible financial crisis recently? Yes, there was, and the I.M.F. mishandled it. But the Thai economy is recovering, and even post-crisis Thailand is a much better place than it used to be.
This may not be obvious to the Western visitor. Much of Bangkok is an urban nightmare of shanties and traffic jams; Thailand is still poorer than most Westerners can easily imagine. But that, in a way, is the point: because the developing world is still so poor, what looks to careless observers like exploitation is often far better than the alternative.
Try looking at some of the literature of the anti-globalists -- say, the lavish series of full-page ads that have been placed in this newspaper by the Turning Point Project. (Who's paying for those ads, by the way?) Again and again you see the less attractive features of the modern world contrasted with an imagined pre-globalization Arcadia of happy villagers living in harmony with nature. Then try checking some of the facts about life before the export boom. Never mind G.D.P.; we're talking basic nutrition and health. What you will discover is that life in that pre-globalization society was nasty, brutish and short; for example, in 1975 only one rural Thai in six had access to safe drinking water. Today it's four out of five.
No wonder, then, that many third-world leaders are contemptuous of their self-proclaimed Western friends who, in the words of Mexico's president, Ernesto Zedillo, are "determined to save developing countries from development."
Of course, those developing countries have their own gripes about the world trading system. Mainly these involve their desire for more, not less, international trade: they are rightly angry that rich countries that proclaim the virtues of free trade place so many obstacles in the way of their potential exports. And they also want more of a say in the decisions of the W.T.O. -- largely because they are afraid that it will give in to the demands of the Seattle types, imposing labor and environmental standards that they cannot afford.
What they don't want is affluent Westerners telling them -- strangely, at the very moment that some developing countries are finally starting to acquire a bit of real economic power -- what a terrible thing the modern world is.

Surging Blue Chips Help Lift Slumping Technology Shares

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A rally in oil stocks and some bargain hunting buoyed the Dow Jones industrials yesterday. In a major turnaround from recent weeks, the strength in blue chips helped pull technology stocks out of a severe slump.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 198.25 points, or 1.85 percent, to 10,718.09. The Nasdaq composite index, which tumbled as much as 127 points in earlier trading, closed up 2.22 points, to 4,420.77. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 12.11 points, to 1,402.05.
For a second session, the Dow held up better than the technology-dominated Nasdaq. Consumer products companies like Procter & Gamble and Minnesota Mining led the blue-chip index. Procter & Gamble rose 37/8 , to 95 3/4, while 3M gained 6 1/4, to 89 1/8.
Analysts said the Dow was poised for a comeback after its 538.59-point drop last week, which knocked the index 11 percent below its January peak, within market watchers' traditional definition of a correction. With big gains Monday and yesterday, the Dow is now 8.6 percent below its Jan. 14 record of 11,722.98.
"A lot of really good names had been beaten down badly," said Joseph T. Keating, chief investment officer of the Kent Funds in Grand Rapids, Mich. "It was time for some of those stocks to start attracting cash again."
The Dow got a lift from a surge in oil-related stocks. Exxon Mobil rose 2 7/8, to 795/16 , as crude oil futures remained above $30 a barrel. Crude prices topped $30 a barrel Monday for the first time since the eve of the Persian Gulf war in January 1991.
Texaco jumped 17/16 , to 505/16 , on the New York Stock Exchange. A Lehman Brothers analyst raised his rating on Texaco stock, estimating that shares would reach 65 within the next 12 months.
Oil services companies like Schlumberger, up 4 1/2, to 65, also rose.
While rising prices are good for the companies that produce and explore for oil, they can contribute to inflation. That possibility helped keep investors on edge yesterday, analysts said.
Technology stocks were particularly rattled by investors who are worried that the Federal Reserve will continue raising interest rates this year as it works to keep inflation from accelerating. The Fed has raised rates four times since June, and has seen little sign that the economy's growth has slowed.
Because higher interest rates can cut into corporate profits, investors have been favoring stocks of companies whose profits are growing fast, namely, technology stocks. But some of those favorites fell yesterday as investors sold shares to lock in profits from a big run in recent weeks.
Cisco Systems declined 2 1/2, to 128, and MCI WorldCom slipped 2 1/4, to 4713/16 .
"Markets are currently going through a period of trial, where upward pressure on rates continues to take their toll on most financial instruments," said A. C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan Associates in Santa Barbara, Calif.
By late afternoon, however, some big gains from a handful of technology stocks powered the Nasdaq index higher. Rambus rose 4019/64 , to 15147/64 on the expectation that Intel will use its technology to manufacture high-speed computer chips.
Ultimately, investors are correct to place their money on the promise of technology, Mr. Keating said.
"There are two kinds of companies you've got to own: the techs and the companies that can most successfully implement technology to stay ahead of the pack as interest rates go higher," he said.
Later this week, the government will release data on producer prices and consumer prices. Both reports are considered important gauges of inflation pressures lurking in the economy. Also, the chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, will testify before the House Banking Committee tomorrow.

HEADLINE: Profits at Deere Down in Quarter

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MOLINE, Ill. Feb. 15

 BODY:
Deere & Company, one of the world's largest farm equipment makers, said today that profits in its most recent quarter fell 24 percent on continued slack demand for farm equipment but still beat Wall Street estimates.
The company said it earned $37.7 million, or 16 cents a diluted share, which was down from $49.7 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales in the period, which was the first quarter of Deere's fiscal year and ended Jan. 31, dropped to $2.34 billion from $2.46 billion a year earlier. 
 The profit was better than the 6 cents a share expected by Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial, and Deere's shares were up $1.44, to $40.44, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Some analysts had expected Deere to post a loss in the quarter, which would have been its first operating loss in seven years.
The company said it expected sales, excluding the effect of inflation and currency exchange fluctuations, to rise about 10 percent in fiscal 2000 compared with 1999, fueled by gains in commercial and consumer equipment.

Treasury Prices Fall on Report of Higher Factory Output

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were down moderately yesterday, after a stronger-than-expected gain in industrial production raised investor concern about further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve Board in the months ahead.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 8/32 to 1004/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.24 percent, from 6.22 percent on Monday. 
 As expected, financial markets traded in fairly narrow ranges ahead of Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to Congress tomorrow on monetary policy and the state of the economy from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman.
Treasuries initially fell after the government reported that industrial production rose 1 percent last month; economists had expected a 0.6 percent increase. Production rose 0.4 percent in December.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said, "Against a background of a booming economy and an extremely low unemployment rate of 4 percent, the Federal Reserve is expected to tighten interest rates once again at its March 21 Federal Open Market Committee meeting in order to pre-emptively guard against potential inflationary pressures in the future."
He said the Fed was likely to maintain upward pressure on interest rates until definitive signs emerge of a more moderate pace of growth. Mr. Fine pointed to the current spread between the two-year Treasury note rate and the federal funds rate as a clear indication that the bond market expected the Fed to raise rates another half percentage point, "with a glint of possibly more beyond that."
Economic reports are expected to continue to highlight the torrid pace of growth. Mr. Fine noted the surge in industrial production in January. This spurt in production resulted in an advance in capacity utilization, which rose 0.5 percentage point, to 81.6 percent.
January housing starts, to be released today, are likely to fall after a jump in December, but Mr. Fine said housing activity to date had shown only scant signs of decline, and did not suggest an imminent sharp slowdown in economic activity.
Another important indicator will be Friday's release of the Consumer Price Index. While inflation must still be characterized as benign despite the 2.7 percent rise in the index last year, the energy sector bears watching.
"Although the structure of the American economy and behavioral patterns regarding energy costs have changed relative to the past," Mr. Fine said, "the fact remains that rising energy costs have not yet woven their way in the overall price structure, and while the impact today may not be what it once was, it nevertheless should not be dismissed."

Wal-Mart Has Its Ups And Downs

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
Propelled by strong growth in its superstores and international operations, Wal-Mart Stores reported another year of record sales and profits yesterday. So, naturally, its stock declined.
The retailer, the largest in the world, said that its revenue for the year ended Jan. 31 was a whopping $165 billion, a 20 percent increase from the previous year. 
 The increase was all the more impressive because it came after a 17 percent revenue expansion last year and a 12 percent increase the year before, proving that the juggernaut is only gaining speed.
To put those sales in perspective, total retail spending in the United States was $3 trillion in 1999, according to the National Bureau on Income Statistics. So, stripping out income from international stores, which was some $22 billion, Wal-Mart accounts for nearly 5 percent of the entire American pie.
Not only was sales growth big at Wal-Mart, it was broad. All major divisions, from the Sam's Warehouse clubs to the discount stores, reported gains in sales and profits (the international division actually had an 85 percent expansion in revenue).
The retailer's profits rose 26 percent, or $1.25 a diluted share, for the full year. For the fourth quarter, the company earned 43 cents a share, ahead of the 42 cent estimate of Wall Street analysts, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
Investors responded to the good-news fest by unloading stock. Wal-Mart's shares fell 87.5 cents, to $58, largely on concerns that the retailer would be hard pressed to exceed this year's blistering growth.
In a conference call with stock analysts, H. Lee Scott Jr., the chief executive, added to the worries by warning that the company would have to contend with higher oil prices and higher labor costs. Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., has about a million Americans working for it, making it the largest employer in the nation.
Wal-Mart is also experiencing a cyclical problem. Retail stocks have been depressed by investors' concern that continuing increases in interest rates by policy makers at the Federal Reserve will dampen consumer demand in the coming year.
"The stock's softness is more a reflection of institutional investors' concerns about how a Fed hike will affect consumer spending," said Jeff Feiner, a retail analyst with Lehman Brothers. "But the underlying fundamentals of the business will continue to be strong."
But Wal-Mart, which tends to err on the side of caution when predicting future growth, is positioned for another banner year.
For starters, it is still expanding its Supercenters. Supercenters are outsized stores that combine discount store merchandise with grocercies and a pharmacy, and they have been a particularly profitable form of retailing. Wal-Mart built 157 of these monsters last year and predicted an equally aggressive expansion this year.
More important, Wal-Mart could actually benefit from higher interest rates. Who better to benefit from consumers' watching the bottom line than a chain famous for its low prices? Gucci and Tiffany's might become jittery when the Fed raises rates, but Wal-Mart is full of consumer necessities.
Moreover, while rising wages and fuel prices are tough on businesses, Wal-Mart is better prepared than its competition is. "Wal-Mart can spread out fuel and labor costs over a dense volume of merchandise because they are more efficient," said Burt Flickinger III, managing director of Reach Marketing, a marketing consulting firm in Westport, Conn. "It could be a critical competitive advantage."
The company, meanwhile, declined to confirm or deny a report yesterday in the retail industry trade paper, Women's Wear Daily, that it was set to buy Fruit of the Loom, the apparel manufacturer that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December. Wal-Mart has had great success reviving apparel makers, including Faded Glory and Catalina, and turning them into profitable house brands.

HEADLINE: Internet Executives Are Reassured AfterWhite House Meeting

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Executives from the nation's leading Internet companies told President Clinton at the White House today that despite hacker attacks that disrupted several major Web sites last week, they saw no need for an increase in government regulation of the industry.
The meeting was organized months ago to discuss ways to prevent the World Wide Web from being used for terrorism but took on a sudden urgency with last week's events, in which several sites were disrupted for hours. Those sites included Amazon
.com, Yahoo and eBay. 
 Many in the industry feared the government would cite the hacker attacks as evidence of the need to expand its role in regulating Internet security. But after today's meeting, many of the two dozen executives who sat down with Mr. Clinton said they were reassured that he had no such intention.
"In dealing with the challenge of security on the Internet, private industry must take the leadership role," said Harris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of America.
Mr. Miller, whose trade group represents many of the leading information technology companies, told reporters after the two-hour meeting that it was important that the computer industry -- not the government -- oversee Internet security because "the private sector has made the Internet the vibrant and dynamic thing that it is today."
Officials of the Clinton Administration seemed to go to great lengths to reassure industry participants -- including a reformed hacker turned security consultant who went by the Internet nickname "Mudge" during his hacker days -- that there was no intention to impose new regulations on them that could impede the growth of the Web.
Commerce Secretary William M. Daley told reporters after the meeting that the administration would do nothing that would damage the Internet.
He said the government's role was to support the industry, and that companies were properly taking the lead in enhancing security. "It is not about the government regulating this or taking steps or actions that would at all impede the Internet because, of course, it is the dynamic engine that is driving our economy today and we must keep that open."
David Starr, the chief information officer for the 3Com Corporation, said after the meeting that "everybody was concerned going in that the government would use this as an excuse for more involvement in the Internet. But we were pleasantly surprised that they didn't."
Mr. Starr said one of the issues discussed at the meeting was whether the government could do anything to improve security on the Web to ensure that last week's incidents were not repeated. "The answer was clearly no," he said.
Mr. Clinton opened the meeting with a reference to last week's cybersalvos by hackers who are still being sought by the the F.B.I., saying that the attacks were "a source of concern, but I don't think we should leave here with this vast sense of insecurity.
"We ought to leave here with a sense of confidence that this is a challenge that was entirely predictable," he said. "It's part of the price of the success of the Internet."
It was not, he added, "an electronic Pearl Harbor."
Federal law enforcement officials said today that they were seeking to interview two young computer enthusiasts who might know about last week's attacks. But the officials cautioned that the people were not necessarily themselves suspects and that they did not anticipate any early arrests.
Whitfield Diffie, the corporate information officer of Sun Microsystems Inc., who attended the meeting, said the participants were relieved when Mr. Clinton quickly made it clear that he believed the industry had thrived because the government had applied a light hand.
"There was a general agreement on the desirability of the industry solving our own problems," he said.
Mr. Diffie said the industry leaders at the meeting were intent on letting the White House know that "the real expertise on these problems is in the industry."
At the same time, many of the participants acknowledged that there had been insufficient attention to security in some parts of the industry. "It's clear that we've got to do a better job," said Nicholas M. Donofrio, senior vice president for I.B.M.'s technology group.
He said most of the security tools already existed to prevent incidents like those last week, but that some companies had not deployed them.
As an example, he said, many computers come with a factory-installed default security system that is meant to be changed when it is put into operation. "We believe that a third of them are never changed but left just the way it arrived from the factory," he said. He described that as the equivalent of buying a briefcase with a three-digit combination lock that opens when all the numbers are at 0-0-0 and never changing the combination.
"This was a wake-up call, not a crisis," he said, employing a description used by several of the participants. "The time to fix things is now before there is a real crisis."
But like his colleagues, Mr. Donofrio was firm in saying that "this is a problem mainly for the private sector."
Some of the company officials said if the industry was to be left to solve the problems by itself, as they had urged, there had to be greater coordination and more uniform security standards.
Clarence Chandron, executive vice president for the Nortel Networks Corporation, said the group agreed that "we really need to focus on implementation now," including "a massive communications effort throughout the industry" to make sure other companies install the security systems needed to avert these kinds of attacks.
This work, he said, would most likely be coordinated by the Information Technology Association, the trade group that coordinated the industry participation in today's meetings.
Mr. Miller said his group had proposed a plan in which Internet companies would commit themselves to sharing information among themselves, including how to deal with security vulnerabilities.
The industry participants today spoke regularly and politely about the need for a continuing partnership with the government in improving computer security. But their concept of what role the government would or should have was decidedly limited.
They generally wanted the government to maintain high security for its own computers and keep up with the changing technology. "So that when we speak, they understand us," said Mr. Donofrio of I.B.M.
John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, who has been in charge of computer security, said the government had not done a good enough job of securing its own computer systems. "We need to make the government a role model," he said.
Mr. Clinton has proposed a 16 percent increase in financing for computer security issues, to $2 billion. Mr. Podesta said this would include a proposal to address the problem of having the most gifted computer security specialists quickly leave government for more lucrative positions in the private sector.
The administration is proposing a subsidy to help with education costs for computer students who would then be obligated to serve for a time with the government.
The White House provided this list of people who attended the meeting:
Douglas F. Busch, vice president of information technology, Intel; Clarence Chandran, president, service provider and carrier group, Nortel Networks; Vinton Cerf, senior vice president, Internet architecture and engineering, MCI Worldcom; Christos Cotsakos, chief executive, E*Trade Group; Jim Dempsey, senior staff counsel, Center for Democracy and Technology; Whitfield Diffie, corporate information officer, Sun Microsystems; Nick Donofrio, senior vice president and group executive, technology and manufacturing, I.B.M.; David Farber, University of Pennsylvania; Elliot Gerson, chief executive, Lifescape.com; Adam Grosser, president, subscriber networks, Excite@home; Dr. Stephen Kent, BBN Technologies (GTE); David Langstaff, chairman and chief executive, Veridian; Michael McConnell, Booz-Allen; Mary Jane McKeever, senior vice president, world markets, AT[T] Roberto Medrano, senior vice president, Hewlett-Packard; Harris N.

HEADLINE: LESSONS;
A Conservative Picks a Path Less Taken

BYLINE: By Richard Rothstein; E-mail: rrothstein@nytimes.com

 BODY:
TOURING South Carolina, John McCain is accompanied by Lisa Keegan, the magnetic schools superintendent from Arizona, his home state, who handles inquiries about his education proposals. Widely admired by conservatives, Ms. Keegan would be on a short list for secretary of education in any Republican administration.
Ms. Keegan has been a conservative flag-bearer in the education wars, demanding publicly financed vouchers for parents to use at private schools. She wants market forces alone to regulate education. She acknowledges that when parents choose a school, it might be better if they knew how it taught reading and math, but she insists that they should nonetheless be allowed to choose on any basis they wish. 
 In Arizona, she has promoted tax credits for donations to private voucher plans. And last year she received the annual award of a foundation sponsored by the conservative economist Milton Friedman, who has championed privatized schooling since 1955.
But Ms. Keegan could ultimately surprise us, and perhaps herself. When outsiders like her accept real responsibility, solutions that once looked simple to them may no longer seem practical. Now in charge of Arizona's school accountability, she must decide which schools are successful, and the stakes have become particularly high for her: she has presided over a big expansion of charter schools, and unfair standards would harm charters as well as regular schools.
Ms. Keegan's challenge is this: to defend low-scoring schools outside the regular system, she is being forced to acknowledge that students' social and economic hardship, as well as school quality, affects results. This insight is incompatible with the idea, typically advanced by fellow conservatives, that public schools must be failures if they cannot themselves eliminate the rich-poor gap in scores.
More than 30,000 Arizona children are now in charter schools, twice the enrollment share of charter schools in any other state. Charters get state financing and are freed of almost all curricular and personnel rules. In return, they are supposed to achieve, or be closed. The idea is that regular schools, fearing loss of students, will also improve. For such competition to work, the state schools superintendent must report achievement for both regular and charter schools. And because charters promise results, Ms. Keegan plans to recommend closing those that perform poorly.
But which will they be? In Arizona, scores at charter schools are about the same as at regular schools. From 1997 to 1998, regular schools' fourth-grade math scores rose from the 48th to the 51st national percentile, while charters' went from the 42nd to the 43rd. In reading, regular schools' scores were unchanged at the 52nd percentile, but charters' dropped from the 52nd to the 50th.
This, Ms. Keegan knows, does not mean charters are failing. She professes no concern if a school's scores are low, provided students' annual gains compare favorably with gains in schools that have similar students. It is this relative standard that defies conventional cliches. David Garcia, Arizona schools research director, says schools will be compared only with those where students have similar socioeconomic backgrounds or "extenuating circumstances."
Charter schools can be nontraditional. Some recruit dropouts; simply getting many of those youths to stay in class may be a success, and so it would not be fair, Ms. Keegan believes, to judge such schools only by test scores. Her recommendations for closing will consider mitigating factors and emphasize "multiple measures" of success, for regular and charter schools alike. For example, a school might be considered adequate if students, though testing poorly, later succeed at community college.
This is a bold approach. By contrast, Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, last year gave private vouchers to parents at two low-scoring public school "failures." Those schools enrolled very poor children, and tried to improve results with innovative programs. Lisa Keegan's measures might not find failure there. (As in Florida, New York policy makers resist alternative academic measures and now identify school failure by low scores alone, without considering Ms. Keegan's "mitigating factors.")
Ms. Keegan has not yet detailed how she will decide whether to call for a school's closing. She will almost certainly be pressured by critics who contend that she whitewashes schools that serve hard-to-educate children and achieve high gains but low scores. Perhaps she came to these ideas only from a desire to excuse low-scoring charters. But because she takes the challenge so seriously, Lisa Keegan could transform education debates, providing conservatives and liberals common ways to evaluate schools.

HEADLINE: New York Is Ranked High For Deadly Heart Attacks

BYLINE: By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE 

 BODY:
White women in New York State had the highest death rates from heart disease among white women in the United States, and New York ranked second highest in the number of deaths among women over all, the first national study of heart disease in women by region, race and ethnic origin has found.
The study, published yesterday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and by West Virginia University, found that the death rates from heart disease were generally highest in the impoverished, rural areas of Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta and elsewhere in rural Southern states. 
 But the study also found pockets of high death rates elsewhere, too, particularly in four densely populated cities: New York, Chicago, Detroit and New Orleans. States with the lowest death rates were in the West, and the rates were low to moderate in the Midwest.
"Contrary to what many people believe, heart disease is the leading cause of death for women," said the surgeon general, Dr. David Satcher. While heart disorder has long been regarded as a "men's" disease, Dr. Satcher said the study provides a perspective on the threat heart disease in women.
Dr. Michele L. Casper, an epidemiologist at the C.D.C. who is the chief author of the study, said she was surprised by the New York findings because the high rates generally appeared in Southern rural areas where many women, particularly the elderly, might live isolated and alone, perhaps unable to care for themselves or get to a doctor.
Dr. Casper also said many rural areas had no coronary units that could sometimes prevent heart attacks or cardiac rehabilitation centers that could prevent recurrences. Such conditions might also apply to poor women living in densely populated urban areas, she said.
Dr. Casper said the current research was designed specifically to pinpoint differences in death rates among different groups of women and how the rates varied from region to region. Further studies would examine the causes, she added.
But the researchers said social and economic factors, including the style of living, were also possible reasons for the disparities in death rates generally and for the high rates in New York.
Dr. Antonio M. Gotto, dean of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City, said life style might be responsible for as much as 50 percent of the incidence of heart disease among women. In New York, he said, a great ethnic, cultural and economic diversity produces great differences in the way of living and in patterns of behavior, including diet, intake of fat and cholesterol, physical exercise, smoking, blood pressure and money to pay for treatment.
Among other findings of the study were these:
*The states with the highest death rates from heart disease were Mississippi, New York, ; and West Virginia.
*The lowest-ranking states among the low range of death rates were in the Pacific Northwest, the Rocky Mountain region of Colorado and New Mexico and in parts of Wisconsin and North and South Dakota. The Midwest was in the moderate to low range.
*Women in Minnesota were the most likely to survive heart disease, the study found, while white women were most likely to survive in Hawaii.
Some 370,000 women died of heart disease nationally in 1997, the last year for which figures are available. Annual rates of mortality among women, a total of 401 per 100,000 women, the C.D.C. statisticians said, were greater than for all forms of cancer combined for women.
Disparities in heart disease death rates among men will be studied next.
Dr. Nancy Krieger, an associate professor in the department of health and social behavior at the Harvard School of Public health, said the researchers were trying to move beyond the limitations of current health data.
"You just can't look at heart disease mortality among women," Dr. Krieger said. "Epidemiology research shows that what matters are the conditions you lived in when you grew up, as well as how you are able to live as an adult and the quality of care you receive" when medical care is needed.
The research confirmed previously known disparities between the five major racial and ethnic groups in the United States: that significantly more black women die from heart disease than any other group, but that whites are much more likely to die from heart disease than Asian and Pacific Islanders, American Indians and Alaska Natives.
Among black woman, the death rate from heart disease was 553 per 100,000; among white woman, 388 per 100,000; American Indians, 259 per 100,000, and Asian and Pacific Islanders, 221 per 100,000. The rate for Hispanic woman of all races was 265 per 100,000.
Counties with the highest death rates for white women were roughly the same as those for black women -- that is, in Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta, except that for whites there was a greater concentration along coastal regions of the Southeast. And the highest state rates were New York, followed by Mississippi and West Virginia.
In New York State, the death rate for all 4,929,714 women was 487 per 100,000, compared to the national average of 401. For black women the rate was 573; for whites, 477; Asian and Pacific Islanders, 236, and American Indians and Alaska Natives, 212.
Mississippi had the highest death rate for black women, 686 per 100,000.
In New York City the death rate for all 2,019,225 women was 561 per 100 thousand; for black women the rate was 587; for whites, 559; Hispanic women, 320; Asian and Pacific Islanders 248, and American Indians and Alaskan Natives, 97. The average number of deaths from heart disease among white and Hispanic women was highest in Manhattan; for blacks, Asians and Pacific Islanders, Brooklyn; American Indians and Alaskan natives the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn.

Study Says the Internet Increases Social Isolation
The nation's obsession with the Internet is causing many Americans to spend less time with friends and family, less time shopping in stores and more time working at home after hours, according to one of the first large-scale surveys of the societal impact of the Internet.
The report raises the specter of an atomized world without human contact or emotion. That conclusion may prove controversial because some online enthusiasts say the Internet has fostered alternative electronic relationships that may replace or enhance face-to-face family and social connections.

HEADLINE: Production Surged 1% In January

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 15

 BODY:
United States industrial production in January posted its largest gain in 18 months as factories, utilities and mines all increased output, Federal Reserve figures showed today.
Production rose 1 percent last month, after gaining 0.4 percent during December. The plant-use rate, which measures the amount of industrial capacity put to work, rose to 81.6 percent in January from 81.1 percent, which had first been reported as 81.3 percent. 
 "This is an unambiguously strong report," said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.
Before the report, analysts had expected an increase of 0.6 percent in production and a plant-use rate of 81.5 percent.
The January increase in industrial production was the largest since a 1.8 percent gain in August 1998 when General Motors factories restarted production after a two-month strike. The plant-use rate was the highest since it was 81.9 the same month.
By category, manufacturing output rose 0.9 percent in January -- the biggest gain since October -- after rising 0.2 percent in December. Last month's rise was led by autos, semiconductors and industrial machinery.
Production of business equipment, including computers and semiconductors, rose 1.9 percent after a 0.2 percent drop in December and no change in November. That suggests businesses delayed buying new equipment until after the start of the new year to avoid Year 2000 computer-related problems.
Mining output rose 1 percent after showing no change a month earlier, reflecting a rebound in oil and gas drilling as oil prices rose. Output at utilities rose 1.8 percent atop a 4.2 percent increase in December.
By industry, auto and truck production rose 4.2 percent in January after falling 3.6 percent in December. Automakers are benefiting from the strength in consumer spending, which has been fueled by the lowest unemployment in three decades.
Production of semiconductors and other electrical components rose 4.4 percent last month after increasing 5.3 percent the previous month.
Output of construction supplies rose 0.2 percent in January after falling 0.2 percent in December. Sales of new homes finished a record year for the housing industry. The year ended with sales of 904,000 new homes, topping 1998's total of 886,000 and setting a record for the second consecutive year.

HEADLINE: Commuter-Tax Repeal Goes Before Top Court

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 15

 BODY:
The repeal of New York City's commuter tax went before the state's highest court today, and the judges reacted skeptically to the city's claim that the state could not end the tax without the city's consent.
The judges of the Court of Appeals also heard arguments from New Jersey and Connecticut that the state must repeal the tax on their residents who work in the city if it is to repeal the tax on New York State residents who make the same commute. 
 The commuter tax, which generated $360 million a year for the city, was abolished for in-state residents last year by state lawmakers, in a flurry of one-upmanship over a special election for a State Senate seat in Rockland and Orange counties.
After the Republican and Democratic candidates for the seat promised to do away with the tax, a perennial irritant to suburbanites, the cause was taken up by legislative leaders of both parties trying to bolster their parties' claims to tax cutting and the allegiance of suburban voters. That led to the sudden repeal of the tax.
The tax, imposed in 1966 and increased in 1971, was 0.45 percent of taxable income for most taxpayers. The repeal applied only to state residents, but the measure included a clause saying that if the law was found to discriminate against people commuting from out of state, it would be repealed for them, too. A trial court and a state appeals court have both found the distinction to be illegal, but commuters from other states have continued paying the tax, pending a ruling by the Court of Appeals.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani sued to challenge the repeal, citing a provision of the state Constitution saying that the state cannot enact laws affecting just one city or town without a "home rule message," a request by the local government for the change. His stance puts the mayor on the unpopular side of an issue dear to the suburban voters he is courting as he runs for the United States Senate.
Elizabeth I. Freedman, the assistant corporation counsel arguing the case for the city, told the judges today that the repeal "was a special law targeted to the city of New York."
But some of the judges took issue with that claim. When people outside the city are subject to the tax, Judge Richard C. Wesley asked, "How can you say this is a matter purely of New York City's interest?"
Ms. Freedman disputed the claim the Legislature made in the repeal bill that it had a compelling interest in eliminating the tax to promote economic growth. "What was really at issue was the outcome of the election in Rockland County," she said.
But several judges countered that she was asking them to get inside lawmakers' heads, which they described as unwise to try to do. Judge Joseph W. Bellacosa said there was no reason for the court to look any further than the lawmakers' stated intent in determining their motives for passing the repeal.
Judge Wesley noted that the state Constitution specifically says that the state can never surrender its authority over taxes. He also pointed out that the commuter tax law mentions not New York City, but cities of more than one million people -- a common trick among Albany lawmakers to write laws that apply only to the city without appearing to single it out.
On the issue of applying the tax to out-of-staters only, lawyers for Connecticut and New Jersey cited several decisions by the United States Supreme Court saying that similar forms of discrimination violated multiple sections of the Constitution that are generally aimed at preventing states from interfering with one another.
Connecticut's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, said New York's commuter tax "is precisely the kind of levy that our founders sought to prevent."
But New York State's lawyer, Deputy Solicitor General Edward Johnson, argued that those Supreme Court decisions left a little room for variations in taxation -- enough, he said, for a tax that amounted to just $5 a week per person, on average, to be justified. The Supreme Court, he said, only required "a rough equity," not precise equality.
Some judges expressed sympathy for that argument, noting other cases of unequal treatment, such as universities that charge higher tuition to out-of-state students. "We seem to abide that without any problem,"
Judge Albert M. Rosenblatt said.

HEADLINE: Mohegans to Build $800 Million Casino Expansion

BYLINE: By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 15

 BODY:
Straight out of the depressed backwoods of southeastern Connecticut, an incongruous image emerges: a glittering 40-story hotel, a 10,000-seat sports arena and a second casino building featuring a perforated-steel planetarium 150 feet in diameter on its ceiling.
But that -- and more -- is what Mohegan Indian tribal leaders will unveil Wednesday as part of a planned $800 million expansion, the latest volley in the battle for gambling dollars being waged by Connecticut Indian tribes against one another and by both together against the moguls of Atlantic City. 
 The four-year-old Mohegan Sun casino, in Uncasville, Conn., 128 miles from New York City, plans to offer visitors a sprawling entertainment complex built to rival the enormously lucrative Foxwoods Resort Casino run by the Mashantucket Pequot tribe 10 miles to the east in Ledyard.
Once the Mohegans' expansion is complete, probably in two years, both tribes expect Connecticut's gambling industry to significantly cut into the drawing power of better-known casinos in this country and abroad.
"It will make Connecticut much more a force compared to Atlantic City," said Mitchell G. Etess, executive vice president of marketing for Mohegan Sun, now the fourth-largest casino in the United States. Bob DeSalvio, a vice president of marketing at Foxwoods Resort Casino, went a step further, saying, "I think that Connecticut is becoming a very powerful force in the gaming industry nationally and internationally."
The expansion of the Mohegans' gambling operation is also expected to double the 20,000 daily visitors to their casino and add 4,000 jobs to the entire complex, which currently employs 5,500 workers, Mr. Etess said.
The $325 million Mohegan Sun opened in October 1996; the much larger Foxwoods Resort Casino opened in Ledyard in 1992. The two tribes are the only two in Connecticut recognized as tribes by the Federal government, a necessary prerequisite to opening a casino.
The Mohegans expect that their new casino's debut, expected in April 2002, will push gross gambling revenues to "well over a billion" dollars annually from about $750 million, Mr. Etess said.
All told, the casino expansion project, designed by the New York City firms of Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates and Rockwellgroup, is expected to add a total of four million combined square feet of gambling, retail and entertainment space.
Outside, the monolithic hotel tower will be a landmark visible from Long Island, across Long Island Sound, its designers say. Inside, natural light will filter into the new casino and refract off crystals and panels -- 26,000 square feet in all -- of translucent woven multicolored beads, said David Rockwell, an architect with Rockwellgroup. Where the existing casino has an Earth-based theme, the new casino is meant to convey the notion of sky, he said.
Above the new casino's slot machines and gambling tables will hang a giant steel planetarium with a 65-foot cropping of backlit black onyx, Mr. Rockwell said. The hotel lobby will feature 10 abstract wooden sculptures in the form of trees whose arching canopies will be made of beads.
"It gives us the chance to create something that is much more than just a casino," Mr. Rockwell said in an interview today. "This is going to take it to a way, way different level."
On a more conventional plane, the project blueprints also call for a cavernous retail mall and what Mohegan Sun officials say will be the largest ballroom in the Northeast.
Grand as the $800 million construction project is, it will leave the Mohegans' casino complex measurably smaller than Foxwoods, which the Pequot leaders have called the world's largest casino. The expanded Mohegan Sun, for instance, will have 280,000 square feet of gambling space, compared with 315,310 square feet at Foxwoods.
The new Mohegan hotel, which will rival the tallest structure in Connecticut, City Place 1 in Hartford, will have 1,200 rooms; Foxwoods has 1,416.
The Mohegans were planning to release further details of the casino's dimensions and design at noon Wednesday at Rockefeller Center.
From a labor standpoint, the casino expansion "is a wonderful thing," said Donald M. Peppard Jr., a professor of economics at Connecticut College in New London. "Ten years ago, this area was sort of an employment disaster."
On the other hand, there is already a shortage of able workers. Once the casino begins hiring, he said, "If you're another employer around here, you're going to be pulling your hair out."
Mr. Peppard said that roughly half the gamblers at the casino were Connecticut residents.
In New London, about 15 miles south of the casino, most people welcome the expansion, said Riochard Brown, the city manager. "I think the expansion is positive," he said.
Though the expansion is meant to steal some of the monstrous revenues from Foxwoods -- which industry analysts have estimated to be over a billion dollars a year -- Mashantucket Pequot leaders said they wished their rivals well.

Connecticut Luring New York Tourists

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Residents of the New York metropolitan area are heading to Connecticut for short vacations at a record clip, a new study says.
Tourists from metropolitan New York spent $100 million on Connecticut attractions and related businesses in 1999, an increase of 46 percent from the year before, the study says. 
 Based on Connecticut's $2.5 million tourism budget, the state recouped $40 from New York City-area tourists for every dollar spent, said Ed Dombroskas, executive director of the Department of Economic and Community Development's Office of Tourism.
He credited the increase to a new strategy: advertisements featuring only the state's bigger attractions.
The state's tourism industry generated $5 billion in 1999, up from $3.8 billion in 1992, Mr. Dombroskas said Monday.
The study, which was conducted by Witan Intelligence Strategies of Avon, Conn., showed large increases in specific areas of spending. Lodging revenue jumped 24 percent, retail spending increased 41 percent and restaurant revenue rose 6 percent.
The study was conducted by a telephone poll of 700 people from metropolitan New York who had called the Office of Tourism.
Mystic continues to be the No. 1 destination in Connecticut for travelers from New York. Ninety percent of New York travelers were repeat visitors.

HEADLINE: Marriage, Fairness and Taxes

 BODY:

To the Editor:
As a liberal Democrat and a supporter of progressive taxation, I am surprised to find myself disagreeing with your Feb. 13 editorial "A Bloated Tax Cut for Marriage." While I understand the complexities involved in eliminating the marriage penalty, I believe that it should be alleviated for all taxpayers, not only the low- and middle-income earners covered under President Clinton's plan. 
 Married people are healthier and more economically stable than single people, and children of married people do better on a variety of indicators. Marriage is thus a socially responsible act. If the Republican plan is not the best one for eliminating the marriage penalty, perhaps we should look at other alternatives. But there must be some way of spreading the principle of support for marriage throughout the tax code.

HEADLINE: Leak at Indian Pt. Nuclear Plant Prompts Shutdown and an Alert

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN with MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
A leak in a steam generator at the Indian Point 2 nuclear reactor in Westchester County released a small amount of radiation from the plant last night, forcing officials to shut it down and declare an alert.
The plant's owner, Consolidated Edison, stressed that the leak was what it called "momentary" and that there was no danger to residents of the surrounding area or to employees of the plant. 
 But the declaration of the alert -- the second level of four categories of nuclear emergency -- was the first issued by Con Edison since the Indian Point 2 plant opened in 1974. Con Ed officials said last night that they did not know what caused the leak.
The leak in the 1,000-megawatt plant, in Buchanan, about 35 miles north of New York City, occurred about 7:30 p.m., said Michael Spall, a Con Ed spokesman. It allowed hot, radioactive water, which is supposed to be kept isolated, to mix with clean water that is boiled into steam. The steam then flows out of the reactor's containment dome into a turbine that spins to generate electricity.
The leak of radioactive gas into the air occurred because the plant has a system for ejecting air from the steam process in order to limit corrosion, Mr. Spall said. He added, however, that "several seconds later" the system diverted the air back to the containment dome, limiting the amount of radioactive gas released.
"Any releases would have posed no threat to the safety of plant personnel or the general public," he added. "While this is a serious event, it is not one that threatens public health and safety."
There are four levels of response to incidents at nuclear plants: a notification, an alert, a site area emergency, and a general emergency, which is what occurred at Three Mile Island.
Last night, Con Ed quickly sent monitoring teams to the plant's perimeter, but they found radiation levels to be normal, Mr. Spall said.
Although the plant produces about one-seventh of the power used by Con Ed's three million customers, officials said there was no power shortage, nor would there be one because other plants in the region would supply the power.
Dennis Michalski, a spokesman for the New York State Emergency Management Office, said that Con Edison followed all the proper safety procedures, and alerted the state agency's office in 15 minutes. He added that the leak "occurred within the generating structure, but they shut off the valve so none of that steam left the facility."
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission received a report from Con Edison at 8:07 p.m., within the one-hour reporting time limit. Mr. Spall said the leak was in a steam generator, which is a heat exchanger inside the containment dome. The leak opened a path for mildly radioactive water to flow out of containment and into the turbine hall, from which "a small amount" -- he did not known how much -- was released to the environment, he said.
Indian Point's steam generators, four of them for each reactor, are towering metal vessels, filled with thin-walled metal tubes, in the shape of an upside-down U. The tubes are filled with water that flows through the nuclear core to the steam generators and then back to the core, carrying heat away from the reactor so it can be used to make electricity. This water gradually picks up radioactive contaminants.
Outside the tubes there is clean, nonradioactive water, which is pumped in and boils. The steam flows out through giant pipes, through the heavy concrete and steel wall of the containment dome to the turbine hall, which is used to spin a turbine and make electricity. This nonradioactive steam is then run through a big metal cooling box called a condenser, where it is turned back into water. The condenser is kept cool with water from the Hudson River.
At midnight, Mr. Spall said that operators had shut off the flow of steam from the steam generator, and shut off the flow of water that is boiled into steam. And they had reduced pressure in the reactor to 1,000 pounds per square inch, he said. Normal operating pressure is above 2,000 pounds per square inch. But bringing the reactor to cold shutdown -- when it is cool enough to open up without the cooling water boiling away -- was still several hours away, he said.
Other reactors of similar design, called pressurized water reactors, have had steam generator problems.
Indian Point 3, which is owned by the New York Power Authority, had corrosion and cracking problems with its steam generators, and replaced them. But Con Edison said it did not need to, perhaps because it paid closer attention to water chemistry, to limit corrosion.
Rochester Gas & Electric's Robert E. Ginna reactor suffered a steam generator tube rupture in 1982. Many other plants have been closed for months by steam generator tube problems.
With the economic value of nuclear plants much diminished by changes in technology and in utility rules, it was not clear whether it would pay to replace the steam generators, if that were to become necessary. Like an old car that needed a new transmission, a severe steam generator problem could lead to retirement.
Con Edison said earlier this month that it would offer the reactor for sale this year.
Indian Point 2 has had a spotty history in recent years. In 1994, the plant broke the world record for longest continuous operation -- 19 months -- of a light-water reactor, the kind used in the United States and most of the rest of the world.
But in December 1996, a minor chemical spill forced the plant to shut down. In 1998, the plant was closed again, that time for several months, because of safety concerns. And last September, the plant was temporarily shut down after a series of electrical problems caused the system to misread temperature and pressure readings.

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT;
When Young Managers Deliver the Pink Slips

BYLINE: By CHARLES BUTLER 

 BODY:
They were in high school or college when the great wave of layoffs swept corporate America in the early 90's. And while they heard stories about neighbors who had lost their jobs, they didn't give them much thought.
Now, these 20-somethings are thriving in the longest economic boom in American history. Many are managers, and holding onto employees, not letting them go, is their main concern. But when pink slips must be delivered, these young bosses often have to deliver them. 
 "My biggest fear was, I don't want this girl to walk out of here and hate me," said Michelle Anderson, the accounting manager for the MA&A Group, a consulting firm in Atlanta, who at 26 last April fired a female associate more than six years her senior. It was a first for her, and it was an ordeal.
"You're sitting there and going, 'I'm younger than this person and I'm affecting her life completely today,' " Ms. Anderson said.
Seven months later, she had to repeat the process, firing the associate's replacement.
Of course, managers have always had to dismiss underlings when their performance lagged or the company's profits sagged. Even Internet success stories like Amazon.com and iVillage.com recently had to trim their staffs for economic reasons.
But not so long ago, the bearer of bad tidings was usually an old pro, or at least someone old enough to know how to cope with the emotions surrounding it. Today, increasingly, the dirty work is done by people a few years out of college for whom management has mostly meant recruiting employees with stock options and playing the host at happy hours.
And their inexperience can create problems for companies. For instance, several employment lawyers say they are noticing an increase in age-discrimination suits resulting from the way young managers dismissed older workers. According to Rosemary Alito, a lawyer with McCarter & English in Newark, age discrimination "is becoming more an issue where you have younger people in high-level positions."
Moreover, many Internet companies and other start-ups are likely to be targets for suits because they often do not even have human-resources departments in place to conduct dismissals properly, she said.
Compounding the problem, says Adin Goldberg, a lawyer with Whitman Breed Abbot & Morgan in New York, many young managers are not practiced in politically correct office-speak. Mr. Goldberg recently advised a company to settle an age-discrimination suit involving a 25-year-old sales manager who fired a salesman in his 50's. The employee said the manager repeatedly made references to wanting "a fresh approach" in the office. While the phrase is vague, Mr. Goldberg said, most juries would interpret it as denigrating to the older worker.
Aside from the legal implications, young executives are often not equipped to handle the emotional side of firings. For Jennifer Floren, 28, the chief executive of experience inc., a Boston Internet company she founded in 1996, the memory of one of her first dismissals remains vivid.
"The woman burst into tears and started screaming, 'This is so unfair. How could you do this to me? Please give me one more chance,' " said Ms. Floren, whose Web site, www .experienceinc.com, provides career advice to college graduates. "It is so tempting to say, 'O.K., stay one more day, one more week.' "
While she avoided making that concession, she has hired a human-resources manager to handle personnel issues, including dismissals, at the 65-employee company.
Senior executives of MA&A would not let Ms. Anderson -- or any of the firm's other managers -- dismiss an employee without her going through training sessions. In the days leading up to the morning last April when she would dismiss an employee for the first time, Ms. Anderson spent several hours with the company's human-resources manager, Ellen Warden, in role-playing simulations. The coaching prepared her for reactions ranging from tears to tirades and provided a script to deliver the news sensitively but legally.
"I had rehearsed so much, I think I was a tape-recorder," Ms. Anderson recalled.
The morning of the firing, after a bad night's sleep, she arrived at work earlier than usual and paced the hallways. As soon as the employee arrived, she was called into a conference room where Ms. Anderson, accompanied by Ms. Warden, dismissed her.
"It went a lot better than I expected," Ms. Anderson recalled. "The woman said to me, 'I know this is probably harder for you than me.' "
To be sure, not every 20-something goes through such an emotional crisis. "Of course it gnaws at your stomach because you have the fate of someone in your hands," said one young executive of a Manhattan high-technology start-up who fired an employee during the Christmas holiday.
But, added the executive, who requested anonymity for fear of scaring off prospective employees, "We were confident he could get something else."
Other young managers take a similarly businesslike approach. Court Coursey, 27, says it was hard for him to lay off five employees shortly after the company he founded, certifiedmail.com, was acquired by WebMD Inc., in 1998, "especially in a high-growth company where it's a team-like atmosphere."
But, added Mr. Coursey, who now runs a holding company that develops Internet companies, "At the end of the day it's a business, and you have to make hard business decisions."

 CORRECTION:
An article on the Management page in Business Day on Feb. 16 about the daunting task of young managers who have to fire employees included one example erroneously. IVillage.com says it has never laid off employees for economic reasons and has not recently trimmed its staff.

Chart: "Tips for Beginners"
Never fire on a Friday. The worker will stew all weekend and sue on Monday.
 
Rehearse the termination with a human-resources employee or lawyer to avoid saying something insensitive or illegal.
 
Keep the termination exercise to less than 10 minutes. This is a firing, not a performance review.
 
Be prepared for tears, anger and pleas. But don't give in.
 
Let the fired employee keep his e-mail address for a stated period. The gesture will make you seem understanding.

HEADLINE: A Chapter 11 Filing by Charter Behavioral

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
Charter Behavioral Health Systems, the nation's biggest operator of psychiatric hospitals and treatment centers which has gone into a financial free fall, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors yesterday.
Charter, which is 90 percent owned by Crescent Operating Inc., a company led by Richard E. Rainwater, the financier from Fort Worth, said it made the filing to "ensure continued services to patients" in its units. 
 Charter listed less than $50 million in assets and more than $100 million in debts in filings yesterday at the United States Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del.
The Crescent Real Estate Equities Company, a real estate investment trust also led by Mr. Rainwater, already owns the buildings used by Charter's hospitals and treatment centers.
Three years ago, Charter ran roughly 90 psychiatric hospitals and treatment centers for more than 8,000 patients, many of them children. Operations have now dwindled to 37 units with a capacity of 2,000 patients.
Since last year, the Justice Department and the Department of Health and Human Services have been investigating Charter and Magellan Health Services Inc., which once owned the chain, for Medicaid billing fraud and patient abuse.
In 1997, Magellan Health entered into a complex $400 million deal in which it sold Charter's buildings to Crescent Real Estate and a 50 percent stake in the chain to Crescent Operating, an affiliate of Crescent Real Estate. Because real estate investment trusts cannot operate companies, Crescent Operating was formed by Mr. Rainwater and his associates to hold the Charter stake.
The 1997 deal came as the industry faced cutbacks by insurers on treatment payments. Many former officials of the chain have said that the plan -- which saddled Charter with some $125 million annually in new franchise fees and rapidly escalating rents -- contributed to Charter's financial collapse, undermining patient care in the process.
Officials of Magellan Health, Crescent Operating and Charter Behavioral have said that the chain's problems were caused by the insurance cutbacks, and that the 1997 plan did not affect patient care.
Last year, Magellan Health, the nation's largest behavioral health care company, transferred all but 10 percent of Charter to Crescent Operating.
Yesterday's filing comes a month after Charter said it would close and sell about 35 hospitals and centers. Former employees at some units have filed lawsuits contending that Charter violated federal law by failing to give them sufficient notice of the unit's closings and paying them severance benefits.
Mary E. Olson, a lawyer in Mobile, Ala., representing former Charter employees in three of those actions, estimated that about 5,000 former workers at the chain had been affected by the recent closings.
Karen Keiser-Jenkins, a spokeswoman for Charter, which is based in Alpharetta, Ga., declined to comment on the lawsuits. But in a news release, Charter said it was "unable to fully fund all benefits" to staff members dismissed before yesterday's filing.
In a release, Crescent Operating said that Mr. Rainwater would guarantee a bank loan that Crescent Operating plans to use to buy the reorganized company. Mr. Rainwater would be compensated for that guarantee, the company said. He is the largest shareholder in both companies and was the biggest stakeholder in Magellan Health at the time of the 1997 deal.
Last Friday, Jeffrey L. Stevens, an official of Crescent Operating and an associate of Mr. Rainwater, told Charter executives that the chain had $60 million in debts, according to a former Charter official who was informed about that meeting.
Ms. Keiser-Jenkins said that she was not aware of the meeting. Mr. Stevens did not return calls in recent days seeking comment.
Under a proposed plan, Crescent Real Estate would initially lease the 30 Charter facilities it owns to Crescent Operating for $20.3 million, a 13.3 percent annual return, the company said. That rate would rise by 5 percent annually.
Crescent Real Estate would also receive the proceeds of any sales of buildings once used by Charter.

HEADLINE: Data on Housing Industry Is Stronger Than Expected

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Construction of new homes and apartments increased unexpectedly in January, and permits for new projects climbed to the highest level in a year, suggesting builders will stay busy in months ahead even as interest rates rise.
Starts of new housing rose 1.5 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.775 million units after jumping 5.1 percent in December, the Commerce Department said today. Analysts had expected a decline of 4 percent. 
 "Consumer confidence has remained strong, and buyers are feeling pretty good," said Fred Cooper, vice president for finance at Toll Brothers, a builder based in Huntingdon Valley, Pa.
"I don't think the interest rates at current levels" are chasing potential homeowners away, he added.
 Builders are still trying to catch up with last year's record sales. Toll's backlog for the quarter ended Jan. 31 was up 31 percent from the similar quarter a year ago, Mr. Cooper said. It takes a builder 5 to 11 months to finish a home after it is ordered. "We're pretty comfortable fiscal 2000 is going to be a record year," he added.
January's increase was paced by a 17.7 percent surge in starts of apartment buildings and other multifamily dwellings.
Construction of single-family houses fell 2.1 percent. The West led the nation with a 7.3 percent increase, while starts fell in the Northeast, where winter weather affected construction.
The housing report showed permits for all new housing construction rose 8.7 percent in January to an annual rate of 1.763 million units -- the highest since January 1999. Permits for single-family homes rose to the highest annual pace since February 1999.
The level "makes it clear that higher rates notwithstanding, new home construction will continue at a breakneck pace for several months to come," said Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa.

HEADLINE: Police Official Said to Lead Crisis-Management Agency

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is expected to name a senior police official to head the city's Office of Emergency Management, a four-year-old agency created to handle municipal crises ranging from subway crashes and water main breaks to potential chemical or biological terrorist strikes, city officials said yesterday.
The police official, Richard J. Sheirer, the department's deputy commissioner for administration, could be appointed this week, according to several senior city officials, who said the announcement had already been postponed once because of the mayor's scheduling conflicts. 
 Mr. Sheirer, 53, spent 29 years in the Fire Department, rising from a fire dispatcher to deputy commissioner under Howard Safir, then the Fire Commissioner. He joined the Police Department in April 1996 when Mr. Safir replaced Commissioner William J. Bratton.
Mr. Sheirer would succeed Jerome M. Hauer, an expert on civilian response to chemical and biological terrorism who has a master's degree in public health. Mr. Hauer, who is a consultant to the Pentagon and the Department of Justice, has built what is regarded as the premier emergency management program in the United States.
A spokesman for Mayor Giuliani, Matthew Higgins, would not comment on a replacement for Mr. Hauer and Mr. Sheirer did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
The emergency management office was created to coordinate the activities of the multitude of city agencies that respond to incidents like blackouts, disease outbreaks and acts of terrorism. The office also develops emergency plans for the city and training programs.
But the office's relationship with the Police Department has long been strained, particularly over who has ultimate responsibility to handle some emergencies. Those tensions only increased around the millennial celebrations, as both agencies prepared for possible calamities, from computer failures to a feared attack on New Year's revelers in Times Square.
Mr. Sheirer, who has a bachelor's degree in political science from St. Francis College in Brooklyn, brings to the job his experience in the Police and Fire Departments -- the two agencies most involved in emergency response -- and his close working relationship with Mr. Safir.
But he has little background in the complex world of antiterrorism, where Mr. Hauer is an acknowledged expert.
Some city and police officials have criticized the selection of Mr. Sheirer, saying his closeness to Mr. Safir would place the Office of Emergency Management too close to the Police Department and undermine some of its independence.
But others praised him, saying that his experience in both the Police and Fire Departments and his background in emergency communications make him a good candidate for the job.

HEADLINE: No Fiscal Conservatives Here

BYLINE: By P. J. O'Rourke; P. J. O'Rourke is the author, most recently, of "Eat the Rich."

 BODY:
George W. Bush and John McCain both claim to be fiscal conservatives. But what is a fiscal conservative? And who is the true conservative when it comes to fiscal matters?
Is it Mr. Bush, with his dramatic tax cuts and his vow to protect Social Security's revenue surpluses? Is it Mr. McCain, with his more prudent tax reductions, his emphasis on paying down the debt, and his openness to a privatized element in the Social Security trust fund? Or is it Bobo the sock puppet, here on my hand, who promises everyone in America a personal Web site, a billion-dollar I.P.O., a back rub and a Lincoln Navigator? 
 To a true fiscal conservative, tax cuts don't matter much, and neither does the national debt. That is because the real problem is spending. Even the best and most necessary public spending comes with a harrowing price: the percentage of a nation's goods and services controlled by its government is the percentage of freedom and independence taken from individuals and given to politicians. Currently, just at the federal level, that's about 18 percent of your life.
Think of politicians as visiting in-laws. Either George or John (or Al or Bill) will be coming over every Saturday morning and won't leave until halfway through the basketball game on Sunday afternoon.
Government spending diverts wealth from the brilliant, if somewhat erratic, intelligence of the free market to the absolutely reliable stupidity of the political arena. But while politicians may be stupid about spending, they are very sharp about how to finance their expenditures. Government can pay its bills with tax money, run up a budget deficit or print more cash, creating inflation. Inflation hurts the saver, deficits hurt the investor, taxes hurt the earner, and all three are usually the same person: you.
Mr. Bush hardly mentions cuts in federal spending. Mr. McCain would eliminate "corporate welfare," which, according to the Cato Institute, costs the taxpayer an estimated $65 billion a year -- 3.5 percent of federal expenditures. No presidential candidate has made a serious promise to cut overall government spending since Ronald Reagan. And we know how that went.
The Social Security trust fund is another thing that doesn't matter to a true fiscal conservative -- because the Social Security fund doesn't exist. The trust fund is a figment of legislative imagination and consists of nothing but a wishful proposal to give old people some money, later, maybe.
Yet Mr. McCain said that as president, he would put money aside "to make sure that those who paid into the Social Security system get what they're entitled to."
George Bush said he would "reserve the Social Security surplus for Social Security itself."
Thanks for nothing. Having government save its own money in a Social Security trust fund is like having me collect my own I.O.U.'s. What I'll get is a pocketful of cocktail napkins, matchbook covers, Post-it notes and torn-out notebook pages.
The only way to make the Social Security trust fund real is to make the money in it really belong to someone, which is to say privatize it. Mr. Bush finesses the notion. Mr. McCain is willing to try some measure of privatization, but only after Social Security is reformed though "an inclusive deliberative bipartisan process."
That should be sometime during the second Trump administration.
What really does matter about Social Security to a fiscal conservative is that Social Security is an entitlement. The conservative is appalled by a change in emphasis in American politics, from negative to positive rights. About that Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain are silent, possibly because they're off looking up definitions of the terms. Negative rights are the more-the-merrier kind. My freedom of speech stimulates your freedom to tell me I'm wrong. My choice of worship does not impair your ability to slip out of a pew and go play golf.
But entitlements are positive rights, and they are limited by finite resources. A "right to medical care" costs money. Money spent on your Prozac prescription is money that can't be spent on giving my grandmother a new hip.
Entitlements destroy citizenship. If the purpose of the political system is to give me nice things -- low taxes, fat retirement benefits, free flu shots -- then my vote should be auctioned to the highest bidder. Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain are making some generous offers. But not so generous as Bobo's. I suggest a write-in this November. I promise to be a dignified and gracious First Thumb.

U.S. ImposesSanctions On Oil Venture in Sudan

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
The United States imposed sanctions today on a multinational oil venture in Sudan, a project that critics say has helped the government there finance a religious war against southern rebels.
The Treasury Department's sanctions prohibit American companies and citizens from doing business with the Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company, a joint venture between Sudapet, Sudan's national oil company, and Chinese, Malaysian and Canadian partners. The sanctions ban trade and financial transactions with the joint venture and freeze any assets it has placed in United States banks. 
 The sanctions do not cover the foreign parent companies that backed the oil venture. Some members of Congress and human rights groups had urged the Clinton administration to punish Talisman Energy, the China National Petroleum Corporation and Petronas, the leading oil companies in Canada, China and Malaysia, respectively, for their involvement.
Sudan's Islamic government has used oil revenue to fuel its war against rebels in the mainly Christian and animist southern part of the country, Western religious and human rights groups have argued. The civil war has gone on for 17 years and killed millions of people.
Since 1997, the United States has banned all trade, loans and aid to Sudan, accusing the Khartoum regime of allowing slavery, supporting terrorism and seeking to overthrow neighboring governments. Today's sanctions were an extension of the earlier action, coming after the Treasury Department determined that the oil project was essentially part of Sudan.
"We made a strong finding that the Sudapet project is part of the country," a senior Treasury official said. "Once we did that, applying sanctions was more or less automatic."
The United States imposed sanctions just two days after Canada made the opposite decision, electing to spare Talisman and Sudan itself from punishment. Talisman, which has a 25 percent stake in the Sudapet project, is one of the few large Western companies willing to invest in Sudan, and has come under pressure to sever links.
The Treasury Department's sanctions are not expected to affect Talisman directly. Company officials told reporters today that they had separated the finances and operations of the Sudanese joint venture from those of the parent company. Still, Talisman shares fell 2.30 Canadian dollars, or 5.6 percent, to 38.80 Canadian dollars in Toronto trading.
Likewise, the sanctions are unlikely to affect China National Petroleum, known as C.N.P.C. The state-owned company is planning to list shares on the New York Stock Exchange this spring, an offering underwritten by the Goldman Sachs Group. C.N.P.C. is selling shares in a new subsidiary called PetroChina that consists exclusively of the company's domestic assets.
Some human rights groups and members of Congress have urged the Clinton administration to take stronger action against the three foreign companies that backed the Sudan venture. Representative Frank R. Wolf, Republican of Virginia, has argued that the administration should block the planned United States listing of the C.N.P.C. subsidiary because of its ties to Sudan.
"Anything they do to punish those companies, I support," Mr. Wolf said of the Clinton administration. "But I would like to see it broader. This is one of the major moral issues in the world today."
The senior Treasury official said the Trading With the Enemy Act, under which sanctions against Sudan were imposed, does not allow the administration to punish third-country companies, only United States citizens and United States companies.

Bradley Says Clinton and Gore Neglected Upstate New York

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH with KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: BUFFALO, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Turning his attention to upstate New York, Bill Bradley said today that the federal government had not invested enough money in the region's depressed economy and criticized Vice President Al Gore for not spending enough time here.
Addressing small crowds in Buffalo and Rochester, Mr. Bradley said one reason that upstate cities had not benefited from the recent economic boom nearly as much as other regions was that the Clinton administration had not spent enough on economic development projects here. While the national employment rate increased by almost 19 percent in the 1990's, Mr. Bradley said, the employment rate in western New York grew by only 2.5 percent. 
 "One of the things we can do in being a good steward of the good economy is to recognize that not every place in America is booming," Mr. Bradley told about 200 students and administrators at Erie Community College in Buffalo.
Mr. Bradley said several times that Mr. Gore had neglected upstate New York. "Al Gore says he's been to California 60 times since he became vice president," he said. "My question to him is, how many times has he been to western New York?"
Mr. Gore last visited upstate New York on Monday, when he delivered a speech in Rochester on education.
Responding to Mr. Bradley, Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said, "Al Gore has been fighting with the administration to expand prosperity all across the country while Bill Bradley was out on the speaking circuit making money for himself."
Mr. Bradley last visited upstate New York in October, when he made stops in Albany and Syracuse.
Today, Mr. Bradley also lamented the rising cost of heating oil, a pressing issue throughout New York and particularly upstate.
As he has done before, Mr. Bradley called on the Clinton administration to release oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to drive down the cost of home heating oil. The administration has refused to release oil from the reserves, saying it should be saved for emergencies.
President Clinton said today that he would provide low-income families in the Northeast with $125 million to help with the rising cost of home heating oil, on top of $200 million provided earlier this season.
Mr. Bradley praised the administration for granting the heating subsidies, but at the same time, his campaign said "the real intended beneficiary was Al Gore." According to a press release from the Bradley campaign, New Hampshire received $5.4 million in heating subsidies last month, on the eve of that state's primary, while New York received only $2.6 million. The press release suggested that a $34 million subsidy that New York received this month was timed to arrive near the state primary, March 7, so that Mr. Gore would win more votes here.
Mr. Hattaway scoffed at Mr. Bradley's suggestion.
"The release was intended to help low-income people stay warmer," he said. "'I was in New Hampshire, and it was cold."
While Mr. Bradley spoke tonight in New York City at the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center, Mr. Gore today received the endorsement of the Empire State Pride Agenda, one of the state's largest gay and lesbian groups. On Friday Mr. Gore received the backing of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian group.
Jeff Soref, co-chairman of the New York group, acknowledged that Mr. Gore and Mr. Bradley had similar positions on gay issues but said his group chose Mr. Gore because "the Clinton/Gore administration has brought unprecedented changes" for gays. In thanking the group, Mr. Gore noted that he was "the first vice president to speak at a gay-rights event."
Mr. Gore said he would appoint a commission to study "how domestic partners should be recognized."

HEADLINE: Christian Groups Urge a Vast, Coordinated Attack on Poverty

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
Concerned that poverty persists in America despite a prolonged period of national prosperity, a broad group of Christian leaders gathered in Washington yesterday to call for an effort by churches, businesses, labor and government to help poor people.
The group's statement, a "Covenant to Overcome Poverty," urges religious organizations to make working on behalf of the poor a priority. It also asks people to evaluate political policies and candidates "by how they impact people who are poor." 
 The document was signed by officials of evangelical and mainline Protestant organizations, including the National Association of Evangelicals and the National Council of Churches, as well as by ministers of African-American churches and representatives of several Roman Catholic groups.
"We want to put poor people on the national agenda -- they're not there now," said the Rev. Jim Wallis, a leader in Call to Renewal, a five-year-old coalition of religious organizations that wrote the statement. The statement noted that one in every five American children is growing up in poverty but that the proportion is higher -- one in every three -- among children of racial minorities. Mr. Wallis said the religious leaders believed that a "moral constituency" was needed to focus attention on finding ways to alleviate poverty, especially for children's sake.
"The obvious constituency is the churches, given how clear the Bible is" about an obligation to help the poor, said Mr. Wallis, who is also editor of Sojourners, a religious magazine based in Washington. "When you have rising inequality and record prosperity at the same time, it's a biblical issue."
The statement said, "Just as some of our religious forebears decided no longer to accept slavery or segregation, we decide to no longer accept poverty and its disproportionate impact on people of color." The document called for making alleviation of poverty "a bipartisan cause," and was issued by the signers on the steps of the Capitol.
In a telephone interview afterward, the Rev. Wes Granberg-Michaelson, general secretary of the Reformed Church in America and chairman of Call to Renewal, said that while the various participating Christian groups might disagree on "specific policy positions," they were united in their belief that a shared national effort on behalf of the poor was needed. He said they agreed that poverty could be relieved neither by the churches alone nor exclusively by government programs.
The statement was issued after three days of Washington meetings, involving some 500 people from religious organizations around the country, that were organized by Call to Renewal to discuss how local groups were trying to help the poor.
"We've been laying the groundwork all across the country" with such local efforts, Mr. Wallis said. "And now we're building a network" to link the groups. He said he hoped that working against poverty would emerge as a leading moral issue.
"Part of what might be happening," he said, "is, you reach a new millennium and find some leftover questions that did not get resolved and then become the primary moral issues."

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Tigers Win Big One On Assist From Selig

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
The season hasn't even started, and the Detroit Tigers have already registered a victory. They scored one over Commissioner Bud Selig, and the surprising aspect of it was he let them have it. Not a good start to the season for the commissioner. Baseball's impartial arbitrator may be the next to hand him a loss, that one on the John Rocker grievance.
If the arbitrator, Shyam Das, should overturn or even reduce Selig's 73-day suspension of Rocker for his ugly comments about all sorts of groups, the commissioner would have the excuse that he was unable to do anything about it. But in the Tigers' case, Selig has been a willing accomplice. He has allowed the Tigers to blatantly flout his directive on interviewing minority candidates for certain jobs. 
 In fact, not only has Selig failed to discipline the Tigers, but he has also praised them for taking what some skeptics might see as a cosmetic step designed to get them off the hook with the man whose powers were recently enhanced so that he could fine a team $2 million.
"I heard they were going to be fined," said one club executive, who was clearly disappointed to learn that the Tigers hadn't been fined. "Some people assumed that one of the reasons this new power was given was that he'd be able to fine clubs more if they didn't address the inequality in hiring."
About six months before the Tigers hired Phil Garner as their manager, the commissioner clearly set out his position on interviewing minority candidates. That's right, interviewing, not hiring. Baseball is a game that is played slowly and makes advancement at glacial speed. Last April Selig sent a directive to all clubs outlining the steps they were to take if they had vacancies in any of five positions of decision-making authority, including manager and general manager.
"If a club has an opening in any of these positions, the club owner must notify me personally," he said in a letter to owners. "In addition, your list of candidates must be provided to me. I expect the list to include minority candidates whom you and your staff have identified. I will provide assistance to you if you cannot identify candidates on your own."
Selig also told the owners he would discipline clubs that did not "aggressively pursue equal opportunities and initiatives."
When the Tigers decided last October to make a managerial change, they did not (1) notify Selig of the vacancy, (2) provide him with a list of their candidates, (3) identify any minority candidates or (4) seek assistance in identifying candidates.
Then, heaping insult upon insult, the club president, John McHale Jr., when asked about the Tigers' failure to follow the directive, said, "There isn't a legal obligation to adhere to any directives from the commissioner's office."
The Tigers got away with it because they established a community advisory board dedicated, in the words of a news release from the commissioner's office, "to Equal Employment Opportunities, their Diverse Business Partners Program and their community relations activities." Selig, in the release, called the Tigers' plan "a very progressive and sensitive series of programs."
He praised the club for recognizing the problem and addressing it, adding, "That, I believe, is more important than taking disciplinary action."
On the telephone yesterday, Selig said he expects the Tigers' program to be beneficial to baseball and to the Detroit community. "This is not just a glitzy thing," he said. "They have many announcements to come. They're going to be meaningful. The economics of it will be good in terms of what they're spending and what they're going to be doing. As much as I would have fined them, they're going to spend a lot more than that."
Selig talked about minority suppliers and minority banks, but his directive talked about positions whose holders control budgets and have the authority to make decisions in baseball operations. The Tigers, like most teams, still have a white manager, a white general manager, a white assistant general manager and a white scouting director, positions specified in the directive. If members of minority groups aren't interviewed, they can't be hired. That was the message behind Selig's letter.
The club executive who lamented Selig's failure to fine the Tigers raised the postulation that the Tigers' behavior was worse for baseball than Rocker's remarks. Rocker's comments, he reasoned, were the act of an individual; the failure to interview and hire members of minorities is institutional.
If there is a hint here of a double standard at work, consider some other issues that baseball officials have ignored. While Rocker has been suspended for 73 days and fined $20,000, his employer in Atlanta, Ted Turner, has made a career of making outrageous statements about ethnic groups and remains undisciplined. Marge Schott should have been so widely ignored.
The Braves also continue to encourage their fans to perform the tomahawk chop that American Indians find offensive. The Cleveland Indians offend the same group with their name and their Chief Wahoo emblem. For many years they defended their use of both by explaining that they were honoring a former player who was an Indian. Recently, the Indians admitted that well, maybe that wasn't quite the real story.
Baseball doesn't necessarily have to conform suddenly to the strictest practice of political correctness, but its officials and teams might want to try their hand at consistency.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
Running Into Controversy

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

 BODY:
The presence of the Confederate battle flag above South Carolina's State Capitol is a hot-button political issue that has reverberated beyond Saturday's state Republican primary and into the world of Olympic distance running.
The United States women's marathon trials will take place in Columbia on Feb. 26, where the flag flies over the Capitol even though many consider it a symbol of slavery, segregation and the Ku Klux Klan. 
 USA Track and Field, the sport's national governing body, has issued a statement in support of the removal of the flag from the South Carolina Statehouse, although it has not called for postponing the race or for moving it to another location.
The track federation has also offered to assist marathoners who wish to support an economic boycott of the state, which has been called for by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Runners who wish to avoid patronizing hotels will be housed by local families in Columbia, the federation said in a letter sent to the approximately 200 qualifiers for the marathon trials.
"This would minimize the economic impact of your visit to South Carolina," said the letter, which was signed by Craig Masback, the chief executive officer of USA Track and Field and by Patricia Rico, the federation's president.
The flag issue has fostered a heated Internet debate about the responsibility of athletes to use their public positions as a platform for addressing social and political matters. Some college sports programs are also joining the fight against the flag. Last week, Swarthmore College announced that it was canceling spring-training trips to South Carolina for its tennis, lacrosse, softball, golf and track and field teams, joining other Philadelphia-area schools such as Haverford College, Bryn Mawr and Temple, which have also voided trips for tennis and lacrosse teams in support of the N.A.A.C.P.-sanctioned economic boycott.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association has also been asked by a coaching group that the South Regional of the men's college basketball tournament be removed from Greenville in 2002 if the Confederate flag continues to fly above the Statehouse.
The Southern Conference, which includes such schools as Furman and the Citadel, has called for a removal of the battle flag and has indicated that it will consider moving its 2001 postseason basketball tournament from Greenville, S.C., and the 2002 and 2003 tournaments from Charleston if the issue is not resolved by the current session of the South Carolina legislature.
"We have confidence things will be resolved; that's what we're hearing through the grapevine," said Alfred White, commissioner of the Southern Conference. He noted that South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges had won support from several black legislators for moving the Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse to a monument of a Confederate general on the Capitol grounds.
A statement issued this week by USA Track and Field said that, "For many Americans, the Confederate flag is a symbol of subjugation and segregation. We urge the South Carolina legislature to remove the Confederate flag from its Statehouse as soon as possible."
In an interview, Masback said that it would be impractical to move a 26.2-mile race at the last minute, as well as unfair to athletes who have been preparing for months for the Columbia course. He said the federation decided to take a public stance on the flag issue after being encouraged to do so by some of its officers and athletes. Jill Pilgrim, the general counsel for the federation, also said the track group was bound by contractual obligations to keep the race in Columbia.
Mike Moran, a spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee, said the U.S.O.C. was bound by its constitution not to make political statements unless athletes were being deprived of the right to compete. The 2000 Summer Games are scheduled in September in Sydney, Australia.
The 1996 trials were held in the South Carolina capital, which won the 2000 Olympic marathon trials two years ago after a competitive bidding process. The state N.A.A.C.P. began calling for an economic boycott last July. Considering that time frame, along with the fact that race organizers have also called for a removal of the Confederate flag, N.A.A.C.P. leaders said they did not oppose the holding of next week's marathon trials.
"We are glad that the Carolina Marathon Association has taken a stand on the issue," said Lonnie Randolph, president of the Columbia branch of the N.A.A.C.P. "They are not violating sanctions per se. But I did meet with race officials and expressed to them the hope that they will support our efforts in the future and not return until the matter is resolved."
Katrina Price-Crosby of South Pasadena, Calif., an African-American who will compete in the Olympic trials at 5,000 and 10,000 meters in July in Sacramento, said canceled a race appearance in South Carolina last December. She added that she has also canceled plans to attend the marathon trials to cheer on her friends. She has asked them to support the economic boycott by bringing some of their own food and by not renting cars while in the state.
Price-Crosby and Steve Holman, an African-American who is America's top miler, said they have begun exploring the idea of manufacturing red, white and blue ribbons that could be worn as lapel pins by the marathoners as a sign of silent, individual protest during next Saturday's race.
"I'd wear one in a heartbeat," said Kristy Johnston of Shepherdstown, W.Va., who has the second-fastest qualifying time. She said she had considered wearing a confederate flag pin with a line through it on her ball cap, but was afraid "I could get shot by some redneck." She said she planned some sort of flag protest during the race.
"I hope I'm in a position to express my opinion," Johnston said. "It seems like majority of people in South Carolina don't want the flag there. It's amazing a small group of people have kept the flag flying. It's unbelievable to me it's still up."
Alisa Harvey of Manassas, Va., who might be the only African-American in the women's marathon trials, said that she would consider wearing a ribbon, but added, "We need to run a race and deal with this afterward."
Holman, who lives in Arlington, Va., has vociferously called for the female marathoners to make some sort of statement about the flag during the Olympic trials.
"I would say to anyone with a microphone that if the Olympics are about bringing people across the world together, why does South Carolina continue to support a flag that stands for keeping people apart?" he wrote in a column on the online version of Runners World magazine.
In an interview, Holman said: "If they were flying a swastika, would Jewish athletes sit on their hands? I think it's pretty unlikely."
Gwyn Coogan, who finished fourth at the 1996 Olympic trials, said that she thought it was "a shame that people feel the need to fly the flag," and that she felt conflicted about competing in the 2000 trials.
"It would be great if I could say, 'I disapprove of that flag, it represents terrible things to many people, therefore I'm not going to run in the race,"' said Coogan, who lives in Frederick, Md.
"Not running would be the ultimate way of saying you agree with the N.A.A.C.P. tourism boycott. In a sense, I'm very much violating their boycott. But this event happens every four years. I've been planning to do it for four years. I need to run this race."

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S NEWS CONFERENCE: THE POLITICAL ANALYST;
Clinton Isn't Running for Office, but He Has a Lot to Say About the Race

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
His name is not on the ballot, he reminded the audience. He is just another voter, he said. But President Clinton could not resist weighing in today on the first political campaign season in decades that did not directly involve him.
The president declared himself a supportive spouse, but not a senior adviser, for Hillary Rodham Clinton in her bid for a Senate seat in New York. And he said he was not concerned that his wife was trailing Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York in the polls. 
 "I think she's doing remarkably well, given the unusual nature of the campaign and the formidable obstacles out there," Mr. Clinton said at his first, formal news conference of 2000. "And I think now the people will begin to listen and debate, and I think she's doing real well."
His role?
"I'm basically doing for her what she's always done for me," he said. "I'm talking to her about whatever she wants to talk about. I'm giving her my best ideas."
Mr. Clinton was reluctant, initially, to weigh in on the presidential contest. "I'm not running for office and, by and large, I think I shouldn't comment," he said. "There may be a few exceptions."
Many of the journalists questioning Mr. Clinton, fresh from the campaign trail, eagerly sought out those exceptions.
"Maybe this will be one of the exceptions that you'll be willing to make," said Claire Shipman of NBC News, offering a question on former Senator Bill Bradley's attacks on the veracity of Vice President Al Gore in the Democratic presidential contest.
Mr. Clinton bit, defending the vice president for having been "brutally honest" over the last seven years.
"When it was an unpopular thing to go into Kosovo, he wanted to do it," Mr. Clinton said, offering other examples of Mr. Gore's candid nature.
"When it was unpopular to go into Bosnia, he wanted to do it," Mr. Clinton said. "When it was unpopular to stand up for freedom in Haiti, he wanted to do it. When only 15 percent of the people thought we ought to help Mexico, but I knew it could hurt our economy, he was right there. And I could go on and on."
But Mr. Clinton stopped short of criticizing Mr. Bradley for doubting Mr. Gore's truthfulness, saying the vehement back-and-forth between the two candidates was typical campaign heat.
"I have never seen a tough race where people fought with each other, where they didn't have different interpretations of each other's record and each other's positions," Mr. Clinton said. "And then once you disagree with someone's position or someone's record, then the person will say, 'I just think you're mischaracterizing it.' "
Mr. Clinton said later that he thought Americans were too smart to blame a candidate -- Mr. Gore -- for personal mistakes made by someone else -- Mr. Clinton.
"I think the implication that anybody would be held responsible for somebody else's mistake or misconduct is just -- it's a real insult to the American people," the president said. "And they're not going to do that. That's not in their interest, and it's not in their nature. They're too smart and too good for that"
At times, Mr. Clinton came across as magnanimous toward the two Republicans seeking to replace him. He said all four major presidential candidates -- Republicans John McCain and George W. Bush included -- were "people of accomplishment, people who have certain convictions, people who have, I think, pretty clear philosophies and records."
But Mr. Clinton, brushing off a question about how often his name has been disparaged on the campaign trail, still showed his partisan ways.
"I have a lot of sympathy with Governor Bush and Senator McCain," he said, barely able to suppress a smile. "I mean, it's hard for them to figure out what to run on. They can't run against the longest economic expansion in history or the lowest crime rate in 30 years or the lowest welfare rolls in 30 years."
He continued: "They've got a tough job, and I have a lot of sympathy with them. And I don't want to complicate their problems by saying any more about them."

HEADLINE: Senaor Kerrey Accepts Presidency of New School

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

 BODY:
Senator Bob Kerrey, the Vietnam War hero and political maverick, is leaving the Senate -- and Nebraska -- for Greenwich Village, where he will run the New School University, known for both its strong graduate programs and its sometimes quirky classes like "Gym Culture and the Modern Amazon."
The liberal Democrat, who once considered resurrecting his bid for the White House, said he had been planning to run for a third Senate term until the school approached him. The more he thought about it, he said, the more he liked the idea of an academic post. He announced last month that he would not seek re-election. 
 Mr. Kerrey, 56, said he would bring varied credentials to the job, which starts when he leaves office next January, ranging from an undergraduate pharmacy degree to a specialty in demolition as a Navy Seal to helping the University of Nebraska expand its curriculum onto the Web.
His one experience in academia, he readily admits, was teaching a course on Vietnam in California in 1987, a post that he said he took in no small part because it allowed him to spend the worst months of the Nebraska winter on a beach in southern California. But he says the new job will allow him to pursue a longstanding interest in education. "I will be addressing what I consider one of the most difficult problems in higher education," he said in an interview from Omaha, "in that it is becoming less and less accessible to the middle class because of the costs."
Mr. Kerrey, who is chairman of the Federal Web-Based Education Commission, said he wanted to pursue the idea that the Web could be used to run a school more efficiently and lower the costs.
The school, founded in 1919, gradually rose in stature in the 1930's and 1940's when it served as a haven for social scientists fleeing persecution in Germany and other countries.
The school at first offered graduate degrees in fields like economics, philosophy, political science, psychology and sociology, but over the decades it gradually expanded. It took over the Parsons School of Design and the Actors Studio Drama School and added other academic divisions offering study in management, urban policy and music. It changed its name in 1997 from the New School for Social Research.
The university has 7,000 students seeking degrees and a full-time faculty of 162, but it is better known for its 20,000 older students in continuing education, its staff of 1,175 part-time instructors and its courses, which run the gamut from English literature to astronomy to photography.
Every catalog brings a selection of more off-beat courses, from basket-weaving, lampshade-beading and other crafts to cultural studies like "Baseball in New York" to even more eclectic social topics -- "Freaks, the Culture of the Grotesque," for example, and "Gym Culture and the Modern Amazon," a course about women and workouts.
Mr. Kerrey said he hoped to teach one class himself, in how to draft a law. He also said the fact that his longtime girlfriend, Sara Paley, a screenwriter, lives in New York was a "happy coincidence."
He will be the school's seventh president. Its sixth, Jonathan F. Fanton, was appointed in 1984 but left the $250,000 post with its official Greenwich Village residence last September to become president of the MacArthur Foundation in Chicago.
The university said that it was attracted to Mr. Kerrey both for his high public profile and his extensive work in education. "We view ourselves as a place of independence," said Philip Scaturro, the school's chancellor, "a place where free inquiry and discussion is valued, and we believe those same values are important to him."
Mr. Kerrey lost his leg in Vietnam and won a Medal of Honor. He was governor of Nebraska and operates a chain of restaurants and health clubs in his home state.
He ran for president in 1992 but withdrew quickly after failing to win much support. He toyed with the idea of running again but dropped the idea in 1998, saying he wanted to run for the Senate again.
His decision not to return to what was a safe seat came as a blow to the Democratic Party, which would like to reverse the Republican's 55 to 45 margin of control in the Senate. Nebraska tends to vote Republican, and the seat is now up for grabs.
The senator had previously said that he might consider being a candidate for vice president. "This doesn't rule it out, but it certainly says to anyone who is thinking of calling me up -- and that list is getting smaller and smaller by the day -- that I am going back to private life," he said. "Barring something spectacular, I intend to keep that commitment."
The senator does not yet have a formal contract with the school. He said he thought he had already identified the most difficult problem he would have adjusting to life in New York after decades in Omaha and Washington.
"I do notice that walking down the streets of New York," he said, "when I hear a horn honk I tend to turn around to wave, so I guess I will have to break myself of that habit."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: COMMODITIES;
Saudi Oil Minister Hints OPEC May Feel Compelled to Raise Output

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer, signaled that prices have climbed too high and may need to fall to ensure stable growth in the world's economies.
The Saudi oil minister, Ali al- Naimi, said during a visit to Tokyo today that oil producers, with prices more than double the levels a year ago, will guard against "any disequilibrium that may negatively impact the world's economic growth." 
 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets late next month to debate output levels, and the comment is the strongest indication so far that OPEC's recent policy of restricting output may change.
Crude oil prices have averaged $24.86 a barrel since mid-August in New York trading. Late today, oil for March delivery settled on the New York Mercantile Exchange at $30.05 a gallon, down a cent, after selling as high as $30.45 during the session.
OPEC, along with other producers including Mexico and Norway, agreed last March to reduce output by about 7 percent to eliminate what was then oversupply. Those cuts are to expire at the end of March.
The producer group is coming under pressure from countries, including the United States, that maintain that high energy prices threaten to curb growth and bring on inflation. President Clinton said on Tuesday that current oil prices were "a deeply troubling thing." He left open the possibility of releasing oil from the nation's strategic reserve if producers continued to restrict supplies.
The OPEC cuts have more than eliminated last year's surplus and helped the commodity price of oil roughly triple from December 1998. Still, divisions are appearing within OPEC on whether to ease the cuts. Kuwait on Tuesday and Iran today dismissed calls to increase output. All decisions on output policy require the unanimous support of the group's 11 members.
United States inventories of crude oil and gasoline fell more than expected in the week that ended Feb. 11, with crude oil supplies near a 23-year low, American Petroleum Institute figures show.
OPEC members' compliance with output limits fell to 63 percent last month from 81 percent in June, according to Dresdner Kleinwort Benson and the Petroleum Finance Company. Saudi output has increased about 350,000 barrels a day in the last six months, to about 7.8 million barrels a day in January.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE SPOTLIGHT;
Old-Line Republican Finds an Independent Streak Among the Voters

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY and DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: GREENVILLE, S.C., Feb. 16

 BODY:
Not quite a decade ago, Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina bought an airplane ticket to Germany and brought home a BMW. Not a car, but a factory. For Mr. Campbell, who had a talent for luring foreign industry, the arrival of BMW meant thousands of new jobs and international cachet for a state once dismissed as a redneck backwater.
But in recent days, Mr. Campbell, who stepped down in 1995 after two terms, has felt the burden of his own success. For two decades, he has delivered his state's primary for every Republican presidential front-runner. Just as New Hampshire has made a habit of deflating front-runners, South Carolina has propped them back up. The state became known as the fire wall, the place where insurgents, notably Patrick J. Buchanan, inevitably flamed out. 
 Mr. Campbell is again trolling for support for yet another wounded front-runner, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, for the Republican primary on Saturday.
But the state he is encountering, a place he dominated and helped revive, is no longer the same. His political machine is intact, but there is a new generation of voters, many of them new to South Carolina, drawn by industries like BMW. They are conservative, but they are not predictable, or necessarily Republicans.
"We probably have a weakened fire wall," said Mr. Campbell, who is now a lobbyist in Washington. "We used to be a state where four or five people ran everything. Now, it's open and it's challenging, and I think that is good for us."
The immediate beneficiary of this evolving political culture is Senator John McCain, who is trying to stoke South Carolina's populist streak and build an improbable coalition of Republicans, independents and alienated Democrats. A decade ago, political observers say, Mr. McCain could never have pulled this off, and even now, his chances of victory on Saturday depend on an unprecedented turnout of natives and newcomers outside the Republican mainstream.
Regardless of the outcome, the competitiveness of the race has underscored how the changing national economy is changing politics everywhere, even in places like South Carolina. It was evidence in New Hampshire, where a new pool of voters created by that state's technology boom helped Mr. McCain trounce Mr. Bush.
But there are new pools of voters here, whether transplants from the Midwest and the Northeast working along the Interstate 85 corridor, or the thousands of retirees, many of them from the military, who continue to repopulate the coastline. There also are younger native Republicans, raised in the state's suburbs, who are less inclined to walk lock step with establishment leaders.
Mr. McCain's candidacy has sparked an open rebellion by two Republican congressmen, Lindsey Graham and Mark Sanford, who have embraced his populist message and have escorted him around the state, partly in hopes of burnishing their own chances at higher office.
"That granular political structure, built up around county courthouses, is all gone now," said Blease Graham, a professor of state history at the University of South Carolina. "Things are so much more fluid now. People are mobile, and the old loyalties are dying."
What is changing South Carolina more than anything is prosperity. The dispute over the Confederate battle flag atop the Capitol is a reminder that the state's past is far from buried. But the present and future are in view: The booming manufacturing zone along I-85 in the north and the retirees flocking to the coast, particularly near Hilton Head, where the accents are often from Chicago and New York.
Not more than 40 years ago, South Carolina suffered endemic poverty, masked by the aristocratic sheen of Charleston. Now the state is a national leader in attracting manufacturing, including $42 billion in capital investment during the 1990's, a boom that created 207,000 jobs. Once isolated, South Carolina now has 500 foreign companies that employ nearly 85,000 people. Of the state's 3.9 million residents, nearly 144,000, mostly from the Midwest and the Northeast, have moved in since 1990.
"If people think we're a bunch of corn pones with pickup trucks and trailers, they're wrong," said Vic Sherlock, a recent transplant from suburban Washington who is now an officer in the Greenville County Republican Party.
"This state is going through dramatic, dramatic growth," Mr. Sherlock said. "There is the old guard and the new guard. There is a very hard-core conservative base. It seems like the new people coming in are predominantly Republican but perhaps not as conservative."
Along I-85, growth is everywhere. In Greenville, the downtown streets are lined with restaurants like Bistro Europa or with bars where conversations are often conducted in German. Local residents have nicknamed the Interstate "the Autobahn" not only because of the high rate of speed but because of the German companies that are alongside.
In Spartanburg, a city northeast of Greenville, the county Republican Party is run by a New Jersey transplant, Rick Beltram. The old mill villages of white frame houses that were built for textile workers are still standing, but most of the mills have closed. A new downtown hotel is planned with a nine-hole golf course, and Republicans hold fund-raisers at the BMW museum beside the factory.
"I told somebody the other day that this place is beginning to look like New Jersey," said Gary Towery, who left Spartanburg more than 40 years ago and returned in 1996, perhaps overstating the comparison a bit. "I look around, and I am mesmerized by the difference in the people. You don't hear the accents as predominantly as you did before."
Few politicians in South Carolina have better gauged the changing moods of the state than Mr. Campbell. He built the state's Republican Party in the 1970's and 1980's, capitalizing on white resentment of the civil rights era and the growing sense of alienation from Washington. He and allies like Senator Strom Thurmond and Lee Atwater, the former Republican strategist, bridged the state's two rival regions, assembling a coalition of Charleston Republicans with upstate religious conservatives, many of whom were moving into the middle class and to the right economically. There were 29 Republicans out of 124 state legislators in 1987; by 1994, the party had a majority and had elected a House speaker.
"He was a party builder, more of a partisan by nature than his predecessors," said Warren Tompkins, Mr. Campbell's chief of staff, who is now the chief strategist in South Carolina for the Bush campaign. "He was able to utilize the growing discontentment with Washington, and the new economic climate, to add people to the Republican Party."
But prosperity has brought a growing independence among voters, as the freshness and rigidity of the earlier conversion to Republicanism had begun to fade. Voters began identifying themselves as independents, splitting their tickets, and black voters became better organized. The turning point came in 1998, when Mr. Campbell's hand-picked successor, Gov. David Beasley, a Republican, lost his re-election bid.
Republicans not only lost the governor's office to Jim Hodges, but their majority in the Legislature was cut, and they failed to dislodge Senator Ernest F. Hollings, a Democrat.
"We have some of the pains that you suffer from when you achieve majority status," Mr. Tompkins said. "You're not as tightly knit as you were when there were only 29 Republicans. Back then, we never had to worry about voters wandering off the reservation."
Now, the Bush-McCain race is the prism through which change is being measured. Whit Ayres, a prominent Republican pollster in Atlanta who once worked in Mr. Campbell's administration, said the influence of newcomers is significant but should not be overstated. The number of people voting in the Republican primary has grown from 149,000 in 1992 to 274,000 in 1996, and Mr. Ayres noted that many of the new residents have joined the establishment embodied by Mr. Campbell.
"If we're talking about the plant manager for BMW in Spartanburg, that person is very much a part of the traditional business establishment," Mr. Ayres said. "But if we're talking about the guy on the factory floor, I think he may be for McCain."
Four years ago, Mr. Buchanan had hoped to shatter the Campbell coalition by dividing the bubbas from the blue bloods with his blunt appeal for trade barriers. But he badly miscalculated. The factory workers who collected paychecks from foreign corporations like BMW, Michelin and Hitachi concluded that tariffs were not in their best interest.
Mr. McCain is taking a different tack, preaching free trade like Mr. Bush, but hammering away at the Washington establishment even as Mr. Bush tries to wed him to it. The great unknown is whether the same wave of independents who voted for Mr. McCain in New Hampshire -- largely under the radar of polls -- will appear in South Carolina. He is counting on military retirees along the coast, just as Mr. Bush has worked the Bible Belt in the upstate.
Frank Brafman, 72, a Republican and chairman of the Beaufort County Council, said Mr. McCain's appeal is one of personality. He said demographic changes in his area skews handicapping. He suspects, for example, that many of the new residents are Democrats, maybe 25 percent. "They are very quiet," Mr. Brafman said, but they do vote in national elections.
"I don't think I've ever experienced anything like this where nobody knows what will happen," said Mr. Brafman, who supports Mr. Bush. "It's different upstate, where Bush has the edge. It's hard to gauge how Republican are going to vote, because ideology has nothing to do with it."
Mr. Sanford, whose Congressional district encompasses much of the state's northern coast, said the notion of voters following orders from above could get someone "clubbed to death with a 7-iron" at the retirement communities on Hilton Head.
"There was this whole notion after New Hampshire that the Southerners in South Carolina would throw out what the Yankees had done," he said. "But in many neighborhoods in my district, there are more Yankees than Southerners. That whole notion just isn't true."
And what of Mr. Campbell? He stood at the back of a Bush rally last week, talking with reporters. He spoke a bit testily of Mr. Graham and Mr. Sanford; he said Mr. Graham, who became famous for his role in last year's impeachment proceedings, is trying out for a United States Senate run, a notion Mr. Graham does not exactly deny.
Mr. Campbell has taken a leave from his lobbying job to help Mr. Bush. He believes Mr. Bush will win. His numbers are rising in the polls, and South Carolina residents love the Bush family. Asked whether politicking was harder today, he laughed. "Probably," he said. "Because we had a lot of success then, and it doesn't come as easy anymore."

HEADLINE: Nuclear Plant Had Warning Over Leakage

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN with MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: BUCHANAN, N.Y., Feb. 16

 BODY:
Consolidated Edison officials said tonight that the steam generator that leaked radioactivity Tuesday night at the Indian Point 2 nuclear plant, setting off a wide alert, had begun showing signs of a leakage problem several weeks ago.
But officials said the problem did not seem serious enough to merit corrective action like shutting down the plant. 
 That early warning is one of several items likely to be reviewed as officials sort through Tuesday's leak, which led to the most serious incident since the plant opened in 1974. The alert at the plant ended at 6:50 p.m. today, nearly 24 hours after the accident occurred.
If any radiation escaped into the air after radioactive water and gas leaked inside the plant, the levels were so low as to pose no possible health risks, officials said today.
But experts said that even if the accident posed no health threat, it raised questions about the viability of the 26-year-old reactor. Replacing the damaged generator would be enormously expensive, and any indication that the plant has serious problems would make it difficult for Con Ed to find a buyer. The company recently said it was seeking bidders for the plant.
Of particular interest to investigators is increased leakage detected this month in the Number 24 generator, the one that failed Tuesday night. This is one of four devices that, using heat from the nuclear core, generate steam that drives turbines, producing electricity.
Normal leakage is about 2 gallons a day in a generator system that circulates millions of gallons daily. About a week ago the leakage rate rose by as much as a half-gallon a day. The additional leakage all came from the generator that sprang the much larger leak Tuesday night. By contrast, that sudden leak had a rate of more than 75 gallons a minute, Con Ed officials said.
James Baumstark, vice president for nuclear engineering at Con Ed, said federal inspectors from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission permanently stationed at the plant never indicated before the incident that the rise in leakage from the suspect generator was serious enough to shut the plant down.
Instead, Con Ed's plant managers ordered plant operators to be on heightened alert in case the early leaks were hinting at a larger failure in the steam generator's innards, which are a nest of thin-walled pipes.
"We were basically monitoring it on a day-to-day basis," Mr. Baumstark said. "Crews were alert to the potential of a steam generator leak such as occurred last night."
Officials said that luckily, when the incident occurred, safety systems prevented any significant release of radiation. Using calculations to determine the worst possible case, Stephen Quinn, a Con Ed vice president who once managed the plant, said the greatest release of radioactivity outside the plant buildings would have been "one-fifth to one-twentieth of the exposure you currently get just from walking in a park, standing on a rock."
The incident was apparently set off when one or more of the 3,200 pipes inside the No. 24 generator leaked, allowing perhaps 5,000 gallons of radioactive water heated by the nuclear core to mix with clean water used to generate steam and run turbines, Mr. Quinn said.
The steam generators have long been considered one of the weakest links in the equipment that turns energy from splitting uranium atoms into electricity. Inside the generators, contaminated water and clean water are separated only by the thin walls of a nickel-based alloy, chosen not for strength or corrosion resistance but for ability to transfer heat.
These tubes have long been known to crack and erode under years of use as hot, high-pressure water wears away the metal, or sludges from impurities in the water cause corrosion.
It will probably take a week of work before the domed containment building will be sufficiently decontaminated for engineers to begin determining the source of the accident, Con Ed officials said.
In a week or so, investigators plan to send small robotic inspection devices into the leaky steam generator, Mr. Quinn said at a news briefing.
Of the four levels of nuclear accident classification, Tuesday's was the second from the bottom.
On Tuesday night, Con Ed officials said that radioactive gas leaked into the air from a plant system that ejects air from the steam process to avoid corrosion. But tonight, Mr. Quinn said, it remained unclear if any radiation at all escaped and wafted into the night air before an emergency valve shut and shunted any gas back into the sealed dome.
He said that 16 radiation detectors taking constant readings around the perimeter of the plant and a mobile team from the Westchester County Health Department, using hand-held detectors, never found any signs of a rise in radiation outside the complex.
But if the accident was small, its impact could be large, especially because the company recently began accepting bids to sell the plant.
"It certainly tells a potential buyer to hesitate, to see how big the problem is," said David Wooley, a professor of environmental and energy law at the Pace University Law School, in White Plains. And, he added, "if you've lost one tube, that's an indication you've got an aging generator, and you're going to see it again."
Another professor at Pace, Edward Smeloff of the Pace University Energy Project, said it was not clear what the incident would mean to the life expectancy of Indian Point 2, but noted that "this has been a seminal event in the history of other reactors." Mr. Smeloff, a former utility executive, listed Maine Yankee, in Wiscasset, Me., and Trojan, near Portland, Ore., where, he said, steam generator problems "convinced management to close the plant."
A spokesman for Con Edison, Joseph P. Petta, who was asked how the event on Tuesday would influence a sale or affect the plant's future, said "that's a premature question right now."
"Our focus right now, he said, "is on the events at the plant." He would not say if any bids had been received, or when the company expected to know the extent of the damage.
But Mr. Smelloff suggested that as New York deregulates -- the reason that Con Ed was seeking to sell the plant -- the company probably could not win approval from the Public Service Commission to risk customers' money on major new investments, especially if the proceeds of a sale would benefit the shareholders. And the company might think twice about putting more of its own money in the plant.
It is not clear who would bear the extra cost if Indian Point 2 closed now; under a "settlement agreement" with the Public Service Commission, ratepayers are supposed to cover some of Con Ed's losses in a sale, but the agreement contemplates a salable, operable plant.
Consolidated Edison has understood for years that the steam generators at unit 2, numbered 21 through 24, would not last as long as the plant's operating license, which lasts through 2013. But as the finances of nuclear power have grown shaky, with some reactors around the country being shut down and others being sold for a relative pittance, the economic feasibility of replacing the generators has also grown uncertain. Con Edison bought new generators 12 years ago and has them stored on site, but according to its annual report, installing them could cost $100 million, plus replacement power costs for a three-month shutdown.
Similar to the way the owner of an old car responds to a fender-bender, the company may decide that the plant was totaled, because its remaining value is too small to justify the expense of replacing the generators, experts said.
Steam generators were on buyers' minds even before the accident.
"With a steam generator event, one of first things that I consider is, am I going to be faced with some huge capital expenditure soon after I acquire the plant?" said Shelby T. Brewer, the former head of a company that designed nuclear plants, Combustion Engineering. He is now shopping for reactors like Indian Point 2, which have been put on the market because of deregulation. Mr. Brewer estimated that a reactor the size of Indian Point could sell for $20 million to $30 million, but that steam generator replacement could cost five times that much.
At a time when nuclear reactors are selling for pennies on the dollar, relative to the capital invested in them, the buyers count on making a profit by buying them dirt cheap, experts say. Any sign that the plant will not run well, or will require long periods of shut-down, is damning.

HEADLINE: Death of a Garden

 BODY:
On Tuesday morning, Esperanza Garden, a community garden on East Seventh Street in Manhattan, was bulldozed after 22 years of existence. Its destruction marked the latest battle in the long-running war between Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and community advocates over the use of city-owned lots for community gardens. City Hall contends that many lots were only lent to the neighborhoods for gardens with the understanding that they would ultimately be taken back. Now, the mayor says, the lot on East Seventh Street should be sold to a developer to build low- and middle-income housing. 
 But the developer for this lot has set aside only 20 percent of the planned housing units for low-income housing. The rest will be made available as the market dictates. There are also provisions for nearly 7,000 square feet of retail space and 5,000 square feet of permanent open space. The fate of Esperanza Garden had been decided during a series of public hearings intended, in the administration's words, to balance competing interests, though it is not clear how the users of a community garden can compete with the economic clout of a developer.
No city ownership right can quite absolve the mayor and his administration of insensitivity in their handling of community gardens. "If you live in an unrealistic world then you can say everything should be a community garden," the mayor said. But their defenders do not assert that everything should be a community garden. They only say that such gardens, rare as they are, bring vitality and a sense of purpose to neighborhoods.
The conflict underlying the destruction of Esperanza Garden seems more fundamental than a struggle between gardeners and developers, green space and housing. It seems to be a conflict about the expression of public will. In most cases, the mayor clearly tries to take the broad view of what is best for most New Yorkers. Not every community garden will survive in an economic climate as ebullient and a housing market as tight as this one. But the most meaningful definition of public value is not always the broadest or most economically justifiable one. A patch of green or a plot of flowers can often do more for a neighborhood than new apartments and retail establishments.

HEADLINE: U.S. Resists a Proposal by Japan to Cut Money for U.S. Bases

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott called on the Japanese government today to reconsider a proposal to reduce its financial support for American troops in Japan.
Mr. Talbott held two days of talks here after a move by Japanese officials last month to cut payments to the United States to cover the costs incurred by American military forces in Japan, for labor, utilities, facilities, maintenance and training. 
 Japanese financial support for American military operations began in 1978, when the United States economy was foundering and Japan's cost of living had skyrocketed. Japan, which paid about $2.5 billion to support the American military last year, is seeking to reduce those payments because its economy has fallen upon hard times.
Mr. Talbott asked Foreign Minister Yohei Kono to generate public support for continuing the assistance for the United States military, Japanese foreign affairs officials said.
"As I discussed with Foreign Minister Kono, Japan and the United States bring different contributions to our security alliance," Mr. Talbott said. "The bases and host nation support that Japan provides are a critical contribution to the alliance. Host nation support is not just another line item in the budget."
Japanese officials said there was no immediate response from Mr. Kono but said the government's position was that the military support payments are a heavy burden. The agreement under which Japan provides support to the United States military is to expire in March 2001 and is currently being renegotiated.
Germany and South Korea make similar, but smaller, payments for American military operations.
There are about 45,000 United States military personnel in Japan, including 19,000 marines in Okinawa and 13,700 air force staff. American military officials have said that the importance of the bases in Japan has increased with the closure of bases in the Philippines. They say the bases in Japan are especially vital to respond to security threats from China, North Korea or Russia.
On another security issue, an official in Mr. Talbott's delegation, Walter B. Slocombe, the Defense Department's under secretary for policy, called on Japan to continue to cooperate with the United States on a planned missile defense system to guard against the threat posed by North Korea's missile program.
In a meeting with Japan's defense minister, Tsutomu Kawara, Mr. Slocombe said that the United States and Japan need to consider "a military approach" in dealing with North Korea, Japanese officials said.
In 1998, North Korea fired a short-range ballistic missile over the Japanese mainland and into the Pacific Ocean, raising concerns across Asia. Last year, North Korea threatened to test-launch a missile with a longer range and greater accuracy.
Responding to those threats, the United States and Japan signed an agreement to conduct joint research on a missile defense system, estimated to cost as much as $521 million in the initial phase, which would be split equally by both countries.
The so-called theater missile defense is intended to protect the United States and its allies from incoming ballistic missiles flying within a radius of about 1,800 miles by detecting them with satellites and shooting them down with missiles.
Despite North Korea's recent agreement to suspend its missile development program in exchange for the United States' lifting of sanctions, Mr. Slocombe expressed concern about security risks to the region, the officials said.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S NEWS CONFERENCE;
Excerpts from Clinton's Comments at Wide-Ranging News Conference

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's news conference yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:
 
Prepared Statement
First, let me say that we all know that we are in the midst of the longest and strongest economic expansion in our history, with nearly 21 million new jobs, unemployment at 4 percent and solid income growth across all income groups. 
 Americans in public service and in the private sector must remember that our success in promoting peace and prosperity is not the result of complacency, but of our common commitment to dynamic action rooted in enduring values. If we want to continue to enjoy success, we must continue our commitment to dynamic action.
There is important work to be done in America this year and in Washington, D.C. this year. First, we must stay on the path of fiscal discipline that got us to this point. If we stay on that path, we can make America, in just 13 years, debt free for the first time since 1835. Then we can use the benefits of debt reduction to preserve two of the most important guarantees we have made to the American people: Social Security and Medicare, something that will be a challenge as we see the number of people over 65 double in the next 30 years with the retirement of the baby boom generation.
Specifically, we can make a bipartisan down payment on Social Security reform by crediting the interest savings from debt reduction to the Social Security trust fund to keep it strong and sound for 50 years, beyond the life span of all but the most fortunate of the baby boom generation.
As a first step toward a comprehensive solution, I believe we should do something I called for in my 1999 State of the Union address: to end the earnings limit for Social Security retirees between the ages of 65 and 69.
To strengthen and modernize Medicare, I propose to implement important reforms and to dedicate more than half the non-Social-Security surplus to Medicare, over $400 billion, to keep it solvent for another decade, past 2025, and to add a voluntary prescription drug benefit.
I'm pleased Congress is beginning to take up this issue, and I ask them to move quickly and to resist the temptation to spend large portions of the surplus before we have lived up to our commitment to prepare for the undeniable health and financing challenges that Medicare will bring.
We should also move to complete the unfinished business of the last Congress: passing a real patients' bill of rights, campaign finance reform, hate-crimes legislation, an increase in the minimum wage and, especially, common-sense gun safety legislation.
Guns in the wrong hands continue to claim too many young lives, lives like those of Andre Wallace and Natasha Marsh, the fine young D.C. residents who were gunned down in front of Natasha's home last week and were buried just yesterday. We saw it also in Littleton just a few days ago with the shooting deaths of two teenage students from Columbine High School. Today, the secretary of housing and urban development, Andrew Cuomo, who is with us today, released the first-ever comprehensive analysis of gun-related violence in public housing in America. The report shows that while crime in public housing is declining as it is in the rest of the country, gun-related crime remains a serious problem there, with residents of public housing more than twice as likely to be victims of gun violence as other members of our society. More than a million children and 360,000 seniors live in public housing in the United States. They deserve to be as safe as the rest of us.
Ten months after the tragedy at Columbine, it is long past time for Congress to pass this common-sense gun safety legislation.
I would also like to address the impact of rising oil prices on American families. In the Northeast, the impact has been particularly harsh because from the Mid-Atlantic States to New England, many families still rely on home heating oil, a source of heating no longer used in the rest of the country. These families have been especially hard hit. That is a serious concern, especially because the winter months have been colder this year than in the past few years. Since January, we have released $175 million to help lower-income families pay their heating bills. We have also asked refiners to keep producing at full throttle until the crisis is past. And we directed the Coast Guard to expedite deliveries of home heating oil to affected areas.
These actions have helped to ease the burden on the citizens who are the most vulnerable. Still, there are too many families with moderate incomes who have no option other than heating their homes with oil, and they need help, too. There is more to do.
Secretary Richardson is in New England today, holding a summit with refiners, distributors and major users of home heating oil to determine how government and industry can work together to better meet the needs of consumers in the Mid-Atlantic and New England States.
Today I'm announcing additional steps to help families struggling to pay their heating bills. I directed my budget office and the Department of Health and Human Services to release right now the remainder of this year's funding for emergency heating assistance, about $125 million more. This money will be targeted toward the hardest-hit states, those with the highest usage of home heating oil. I will be meeting with governors and members of Congress in those states to ask them to use all their authority to expand the pool of people who receive those funds, making sure that as many people who need the help can get it.
And let me explain what I mean by that. Under the present law, states can pay LIHEAP assistance -- low-income heating assistance -- to people up to 150% of the poverty line, the national poverty line, or up to 60% of the median income in their states. In the states that are most severely affected, where you have a lot of people who live on middle incomes, but particularly if they have children, are really hurt by an increase of $200 or $300 a month in their home heating bill, are eligible for this assistance but don't presently receive it. So if we provide more money, if the states really want to see the maximum number of people helped, they have the ability to raise the income limits of people eligible for that help and to structure the help accordingly.
We will also be requesting $600 million in emergency supplemental funding for the LIHEAP program to help more hard-hit families through the current crisis, as well as to have some money for others who may be hard hit later in the year, when the hot weather sets in.
We will send legislation to Congress in the next 10 days, and I hope there will be fast action on it. Meanwhile, we will continue to work toward a longer-term solution. I've asked Secretary Richardson to conduct a 60-day study on converting factories and major users from oil to other fuels, which will help to free up future oil supplies for use in heating homes.
Americans have always pulled together to help their fellow citizens in times of need. Over the last seven years, we've stood to help the victims of earthquakes in California, of the farm crisis and a 500-year flood in the Middle West, and again and again, and recently again this week, the violent storms in the South. Now the families in the Northeast need our help, too, and we must act.
Again I say the United States did not get to this fortunate moment by inaction and complacency. We got here by a commitment to giving the American people the tools and conditions to solve their own problems and in continuing to act aggressively and dynamically. This must be a year of that kind of action. . . .
 
Questions and Answers
 
Capital Punishment
Q. Mr. President, there are growing calls for a national moratorium on capital punishment from the American Bar Association to members of Congress. Governor Ryan has halted executions in Illinois, as you know, because the convictions of 13 people on death row were overturned. On the other hand, Governor Bush said last night that he's confident that the 100 people who were put to death in Texas under his watch, were all guilty. . . . You signed four death warrants, or death execution warrants, while you were governor. What's your feeling about a moratorium on executions?
A. Well, first, I think Governor Ryan did the right thing, and it was probably a courageous thing to do, because a majority of the American people support capital punishment, as do I. But I think that in Illinois he had a situation where the exonerations and the executions were about equal in number over the last several years. So, it is -- he had a difficult situation and I think he did the right thing. And I think that if I were a governor still, I would look very closely at the situation in my state and decide what the facts were.
There are, I think, not those grounds for that kind of moratorium under the federal law because of the circumstances under which people are convicted. Now we have a -- a different review going on here, a Justice Department review on the racial impact or whether there was one in the death penalty decisions under the federal law. . . .
We also are in the process of developing guidelines for clemency applications when any individual claims of innocence or questioning of the sentence, even though guilt is not a question, can be pressed. And, I think in an attempt to address the problem you mentioned, I think, Senator Leahy has introduced some legislation to try to give convicted criminal defendants access to DNA testing and other things which might tend to disprove their guilt.
So, I think that this, you know, all these things need to be looked at. The people who support the death penalty, it seems to me, have an especially heavy obligation to see that the, in cases where it is applied, there is no question of whether it, whether the guilt, was there. So the only issue left is whether philosophically you think it's a right or wrong thing to do.
Q. So you would not support a ban? You would not support suspending it or a moratorium now?
A. In the federal cases, I don't believe it's called for. But as I say, we do have the review going on in terms of the racial implications of the way it's been applied, and we also are in the process of drawing up guidelines for clemency requests which, obviously, would give people an opportunity to raise the question of whether there was some doubt about their guilt or innocence. . . .
 
Arkansas Investigation
Q. The Arkansas Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct has initiated an investigation into a complaint regarding statements that you've made in testimony before Judge Susan Webber Wright, action that could include disciplinary action up to and including disbarment. . . . Would you be willing to surrender your law license to avoid such a hearing or will you fight it up to and including availing yourself of a public hearing as you are entitled to under the regulations?
A. Well, let me say to you the reason, and the only reason, I didn't settle the lawsuit in the first place was because I thought that it was wrong for the president to take an hour, much less a day, much less weeks away from the job of the American people to deal with anything that could be a distraction. And I did it only after there was a court ruling that the case had absolutely no merit, which was obvious to everybody who looked at the facts.
Now, I haven't changed my position on that. As a result and all the things that have happened subsequently, I have -- I have left a lot of things unsaid, which I might have otherwise said. And I hope I can continue to do that, and that's what I'm going to do today. . . .
 
Heating Oil
Q. Mr. President, along the lines of the heating oil situation, or whatever, would you at any point consider, because perhaps as the prices continue to spike up, would you at any point consider that it could have some detrimental effect on the economy, would you consider tapping into the strategic petroleum reserves? And, conversely, I'd like to ask if we as Americans have some kind of divine right to cheap gasoline and cheap heating oil?
A. Well, well, you've asked two questions and let me try to answer them. And I'd like to make, if I might, three points.
No. 1, the statute for using the strategic petroleum reserve sets forward the conditions under which it might be used. And I have not ruled out any action which I think is in the interest of the American people.
No. 2, I think what is in our interests are stable prices that are not too high, but don't drop real low, encourage over-consumption and then jump way up again. That is what we need is stable prices that are not too high, but that are also stable.
I also think that's in the interest of the producing countries. Why? Because if prices got so high they weakened -- disregard America's economy -- other people's economies, that would shrink the markets for the producers. If the economy goes down, that would lower the price and they'd wind up with the worst of both worlds. If the price stayed up for any period of time, it would make non-OPEC members who could produce oil more likely to do it, which would further drive the price down. . . .
I think the OPEC members understand that and I think that there is an interest in stable prices at an acceptable level. And we have these conversations all along and I think that is clear. And we'll see what happens on that. But I wouldn't rule out using the petroleum reserve.
Now, the third point I want to make is this: you said, do Americans have a right to cheap gas and cheap heating oil? What I want to do, because I think it's important for our long-term security, is get America in a position where our -- the fuel efficiency of our vehicles is so great or our ability to use alternative-fuel vehicles or dual-use vehicles, biofuels, mixed electric and gasoline fueled vehicles that have automatically regenerating batteries, that our capacity to do that is so great that we will not be reliant on the ups and downs of supplies and the increases that might come in the future would have a much more limited impact on us. I would remind you that these increases have had a much, much more limited impact on the United States than the oil price increases of the 70's, for example, because we're so much more energy efficient. . . .
There are all kinds of problems in the historical explanations for why the Mid-Atlantic and New England States are so dependent on home heating oil and no place else is. But it's not a good situation. . . . If -- we need to examine and it's one of the things I asked Secretary Richardson to look at is look at what are the institutional barriers for businesses and individuals converting away from home heating oil to heating sources that are more commonly used in other places. What are the costs? How might -- are there any federal actions that might be undertaken and in concert with the states or with the private sector to help minimize those costs and facilitate a conversion.
The people on home heating oil are the most vulnerable people in America by a good long ways to these radical swings in oil prices. And it's also because they're delivered, essentially, by individual business, you know, who come to your home and send you a bill, consumers don't have the -- the option that many of you who live in D.C. have. For example, you can average your electric bills. You can average your utility bills over a period of months, so if you have a couple of bad months, you can average them out. Those options are not available to them either.
So I think we have to look long term, in my judgment, at whether there's a conversion strategy there that would enable a whole different energy future to open up in terms of home and business energy usage. . . .
 
Gun Control
Q. On the topic of gun control, . . . the central sticking point in the Congress is over this division between the Senate and the House over a waiting period for gun sales at gun shows. The Senate has endorsed 72 hours; the House and a goodly number of Democrats have endorsed 24 hours. Would you accept a compromise . . . or is that 72-hour waiting period so important you'd prefer no bill to a compromise? . . .
A. There are two benefits to the waiting period. One is, does it really give you an adequate amount of time to check the records? And two is, should there be a cooling-off period if somebody who's really hot buys a gun with a bad intent and might cool down and refrain? If you move away from 72 hours to a shorter period, then the question is, since so many of these gun shows occur on the weekend, will there be access to the records to do the check? . . .
 I can only tell you what I believe. This is not theology, this is what does it take as a practical matter to have a bill that works to keep people alive? I mean, there's no question that the Brady bill has kept a lot of people alive. And there's furthermore no question that there has not been a huge amount of inconvenience in the waiting period.
Now, I know what the argument is. The argument is, well, the gun show people are mobile. So it's not like you can, you know, wait five days, go back to the same store where you placed the order for the gun and it's going to be there five days from now. And the gun shows are mobile. I understand what the problem is. There has got to be a solution here that deals with that. You know, maybe they could park the guns at the local police department or something else. There's got to be some way to deal with this that allows us to have a practical law that works.
The one thing I will not do is I will not sign a law which promises the American people that this is going to make them safer and it won't do it. . . .
 
Politics
Q. Mr. President, is a candidate's past record on abortion fair game in a campaign? The first lady seems to think it is; the vice president seems to think it isn't.
A. Well, you know, now if I get into that, then you'll have me handicapping that debate last night. Let me just say this, I'll make a generic comment about that because I think all of you are going to writing about this. I see, you know, one candidate says this about the other's record, then one complains about how the other one interprets his record and all that kind of stuff. I have never seen a hard-fought political race where candidates did not disagree with their opponent's characterization of their record and their positions. I mean, that's part of the debate and it's always going to happen.
And, again, I think anything I say to get in the middle of that is not, I'm not running for office, and by in large I think I shouldn't comment. You know, there may be a few exceptions, but I think basically the American people are in the driver's seat, they're making this decision. I get to vote like everybody else, but I'm not a candidate and I don't think I ought to get in the way unless there's some specific issue related to something I've done as president. . . .
Q. Senator Bradley has made it a point of late to challenge Vice President Gore's veracity, essentially to cast him as a politician not to be trusted. He's been your vice president for the last seven years. Are you offended by those remarks? Certainly there's nobody in a better position than you to speak to his character.
A. Well, my feelings are not relevant. But I can say this: He has always -- one of the great strengths that he had as vice president is that he was always brutally honest with me. I mean he was never afraid to disagree with me. And when we had very tough decisions -- very often we'd be in these big meetings and you can see when these tough decisions come down, and I mean this -- no offense to any of you, this is actually a compliment to you -- but when you've got seven people in a meeting and some huge decision is on the line and you realize that if you make the wrong call it could not only be bad for the country, it could be very bad for the health of the administration, it's amazing to see how some people guard their words because they're so afraid that what they say, even though the meeting is in confidence, will be published.
In all those tough times, he took a -- he decided what he thought was right and he took a clear and unambiguous stand. And I think the country is better for it. And I could give you lots of examples. I mean, he, when it was unpopular thing to go into Kosovo, he wanted to do it. When it was unpopular to go into Bosnia, he wanted to do it. When it was unpopular to stand up for freedom in Haiti, he wanted to do it. When only 15 percent of the people thought we ought to help Mexico, but I knew it could hurt our economy, he was right there. And I could go on and on. So all I can tell you is that in all my dealings with him, he has been candid in the extreme and all anyone could ever ask.
Now, I'll say again what I said before: I have never seen a tough race where people fought with each other where they didn't have different interpretations of each other's record and each other's positions and then once you disagree with someone's position or someone's record, then the person will say I just think you're mischaracterizing it.
Now, depending on the level of heat and intensity of the campaign, how they say that and how they feel about it will go up or down. But this happens in every election, and I think the important thing to remember is you've basically got four people running for president now who are people of accomplishment, people who have certain convictions, people who have, I think, pretty clear philosophies and records. And I know that they'll -- everybody'll get hot and mad at everybody else, but I mean you know, this is not a bad thing for America, this choice they've got. And they're very different.
So America has a good choice. And I think that, you know, I'm -- it's tough to be in these races and, you know, when you're not running anymore you can look back and -- everybody can look back on a life in -- public life -- and say now there's one thing I said I kind of wish I hadn't said or I said that, and I believe what I said but I wish I'd said it in a slightly different way. . . .
Q. You say you're not running this year, but you are casting a shadow over the debate on the campaign trail. And all of the candidates ----
A. I'd like to think I'm passing a little sunshine on the world. I keep trying to build these fellows up, you know, I'm -- I'm -- I'm being nice and generous and all that.
Q. Well, all of the candidates are running against your behavior and conduct, not just the Republicans, as Helen mentioned, but all of the candidates.
A. Well, if I were running, I'd do that.
Q. Right. But on the other hand, also, all of the candidates, Republicans and Democrats, do sound a lot like you when they talk about policy. Even the Republicans say they want prescription drug coverage for Medicare --
A. Yeah.
Q. and they support a patients' bill of rights with the right to sue. And I'm wondering if you could comment on both aspects of your influence, both the negative, the fact that everybody seems to be running against your behavior, and also, on the other side, why everyone seems to sound like you when they discuss policy.
A. Well, I -- first of all, I think for the Republicans it's probably good politics to do that, because they spent years and years trying to tell everybody how bad I am. So -- so -- but for everybody, the public, however, people are really smart, you know, and they're -- they're -- it's pretty hard to convince them that they should hold anyone responsible for someone else's mistake, particularly a personal mistake. I mean, I can't imagine any voter ever doing that. That's like shooting yourself in the foot. You know, I even caution people, for example, if -- if somebody says something -- one of you says something or prints something or has a story that we don't agree with -- I tell people all the time, don't ever talk about the press. There is no such thing as the press. You can't blame -- if you think somebody made a mistake, you can't blame everybody else for a mistake somebody made. We're all -- but -- but that's in -- that's in a professional context. In a personal context it's even more true.
So my view is that the voters are going to -- this is, as I have said repeatedly, the presidential election is the world's greatest job interview. And the voters are -- are going to hire someone that they believe, of course, is a good person, a strong person, a person who will be a credit to the office, but they want to know what in the world are they going to do? How are we going to keep this expansion going? How are we going to meet the -- meet the big challenges facing the country? And it is, to me, a source of -- of reassurance, not personal, but for my country's future, that so many of the candidates have adopted at least some of the policies that we have tried to put in place over the last seven years that moved the country away from this big deep partisan division that dominated Washington politics for so long.
So all I can tell you is I think the -- my -- my instinct is that the voters are going to take the measure of these people, they're going to think, you know, who will be a good president, who will make good decisions? And do I agree with this person in -- in terms of priorities and positions? That's what I think. I -- I think that the implications that anybody would be held responsible for somebody else's mistake or misconduct is just, it's a real insult to the American people and they're not going to do that. That -- that's -- it's not in their interest and it's not in their nature, they're not -- they're too smart and too good for that. . . .
 
F.E.C. Nomination
Q. Both Senator Bradley and Vice President Gore have condemned your nomination of Bradley Smith to the F.E.C. Would you care to take this opportunity to explain exactly why you've nominated this man, and, to say what exactly this says about your own commitment to the campaign financial reform that you have said you support?
A. Well, it doesn't say anything about my commitment although I think they were, they were right to condemn it, except that, look at what the law says, the law says: A. This is a Republican appointment and B. is a practical matter. The way the appointments process works in the Senate, if you want anybody to be confirmed for anything, you have to take, and -- and the Republicans in this case happen to be in the majority, the majority leader always makes that recommendation. Now I have, I argued with him as he will tell you for months about this. And there's a reason they wanted Bradley Smith on the F.E.C. You know he -- he hates campaign finance reform. Bradley Smith does. He's written about it. And he'll get a three-year appointment now where he'll be one person on the F.E.C. and I don't like it, but I -- but I decided that I should not shut down the whole appointments process and depart from the plain intent of the law, which requires that it be bipartisan and by all tradition that the majority leader make the nomination. . . .
 
New York Senate Race
Q. Mr. President, current polls show that your wife is virtually tied with her likely challenger, Mayor Rudy Giuliani when it comes to women voters in New York and that she is trailing when it comes to white voters. . . . Can you address why you think your wife is having some trouble connecting with women voters in particular? . . . And are you playing the role of a senior strategist in her campaign?
A. Well, I'm basically doing for her what she's always done for me, you know, I'm -- I'm talking to her about whatever she wants to talk about. I'm giving her my best ideas. I thought she had a wonderful announcement. I was really proud of her. She got up there and said that she understood, she was new to the neighborhood, but she wasn't new to the concerns of the people of New York. And then she said in exact detail she did what I believe all candidates should do. She said, look, if you vote for me, here's what you get. Here's what I'll fight for, here's what I'll do. Here's what I'll fight against. Here's what I won't do.
And now the campaign is under way. And I think she's doing remarkably well, given the unusual nature of the campaign and the -- and the -- and the formidable obstacles out there. And I -- I think now the people will begin to listen and debate and I think she'll do real well. But I'm -- I'm very proud of her and I'm -- I'm -- I think she's doing fine. But you should not, all I'm doing for her is what she did for me. So when she says something, it's what she believes and she's made up her mind what she wants to run on, what she wants to be for and why she wants to do it. And I was -- I was ecstatically happy with the way her announcement came out, because I just knew it was her. And -- and I just think if, you know, you just go out there and make your best shot and hope that it works, but I'm -- my instinct is she'll do right well.

HEADLINE: Exchange to Offer Derivatives Linked tothe Fortune 500 List

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Move over Dow Jones and Standard & Poor's, here comes the Fortune 500 stock index.
Two years after Dow Jones & Company agreed to allow investors to trade derivatives based on the Dow Jones industrials, Fortune magazine says it is going to allow the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to begin offering futures and options linked to a new Fortune 500 index, which the magazine will create. 
 The magazine, which is owned by Time Warner Inc., said today that it would also license the exchange to trade derivatives based on a newly developed Fortune E-50 index, which would track the performance of companies tied to the Internet economy.
Officials at Fortune Inc. said the move was an attempt to leverage a well-known brand name and capitalize on the growing popularity of stock indexes by coming up with two measures derived from the magazine's annual ranking.
The magazine hopes the new indexes -- which will move up and down as a stock measure, just like the Dow Jones average -- will become major benchmarks of stock performance in the broader market as well as the increasingly popular technology sector. And for its part, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange hopes to increase volume and attract investors looking to do one-stop shopping in two more stock index derivatives.
Investors can currently trade futures and options on the Dow Jones industrial average index at the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which pioneered stock index futures when it introduced widespread trading in the S.& P. 500 index in 1982, tried and failed to win the Dow contracts.
Since then, however, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has begun offering a popular contract called the e-mini, a bite-sized S.& P. 500 contract that is meant to appeal to smaller investors. But the larger S.& P. 500 contracts remain the most sought after, with more than 27 million contracts traded in 1999.
The American Stock Exchange has also introduced new stock index contracts in recent years that track the Dow and S.& P. They are known as Diamonds and Spiders. The Nasdaq stock market, owned by the National Association of Securities Dealers, also licenses indexes tied to its index at several derivatives exchanges.
In creating a stock index, Fortune magazine, which introduced its annual Fortune 500 list in 1955, joins other large financial institutions and publishers who have created market measures. Goldman, Sachs & Company and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, the big Wall Street brokerage houses, have indexes that track commodity prices and technology stocks. Standard & Poor's, a unit of McGraw-Hill, offers an array of stock indexes.
Until 1997, however, the Dow Jones industrial average was simply a measurement of 30 big American companies, chosen by the editors of The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Dow Jones. The major futures exchanges were unable to offer products tied to the average.
The editors of Fortune will determine the components and metrics that will be used in calculating the index. The company said those details would be released in the March 6 edition of Fortune, which is due on newsstands next week.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Technology Stocks Gain Ground as Rest of Market Slides

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Technology stocks stood their ground yesterday but the rest of the market declined as investors awaited January inflation figures and Alan Greenspan's assessment of the economy, with its implications for Federal Reserve Board monetary policy.
After two days of broad gains, the split between high-tech and so-called old-economy stocks re-emerged. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 156.68 points, or 1.46 percent, to close at 10,561.41, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 6.88 points, to 4,427.65. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 14.38 points, or 1.03 percent, to 1,387.67. 
 The blue-chip Dow has lost 8.14 percent so far this year and is 9.91 percent below its Jan. 14 peak.
"There's clearly a notion that the Fed eventually will be successful in slowing the economy but it's a question of at what cost," said Ned Riley Jr., chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. For companies sensitive to the business cycle, he added, "the market seems to be discounting almost recession-like conditions."
One of the most prominent casualties was Wal-Mart, which slumped 4 1/8, to 52 7/8, as investors further digested company warnings that recent sparkling results, announced Tuesday, would be hard to beat. It did not help that Abercrombie & Fitch reported disappointing holiday sales, sending that stock down 2 13/16, to 15 3/16, a two-year low.
"The retail stocks have totally rolled over," said Marion Schultheis, a portfolio manager at J. & W. Seligman. Intimate Brands slumped 3 7/16, to 3 11/16, and Limited 2 11/16, to 31 1/8.
Home Depot fell 3, to 56 3/4, also seeming to suffer from fears of how high the Fed might have to push interest rates to cool off an overheated economy. A report of surprisingly strong housing starts yesterday added to such concern.
Financial stocks took a pounding, with American Express off 5 9/32, to 153 27/32, and Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and J. P. Morgan all losing more than 3 points.
But technology stocks largely withstood the decline. Hewlett-Packard was the best-performing Dow stock, rising 4 1/16, to 129 3/8, as investors anticipated its earnings report after the close. The stock subsequently climbed to 131 as investors appeared to focus more on rising revenue than on slipping profits.
Biotechnology was especially strong, spurred partly by Human Genome Sciences, up 33 1/4, to 188, which patented a gene that could help create drugs to treat AIDS. Amgen climbed 4 13/16, to 69 7/8; Hyseq 8 1/8, to 99; and Targeted Genetics 7 3/16, to 19 3/4
Secondary technology stocks were a big factor in the rise of the small-cap Russell 2000 to a record 547.76, putting the index ahead 1.39 percent for the day and 8.52 percent for the year.

Treasuries' Prices Mixed
 
By Reuters
Treasury bond prices were mixed yesterday in thin trading.
The Commerce Department said construction of new homes and apartments increased unexpectedly in January, which stoked fears that the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, may use his semiannual Congressional testimony today to signal an acceleration in monetary tightening to cool a still red-hot economy.
Consolidation was the major theme for bond markets, with dealers and investors taking positions ahead of Mr. Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, a biannual report on the state of the economy, scheduled for 10 a.m.
Analysts and traders expect his speech will offer much-needed guidance on the future direction of monetary policy and warned it could be more hawkish than markets had been pricing in.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 6/32, to 99 29/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.26 percent, from 6.24 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: A.F.L.-C.I.O. Maps a Fight Against an Easing of China Trade

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 16

 BODY:
A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials today outlined an ambitious campaign to persuade Congress to oppose President Clinton's efforts at normalizing trade relations with China.
The labor officials buttressed their case by issuing the results of a poll that found most Americans opposed normal trade with Beijing. 
 The telephone poll, of 609 people around the country over three days beginning Jan. 25, showed that 65 percent were against normal trade relations with the Chinese and that 61 percent said China had unfair trade policies. A particularly surprising result of the survey, conducted for the federation by Peter D. Hart Research Associates, was that a higher percentage of Republicans than Democrats or independents opposed normal China trade.
John J. Sweeney, the federation's president, said the labor movement hoped to work with Democrats and both moderate and conservative Republicans to build a majority on the issue.
The labor federation has been the most powerful opponent of the Clinton Administration's trade accord with China, which, with Congressional approval, would remove trade barriers against the Chinese and ease their entry into the World Trade Organization. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. wants to make sure that instead, Congress continues its annual reviews of trade with China, an exercise that often irritates Beijing while pressuring it to improve its performance on human rights and worker rights.
Labor leaders said the battle they mount over China could be as big as the huge but ultimately unsuccessful fight they undertook in 1993 to press Congress to reject the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Gathered here for the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s winter meeting, labor leaders said their fight against normalized trade with China would be part of a larger, multiyear effort to make the global economy fairer to workers in the United States and overseas. Mr. Sweeney said the labor movement wanted to build on the December protests in Seattle against the harshest effects of globalization.
Many Democratic officials say they fear that labor's battle against the administration's China trade policy could weaken union members' support for the presidential candidacy of Vice President Al Gore and for Democratic Congressional candidates, at a time when the labor movement wants to help the party regain control of the House.
But, to pressure members of Congress not to normalize trade with China, the labor federation said it would run broadcast spots in 12 to 15 Congressional districts where lawmakers are wavering. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. also plans to get union members to meet with every member of Congress, and to sponsor town meetings on the issue around the country.
In Seattle, the labor movement worked closely with environmentalists and advocacy groups for the third world, and, addressing some of their concerns, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. said today that it was backing debt relief for poor nations.
In announcing what it called a Campaign for Global Fairness, the federation said it would seek to have countries gain the power to bring trade sanctions against other nations where core labor standards, like a ban on child labor, are frequently violated.
"It is insane that under the rules governing worldwide trade today you can take action against a company for pirating a Madonna videotape," Mr. Sweeney said, "but you can take no action against a company for employing children, or using forced labor, or violating workers' fundamental rights, or poisoning the environment."

HEADLINE: Banker and Husband Tell Of Role in Laundering Case

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN with RAYMOND BONNER 

 BODY:
A former executive of the Bank of New York and her husband told a federal judge yesterday that they helped a group of small but politically connected Russian banks create an elaborate money laundering scheme that moved billions of dollars out of Russia through the American bank.
After more than 18 months of investigation, federal authorities delivered Lucy Edwards, a former Bank of New York vice president, and her husband, Peter Berlin, to the United States District Court in Manhattan. They described how between 1996 and last year, more than $7 billion left Russia illegally and flowed through a network of front company accounts at the Bank of New York that were controlled by Mr. Berlin. From there, the money was transferred to offshore accounts. 
 The network, according to the couple, was designed by Russian bankers to whisk money electronically between Russia and the United States for three broad purposes: to evade Russian taxes on money from legitimate business transactions, to avoid Russian customs duties on imports and to "wash" the profits of outright criminal enterprises through legitimate banks, including a $300,000 ransom payment in 1998 to the kidnappers of a businessman in Russia.
The couple, who said they were paid nearly $2 million for their services, said the scheme allowed Russian bankers to conduct illegal banking activities in the United States that circumvented the scrutiny of federal banking regulators and law enforcement officials.
"I closed my eyes to that fact," said Ms. Edwards, who worked in the Eastern European division of the Bank of New York. She said she "suspected the accounts were being used by many people for illicit purposes."
The couple pleaded guilty to a series of federal crimes, which carry sentences of up to 10 years in prison and heavy fines, and to cooperate with investigators in a plea bargain that federal authorities hope will produce more charges.
"More than one or two people had to turn the other way," an investigator said. "You don't transfer $7 billion through the spanking-new Eastern European division without somebody knowing."
The Bank of New York, which has not been accused of any wrongdoing, declined to comment yesterday. It fired Ms. Edwards shortly after the federal money laundering investigation became public last August, and has been cooperating with the authorities.
After the remarkable courtroom appearance yesterday, the bank's culpability, and that of its directors and officers, is still not clear. Federal prosecutors have great discretion in deciding whether to pursue criminal charges against a bank when an officer breaks the law.
Court documents and the couple's oral confession named several Moscow banks as being part of the scheme. According to previously unpublicized documents and to Western financiers with direct knowledge of the banks' affairs, one of the banks, Sobinbank, is controlled by members of a powerful group of Russian financiers known as the oligarchs, who own much of Russia's wealth and have wielded enormous influence within the Kremlin.
The court confessions yesterday provided the first detailed public accounts by participants in the money laundering scheme, which had been under investigation since 1998.
Ms. Edwards, Mr. Berlin and three companies controlled by Mr. Berlin -- Benex, Bec International and Lowland -- pleaded guilty to laundering money to promote criminal activity and defraud the Russian government; conducting unlicensed banking operations; establishing an unauthorized branch of a foreign bank; operating an illegal money transmitting business; making improper payments to a bank employee; receiving illegal payments as a bank employee and laundering those payments abroad; tax evasion; and fraudulently obtaining visas for hundreds of Russians to enter the United States.
The New York Times reported yesterday that investigators had evidence that Ms. Edwards had bribed one of her superiors at the bank. No such evidence emerged in court, though the documents released yesterday charged that there were "corrupt payments to members" of the bank's Eastern European division.
Appearing calm and rested, and smiling occasionally at each other and their lawyers, Ms. Edwards and Mr. Berlin described the origins and purpose of the money laundering operation during a court appearance that lasted slightly longer than two hours.
Ms. Edwards, 41, speaking in a soft Russian accent, said she was first approached in late 1995 by representatives of DKB, a Russian bank whose full name is Depozitarno-Kliringovy Bank, who were interested in using the Bank of New York's offices and technology to illegally move money out of Russia. During the following years, Ms. Edwards said, those activities came to include money laundering and other schemes to which she pleaded guilty.
Russian banking during the 1990's has been a notoriously freewheeling affair, with allegations of extensive involvement in the banks by organized criminals. Ms. Edwards noted in her testimony that DKB's Moscow employees told her in 1998 that they were afraid to leave the bank's headquarters because "customers with machine guns were waiting for them."
The ransom money referred to in court yesterday relates to a 1998 request by the Russian government for the F.B.I.'s help in a kidnapping case. The ransom, it turned out, moved through a Benex account at the Bank of New York on its way to Russian organized crime figures, prompting the bureau to open its own inquiry.
Although the Bank of New York earned relatively small profits from its business in Russia, its aggressive pursuit of clients there held out the promise of potentially lucrative future deals.
Mr. Berlin, 45, testified that Benex, Becs and Lowland all had accounts at the Bank of New York that he opened on behalf of his overseers in Moscow. He said that the companies were staffed by DKB employees and that Ms. Edwards helped install Bank of New York computer software in the Forest Hills, Queens, office of a Benex affiliate to allow money to be moved electronically.
The couple said that DKB representatives told them in the fall of 1998 that they had acquired control of another bank, Flamingo, and wanted a new company created to move money from that bank through the Bank of New York. Mr. Berlin opened Lowland in Jersey City for that purpose.
According to a series of confidential financial audits, a Moscow bank controlled by Aleksandr Smolensky, SBS-Agro, owned sizable stakes in both Sobinbank and Flamingo Bank.
One of the audits, conducted in 1997 by the accounting firm Arthur Andersen & Company, with the cooperation of SBS-Agro's management, found that the purpose of SBS-Agro's investment in Flamingo Bank was "the possible purchase of its business in the future." It could not be determined whether SBS-Agro ever acted on that goal. A 1998 audit of SBS-Agro by Arthur Andersen noted that the bank's 20 percent stake in Sobinbank amounted to "control or significant influence" over Sobinbank's activities.
SBS-Agro, which largely collapsed during the Russian economic crisis in 1998, was part of a financial and oil empire controlled by Mr. Smolensky, Boris Berezovsky, a prominent Russian financier with long ties to former President Boris N. Yeltsin, and Roman Abramovich. The three financiers did not respond to repeated interview requests over the last few weeks. Neither SBS-Agro nor any of the three financiers were mentioned by Ms. Edwards or her husband, or in the court documents filed by federal investigators yesterday. There is no evidence of any involvement by them in the Bank of New York activities.
For their cooperation with their handlers in Moscow, Ms. Edwards and Mr. Berlin received $1.8 million, which represented a percentage of the money moved through the Benex network. "We were paid substantial commissions for doing very little work," Ms. Edwards said.
Ms. Edwards and Mr. Berlin said that they directed that their money be deposited in offshore bank accounts so they could avoid paying taxes on it in the United States.
Ms. Edwards said she helped hundreds of Russians secure bogus visas for travel to the United States and that most of them worked in the Russian banking industry.
She also said that after the couple moved to London in 1996, they paid a Bank of New York employee, Svetlana Kudryavtsev, $500 a month to make sure the Benex accounts were operating properly. Ms. Kudryavtsev is one of the employees at the bank who is described in court papers released yesterday as having taken "corrupt payments." Ms. Kudryavtsev was indicted last month on charges of lying to federal investigators about whether she or her husband had received money or loans from Ms. Edwards. Her lawyer could not be reached for comment yesterday, but on Monday he described the charges as unwarranted. The indictment charges that Ms. Kudryavtsev received about $30,000 from Ms. Edwards and Mr. Berlin between 1995 and 1999.
Ms. Edwards and Mr. Berlin face a maximum of 10 years in prison for the charges against them when they appear at a sentencing hearing on May 3, but it is likely that their cooperation with the authorities will lessen the severity of any punishment against them.
"Lucy Edwards and Peter Berlin have come voluntarily to New York from their home in London to accept responsibility for their part in the illegal transfer of funds through the Bank of New York," T. Barry Kingham, the couple's attorney, said yesterday in Manhattan. "They have cooperated fully with the investigation being conducted by the F.B.I. and the U.S. Attorney's Office, and they will continue to do so."
The couple have surrendered about $1 million to the authorities, some of which was maintained in Swiss bank accounts, and they will be released from federal custody pending their posting of a $500,000 bail bond.
"Today's pleas starkly demonstrate the serious dangers of unlicensed and unregulated entities operating within the American banking system as cover for money laundering and other criminal activities," said Mary Jo White, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, in a prepared statement yesterday. "Evading and disregarding American laws in this manner significantly undermines the integrity of United States and foreign banking systems."
Lewis D. Schiliro, assistant director in charge of the F.B.I.'s New York office, said that the investigation "has followed a long, winding road throughout the United States and abroad" and that his agency is "determined to continue following the complicated trail of money and banking transactions until all those who have committed crimes are identified and charged."

HEADLINE: Vaccine Price Prompts Shift

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Worried about the high price of a vaccine that fights ear infections, pneumonia and meningitis, a government advisory committee changed its initial recommendation and voted today to require that fewer children receive the shots.
The vaccine, Prevenar, should be administered to all children under the age of 2 and to those ages 2 to 5 who are at high risk of contracting the diseases, said the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
 It was only the second time the committee had debated the potential economic effects of a vaccine, marking a potential shift in what medical experts consider before making a recommendation.
"We're having to look at cost more and more," said Dr. John Modlin, the chairman of the committee and a professor of pediatric medicine at Dartmouth College.
In October, the committee had voted to recommend providing the vaccine, which costs $232 for a four-dose series, to all children under 5.
Food and Drug Administration approval of the vaccine is expected this week, and its manufacturer, American Home Products, will begin marketing it this spring.
Prevenar fights the bacterium streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading cause of pneumonia, meningitis and ear infections.
According to a study, the vaccine reduced ear infections by 9 percent, and visits to doctors by patients with chronic ear infections who took the vaccine were down 20 percent.

HEADLINE: Town Confused on a Day The Sirens Didn't Go Off

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: BUCHANAN, N.Y., Feb. 16

 BODY:
Mitchell M. Vanderveer was running on a treadmill at a health club here this morning when he heard that the Indian Point 2 nuclear power plant had apparently released a small amount of radiation on Tuesday night. Suddenly, his heart rate spiked.
Where were the sirens? Why wasn't he notified? What, exactly, was going on? 
"Here I am, huffing and puffing, and I'm wondering what I'm breathing in," said Mr. Vanderveer, 46, a groundskeeper at an estate in Croton-on-Hudson. "They use that siren system, which is certainly annoying, when they don't need it. And when they do need it, they don't use it."
Mr. Vanderveer was hardly the only person living, working or passing through this Hudson River town today who was rattled and a bit confused about what happened at Indian Point. Adding to the sense of confusion, Consolidated Edison said early this evening that it was unclear whether any radiation had even escaped the plant.
But for many people here, what seemed most important today was not the scientific data, or engineering jargon, or calls for calm from public officials that invariably accompany any anomalous event at a nuclear power plant. Instead, they questioned whether emergency officials had handled matters properly, or had underplayed the situation. And they reminded themselves that a 26-year-old institution that people around here often take for granted, in a wishful-thinking kind of way, can still malfunction or at least produce unwanted events.
It certainly did not help that news helicopters were over the area in pitch darkness early this morning, rousing many people from bed.
"I thought there was a convict who escaped; I didn't know what was going on," said a shaken George Roppoccio, 44, a self-employed handyman who has lived all his life in this corner of Westchester County. "I don't think anything like this ever occurred."
It was the first time, in fact, that Con Edison had issued an alert -- the second of four levels of nuclear emergency -- since the Indian Point 2 plant opened in 1974.
Within an hour or so of being notified by Con Edison on Tuesday night, Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester County executive, opened an emergency operations center in White Plains. Mr. Spano also directed the county's Health Department to conduct independent radiation tests within a 2.5-mile radius of the plant, said Adele Dowling, a spokeswoman for the county's Indian Point emergency response team.
Those tests showed nothing abnormal, Ms. Dowling said.
By the small hours of this morning, when Con Edison was reporting that the situation was stabilized, Mr. Spano and the county executives of Rockland, Putnam and Orange Counties decided that it would not be necessary to sound the 153 sirens within a 10-mile radius of Indian Point. To date, the sirens have only blared during drills, Ms. Dowling said.
Mr. Spano was so confident, in fact, that he decided to go ahead, as planned, with a business trip to Los Angeles this morning to get advice -- ironically enough -- from officials operating a new emergency services center.
"He was assured that there was no public threat," said Susan Tolchin, a spokeswoman for Mr. Spano.
To disseminate information, emergency officials opened a media center at Westchester County Airport on Tuesday night and established what Con Edison called a "rumor control" phone number. By early this evening, more than 450 people had called.
Even so, some people said that the very term "rumor control" did not exactly inspire confidence in what officials were saying.
"It was weird," said Ann Makelainen of the use of "rumor control" to calm fears. "I'd rather be notified than have to listen to the news. I'd rather be safe than sorry," said Ms. Makelainen, a receptionist at the National Maritime Historical Society in Peekskill, which is within view of the Indian Point plant, less than a quarter-mile away.
For years, many people here have been ambivalent about their relationship with Con Edison and Indian Point. While grateful for the taxes the plant pumps into the local economy, many people also say that they feel that Con Edison has not done enough to inform the public, especially considering the plant's spotty record in recent years.
At Johnny Rit's, a sports bar near the entrance to the plant, the owner, Johnny Ritornato, and the manager, Johnny Ritornato Jr., had different interpretations. The younger Ritornato said that he could not trust Con Edison. But the elder Ritornato, who has owned the bar for 35 years and counts many Indian Point workers among his regulars, said he did not mind not being notified about what had happened.
As he watched the crush of journalists in the area this afternoon, he said: "Most everyone who works at Indian Point, they are all pretty intelligent guys. I think they know what they are doing. They all have degrees, some have master's, some have doctorates, some have worked on submarines; they're a solid bunch."
But one of Mr. Ritornato's customers, George Ondek, was more skeptical, more nervous.
"You never know," Mr. Ondek said, in between sips of a soda. "I was surprised they didn't notify us. Why were all the government agencies notified and not the general public? After Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, of course you worry about these things."

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S NEWS CONFERENCE: THE OVERVIEW;
Clinton Moves to Give Northeast Aid With Fuel Oil

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY and DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
President Clinton today pledged even more money for Northeasterners grappling with the soaring cost of home heating oil, even as he acknowledged that federal heating assistance funds may not be adequate to help low-income families endure the winter.
Also today, at a meeting with consumer groups and industry leaders in Boston, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the federal government had been caught by surprise by the heating oil problem. "We were caught napping," Mr. Richardson said. "We got complacent." 
 In his first news conference of the year, Mr. Clinton touched on the political campaigns of his wife and his vice president, and he left the door open to a visit next month to Pakistan, a nation in the middle of a domestic crisis and a nuclear standoff with India.
But Mr. Clinton focused much of his attention on the big increase in heating oil prices, saying he would order that the remaining $125 million in a Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program be made immediately available -- on top of $200 million already released -- and would seek from Congress $600 million in additional emergency funds for states hardest hit by the cold.
"Over the last seven years, we've stood to help the victims of earthquakes in California, of the farm crisis and a 500-year flood in the Middle West," Mr. Clinton said. "Now the families in the Northeast need our help, too, and we must act."
Along with the funding increases, Mr. Clinton also called on the states to liberalize the income limits so more families could receive the federal aid.
Mr. Clinton stopped short of ordering any release of oil from the government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, even though a growing chorus of officials in the Northeast have urged that the oil be put on the market to depress prices. But the president said he had not ruled out tapping into the emergency reserve later.
Mr. Clinton fielded 20 questions in an hour. He insisted he did not want to involve himself in either the presidential race or his wife's run for senator from New York, but he could not help himself.
Asked how it felt to be used as a rhetorical punching bag by Republican presidential candidates, Mr. Clinton said he was not surprised that the Republicans were eager to attack him personally.
"They can't run against the longest economic expansion in history, or the lowest crime rate in 30 years, or the lowest welfare rolls in 30 years," he said, ticking off his familiar litany of statistics and expressing "sympathy" for the position the Republicans found themselves in.
On foreign policy, Mr. Clinton held out the possibility that he would extend a trip to India and Bangladesh next month to include a stop in Pakistan -- a move that would put him at the center of a tense nuclear standoff. Mr. Clinton had originally hoped to visit both India and Pakistan, but the military coup in Islamabad led to the conclusion that he could not appear to be giving legitimacy to military leaders who had overthrown a democratically elected government.
Behind the scenes, the administration has told the Pakistanis that if they want Mr. Clinton to visit -- a trip the Secret Service has insisted ought to last only a few hours -- they must set a timetable for a return to democratic elections and some steps toward curbing terrorism.
"I will make a decision about whether to go based on what I think will best serve the long-term interests in nonproliferation and trying to stop, particularly, a nuclear arms race," Mr. Clinton said today. "The very real danger that a conflict between India and Pakistan not contained is one of the most significant security threats to the interest of the United States in this new century."
Mr. Clinton said the United States would step in to act as a mediator in the territorial dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir, but only if both countries asked. "Unless we are asked by both parties to help," he said, "we can't get involved."
Mr. Clinton also pressed Congress to move quickly on granting China permanent trading status with the United States, under the deal struck late last year to permit China into the World Trade Organization. For the last two decades Congress has extended that trading status year-by-year and used the run-up to those votes to highlight Chinese human rights violations, trade barriers to American goods and military threats to Taiwan.
But the debate has become an empty one. Each year Congress has given in to overwhelming pressure from American businesses, which say they would lose billions if the trade status is not extended. Under the World Trade Organization's rules, Congress would no longer have a choice. It could not keep China on a year-by-year string, constantly threatening to yank its trading privileges.
Mr. Clinton tried today, as he has in private meetings this week with members of Congress, to make a broader case. "This is a huge national security issue," he said.
"This trade agreement offers no increased access to the American markets by China, but gives us dramatically increased access to their markets. Moreover, it means we can get access to their markets without having to transfer technology or agree to do manufacturing in their country."
Nonetheless, American officials say they expect that, as a practical matter, China will continue to get technology and more American manufacturing presence.
On the domestic front, Mr. Clinton repeated his call for Congressional action on gun control legislation this year and said he saw no reason for the federal government to follow the state of Illinois in calling a temporary halt to executions.
Also, by providing more heating oil money, Mr. Clinton sought to dampen the growing calls for more expansive action. Those pushing for a release of some of the country's oil reserves include members of both parties. One is Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Hillary Rodham Clinton's rival in the New York Senate race, who has been running television commercials on the issue.
Immediately after the president's announcement, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, criticized Mr. Clinton's action for not going far enough.
"This will help the one million New Yorkers who benefit from this program," Mr. Schumer said.
But he added that dispensing more money from the oil fund "will not provide long-term relief for the price hikes that we are seeing in heating oil bills and will soon see at the gas pump."
