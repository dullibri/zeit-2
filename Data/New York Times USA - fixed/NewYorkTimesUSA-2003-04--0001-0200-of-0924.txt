HEADLINE: SK Group Restates Earnings And Korean Stocks Tumble 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, March 31 

 BODY:
Fresh problems emerged today at the scandal-plagued trading arm of the SK Group, South Korea's third-largest conglomerate, rocking the Korean financial community and sending other stocks tumbling.
 The trading company, SK Global, restated its 2002 earnings today for the second time in a month, turning what was reported as a profit of 194.2 billion won ($155 million) into a loss of 296.7 billion won ($237 million). SK Global also said its $5.3 billion in debts exceeded its assets by $169 million at the end of the year. 
 The company's chief financial officer, Moon Duk Kyu, resigned, and trading in the company's shares was suspended by the Korea Stock Exchange until Wednesday.
Investors responded today by bidding down Korean stocks generally by 3.7 percent. Earlier problems at the company, including an investigation of $1.2 billion in overstated revenue for 2001 and the indictment of 10 SK Group executives on fraud charges, have battered confidence in South Korean markets, prompting investors to withdraw billions of dollars from investment funds and to shun corporate bonds.
The revelations today raised new questions about the effect SK Global's troubles would have on other companies in the SK Group. The SK Corporation, the country's largest oil refiner and the central company in the group, owns 40 percent of SK Global, which markets its products; the refining company's chairman, Chey Tae Won, and another top aide are in jail awaiting trial.
Alarmed officials from the Ministry of Finance are meeting this week to discuss new measures to contain the damage from the scandal. The ministry has already backed away from plans to crack down on the big family-dominated conglomerates, known as chaebol, because of the market panic that the SK scandal has caused.
More bad news today from other fronts rattled South Korean investors as well, including a worrisome increase in inflation and the threat of American antidumping measures against the country's memory-chip makers.
The United States Commerce Department is due to decide soon on a complaint from Micron Technologies that it has suffered heavy losses because Hynix Semiconductor, a bankrupt chip maker being run by creditors including state-owned banks, has sold chips below the cost of production and has been kept alive by subsidies. 
If the department imposes sanctions, that would also affect Samsung Electronics, the world's largest maker of the chips, which accounts for 20 percent of the entire market value of the Korean Stock Exchange. Samsung shares fell by 7.5 percent today; Hynix shares do not trade.
Consumer prices were 4.5 percent higher in March than in March 2002, the National Statistical Office reported today. Much of the increase was attributable to rising energy prices and the falling value of the South Korean won, making imports more expensive. The won has fallen 7 percent against the dollar since its peak in mid-January.
Analysts said that the widening problems at SK Group and other conglomerates, coming against the backdrop of nuclear tensions with North Korea and uncertainty about developments in the Middle East, were beginning to create a crisis atmosphere in South Korea, even though the country's current difficulties appear to be far less severe than they were during the economic crisis of 1997 and 1998.
SK Global said that the latest restatement of results came about because on the advice of auditors from Ernst & Young, it had reclassified some customer accounts from receivable to uncollectible and had written them off. There was no indication that prosecutors would add these accounting moves to its investigation.

HEADLINE: A New Look for a 10-Story Oddity 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Evoking both loom and kiln, the Museum of Arts and Design plans to reclad 2 Columbus Circle -- an abandoned work of romantic modernism that has irritated and amused New Yorkers for 39 years -- in a scrim of bright terra cotta.
 The plan will almost surely set off a contentious public review. Admirers of the original filigreed design by Edward Durell Stone may make one last effort to save the facade, even though the designation committee of the Landmarks Preservation Commission has already declined to nominate the structure. 
 Under the redesign, daylight would for the first time fill the inside of what is now a nearly windowless building. Slits and openings between the four-inch terra-cotta panels would give museumgoers views of Central Park and allow pedestrians to glimpse the galleries through a diaphanous veil. Vertical glass channels, filled with artwork, would penetrate the 10-story structure. 
The redesign, by Brad Cloepfil of Allied Works Architecture, was presented yesterday to the City Planning Commission, whose approval is required for the sale of 2 Columbus Circle, a city-owned building. The museum, formerly the American Craft Museum, would move there in 2006 from 40 West 53rd Street.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that Mr. Cloepfil had "come up with a brilliant design that will bring this iconic building back to life and integrate it into the urban fabric of the neighborhood while preserving its unique personality."
Unlike preservation battles in which venerable landmarks are defended from replacement by mediocrities, this debate will concern functional improvements to a structure about which even admirers confess ambivalence, reaching for words like zany, whimsical, kitschy, kooky and quirky to describe it.
"The way this building will be successful is as a new work of architecture," said Laurie Beckelman, a former chairwoman of the landmarks commission who directs the building program for the museum.
Holly Hotchner, the museum director, said the choice of a facade made of clay, fired into a warp-and-weft pattern in terra cotta, "speaks to who we are" -- an institution concerned with material and craft.
A spectral memory of Stone's building, though not its specific imagery of circles and arches, will be embodied in the redesign. "At one level," Mr. Cloepfil said, "we are trying to maintain its monumentality, but at the same time make it a more ephemeral body, so it begins to merge with Columbus Circle."
Though the size and shape of 2 Columbus Circle would not change -- most notably the concave north wall, which follows the circle's arc -- it would lose its filigreelike portholes, sidewalk arcade lined in lollipop-shaped columns, two-story upper loggia and white marble cladding, which is in such a sorry state of repair that a protective sidewalk bridge has had to be erected.
Behind the terra-cotta panels would be glass-enclosed openings of varied dimensions, some as high as 70 feet. Holes would be opened through the floors to create uninterrupted interior glass columns, three or four feet square, that would be filled with artworks.
In another gesture to unify the building vertically, a processional staircase would be built on the Broadway side of the building, linking the six public floors.
Stone's unusual interior design, in which galleries are stepped around the elevator core at half-story intervals, would be eliminated. Each of the 3,650-square-foot floors would then be on a single level. Above the galleries would be classrooms, studios, offices and a restaurant.
The 155-seat Mark Goodson Theater in the basement would be left largely intact.
Two Columbus Circle opened in 1964 as the Gallery of Modern Art. It was built by Huntington Hartford, heir to the A.&P. supermarket fortune, to house his own collection and serve as a bulwark in his passionate fight against abstract art.
"It will last for generations to come," Stone predicted when he unveiled his design. As it happened, the gallery lasted five years.
Fairleigh Dickinson University took over in 1969 and ran the building until 1975 as the New York Cultural Center, where art exhibitions were held. The city then used it as a visitors center and headquarters for the Cultural Affairs Department. The agency moved out in 1998; the space has since been vacant.
Last year the building was awarded to the museum by the city Economic Development Corporation. The museum estimates that it will cost $50 million to acquire the property and renovate the building. Though Ms. Hotchner would not break down the costs, she said the city would allow the museum to defer much of the acquisition payment until 2008 and thereafter.
The preservation fight would probably be led by the Landmark West group on the West Side. "While we look forward to the building's reuse, we believe it is incumbent on the city to exercise caution and treat Stone's design with the respect it deserves," the group said last week.
Landmark West and the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects sponsored a panel discussion in February on the building.
"This is almost like an architectural folly," said Thomas Mellins, an architectural historian who moderated the panel. "Do we need quirky folly to have the overall texture be rich and vital in the city? Or canwe live without it?"
Folly or not, Theodore H. M. Prudon, president of the Docomomo U.S. preservation group, said it was a "very significant building by a very significant architect."
Billie Tsien, who designed the new American Folk Art Museum at 45 West 53rd Street with Tod Williams, allowed that 2 Columbus Circle had "good bones" but said it was a "very, very problematic building to be a gallery space."
She praised the choice of Mr. Cloepfil to redesign the building, though she had yet to see his proposal. "It's very hard for me to sort of prejudge something that I don't know and say that this building must remain as it is," Ms. Tsien said. "Because if it remains as it is, it's a dead building."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL; 
Extra Pampering forUsers of Car Services

BYLINE:  By TANYA MOHN 

 BODY:
The economic downturn may have produced an era of no frills, but for the business traveler taking a limousine or car service these days, times have never been better. 
 Being chauffeured around town is safer and more comfortable than ever, service providers and customers say. And if you like V.I.P. treatment, you'll definitely get it from limousine companies eager for your business and from drivers desperate to hang onto their jobs. 
 "We're trying to make limousine travel like a luxury hotel on wheels, to offer the same service a traveler would receive at the Four Seasons or the Ritz-Carlton," said Tom Mazza, executive director of the National Limousine Association in Marlton, N.J.
Since the Sept. 11 attacks, many ground-transportation companies have closed, and the competition for existing business is fiercer than ever. At Hollywood Limousine in New York, for example, drivers routinely do little extras like storing your coat until you return from a trip to a tropical climate. On their way to pick you up or while waiting for you to emerge from a business meeting, they will walk your dogs, pick up your groceries or even baby-sit for you. 
"We can't lower our price," said David Stone, Hollywood Limousine's owner. "So we have to give you more."
Joseph Rucker Jr., a corporate chauffeur with Commonwealth Limousine Worldwide in Boston, takes a more low-key approach that emphasizes quiet dignity and efficiency. He maps out his route before he gets in the car, tells clients he is there for their every need and gives them his business card so they can reach him at all times. He also wears custom-tailored suits, many with jackets a touch longer than most to resemble the traditional tunic-style chauffeur's uniform.
"I take my wardrobe very seriously," he said.
Customers have noticed. According to Mr. Rucker's boss, Dawson A. Rutter, requests for him to be at the wheel come in at the rate of three or four a day, and Mr. Rutter has to decide who gets him and who does not.
One fan is Jane Lanouette, senior vice president for publicity and promotions for Allied Advertising in Boston, which specializes in motion picture advertising and public relations. "I'm the most anal-compulsive person in the world," Ms. Lanouette said, referring to Mr. Rucker's famous punctuality, "but he's worse."
Mr. Rutter has assigned his star driver to coach his 75 colleagues on the art of pleasing customers, from basics like opening doors for them to special touches like knowing which restaurants and hotels to recommend.
"We even instruct drivers to tip doormen at hotels, so next time they pick up a client the doorman will say, 'I've got a spot right here in front for you,' " Mr. Rutter said.
Tran-Star Executive Transportation Services in Deer Park, N.Y., has also stepped up training for its drivers on winning the hearts of business travelers. It offers service "tidbits of the day," like keeping magazines and newspapers on hand for customers and memorizing regulars' taste in coffee; it sends out written guidelines on proper behavior; it holds weekly lectures and tutorials; and it has dispatchers give periodic talks via two-way radio on the importance of defensive driving. The company also gives drivers awards for exemplary work.
"A lot of times, I write a personal note that I put in the driver's paycheck," said Michael A. Rice, Tran-Star's president.
All the coaching apparently works. Howard S. Stapler, a vice president at Henry Schein in Melville, N.Y., says Tran-Star drivers know he loves sports. "So they will put the ballgame on the radio, or if I miss a game they will give me a rundown of the scores," he said.
While all the pampering is nice, it is safety that business executives care most about. And it is safety that they are getting. To rein in insurance costs that have shot up by an estimated average of 40 percent since Sept. 11, 2001, companies are investing more in driver-safety and training programs.
And they are becoming much more careful about hiring, increasing the criminal-background and drug-screening checks on job applicants.
Technological advances in the industry have also increased safety. DriveCam, an on-board video system that tracks the car's jarring movements, like sudden braking or colliding with another object, is being used by an increasing number of car services and is credited with preventing accidents. "It is like having a supervisor in your car," said Mr. Rice, owner of Tran-Star, who added that the number of traffic mishaps by his drivers decreased 35 percent in the first year after the system was adopted.
New technology makes riding in a limousine vastly more convenient than it was only a few years ago, too. New software enables limousine drivers and their passengers to tap into the latest information on airline flights or to book a car service in any city in the world. Some companies have installed global positioning system navigational systems in their cars, making it easier to get around.
"We try just about anything and everything," said Michael Zappone, president of All Transportation Network, a limousine service in Newburgh, N.Y.
His eagerness to please has won over an initially skeptical Jacquelyn Appeldorn, general manager of Mohonk Mountain House in New Paltz, N.Y., a resort popular with corporate clients. It had always provided its own transportation for guests, first with coach and buggy in its early years in the late 19th century, then with cars. "We had a lot of trepidation giving up that control," she said.
But after All Transportation persuaded her of its ability to respond to calls on short notice, to be available 24 hours a day, to handle sudden changes in travel plans and even to keep operating in snowstorms, she signed up.
Limousine rides have also become more relaxing with the advent of the Executive L series of Lincoln Town Cars. It has become the new standard, people in the industry say, giving passengers an extra six inches of legroom and the ability to adjust the heat and radio.
"They have the comfort of a stretch without the showiness of showing up in a limo," said Mr. Zappone of All Transportation Network.
The use of all that space differs starkly between men and women, Mr. Mazza, the head of the National Limousine Association, has found. Mr. Mazza, who is the co-author of "Stretching It: The Story of the Limousine" (SAE International, 2002), says his own unscientific observations and those of drivers he knows have found some interesting contrasts: 
*Female executives tend to close their eyes while riding, while men are more likely to whip out a laptop or get on the phone.
*Women view the car as a safe haven to rest and feel secure, and are more concerned that drivers should dress immaculately and speak well; for men, getting to their destination as quickly as possible is paramount.
*Male executives also care more about the model and year of the car than women do.
But not all men care all that much. In fact, both sexes are fairly pragmatic in viewing the interior of the limousine as just another temporary working space.
"The car doesn't matter to me at all, provided it has a reading light," said Michael Korda, editor in chief of Simon & Schuster, who uses All Transportation to get to his weekend home after the frequent evening events he attends in Manhattan. "What matters to me is reliability and punctuality. They have never failed to get me. That is the bottom line. What I really want is that absolute certainty it will work, however bad the weather is."

HEADLINE: Manufacturing On Downswing In Midwest 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Manufacturing in the Chicago area unexpectedly contracted in March for the first time in five months as the war with Iraq shook consumer confidence and slowed spending, a survey of purchasing executives showed yesterday.
 The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its factory index fell to 48.4 in March from 54.9 in February. Readings below 50 mean business is contracting. 
 The group also said that a measure of production fell the most in 23 years and that companies placed fewer orders with the region's factories. Weakening manufacturing and expectations of a second consecutive drop in employment in March suggested the economy was stalling.
"It seems to me as if the economy contracted in February and March," said David Rosenberg, the chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch in New York, speaking of the nationwide economy. The last time the economy shrank was the third quarter of 2001, when it was in a recession that economists say ended later that year.
On March 18, Federal Reserve policy makers promised "heightened surveillance" of economic data to assess the war's effect on the economy. Some economists have said the central bank might consider an interest rate cut before its next scheduled meeting in May. The Fed's benchmark rate is at a 41-year low of 1.25 percent.
The purchasing managers' index had been expected to fall to 50.5, according to the median of 53 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Factory activity in the Milwaukee region in March was the weakest since October 2001, a separate report yesterday showed. Economists said they expected the Institute for Supply Management's factory index, to be released today, to show that manufacturing contracted nationwide in March.
The Chicago purchasers' index of new orders fell to 52.5 in March from 59 in February. A gauge of production slumped to 49.1 from 62.4. That was the biggest monthly decrease since May 1980.
The employment index fell to 45.1 from 46.6 in February. The region's factories have been cutting jobs since March 2000, the longest decline in two decades. The inventories index rose to 48 from 46.2. 
The prices-paid index increased to 62.8 from 54.9.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE GROUND -- In Toron to; 
A City With Clean Streets and a Low Crime Rate

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

 BODY:
Toronto, Canada's largest city, is home to all five of the country's biggest banks and its main stock exchange. Helped by North American free trade, Toronto's economy has diversified in recent years, and the skyline is about to gain a 68-story Trump Tower. Nortel Networks, once the darling of Canadian investors but now flirting with penny-stock status, is based in a Toronto suburb. However, the North American technology slump has done relatively little damage to the city's economy. 
 Visitors from south of the border like the clean streets and low crime rate -- and the slices of America, like the Blue Jays baseball team and Raptors basketball team. Hollywood has filmed numerous productions here, including "Chicago," star of this year's Oscars. 

AIRPORT
Some exasperated Torontonians describe Lester B. Pearson International Airport as the world's biggest construction site with planes. Nineteen miles northwest of downtown, Pearson is in the midst of a $2.9 billion revamping, including a new terminal serving Air Canada and its Star Alliance partners that will have 258 check-in counters and 12,600 parking spaces when it opens in October. Most United States carriers will continue to operate from Terminal 3.
Turboprop flights to Ottawa and Montreal operate out of the City Center Airport on an island that is accessible from downtown by ferry only, though the city plans to build a bridge to replace the boat in 2004. The business community favors the project but waterfront residents worry about increased air traffic and noise.

HOTELS
The FAIRMONT ROYAL YORK (416-368-2511, $146 to $206) is one of a string of stately hotels built across Canada in the early 20th century for passengers on the Canadian Pacific railroad. Paul Summerville, head of Toronto-Dominion Securities' Asia-Pacific operations in Tokyo, says the concierge desk is always staffed with two or three people who know the ins and outs of Toronto. Another benefit, especially in winter, is the hotel's connection to the city's labyrinth of underground walkways and shopping malls.
The RENAISSANCE TORONTO HOTEL AT THE SKYDOME (416-341-7100, $133 and up), a short walk from the financial district, has rooms overlooking left field of the Blue Jays' ballpark.
Boutique hotels are few, but one favorite is the WINDSOR ARMS (416-971-9666, $190). It has 26 suites and 2 rooms, and is situated on the edge of the Yorkville shopping and entertainment district, a short cab or subway ride from downtown.

RESTAURANTS
The place for bankers and lawyers to be seen is CANOE (416-364-0054, $150 for dinner for two, including wine and tip), on the 54th floor of the Toronto-Dominion Center, overlooking Lake Ontario. Besides the view, Peter Glossop, a partner at Osler Hoskin & Harcourt, a law firm, said, "There's a nice buzz; everyone's scanning the room, wondering what's going on."
Ethnic restaurants abound. One popular Chinese choice downtown is KING'S GARDEN (416-585-2221, $97). Hershell Ezrin, chief executive of GPC International, a consulting firm, likes the chicken feet in black bean sauce, the baby bok choy with garlic, deep-fried eggplant with salt, and the "wonderful steamed dumplings."
Philip Asseff, president of MCAP Securities, a mortgage trader, sometimes takes clients to MILDRED PIERCE (416-588-5695, $93), a 15-minute drive west of downtown in a burgeoning movie-production and fashion district. He says male guests often remark that their wives would like the place. The desserts are a big hit.

ENTERTAINMENT
As many residents of Buffalo, Cleveland and Detroit can attest, an inexpensive way to take in a Broadway play or musical is to head for Toronto. Among the most popular of the smaller theater companies are CAN STAGE (416-368-3110), TARRAGON THEATER (416-531-1827) and the FACTORY THEATER (416-504-9971).

BUSINESS LORE
Why did the city treasurer take more than 60 calls at home from Dash Domi, including one at 1 a.m. that lasted an hour? Why did city officials accept a trip from Mr. Domi, a computer-services salesman, to a hockey game in Philadelphia? And what about the $480 cuff links that Mr. Domi gave the son of one of Toronto's most prominent movers and shakers? 
Such are the questions raised by a judicial inquiry into a contract that the city council thought would cost $29 million but ended up at double that, including an $800,000 commission for Mr. Domi. Unaccustomed to scandal at City Hall, Torontonians are riveted.

HEADLINE: Historian Named as Provost As Columbia Shapes Future 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Lee C. Bollinger, the president of Columbia University, yesterday named a Columbia historian, Alan Brinkley, the next provost, a post that will give Mr. Brinkley great influence in shaping the school's future.
 In the past decade, Columbia has gained stature academically, thanks in part to the wide-ranging influence of Jonathan R. Cole, its provost since 1989. Mr. Cole oversaw the strengthening of some weaker departments, the recruitment of star professors, and the development of a new school for children of Columbia faculty members and from the university neighborhood. 
 While Mr. Bollinger has appointed a number of top administrators from outside the university since becoming president last June, he has moved more slowly in choosing his academic cabinet.
And now, in making his first top academic appointment, Mr. Bollinger is effectively reducing the role of provost in two ways.
One is that the president plans to be directly involved in academic affairs rather than leaving their total supervision in the provost's hands, as has been the practice in the past. Mr. Bollinger will also directly oversee health sciences -- including the medical school and nursing, dentistry and public health programs, which had been part of Mr. Cole's portfolio.
"I don't believe in the cliched organizational structure of having the president doing the outside work and the provost focusing on the internal affairs," Mr. Bollinger said yesterday afternoon in a telephone interview from Washington. 
He was there to attend oral arguments today before the Supreme Court in the University of Michigan's affirmative action case. Before coming to Columbia last June, he served as president of the University of Michigan and is named as a defendant in the case.
Despite the changes in the provost's responsibilities, Mr. Bollinger said, Mr. Brinkley, 53, will help set the tone and direction for much of the university, from the arts and sciences to business and law.
He will also have a strong hand in shaping the faculty because the provost forms the committees that determine tenure and makes recommendations to the president for all Columbia professors, including those at Barnard College.
Although Mr. Brinkley will not take office until the end of the school year, Mr. Bollinger said he would consult with him on the selection of two coming academic appointments: the next dean for the graduate journalism school -- an appointment he expects to make sometime this month -- and a new vice president and dean for the school of arts and sciences.
Mr. Brinkley, 53, has been at Columbia since 1991 and is in his third year as chairman of its 40-member history department. He said yesterday that he was completely surprised when Mr. Bollinger suggested he become provost during a dinner a few weeks ago at Shun Lee, a restaurant on the Upper West Side.
"It's not something I ever imagined doing," Mr. Brinkley said. "I have a lot to learn."
Mr. Bollinger chose his new provost without a formal search committee but after discussion with a wide range of people around the country, he said.
In Mr. Brinkley's time as history department chairman, the department has accepted fewer graduate students but provided them with better financial support, moved to a more international curriculum and made a number of new faculty appointments. Mr. Brinkley also introduced a program of departmental seminars over Friday lunches.
Mr. Brinkley said he hoped to be able to continue his teaching and research. He is currently writing a biography of Henry R. Luce.
Eric Foner, a history department colleague and friend of Mr. Brinkley's, described him as "a serious intellectual and a very good administrator, even-tempered and diplomatic."
Mr. Bollinger called Mr. Brinkley one of the most distinguished historians in the United States and a superb teacher. He has shown "an unwavering commitment to academic excellence," Mr. Bollinger said.
Mr. Brinkley was educated at Princeton and Harvard and has specialized in 20th-century American history. His 1982 book, "Voices of Protest: Huey Long, Father Coughlin and the Great Depression," won a National Book Award.
Mr. Bollinger and Mr. Brinkley share many interests, including journalism and the arts. Mr. Bollinger, whose father was a newspaper publisher, is an expert in First Amendment law; Mr. Brinkley comes from a family of journalists; his father is David Brinkley, the television newsman and commentator. Mr. Brinkley was a member of the committee that Mr. Bollinger commissioned recently to think about the future of Columbia's journalism school.
Mr. Brinkley said yesterday that the next few years are likely to be more difficult than the past decade because of the economy and the resulting budget problems that have hit universities nationwide.
The biggest issues for Columbia, he said, are likely to be space and money.
His own department has not been able to hire additional professors recently because there was no office space.

HEADLINE: Mass Layoffs Threatened for Teachers in California 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

DATELINE: ALAMEDA, Calif., March 31 

 BODY:
The entire teaching staff, and some administrators, have received pink slips for the next academic year from the Alameda school district, which serves this island city of 75,000 across the bay from San Francisco.
 No one expects the schools to close in the fall, but the layoff notices, in keeping with a state legal requirement, are an indication of the serious financial troubles haunting California's schools. Not since the economic downturn of the early 1990's have schools here experienced such problems. 
 The pink slips, and those issued to thousands of other teachers across the state this month, also illustrate the mixed -- and some say, very worrying -- signals being sent to prospective new teachers.
California is projected to face years of increasing student enrollment. The state also continues to experience a shortage of teachers, especially in math, science and special education. But now, with the state's budget problems, many districts fear they cannot afford to pay those already in the classroom. 
After years of trying to encourage people to enter teaching through multimillion-dollar programs, state officials are being accused of undermining their own successes with the threat of widespread layoffs. Many critics fear the consequences will be felt long after the current budget crisis passes, particularly if students entering teaching programs now decide the future looks too risky.
"We hear all these things in our school placements, that everyone is getting a pink slip and they are laying off all these first-year teachers," said Sarah Kenley, a graduate student in education at San Francisco State University. "It worries me. I think I just came into the profession at the wrong time."
Education and union officials estimate that 25,000 teachers statewide have received layoff notices this month, which are required under state law if school districts are contemplating letting teachers go this summer. It is unclear how many of those teachers will actually lose their jobs because most districts have not yet settled on budgets for next year. 
Gov. Gray Davis has proposed cutting about $1.6 billion in direct financing for the state's 1,000 school districts, part of his effort to deal with a gaping budget deficit attributed to the high-technology bubble burst and a sluggish economy after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
If the Legislature approves the education cuts, local officials say they will need to increase class sizes, eliminate programs and, unavoidably, let go teachers. They will not know for certain until June, when the state budget is supposed to be approved. Financing for school districts comes primarily from the state and is determined by a complex formula, based on the number of students enrolled and other factors.
"The goal was to keep the cuts as far away from the classroom as possible," said Ann Bancroft, a spokeswoman for Mr. Davis's education secretary, Kerry Mazzoni. "Over the past few years, districts were able to raise salaries, in most cases double-digit increases. That's in fact why some districts are needing to lay off teachers: their inability to sustain the level of increases." 
Alameda went to the extreme and issued pink slips to all 635 of its contract teachers so district officials would have as many options as possible about making cuts, district officials said. Though it is likely that only a small portion of the teaching staff willlose their jobs, the tactic led to protests by teachers outside the district headquarters and prompted the teachers' union to seek a restraining order to block the layoffs. The matter is still in the courts.
"The district figured, 'They aren't going anywhere, they need the jobs,' so we all got fired," said Gretchen Mackler-Lipow, a high school government teacher and a former president of the teachers' union. "I have been teaching for 32 years and I've never seen anything like it. It is absolutely demoralizing."
The district's board has begun public hearings to get suggestions about how to cut about $1.7 million from its $77 million budget. The battle over the cuts, and how many teachers might be affected, has made for some tense moments in a district that narrowly averted a teachers' strike two years ago.
But less noticed and perhaps more significant in the long term was another recent announcement by the district. The annual teacher's recruitment fair, scheduled for April, had been canceled.
It was a difficult decision, even with the prospect of layoffs. Like many districts across the state, Alameda has spent years trying to attract good teachers, as the state has imposed new academic requirements and the demand for teachers, especially those with credentials and training in math and science, has far outpaced the supply.
The district typically hires 60 to 80 new teachers a year just to keep up with attrition. Stepping out of the recruitment scene, even for a year, could make it harder to appeal to teachers down the road.
"We want to attract as many new teachers as we can, and we want to be known as a place teachers want to come," said Donna Fletcher, a spokeswoman for the Alameda Unified School District. "But it is an unsettling time. I feel badly for anybody that is entering the profession at the time of this budget crisis."
Kris Marubayashi, director of CalTeach, a state-backed teachers' referral and recruitment program, said the organization had been working especially hard in recent weeks to separate the issues of recruitment and layoffs in the minds of teachers, students and the general public.
The thousands of pink slips, she said, had rattled nerves and created widespread confusion. She has been encouraging Californians to "take the long-term view" of the state's education needs, she said.
Dr. Marubayashi said the basic factors that led the state to declare a teachers' shortage in the 1990's continued to exist today: increasing student enrollment; class-size reduction programs; and a large number of older teachers nearing retirement. 
"Some of the college students are a little concerned, but we are trying to clarify that it might be rocky the first year out, but the need is going to be there," Dr. Marubayashi said. "The economy goes up and down, and we will weather this."
Wayne Johnson, president of the California Teachers Association, the state's largest teachers' union, described the financial troubles as the worst he had ever seen. Mr. Johnson, who began teaching in Los Angeles in 1962, predicted that districts statewide would lay off more teachers this year than any other year in his career.
At the same time, though, Mr. Johnson said, many districts will find ways around the harshest measures, by offering early retirement packages and saving money through other means, like increasing class sizes. Meanwhile, some big city districts, like Los Angeles, expected no layoffs and were even hiring this month because of big enrollment increases and state financing for special programs, he said. It was in those places, he said, that new teachers should be looking.
Sabrina Wick, 19, of Redlands, Calif., who is studying in San Francisco to become an elementary school teacher, said it was easy to get overwhelmed by the bad news. Some of her colleagues were rethinking their career choices. In her case, though, the turmoil had made her more determined: somewhere in the state, she said, she would be needed.
"It's not going to make me not follow my dreams," Ms. Wick said. "I have wanted to be a teacher since the second grade."

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Administration and Port Authority Get Closer on Possible Land Swap Deal 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The pending deal between the Port Authority and the Bloomberg administration to swap the land beneath two airports for the World Trade Center property has picked up momentum in recent weeks, even as it has become a game of political pick-up sticks setting off repercussions on both sides of the Hudson River.
 The proposed deal appeared breathtakingly simple when it was announced last August: The city would give the Port Authority the 5,610 acres it owns beneath two city airports in exchange for the 16-acre trade center site and lots of cash. The city would gain control of the site, while the authority would get control of the airports. 
 After languishing for months over the terms, the talks on the land swap were revived early this year. Joseph Seymour, executive director of the Port Authority, and Daniel L. Doctoroff, deputy mayor for economic development, met again yesterday to discuss the arrangement. There are still many unresolved issues, including the economic wisdom of the swap for the city. But if it does happen, the officials involved in the talks said, it would occur by July 1 and the start of the city's next fiscal year. 
Although progress is slow, the officials said that the two sides had gotten closer on three key points.
The Port Authority would turn over the site and pay the city $700 million to $800 million in return for the airport land. This puts the two sides considerably closer than the $400 million that once separated them.
The mayor would have an advisory role over the future of the airports, but not the veto power he initially sought.
And the city would take control of the trade center site, after a development plan was arranged that included a memorial park, a transit center and perhaps the first office tower. The city is also pressing the authority to commit to a continuing financial role in rebuilding downtown.
The deal is good for both sides, said Stephen Berger, chairman of Odyssey Investment Partners and a former executive director of the Port Authority. "It is in everyone's long-term interest to do it," he said. "The Port Authority actually does know how to run airports and does a good job of it."
Gov. George E. Pataki favors the deal and wants to do something to help Mr. Bloomberg, one New York official said. But the official added that he expected New Jersey, the state's partner at the Port Authority, to demand its "pound of flesh" for helping.
Micah Rasmussen, a spokesman for Gov. James E. McGreevey, said: "The governor has serious questions about the financing for this deal and how it would affect New Jersey. We have no information as to how the properties are being valued."
For many critics the biggest question is, will the city get enough money? It is no simple matter to value either property for the future. There are no longer any income-producing buildings at the trade center site. Revenue at the airports fell more than 18 percent in the last year, and several airlines are threatening bankruptcy.
Critics have asked why the city should give up a steady rent from the Port Authority and partial control of the airports in return for a "one-shot" dollop of cash and 16 unproductive acres.
Mr. Doctoroff said: "The swap allows New York City to develop the World Trade Center site in a way that best serves the interests of the entire city. Financially, the swap is a win for the city because of the immediate payments and because over the long run, the right development on the World Trade Center site will enhance the economic vitality of all of Lower Manhattan."
The city is under economic pressure to get a deal done soon, whether it is a land swap or a lease extension beyond 2015 at a higher rent. The administration's 2004 budget, which begins in July, includes a $690 million payment from the Port Authority for back rent and a down payment on a new arrangement at the airports.
A deal would also help the Port Authority, whose financing efforts have been hobbled by the looming expiration of the lease at the two airports in 2015.
"If we can get ownership of the airports and a reasonable settlement with the city, then we'll control our own destiny," said Charles A. Gargano, vice chairman of the Port Authority. "We'll get out of the real estate business."
The airports and the trade center have long been a source of friction between the city and the Port Authority, which built the trade center complex. The complex generated an estimated $371 million in revenues in 2000, and paid the city $26.6 million that year in lieu of taxes. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani viewed that as a paltry sum and filed a lawsuit, charging that the payments should be closer to $100 million, the equivalent of property taxes.
The Giuliani administration also refused to extend the airport leases beyond 2015 because, it said, the authority paid so little for use of the land. In 2001, Kennedy and La Guardia airports generated a net income of $153 million, but the authority paid the city only $13.3 million in rent. Under a complicated formula, the rent dropped to $3.5 million in 2002.
The dispute is now before an arbitrator. But the two sides have also been discussing the swap and its ramifications.
Any deal would almost certainly affect the fate of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the agency charged with rebuilding downtown, and Larry S. Silverstein, the developer who currently owns the commercial lease at the World Trade Center.
A swap could also force the authority into a second costly deal, to pay the city of Newark for the land it owns beneath Newark Liberty International Airport.
The Port Authority currently gets $120 million in rent from Mr. Silverstein, who plans to build five new office towers at the trade center site. According to one person at the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, Mr. Silverstein "is adamantly opposed" to a city takeover. Under a swap, the city would receive the rent payments.
In a speech in December, Mayor Bloomberg outlined a broad plan for downtown that included parks, cultural institutions, housing and some office development, but not the 10 million square feet Mr. Silverstein and the authority want to rebuild. Under the plan devised by Mayor Bloomberg and Mr. Doctoroff, the city would take over the land, buy out Mr. Silverstein and get the insurance proceeds from the attack on the trade center, somewhere between $3.5 billion and $6.7 billion.
Top state officials and some executives at the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation criticized Mr. Doctoroff's intentions even as they acknowledged that there was momentum for a deal. They said that Mr. Doctoroff did not want to build new office towers downtown that would compete with his effort to develop the far West Side of Manhattan and build a stadium for the 2012 Olympics.
In response, Mr. Doctoroff said: "There is no relation between the two. We've made it clear what we think the demand will be for office space downtown."

HEADLINE: War Deals Another Blow to Parts of City's Economy 

BYLINE:  By JEANNE B. PINDER 

 BODY:
New York's cabbies know it, and they will tell anyone who asks: the war in Iraq has applied a new set of brakes to a local economy already slowed by terrorism and the economic downturn. 
 Taxis have fewer customers, both locals at peak times and, especially, travelers at hotels and airports. Waits for fares are longer. Tips are lower. Gas prices are up. 
 "A lot of people don't take the cab," said Khan Jaher, 46, a Bangladeshi who has been driving for 10 years, as he sat idle in his cab on 27th Street at Lexington Avenue last Thursday afternoon. "Before it was a little, but since the war it's worse."
His friend M. D. Nijamuddin Miah, another Bangladeshi driver, chimed in. "No tourists," he said. "Very, very bad business."
Early, partial and sometimes contradictory evidence suggests that New Yorkers have grown even less likely to commit to big moves or big purchases. Fewer business and pleasure travelers are visiting the city. And faltering stock prices, which dropped after a brief spell of euphoria, have dashed hopes that the securities industry, a big driver of New York's economy, is about to rise again.
"From what I understand from people in the hotel industry and the retail sector, they all feel that there's a real falloff that will continue as long as we have this situation," said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a business group.
One dramatic example, she said, was a conversation she had recently.
"We had a conference scheduled in May by a national nonprofit that was going to come to the Ritz-Carlton in Lower Manhattan, bringing mayors, university presidents and C.E.O.'s to New York City," she said. "They called me last week and said they just couldn't get people to commit to come because there was a lot of anxiety about coming to New York City during the war."
Some economists agree that the economy is on hold. "The best way to characterize the economy is that it's paralyzed," said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Economy.com, a company that specializes in regional studies. "I don't think businesses and households are doing much of anything. They're just waiting to see how this all plays out. People aren't traveling, they're not shopping aggressively, and certainly businesses are in no mood to expand."
Layoff notices are pouring into the Hotel Trades Council, a union representing hotel workers, said a union spokesman, John Turchiano. He said more than 2,000 of the union's 26,000 workers had been affected, either through layoffs or reduced work schedules.
Preliminary data for the week the war started showed that the number of hotel rooms occupied was down about 7 percent and that room rates were down about 6 percent, compared to the same week last year, for a total room revenue drop of about 13 percent, said John A. Fox, senior vice president at P.K.F. Consulting, a hotel advisory company. Occupancy is still about 70 percent, he said, which is a fairly healthy level, and the average room rate is $185 a day.
A senior regional economist for J. P. Morgan Chase, Marc M. Goloven, said the war had hit New York especially hard because unemployment was already high and because the city's most important industries, including financial services and tourism, were already contracting.
"The city's holding its breath, but at this juncture the pace of business is still headed southward," Mr. Goloven said. "The ultimate resolution of the conflict in Iraq may well determine whether the economy continues to contract, or whether it stabilizes and ultimately business builds a base for the resumption of economic growth, if all goes well."
Another big indicator of the health of the city's economy is real estate sales. It is not yet clear what effect the war will have, said Pamela Liebman, president and chief executive of the Corcoran Group, a big New York residential real estate company. Before the war, she said, people were uncertain, and "uncertainty causes inaction." 
"Anecdotally, our brokers said that before war started there were a lot of buyers sitting on the fence," she said. "Then, once it started, a lot of people seemed to be happy that a decision had been made and they started looking again. But it remains to be seen how many of the deals actually go to contract."
Shoppers presented something of a mixed picture. Steve Guerra, manager of the Bose store selling high-end electronics in the Garden State Plaza mall in Paramus, N.J., said on Friday that his store was on target to meet its sales quota last week. But Jae Lee, who owns Tuscany Leather, in the same mall, said business had been "unbelievably down."
In Westchester, Robert Knapp of Scarsdale Ford and Tim Steele, sales manager at Smith Cairns Subaru in Yonkers, said business had been up since the war started. 
On Broadway, ticket sales do not show any clear trend, said Pattie Armetta-Haubner, a spokeswoman for the League of American Theatres and Producers.
"We were down about 15 percent" in sales the week the war started, compared with the same week last year, she said on Thursday. But weekly ticket sales numbers are compiled from Sunday to Saturday, she said, and so the freshest weekly figures do not reflect even a full week of war. Also muddying the picture is the fact that there were 31 shows on Broadway last year at this time, while this year there are 27.
"It's a little too early to tell" whether the war has had any perceptible effect, she said.
But economists have looked, and they say the signs are not good. 
Mr. Goloven said one indicator he watched, an anecdotal and thus imperfect one, was the number of available seats on his Metro-North train from Greenwich in the morning. Over the last few months, he said, "I've noticed that it seems to be easier to find a seat at peak hours these days, and that is not good from an economist's perspective." 
For the taxi drivers, there's another indicator: tips. "People don't tip now," said Abdul A. Bala, 28, a Ghanaian taxi driver who paused on Lexington Avenue to talk. "Before, if the fare was $4.10, maybe your tip was $2," he said, somewhat wistfully. "Now, it is 50 cents."
Mr. Jaher, the Bangladeshi, said there was another way that war had affected his business. Customers ask him, he said, whom he supports in the war. "We say, 'War is not good for anybody,' " he said.

HEADLINE: As Time Expires in Albany, The Budget Impasse Persists 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 31 

 BODY:
As the clock ran out on the fiscal year, New York's governor and two top legislative leaders emerged from a closed-door meeting tonight without an agreement on a new budget or even a borrowing plan to stave off a government shutdown.
 An unusual agreement struck last week by Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader in the Senate, and Sheldon Silver, the Democratic speaker of the Assembly, about how to borrow billions of dollars, was set aside amid a series of technical questions by the Republican governor, George E. Pataki. 
 The three leaders still said they planned to move ahead with a borrowing plan, but perhaps not until larger questions about the budget were answered, Mr. Silver said. 
Since December, Mr. Pataki has been urging the Legislature to borrow $4.2 billion against what the state is owed after a 1998 court settlement with the nation's big tobacco companies, in a process known as securitization.
Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver agreed on a plan to borrow the money, and said they planned to pass legislation this week to allow tobacco bonds to be sold, even if the governor did not sign on.
But Mr. Pataki continued to raise concerns and today said the riskiness of the borrowing idea had grown. Wall Street has threatened to downgrade the credit ratings for about $18 billion nationally of state-issued tobacco settlement bonds in the near future because last week Philip Morris, responsible for more than half of the settlement payments, was hit with a $10.1 billion court judgment in Illinois.
The governor said the claim by Philip Morris that it could not raise a $12 billion court-ordered bond to appeal the judgment could hurt the state.
"It would have been better to go in December, and that's why I was pushing it in December," Mr. Pataki said. "And part of the idea of tobacco securitization, a significant part, was to place the burden on the bond holder instead of on the taxpayers of New York because these are unsure revenue streams 20 years down the road."
The tobacco money, $1.5 billion of which was to pay continuing costs from the last fiscal year and $2.3 billion was to be used to help close this year's gap, was the centerpiece of the governor's plan to solve the state's $11.5 billion budget gap, the worst since the Great Depression.
Meanwhile, more questions were being raised in Albany about whether tobacco borrowing had become too risky for government to rely on. If the credit ratings for tobacco bonds are reduced it will mean that many states, including New York, will have to pay higher interest rates if they want to use the bonds to help cover their budgets.
"Selling bonds based solely on tobacco revenue was a bad idea when revenues were likely," the state comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, said. "Now, when the revenues are very risky, they should not be on the table at all. They will be either impossible to sell or the interest rate will be so high it would be foolish to pay it."
The news came on a day when New York missed its budget deadline for the 19th consecutive year, a fact all of the leaders agreed was disappointing.
"But we will continue to work," Mr. Pataki said, "hopefully in a cooperative and collegial way, to reconcile the differences that exist -- and they are very significant right now -- as quickly as possible."
At the governor's request, the Legislature followed a familiar drill, passing $3.37 billion worth of emergency appropriations. Unlike the practice in other years, the administration's plan was austere and included money only to pay for core health services, state salaries and some other expenses.
The Legislature also passed a bill to pay debt service on the state's bonds.
New York's total outstanding debt, according to the governor's plan, is $41 billion for fiscal year 2003-04, up from $39.4 billion in the fiscal year that ended today, a spokesman for Mr. Hevesi said. Annual debt service rises this year to $3.4 billion from $3.2 billion last year. The numbers do not include the tobacco securitization plan.
Regarding the budget, Mr. Bruno said he was not giving up hope it could be passed in the next few weeks, perhaps by April 16, which is when the Legislature leaves for spring break.
"We just have to get with it," he said.

HEADLINE: Power Games 

 BODY:
Federal regulators have now provided decisive evidence of the cynical behavior of major energy companies in the power crisis that crippled California's economy in 2000 and 2001. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, in an exhaustive study released last week, found that Enron and more than 30 other major companies in the energy markets manipulated not only wholesale electricity prices but also the price of natural gas, a basic fuel for generators. This manipulation was enough to bankrupt a major utility and cost the state billions in excess electricity charges. 
 Industry complaints about a "biased report" should not be taken seriously. The commission has historically bent over backward to be fair to industry, and the companies will have plenty of opportunities to plead their case before the final report. Meanwhile, though, the basic contours of their deception seem unmistakably clear. 
 The commission noted, however, that California itself is partly to blame for embracing a "fatally flawed" deregulation scheme, which discouraged long-term contracts and virtually invited price manipulation on the daily spot market. In addition, the state did not encourage, and industry did not build, nearly enough generating capacity to keep pace with California's superheated economy.
To everyone's great relief, the crisis has largely receded, for consumers if not for the state's budget -- in part because new capacity has come on line, and in part because of a vigorous, if largely underreported, program of energy conservation. Yet the fact remains that sharks in the energy business made things much worse than they would otherwise have been. Now there is a big gap between what California thinks it is owed in compensation and what the commission thinks it deserves. Whatever the final figure, it should not only be fair but also big enough to send a message about energy suppliers' responsibility to play fair in deregulated markets.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Asia: Japan: Industrial Output Falls 

BYLINE:  By Ken Belson (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Industrial output, a key indicator of economic health, fell a worse-than-expected 1.7 percent in February compared with the previous month, as production of personal computers and passenger cars declined. 
The decrease came as exports to the United States and some parts of Europe were easing. Inventories, however, declined faster than production, a sign that manufacturers are adjusting quickly to weaker demand. Ken Belson (NYT)

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: FOR THE RECORD FROM THE PENTAGON; 
'Good Progress' So Far; Worst May Lie Ahead

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a news conference at the Pentagon yesterday by Victoria Clarke, the Pentagon spokeswoman, and Maj. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, vice director of operations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as recorded by the Federal Document Clearing House Inc. A full transcript is online at nytimes.com/iraq.

Ms. Clarke
 The coalition continues to make good progress toward ending the Iraqi regime, freeing the Iraqi people and disarming the country of weapons of mass destruction. 
 As Secretary Rumsfeld and others reminded us yesterday, coalition troops are within 50 miles of the Iraqi capital; we are approaching Baghdad from the north, the south and the west; we have taken Iraq's only port and control its coastline; the oil wells in the south are being secured for the Iraqi people; and we recently hit a large terrorist facility in northern Iraq.
The bombing continues to weaken the command-and-control leadership. Since the coalition bombed Saddam's headquarters at the very beginning of the war, the world has neither seen his hide nor hair, only tapes. We've not seen his sons. We have seen evidence that family members are fleeing the country, or trying to flee the country.
We continue to put about 2,000 troops a day into the country. One thing that is very clear is the end of the Iraqi regime.
It's also important to note what hasn't happened in the first 10 or 12 days, some of the things that were predicted or feared but haven't happened so far. Unlike the gulf war, no Iraqi Scud missiles have been fired into Israel. Unlike the gulf war, the oil fields have not been turned into a huge bonfire, wreaking enormous economic and environmental damage. There has been thus far no humanitarian crisis or mass exodus of refugees. There has, as yet, been no Iraqi use of weapons of mass destruction.
Of course, bad things may still occur. Some of the toughest fighting, as we have indicated, may well lie ahead.

General McChrystal
More than 300,000 forces are deployed in support of combat operations with more than a third of those inside Iraq.
Our ground operations are continuing to engage enemy positions throughout Iraq. We've seized additional key bridges over the Euphrates River, and conducted offensive operations to isolate Samarra and Nasiriya in order to destroy irregular forces in those areas.
We flew about 1,000 sorties over Iraq yesterday, mostly against the Medina, Hammurabi, Baghdad and Al Nida Divisions. We also hit the command, control and communications targets and air-defense sites in Baghdad and in northern Iraq.
Our forces have fired more than 700 Tomahawk land attack missiles and dropped more than 8,000 precision-guided munitions since Operation Iraqi Freedom began.

Questions and Answers

Q. -- You said you'd seen evidence of family members fleeing the country and trying to flee the country -- Saddam's family members. What kind of evidence do you see now that family members are fleeing the country?
MS. CLARKE -- We have seen some reports recently -- and I'll just leave it at that -- that some family members, including family members of very senior officials, are trying to get out of the country.
Q. -- There are reports from the front that they found some kind of a torture chamber near this hospital that was used by Iraqi forces. Do you have any information that the Iraqis have used torture on coalition prisoners?
MS. CLARKE -- I don't have any information on what you just said, but there are reams and reams and reams of information about what the Iraqi regime has done for decades. I mean, it is policy, it is practice, there's bureaucracy behind it, civilians and military alike, what they do. . . . 
Q. -- Are the B-52's dropping dumb bombs in what we used to call carpet bombing on the Republican Guard troops?
 GENERAL McCHRYSTAL -- Sir, they are not. They are dropping a combination of munitions, a large number of precision munitions. So there's really not carpet bombing occurring.
Q. -- Can you say how much these Republican Guard divisions have been degraded? And are you still seeing a problem with them moving their armor and so forth into civilian areas?
GENERAL McCHRYSTAL -- We are seeing significant degradation of those forces. I won't put an exact number on it, but I'll say very significant weakening of the forces.
We are seeing some movement in Republican Guard formations as well. We are seeing movement around the battlefield. What we think we're seeing them do is move to reinforce other forces that have already been significantly degraded or attrited at this point. So we think they're trying to strengthen where they were.
Q. -- And they're putting their armor in civilian areas. Does that continue to be a problem with taking that armor out?
GENERAL McCHRYSTAL -- Well, we continue to see them put it next to houses, all kinds of structures. So it's still targetable, but it's more difficult.
Q. -- Is there an effort to try to stop the units that are up on that front line from retreating back into Baghdad?
GENERAL McCHRYSTAL -- Sir, there are maneuvers going to try to destroy those divisions that stand in our way.
Q. -- Is there any reason it's taking so long to take down Basra?
MS. CLARKE -- It's too soon to characterize which way it's going. We know where it will go eventually, but it could take some time.
We know that is a place where some of the worst of the worst of the Iraqi regime were slaughtering people, putting civilians in front of the fighting, those sorts of things.
Q. -- General McChrystal, could you talk a little bit about the planned follow-on force that's now moving to the region.
GENERAL McCHRYSTAL -- As you know, the plan was set up, or it was developed initially, to start with a force with a flow that then could be shut off if not required. We had the follow-on forces that are now -- some in movement, some in preparation for movement -- all under orders for movement that can be shut off if not required. And the way it was designed was, if opportunity struck and conflict was not required or if very early success was achieved, in fact, the number of forces flowed could be adjusted.
The others that come in, all come in with their full combat capability and can support the actions required.
Q. -- So what will they be doing now, broadly speaking, this 100,000 or so, the mission that they will be fulfilling once they get there? . . . 
GENERAL McCHRYSTAL -- It will be exactly based upon what's required on the ground. If in fact they're required to maneuver and be part of that combat fight, that's what they'll do, and they are prepared for that.
Q. -- General, for the record, have any of coalition forces to date located any chemical weapons or biological weapons in Iraq? If not, more broadly, do you think you have an idea of where they are? And how concerned are you that some of our air attacks, coalition air attacks, might hit a storage place or chemical weapons and release a toxic plume?
GENERAL McCHRYSTAL -- We have not located any chemical or biological weapons to date. We still believe very strongly that the regime has the capability and potentially the intent to employ those weapons. We are targeting in a number of ways, through information operations, through attacking launchers or capabilities, the different ways they could deliver those munitions to try again to prevent their use.
We are very carefully targeting suspected or potential storage sites for just the reasons you outlined, so that we don't get an unintended effect by targeting something kinetically. So we have some other methods we can do that.
But I'd remind you that when chemical and biological weapons are used, in fact, once they're disseminated they can be put in fairly small, difficult-to-predict areas. They can be delivered by everything from a garbage truck to a car bomb, as well as, of course, conventional artillery. So we have got to maintain our own posture and preparation for that.
Q. -- General, you showed that video of a bomb hitting a bunker near H-2, and that's one of the few times that I've seen much information at all come out about what's happening in western Iraq. Could you describe what's going on out there?
GENERAL McCHRYSTAL -- Sir, we have a combination of Special Operations forces operating in western Iraq supported by air, supported by information operations.
They are doing what probably could be termed an area-denial mission. They are able to move almost at will wherever they want. They have been cutting some lines of communication, they've been raiding some facilities, they've been going to some suspected weapons of mass destruction locations. We've had a series of direct action raids, as well as interdiction.
So we think what we've done is in addition to doing some counter-Scud work out there, and denial -- we think that we have denied the regime the ability to operate effectively at all in western Iraq.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: ESTRANGED ALLIES; 
Turkey Works to Allay Western Worries

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, March 31 

 BODY:
After his party's overwhelming victory in Turkish parliamentary elections last November, Recep Tayyip Erdogan sped to European capitals and Washington, a prime minister-in-waiting out to affirm his country's westward course.
 Mr. Erdogan's Islamist roots had fostered doubts about his desire for European Union membership and fidelity to the United States. He seemed determined to allay those anxieties. 
 But four months later, they are as strong as ever and events, largely tied to the war in Iraq, have combined to isolate Turkey and raise important questions about its geopolitical destiny.
Western diplomats, Turkish political analysts and other experts say that Turkey now finds itself in a pivotal position: at odds with Europe, in disfavor with the United States and in desperate need of mending fences.
"It's a challenging and awkward moment," said Ilter Turkmen, a former Turkish foreign minister. "Something has gone wrong."
One indication of that was the announcement today that the American Secretary of State, Colin L. Powell, would come here this week to try to repair a breach that diplomats say could prompt Turkey to turn inward and stoke nationalist sentiments. As the United States stirs new levels of resentment in the Muslim world, it sorely needs the fidelity and friendship of Turkey, the only predominantly Muslim member of NATO and a relatively stable democracy in a volatile region.
"There's a syndrome in Turkey known as the hero syndrome: Turkey stands alone," said one Western diplomat in Turkey, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"There is a possibility now of Turkey entering a stage of isolation, rediscovering the true values of Turkey that have been corrupted by the West, unloved by the West, punished and injured by the West," the diplomat said.
"Long-term," thediplomat added, "it's scary."
Morton I. Abramowitz, a former American ambassador to Turkey, said that in a matter of only months, "Turkey has endangered the whole westward edifice of its policies."
Mr. Abramowitz was referring primarily to Turkey's rejection of an American plan to move troops through Turkey into northern Iraq.
That was a profound military and diplomatic setback for the United States. It left American politicians furious and cost Turkey an aid package of at least $6 billion.
But Mr. Abramowitz was also alluding to Turkey's persistent problems with the European Union and its inability to reach a settlement that would unite the Turkish and Greek sectors of Cyprus.
Despite strong pressure from the United Nations, Rauf Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, would not budge. He ignored even the clearly expressed wishes of Turkish Cypriots, and government officials here proved unable -- or, perhaps, unwilling -- to control him.
As a result, Greek Cyprus will sign an accession treaty next month to join the European Union; Turkish Cyprus will be left out. Many European Union leaders have said that Turkey will be denied membership until the island is reunified.
The implications of Turkey's isolation are serious.
Paul D. Wolfowitz, the United States deputy defense secretary, had often touted Turkey as an example for the region and assumed its steadfast allegiance, a miscalculation that underscored the complexities of diplomacy in this part of the world.
European Union leaders, besides being concerned about Turkey's human rights record and the implications of accepting a Muslim country into predominantly Christian Europe, are seriously worried by Turkey's determination to prevent the emergence of a Kurdish state in northern Iraq. The Europeans have repeatedly warned the Turks against sending troops into the region.
Both France and Germany firmly opposed war in Iraq, but Turkish government officials and analysts deny that the decision to deny American troops passage through Turkey was motivated by a desire to move closer to these European powers.
A few analysts said that Turkey, one of the few Muslim countries with warm relations with Israel, could even begin to identify more closely with Arab states in the region.
But most analysts said that was unlikely, because Turkey had too long a secular tradition, enforced by its powerful military, and too little cooperation with Arab nations, which do not see Turkey as one of them.
There are also indications -- convincing to some Western diplomats, unconvincing to others -- that Turkish government officials want to patch up their frayed relationship with the United States.
In interviews and private conversations, officials with Mr. Erdogan's Justice and Development Party reveal something of an obsession with the degree to which that partnership, a source of vital economic support, has been hurt.
In the last week, Turkish leaders have offered qualified assurances that Turkish troops would stay out of northern Iraq. Mr. Erdogan, now the prime minister, reiterated that position in an op-ed piece published today in the European edition of The Wall Street Journal.
According to diplomats and political analysts, Mr. Erdogan genuinely wanted American ground troops in Turkey, and the financial aid package, but a convergence of political circumstances got in the way.
Before the Turkish parliament narrowly rejected his plan, Turkish military leaders, who were believed to support it, remained publicly silent. They did not want to help Mr. Erdogan, whose Islamist roots give them pause.
Many religious lawmakers loathed the idea of a war against another Muslim country. Many lawmakers of all stripes heeded polls that showed that more than 90 percent of Turks were against participating in a war against Iraq.
Another factor was editorial cartoons and commentary in American and British publications that lampooned Turkey as a hustler trading its strategic proximity for foreign money.
On top of it all, some lawmakers were apparently convinced that they could prevent the war: that the United States would not move forward without Turkey's help.
In fact, parliament's rejection could prolong the war while diminishing Turkey's influence over what happens in northern Iraq.
For now, Turkey seems to be frozen in a confusing place, uncertain of its next steps. With the European Union and the United States estranged by the war, any effort to concentrate on relations with one could diminish ties with the other.
Europe is a more important trading partner for Turkey than is the United States. But its bond with Washington, the strongest advocate for the International Monetary Fund loans that keep Turkey afloat, has long been the bedrock of foreign policy.
Turkish government officials said that Turkey should try to reach in both directions, while also, somehow, remaining apart.
That three-step is especially tricky now, because Mr. Erdogan must attend first to a debt-ridden economy in its worst recession in decades. He was elected to improve it, and could be vulnerable if he does not.
"This one is really, really difficult," said Can Baydarol, a Turkish professor of international relations, referring to Turkey's current predicament. "It's hard to see what, for us, will happen after the war."

Pentagon and State Department In Tug-of-War Over Aid Disbursal

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: UMM QASR, Iraq, March 31 

 BODY:
People in southern Iraq waited today for the assistance promised by the Bush administration while debate simmered over the Pentagon's plans to oversee the distribution of the aid, a task that has traditionally been controlled by civilians.
 Aid organizations, poised to help in the delivery of emergency supplies, said they would be reluctant to take part if their work was associated with the American military. 
 Moreover, State Department and aid agency officials said that distribution of aid under the direction of the military would amplify the perception that the American presence was an occupation.
In an unusual letter to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld last week, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell asserted that he wanted to retain control of the assistance programs for Iraq.
One of the motivations behind the letter, according to State Department officials, was the knowledge that foreign governments and international aid agencies would be reluctant to help in Iraq if the American military was involved. 
Mr. Powell was also eager to maintain the present situation in which emergency teams of the United States Agency for International Development report to Andrew Natsios, the head of the agency, who in turn reports to Mr. Powell. These teams, known as disaster assistance response teams, direct the efforts in the field of nongovernmental aid agencies. 
Almost 50 members of these disaster assistance response teams are waiting in Kuwait City to go to Iraq to direct the delivery of emergency water, food and other supplies. They include doctors, nutritional experts and water treatment engineers. 
But a month ago, Lt. Gen. Jay Garner, a retired Army officer who is the head of the Bush administration's new reconstruction and humanitarian assistance office for Iraq, claimed responsibility for the aid programs, A.I.D. officials said. General Garner, who is also in Kuwait City, reports to the war commander, Gen. Tommy R. Franks. 
"Our implementing partners do not want to work with the military," an A.I.D. official said. He was referring to major nongovernmental agencies, including Oxfam-America and Catholic Relief Services. "We've said A.I.D. would be interested in coordination, not subordination," to the military, he added. 
A military-led relief effort would "jeopardize all burden-sharing by U.N. agencies and other governments," said George Rupp, president of the International Rescue Committee. "It would also compromise the independence and safety of humanitarian workers around the world."
Other aid agencies said that the military, already pressed to supply food to its own troops on the battlefield, would be unable to distribute food effectively to Iraqi civilians. They pointed to the chaotic distribution in the southern town of Safwan where Iraqi men shoved needy women out of the way to grab food boxes as coalition forces looked on. 
"Some American units are running low on food because they can't get supplies to them," said Kenneth H. Bacon, president of Refugees International. "So how can they distribute food to the whole country?" 
Mr. Bacon and the leaders of 13 other major American aid agencies sent a letter to President Bush last week urging him to place the humanitarian effort in Iraq under the auspices of the United Nations.
In doing so, they said, Mr. Bush would be living up to hisown pledge made in the Azores last month that the United Nations would play a key role in the aid programs in Iraq. Further, they said, the World Food Program and Unicef, the United Nations program for children, had worked in Iraq for years and the United States should capitalize on their long experience.
Two Unicef convoys tried to get into Iraq today. The one from the north, with medicine and water purification equipment, was stopped by Turkish border guards. In the south, 5 out of perhaps 10 water tanker trucks were allowed past the border; 3 made it to Umm Qasr. One of the other two turned around when the driver became anxious; a second ended up in a ditch.
The Umm Qasr docks, the main entry point for assistance to Iraq, remained idle today, more than a week after coalition forces declared the facility secure. Several dozen Iraqi dock workers have been employed in recent days after interviews by a team of British soldiers. But so far the workers have been relegated to simple loading tasks at warehouses. The British said they had not yet found any Iraqis to take management positions at the docks. 
One of the reasons for the lack of activity at the docks, according to American officials, was the refusal of the Office of the United Nations Security Coordinator in New York to make a security assessment of the port. Ships loaded with grain from the United Nations World Food Program cannot be unloaded until the port is declared secure.
Teams of United Nations security experts have been waiting for days at the Kuwait border to cross into Iraq to make the assessment but are yet to receive a go-ahead. American officials said they believed that the United Nations was stalling on the safety issue for political reasons. 
As a result of the lack of a security clearance a vessel carrying about 100,000 tons of Australian wheat -- a gift from the Australian government to the World Food Program -- remained stuck in the Persian Gulf waiting to dock. 
In an effort to spur the United Nations on and to demonstrate that the port was safe, two A.I.D. workers were sent to the port today to set up a small headquarters there. They had enough equipment and supplies to stay overnight at the port, where British army officers are working in the derelict offices of the Iraqi port directors who fled.
For the moment, people in Umm Qasr, and in the towns further north to Basra, appeared to have enough food. Everywhere, water was in short supply. In embattled Basra, the International Committee of the Red Cross said that their workers had begun to restore three generators on the water treatment plant in the town in an effort to get the city's water capacity above 50 percent. 
But American aid officials said that stocks of food, distributed before the war, will begin to run out in many Iraqi households by the end of April. 
By then, they said, they will have to be able to revive the distribution systems for the 450,000 tons of food that needs to be distributed every month to Iraqis under a revived version of the oil-for-food program. The aid workers stress that this is four times the amount of food distributed each month in Afghanistan.
The critical shortage of water was evident in Umm Qasr, even though a major new water pipeline from Kuwait into the town opened today for the first time. "The water comes in tankers but there are always fights over it," said Murtartha Taleb Kadem, one of the dock workers. 
It is much more difficult to get water now than before the war, he said. Then, water was available for two hours in the morning, and two hours in the evening. He would buy water for drinking. 
In the section of the town near the port this morning, the obsession with water was clear. Young boys pushed trolleys along the road with empty containers to fill up from a tanker. Men formed a scrum around the back of a truck packed with boxes of mineral water bottles. Young children carried as many bottles as they could, and several women carried bottles under their long black robes.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Doing Business With an Environmental Bent

BYLINE:  By CHRIS HEDGES 

 BODY:
THE word "environmentalist" does not roll easily out of Roger Ullman's mouth. He enunciates each syllable. It is a pleasant if unfamiliar way to define himself. When he says it, even for the second or third time, he sounds a little like a young contestant in a spelling bee.
 "I am still trying to get used to it," he acknowledges. 
 Mr. Ullman, 42, with a degree from the Harvard Business School and a career spent in international investment banking, including many years as a banker in the developing world, left his job as a managing director of investment banking at Merrill Lynch last year. 
He began work, at a much reduced salary, for the recently created New York chapter of Environmental Entrepreneurs, also known as E2, a small nationwide environmental group made up of about 400 business executives. The group, begun about three years ago in Silicon Valley by Bob Epstein, who co-founded the database company Sybase Inc. and two other start-ups, is part of a growing movement by executives who combine a love of finance and business with environmental concerns. And, with skills and connections that many environmentalists may lack, they are producing results.
"My credo is that economic progress and environmental progress are desirable, possible and not mutually exclusive," he said.
This environmental movement works on the other side of the barricades. Its members, like Mr. Ullman, enjoy the world offinance and deals along with the perks of power and privilege. But they also believe that the refusal of many in government to confront the nation's looming environmental crisis -- Mr. Ullman fires off a series of alarming statistics about rising water levels and air pollutants -- will soon wreak havoc with the lives of many Americans. 
They have helped push through tougher auto emission standards in California. The New York chapter of E2, with about 50 members, is supporting a similar bill in New York State, and has begun lobbying lawmakers in Albany to reduce carbon monoxide emissions. 
The group wants environmental groups to begin to think in business terms, including founding companies that promote environmental activism.
"We have high dues, which go to the Natural Resources Defense Council," Mr. Ullman said, speaking of the environmental organization based in New York that is collaborating with E2. "Members must donate at least $1,000 a year. We educate people at a very high level. The typical E2 member is steeped in the business world. He likes the business world. He has achieved success, and he believes in the environment."
But the group's biggest asset is not money, but influence. Members, who often have the clout to get legislators and political leaders on the phone, are asked to devote 10 minutes a month to sending letters or making calls in support of new legislation. The group also organizes lunches, teleconferences and "eco salons," or seminars to learn about environmental issues. They have guest speakers. Members of the New York chapter will have lunch today with Carol Browner, who was chief of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Clinton administration, at the private Century Club in Manhattan. They usually get about 40 people.
"E2 gives a voice to people like that," he said. "It is also an opportunity for networking, and what business person does not like a networking opportunity? We will make you an effective environmental advocate in 10 minutes a month or less."
The language of business is especially important, Mr. Ullman argues, during the Bush administration, which seems to put a premium on business methods and an M.B.A. style of governing. And the group believes that it has tapped into an appreciation of the importance of philanthropy among many entrepreneurs.
"There are millions in corporate America who want to leave something good for their children," he said.
Mr. Ullman, a reserved man who can seem almost shy, grew up in California, where, he says, he spent much of his childhood in the outdoors. He is the son of immigrants. His father, an engineer, is Czech. His mother is Swiss. He lives in Greenwich Village with his wife, Renata Schiavo, and their 4-year-old daughter. He also works for the Rain Forest Alliance, which also uses capital to support environmental causes. And at the slower pace of his current work, "I have gotten to know the playgrounds in Lower Manhattan very well."
HE is careful not to go after large companies other environmentalists excoriate, and he picks his words carefully when describing the role of huge corporations in environmental disasters, especially in the developing world. He used the word "mistake," for example, to describe the gas leak at a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, in 1984, that caused thousands of deaths. It is not a topic he wants to go into.
"We focus on the environment in this country," he said.
Mr. Ullman, like many in the group, including its founder, has the financial freedom to pursue activism. "I work within the system, where I can have the most impact," he said. "I work with companies and individuals that run companies. And I get to be with like-minded people."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 9, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A Public Lives profile on April 1 about Roger Ullman, the head of the New York City chapter of Environmental Entrepreneurs, misstated one of the group's aims. It is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, not carbon monoxide.

HEADLINE: US Airways Makes Cuts And Leaves Bankruptcy 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
US Airways emerged from bankruptcy protection yesterday with a federally backed $1 billion loan and a new $240 million equity investment.
 The airline said that it had completed all requirements to begin its first full day of operation outside of Chapter 11 today. 
 As a result of the exit, it secured a $1 billion loan that was 90 percent backed by the federal government. US Airways received the $900 million federal loan guarantee last year from the Air Transportation Stabilization Board, which was set up by Congress after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks to provide relief to the airline industry. When the carrier filed for Chapter 11 protection last August, federal officials said the company would still get the guarantee as long as it successfully emerged from bankruptcy. 
US Airways also received a $240 million equity investment yesterday from the Retirement Systems of Alabama, the state pension fund. The fund is the airline's main lender and will own a 36.6 percent stake in the airline, as well as get eight seats and 70 percent voting control on the 15-member board. David G. Bronner, chief executive of the pension fund, will sit on the board.
"Securing the $1.24 billion of added capital funds was critical to boosting our liquidity, executing our business plan and weathering the very difficult operating environment that airlines face due to the Iraqi war and general economic weakness," David N. Siegel, the chief executive, said yesterday.
Using bankruptcy laws as leverage, the airline has squeezed out $1.9 billion in annual cost savings since last August. Labor agreements reached in bankruptcy court make up $1 billion of that and are good until Dec. 31, 2008. The company said it also cut $500 million annually from aircraft debt and leases, and got $400 million in supplier renegotiations, management concessions and operating efficiencies.
Nonmanagement employees, in exchange for their concessions, will get a 31.2 percent stake and four board seats. The Air Transportation Stabilization Board will get a 10 percent stake.
US Airways said it intended to renegotiate leases at Pittsburgh International Airport to accommodate an increased use of regional jets. 
The company said it was negotiating with two regional jet makers, Embraer of Brazil and Bombardier of Canada, to place "a significant order in the near future." It said MidAtlantic Airways, its new regional service division, would start operations this fall.
Even with all the cost-cutting, there are no indications that US Airways will become healthy anytime soon. It does not expect to turn a profit this year or next, and it is still operating in the same bleak environment that has pummeled American Airlines almost to the point of bankruptcy.
"Certainly, you have to give them credit," said Jim Corridore, an industry analyst at Standard & Poor's. "They were very efficient in bankruptcy, the way they cut costs. But they'll have an immediate test when they come out."

HEADLINE: War Protests In India Aim At Bottlers 

BYLINE:  By SARITHA RAI 

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, March 31 

 BODY:
To protest the American-led invasion of Iraq, radical groups in India have taken to staging armed raids on some of the most visible symbols of America in this soft-drink-loving country: Coke and Pepsi warehouses.
 In the latest raid, 10 members of the People's War Group, an outlawed militant Maoist faction that has clashed with local authorities in southern India for two decades, stormed a Pepsi-Cola warehouse in the Guntur district of Andhar Pradesh late Sunday night. 
 The rebels ordered employees to leave and then smashed cases of soft drinks and tried without success to set the building on fire, police said. Early this morning, they fired shots into the air to scare away onlookers and then left the warehouse shouting antiwar slogans. 
The management of the warehouse, which belongs to a local franchise bottler and not to PepsiCo, the American owner of the Pepsi-Cola brand, said in a statement that no one had been injured in the incident.
On Sunday, before the raid, the group called for a boycott of American and British goods to protest the war, which it called an imperialist oil grab and "naked aggression against a poor country."
The same sentiment, if perhaps not the same group, seemed to be behind a series of attacks on American soft drink operations. Several distribution centers were attacked last week, including an apparent bombing at a Coca-Cola operation in Andhra Pradesh that destroyed hundreds of cases of drinks.
Coke and Pepsi are the most visible American brands in India; between them they dominate the country's $1.1 billion soft drink market. 
Fearing more such incidents, industry executives in India are trying to emphasize the Indianness of their operations. "We are communicating that we are primarily Indian, employing Indians," said Sunil Gupta, vice president of Hindustan Coca-Cola Holdings, Coca-Cola's Indian subsidiary. "Any attack on our operations will affect the local economy." Last year, Coca-Cola sold 49 percent of the unit to local investors, bottlers, suppliers and an employee welfare fund.
Antiwar protests have been increasing in many parts of India, and so have calls forboycotts of American and British businesses and products. At a rally in Calcutta on Sunday, protesters burned effigies of President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain. 
Some protesters have called for blanket boycotts of American banks, insurers and food and consumer products as a way to bring pressure on the United States to end the war. Darul Uloom, a well-known Islamic religious school, issued a fatwa, or religious decree, last week that called upon Muslims in India not to buy American goods; it issued a similar call when American military action in Afghanistan began in 2001. 
But others have specifically chosen Coke and Pepsi as targets, most recently a group called the Bharatiya Rationalists Association in Kochi, in the southern state of Kerala.
No sales reports are available yet to indicate whether consumers were heeding the calls.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Stocks Close Out Weak Quarter With Day Weighed Down by War

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The first quarter ended on a sour note for stocks yesterday as concern about the progress of the war in Iraq and worries that a longer conflict would slow economic growth dragged the three main gauges down more than 1.7 percent. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell for the third quarter out of the last four. But those declines were 4.2 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively, well below the double-digit plunges in the second and third quarters of last year. 
 The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index managed to eke out a small quarterly gain of 0.4 percent. That gave the Nasdaq its first back-to-back positive quarters since the first quarter of 2000, when the Nasdaq reached its all-time high. 
But that is not much good news for investors, who watched stocks come within striking distance of October's five-year lows before the market rallied for eight days on hopes that the war could be short. Since those expectations changed a week ago Monday, the Dow has given back 53 percent of its 998-point rally.
The economic news ahead, according to some analysts, is likely to be as hard on investors as some of the reports from the war. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago reported yesterday that manufacturing in the region contracted, with its index falling to 48.4 in March from 54.9 in February. In separate reports, retailers from Wal-Mart Stores to J. C. Penney said that March sales were at the low end of expectations or below them.
David Rosenberg, chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch, said that it appeared to him that the economy contracted in February and March. He also said that Merrill's already lukewarm growth forecast for the first and second quarters of 1 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively, "may not be tepid enough."
Questions about the chances of another recession "may have to be rephrased as to whether we are already in one," he said.
At the close yesterday, the Dow, which was down 216 points, or 2.7 percent, early in the day, finished down 153.64 points, or 1.9 percent, to 7,992.13. The S.& P. 500 fell 15.32 points, or 1.8 percent, to 848.18, after falling almost 20 points, or 2.3 percent, earlier. The Nasdaq was down 28.43 points, or 2.1 percent, to 1,341.17. It was down 33 points, or 2.4 percent, in early trading.
A plunge of more than 6 percent in the shares of Altria, the parent of Philip Morris, also weighed on stocks. Moody's Investors Service downgraded Altria's credit rating yesterday, and Standard & Poor's said on Friday that Philip Morris could face bankruptcy because of a recent judgment in an Illinois state court.
Stock markets were down even more in Europe, falling 2.5 percent to 4 percent. And in other signs of investor concerns around the world, the price of crude oil shot higher and the dollar dropped sharply against the euro and the yen.
Crude oil for May delivery rose 88 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $31.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but is still below its recent high of $37.83. The dollar dropped 1.1 percent against the euro, to $1.0896, and 1.3 percent against the yen, to 118.14.
The fall in stocks and war worries also sent some investors back to the haven of the Treasury market. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 26/32, to 100 20/32 in late afternoon trading as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.80 percent, from 3.92 percent on Friday.
"The stock market is so unbelievably focused on the war," said Bob Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Deutsche Asset Management, that economic news is not making much difference. "Even if the price of oil was dropping and the economic news was positive, we would have had a down day today."
"But on some days," he added, "investors will glance away from the war for a moment and see bad fundamental news. And that will make the market fall more."
Although the first quarter included the run-up to and the beginning of the war, the stock market was not as volatile as in some recent quarters, when there was no major war threat. For the Nasdaq, 55.7 percent of its daily up or down moves last quarter were 1 percent or more, the lowest percentage since the fourth quarter of 1999. The peak was 85.7 percent inthe second quarter of 2000.
The figure for 1 percent moves in the S.& P. 500-stock index was 49.2 percent, the lowest since the second quarter of last year.
The 14.9 percent fall of the Dow from its quarter high to its quarter low was also the smallest since the second three months of 2002.
Telecommunications services, led by declines of AT&T and Qwest Communications, was the worst performing sector in the S.& P. 500-stock index during the quarter, falling 15.1 percent. Except for a 36.4 percent surge in the fourth quarter of 2002, this sector has been down every quarter since the first of 2000.
No other sector, including information technology, has had such a string of declines. In fact, this sector fell only 0.55 percent last quarter, helped by big gains in Corning and Yahoo. Health care put in the only positive performance, ekeing out a 0.85 percent gain.
In trading yesterday, shares of Altria dropped $2.17, or 6.8 percent, to $29.96, after the announcements by the two credit-rating agencies.
On March 21, an Illinois state judge awarded damages of $10.1 billion against Philip Morris for failing to inform consumers that its "light" cigarettes were not less harmful than full-tar cigarettes. To appeal the case, Philip Morris has to put up a bond of $12 billion. While Philip Morris is working to have the bond reduced or waived, Standard & Poor's suggested Friday that raising the $12 billion could force the company into bankruptcy. S.& P. said that because of this possibility, Altria's credit rating could be lowered below investment grade.
Moody's lowered Altria's credit rating two notches today, to Baa1 from A2, leaving it three notches above junk status. But Moody's said there could be further downgradings.
Among the other big losers was AOL Time Warner, which fell 49 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $10.86. AOL disclosed Friday that securities regulators investigating the company's accounting suspect that it improperly overstated its revenue by up to $400 million over two years.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Nations Fail to Agree on Farm Subsidies 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31 

 BODY:
Negotiators failed today to meet their deadline for figuring out how wealthy nations can reduce their huge agriculture subsidies, the issue at the heart of a current round of negotiations at the World Trade Organization.
 The poorer nations were promised that this round of trade talks, named after Doha in Qatar, where they began in November 2001, would especially benefit them and require the first major reductions in what amounts to $300 billion a year in subsidies paid by the world's richest nations to their farmers. 
 The developing nations have said that if these subsidies are not scaled back, then the entire round of talks would be in doubt. That would jeopardize the opening of markets favored by the wealthy nations, especially in services like banking, telecommunications and information technology. 
Supachai Panitchpakdi, the director general of the W.T.O., issued a statement today saying it was a "great disappointment" that the negotiators had missed today's deadline on agriculture, but he said he thought trade officials were committed to finding a compromise. 
There is little disagreement that these subsidies are among the biggest trade barriers for poor nations. They are blamed for depressing world grain and fiber prices, for leading to the dumping of excess grain in wealthy nations and for undercutting farmers in developing nations. Because agriculture is often the one route out of poverty for some nations, the subsidies are seen as a chief reason for the growing disparity between the haves and the have-nots.
In dispute is how the two biggest providers of subsidies -- Europe and the United States -- will cut back the payments. If they can agree, then Japan, Korea and Switzerland are expected to follow.
Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, said today that he was disappointed in the deadlock but played down suggestions that this was another example of the widening gap between Washington and Europe during this time of war.
While noting there was "a lot of sensitivity" about trans-Atlantic relations, Mr. Zoellick said he was working very hard with his counterpart, Pascal Lamy, the European Union's trade commissioner. Mr. Zoellick praised the European Commission proposals to overhaul the community's agriculture.
"All of us face political difficulties in these negotiations," said Mr. Zoellick, referring to the missed deadline at the W.T.O. "We need to help one another work through them, seeking constructive solutions."
The European reaction was less muted. The countries of the European Union -- especially France -- have been criticized for being more attached to farm subsidies than the United States. 
Franz Fischler, the agriculture commissioner for the European Union, said today that he, too, was disappointed and suggested that the proposal rejected at the W.T.O. required European farmers to make greater sacrifices than American farmers.
"If we are to make these substantial reductions to our tariffs and trade-distorting support, we need, and want, our partners to go down this same road," Mr. Fischler said.
The European Union subsidizes its farmers in a different fashion, placing a stronger emphasis on environmental concerns and relying heavily on export subsidies for their producers.
The United States has almost no export subsidies and has proposed cutting subsidies to 5 percent of the value of farm production. Yet the 2002 farm bill signed by the administration drastically raised permanent subsidies. Moreover, trade negotiators are asking for an end to much of the nonemergency food aid given by the United States, which they say is a disguised form of dumping.
The final deadline for serious negotiations on agriculture and the other outstanding issues of this round is this September, when the trade ministers meet in Cancun, Mexico. 
By missing today's deadline, negotiators are compiling a growing backlog of critical issues.
The W.T.O. failed to meet its December deadline to agree on a trade deal that would help developing nations fight AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other diseases. But the United States, with the strong approval of the American pharmaceutical industry, exercised the veto that every nation possesses and stopped the deal. Negotiators say they fear that a compromise will have to wait until September.
Even though nations have yet to agree on a formula for reducing farm subsidies and opening markets for agriculture products, the campaign against subsidies has been hitting its mark, propelled by human rights groups, the United Nations and even the World Bank.
President Jacques Chirac of France promised African leaders this month that he would suspend shipments of subsidized grains to their continent.
But this was seen as a gesture, not a solution, for countries that have been told to climb out of poverty through trade, not foreign aid. They have then found that the free trade of food, the one commodity they all produce, is hampered by subsidies, tariffs and export subsidies for farm products.
Mr. Zoellick is credited with pushing the reform of the trade rules for agriculture at Doha. Trade negotiators say, however, that they are worried that the agreement is too vague, promising "substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support" that can lead to many interpretations.
At a news conference today, Mr. Zoellick said these hurdles were not insurmountable, especially because he considered the chance to reduce subsidies a "once in a generation opportunity." 
"Trade cannot promote the development of countries across Latin America, Africa and Asia without much freer movement of farm products," he said.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: POLITICAL DEBATE; 
Bush Defends Progress of War And Is Cheered

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY and DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31 

 BODY:
President Bush mounted a vigorous defense today of the progress made in the war against Iraq, seeking to rebut concerns in the military and nervousness within his own party about how the conflict is going and how it was planned.
 "In 11 days, coalition forces have taken control of most of western and southern Iraq," Mr. Bush said to cheers from Coast Guard employees at the port of Philadelphia. "Day by day, we are moving closer to Baghdad. Day by day, we are moving closer to victory." 
 Mr. Bush's speech came after a flurry of questions among political and military leaders about whether he had committed enough military forces to the campaign, whether the Pentagon had correctly anticipated the resolve of fighters in southern Iraq and on the outskirts of Baghdad and the degree to which the administration had miscalculated the support Saddam Hussein enjoys. 
While no Republicans would put their name to their comments, fearing retribution from the White House, interviews revealed nervousness within the party.
Some Republicans in Washington were clearly jittery about the course and conduct of a war whose outcome they argued was pivotal to Mr. Bush's re-election next year. And their concern reflected a resurgence of the friction between conservatives who pressed for a military campaign to remove Mr. Hussein and moderates who advocated a more nuanced diplomatic effort and are more closely allied with Colin L. Powell, the secretary of state.
Many Republicans said they were confident that the United States would win the war, albeit after a longer battle than they had expected, and that President Bush would be in a powerful position as he heads into a re-election campaign.
But some Republican officials recalled how quickly Mr. Bush's father's standing fell after the last gulf war. They said there was a cautionary lesson for this President Bush, and that a long, violent, unresolved conflict -- like one in which Mr. Hussein was not found or killed -- could pose a serious problem to Mr. Bush next year.
"I don't understand what is floating his ship except patriotism and terrorism concerns," said one conservative Republican political strategist. "If the tide turns, there's nothing else that keeps his boat afloat. There's a sort of feeling out there of, 'Where is this thing going?' We were all happy to follow President Bush into this, but we're now starting to look up at the hillside and wondering who's up there."
Much of the criticism was aimed at Mr. Bush and two of his top war advisers, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and his deputy, Paul D. Wolfowitz.
"It's obvious that all the Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz battle plans are not panning out," said a veteran Republican strategist based in Washington. "Rumsfeld can only reform things so long before it gets pointed out that they underestimated what was necessary. Where are the flowers being thrown at our forces? Where are the peace signs?"
The concerns came in both political and military quarters. A retired general who served under President Bush's father in the first Persian Gulf war said he believed that the United States would still prevail, despite what he described as the failure of the Pentagon to deploy an adequate contingent of ground forces in the opening days of the war. But he predicted that these difficult first two weeks would harm the nation's standing as a military force.
"What's troublesome is the loss of deterrent value," the retired general said. "A month ago everybody in the world looked at the U.S. military as being 10 feet tall. We're not 10 feet tall."
George A. Joulwan, a former NATO commander, said Mr. Hussein had surprised coalition forces with his own combat plan. "Clearly we have not been greeted as liberators with flags waving, and we've got to go to Plan B," he said. "I wouldn't wring my hands over it. In war, you adjust to the unexpected. We've got forces arriving. It's just going to take longer than we thought."
For all the uncertainty, most leading Republicans seemed to stand by the president. The criticisms were less evidence of any mass defection, but rather of discomfort that several of Mr. Bush's supporters argued was exaggerated by the intense and sometimes critical coverage of the war on television.
On Capitol Hill, Republicans said they remained united behind the administration. "There is pretty much unity within the caucus," said one senior Republican aide. "I don't sense that the same type of Republican division that might be playing out with the old Bush guard is spreading to the hill."
Similarly, party leaders across the country expressed confidence in the ultimate outcome.
"There's a sense of uncertainty, but there's also a great amount of confidence," said Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut. "Like anything else in life, the real challenge for the military leadership is to manage expectations. I think to the viewing public they are doing fine. But to some of the harsher critics, and some of the people who want to formulate a judgment after 15 days, well . . ."
Mr. Bush never mentioned his critics in his comments in Philadelphia today, where he talked on a pier at a busy port, as a chill wind whipped through the crowd. Wearing a Coast Guard windbreaker, he ticked off the accomplishments of the war so far, saying, "In 11 days, we have seized key bridges, opened a northern front, nearly achieved complete air superiority, and have delivered tons of humanitarian aid. By quick and decisive action, our troops are keeping Saddam Hussein from destroying the Iraqi people's oil."
Mr. Bush also said nothing of tactical pauses, or the debate over whether to wait for additional forces before beginning the final assault on Baghdad. He said little about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
And despite evidence that most Iraqis have not welcomed American forces, Mr. Bush cast himself as the country's liberator, telling Iraqis, "We are coming with a mighty force to end the reign of your oppressors."
Mr. Bush's return today to the theme of liberation was telling because White House officials have concluded that it is the argument most likely to quell questions over military tactics. He described, in some detail, how Iraqi "death squads" had killed civilians who do not fight the coalition forces, saying the bodies of dead Iraqis show many were shot from behind.
His aides sought to answer the critics of the war plan by comparing the speed of the advance to the time it took -- nearly a year -- to bring about the collapse of Nazi Germany after the D-Day invasion. "The lesson isn't the scope of the operation," one senior administration official said. "The lesson is that wars require patience."
Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, used a similar D-Day analogy in briefing reporters last week. The analogy may not be apt. One retired Air Force general, a veteran of the first gulf war, said over the weekend, "Someone ought to tell these guys that we're taking out a failing, rogue regime, not the conqueror of all of Europe."
Mr. Bush made no mention of the debate within his administration and among military commanders over whether to consolidate the coalition's gains in the south and west before taking on far more complex military tasks. The debate, administration officials said today, has to do with when Mr. Bush will be able to claim that enough of the country is in the control of United States and British forces that an "Iraqi Interim Authority" can be declared, as an alternative government to that of Mr. Hussein.
So Mr. Bush focused instead today on progress that he described as "brilliant."
"Our forces moved into Iraqi missile launch areas that threatened neighboring countries," he said, a comparison to the first gulf war, when missiles were fired at Israel. "We are coming and we will not stop," he said emphatically. "We will not relent, until your country is free."
Throughout the day, even if there was disagreement about the planning for the military campaign, there was a consensus that Mr. Bush has a lot riding on the outcome. That is particularly true given the continuing problems of the economy.
"I think the war is going to be a success and then immediately the country will pivot to focusing on the economy," said Scott Reed, a Republican strategist.
But even beyond that, there remain questions peculiar to this unusual war, ranging from whether Mr. Hussein needs to be be captured or killed in order for Mr. Bush to declare victory, to how Americans will react if allied forces fail to find evidence of the weapons of mass destruction Mr. Bush cited in rallying the nation to war.
"This is the big enchilada -- not much doubt about that," said Bob Dole, the former Senate majority leader who ran for president in 1996. "If it goes well, he's in great shape. If it doesn't go well, he's got problems. He knew that going into this."

Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's deadline for winning $600 million in savings from city unions is expected to pass today without an agreement, union and city officials said yesterday, leaving another giant question mark hovering over the city's finances.
 With no firm answer from the city's unions, and roughly $1.7 billion in help requested from the state that may not materialize, the city could have a great deal of trouble balancing its budget in the fiscal year that begins three months from now, on July 1. 
 The Bloomberg administration asked city agencies to come up with $600 million in contingency cuts in case the proposed union savings fell through. But with the economy still slow and tax revenues below expectations, Mayor Bloomberg has said that many of those alternative cuts -- including layoffs -- may need to be enacted in any case. 
The contingency cuts being considered include laying off teachers' aides, which would be the first education cuts to affect classroom instruction directly, and closing as many as 37 firehouses at night. The city, which must balance its budget by law, is facing a shortfall of $3 billion to $4 billion next year.
The administration set today as a deadline for the unions so city officials would have time to examine any proposals before incorporating them into the mayor's next budget proposal, which is to be released on April 15. Several union officials said that they planned to continue talking to the administration.
"I think by April 15, we'll either be there, or be close, or there will be a wrestling match," said Lillian Roberts, the executive director of District Council 37, the city's largest municipal union.
But the union is already planning a counterattack, in case no agreement is reached and Mr. Bloomberg releases a budget calling for thousands of layoffs. The union has scheduled a Fight Back Rally outside City Hall on April 29 to protest layoffs.
The Bloomberg administration has suggested options ranging from having city workers contribute to their health insurance to reducing pension benefits for future workers. The unions have countered by calling for early-retirement incentives and ending city contracts with nonunion consultants. Compromise has been elusive.
In a pre-emptive strike, District Council 37 released the results of a poll it commissioned that found a majority of respondents -- drawn from voters in New York City -- favored using city workers instead of outside consultants and would support a tax surcharge on the wealthy.
Although the city has cut, or begun to cut, more than $1 billion in spending since November, next year's budget is still expected to grow by $1.6 billion, because fixed costs like Medicaid, pensions, and debt service continue to grow, according to a report issued yesterday by the city's Independent Budget Office.
The cost of the city's highly unusual decision to borrow money to pay its operating expenses will already be felt next year, the report found. The $2 billion that the city borrowed since Sept. 11 will drive up the cost of debt payments by $95 million next year and $165 million a year after that for the next three decades, the report found.
The mayor may be in tense negotiations with the unions, but he did have a pleasant outing yesterday with five city workers. He invited them to join him in a box at Shea Stadium for the Mets' home opener.
Among those who took in the first few innings with Mr. Bloomberg were Melanie Besculides, a Department of Health worker who monitors suspicious disease patterns, and John Nucatola, a sanitation worker who got kudos for keeping even tiny streets in Queens clear of snow during the recent blizzard.
But the mayor's forecast of a subway series in the fall may be overly optimistic, several budget monitors and sports aficionados warned. The Mets lost, 15-2.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: THE HOUSE MINORITY LEADER; 
With Democrats Divided on War, Pelosi Faces Leadership Test

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 31 

 BODY:
On the morning after the American bombs began dropping on Baghdad, Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, met her lieutenants for a strategy session in the Capitol. Ordinarily composed, she confessed to feeling off kilter.
 "I am devastated," Ms. Pelosi recalls saying, "by the fact that we are going to war." 
 The issue at hand was a ticklish one: how to support the troops without heaping praise on President Bush. Moderates wanted a quick resolution backing the military and the president, but some liberals balked. Ms. Pelosi, who represents San Francisco -- a city described by a local newspaper as "the most vocally antiwar district in the nation" -- was caught in the middle. 
For the 63-year-old Ms.Pelosi, who took over leadership of the House Democrats in January, the politics of the war are especially delicate. In her quest to regain Democratic control of the House, she has the difficult task of bringing together a fractured party when Republicans run Congress and the White House. With Democrats sharply divided over foreign policy, the conflict in Iraq is providing the first real test of her leadership.
"Her challenge," said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the assistant Democratic leader, who is at odds with Ms. Pelosi over the war, "is to project her values and represent her constituents while at the same time leading a diverse caucus, particularly with respect to the war."
That challenge was especially evident in the debate over the resolution supporting the troops. While the Senate voted unanimously in favor of such a measure, Ms. Pelosi could not achieve that kind of consensus in the House. Eleven Democrats voted against and 21 voted present -- to protest language praising Mr. Bush as commander in chief and tying the war in Iraq to the war on terrorism.
The vote came in the wee hours of the morning -- long after most reporters' deadlines had passed -- and only then after Ms. Pelosi spent hours engaging in a kind of shuttle diplomacy between House Republicans, whom she urged unsuccessfully to soften their language, and liberal Democrats, who feared that a vote in favor implied tacit approval of the war. Ms. Pelosi tried to persuade them otherwise, even as she told them they were free to go their own way.
"In the end," said Representative Jan Schakowsky, an Illinois Democrat who voted present, "everyone was really satisfied with the process."
Well, not everyone. Representative Martin Frost of Texas, who briefly challenged Ms. Pelosi for the leader's job last year, sent her a letter while the negotiating was still under way, urging that a resolution be passed promptly. 
"I respect the fact that some people were opposed to this; we all understand that," Mr. Frost said in an interview. "But once the battle starts, then you have to put those issues aside."
As the the first woman to lead a party in Congress, Ms. Pelosi, elegant and energetic, has the kind of star quality that many say makes them again excited to be Democrats. Young women come to the Capitol to have their picture taken in front of her office. Donations to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee have increased by 30 percent, officials there say, since her signature began appearing on the direct mail.
On domestic matters, Ms. Pelosi gets generally high marks from colleagues. She beat the White House to the punch by unveiling a Democratic economic stimulus plan a day before the president. The Democratic alternative to the Republican budget failed by three votes; last year, there was no Democratic alternative.
But some moderates complain that Ms. Pelosi has surrounded herself with a "California kitchen cabinet" that will push the party to the left, a complaint that has become heightened now that she has emerged as a leading Democratic opponent of the war.
"It's not helpful," Representative Charles W. Stenholm of Texas, a leader of the Blue Dog coalition, a moderate group, said, referring to Ms. Pelosi's stance on Iraq.
Asked to rate her overall performance, Mr. Stenholm replied with curt diplomacy: "I would say so far Nancy has done a good job of establishing the type of leadership she intends to bring to the caucus."
That type is vastly different from that of her predecessor, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, a centrist who supports the president's action in Iraq.
"Gephardt was often trying to keep a low profile in the hope that he wouldn't offend anybody, because so many of the districts we needed to win were moderate," said Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California. "She's come out swinging with very clear positions for the Democrats."
But staying focused on domestic policy will be increasingly difficult as the war dominates the news.
"When you are trying to put forth a Democratic message, the war muffles that," said Representative George Miller, a California Democrat and a member of Ms. Pelosi's inner circle.
So Ms. Pelosi has been keeping up a steady stream of news conferences and public appearances, often with Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader. Last week, the two gathered reporters to announce that the Bush economic plan would hurt members of minorities. The week before, they talked about medical malpractice. 
Mr. Miller describes Ms. Pelosi as "one of the most complete political people I have ever seen." A mother of five who did not run for elective office until her children were mostly grown, she learned the trade from a master: her father, Thomas J. D'Alesandro Jr., a former congressman and mayor of Baltimore. Some say she inherited his tendency to reward friends and punish enemies, a criticism Ms. Pelosi brushes aside.
"I think what they say is I appoint my friends," Ms. Pelosi said. "I don't consider that a criticism. I want that to be a well-known fact about me."
Ms. Pelosi, who seems to subsist mostly on a diet of chocolate, moves so fast that her staff says they can tell she is coming by the click-click-click of her heels on the Capitol's marble floors. In her office, she keeps a black-and-white photograph of herself as a young girl in a flowing dress, christening a fireboat -- the mayor's daughter making the newspapers at 7 years old.
Today, more than half a century later, Ms. Pelosi likes to point out that she occupies the office once held by Thomas P. O'Neill, the former speaker of the House, whose granddaughter works for her. She makes no bones about coveting the speaker's job.
"I don't like that we're not in the majority," she says simply.
But the fight to win back the majority, party strategists say, will inevitably be waged in swing and moderate districts where Ms. Pelosi's views on the war do not hold sway. Already, she has begun to moderate her tone, perhaps mindful of the scolding Mr. Daschle received when he criticized Mr. Bush's diplomacy after the war began.
"I do not have any intention of second-guessing the commander in chief," Ms. Pelosi told reporters last week at a news conference.
Still, it is difficult for her to conceal her feelings, no matter how much that moderates wish she would. On the night the war began, House Democrats gathered for a long-planned dinner that Ms. Pelosi had been looking forward to. But when Condoleezza Rice, President Bush's national security adviser, called to advise her that the war would soon be under way, Ms. Pelosi said, "the reality that it was happening just took the wind out of my sails." 
As to the resolution in support of the troops, Ms. Pelosi regards it as "a bitter pill." Ever the pragmatist, she delivered a speech in opposition to its wording, then voted in favor.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 2, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the challenge facing Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, whose Democratic colleagues are divided over the Iraq war, misstated the leadership position of Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, who supports the war. He is the Democratic whip, not the assistant leader.

HEADLINE: Japan Survey Finds Rise In Pessimism 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, April 1 

 BODY:
Japanese business leaders have turned pessimistic again about their economic prospects, as slumping stock prices and jitters about the war in Iraq damp confidence, according to the Bank of Japan's widely followed Tankan quarterly survey.
 The downturn in sentiment was the first in five quarters, and it suggests that Japan, the world's second-largest economy, remains fragile and vulnerable -- especially the country's big manufacturers, which earn most of their profits overseas. Further erosions of confidence will probably add to the pressure on the government and the central bank to find more ways to prop up the economy. 
 The main index of the Tankan report, which gauges the views of major manufacturers, fell one point, to a reading of minus 10, meaning that pessimists outnumbered optimists in the survey by 10 percentage points, one point more than in the prior quarter. Analysts had expected a small gain this time.
The survey was conducted in March, when the war began in Iraq, nuclear tensions mounted with North Korea and the main Japanese stock market index, the Nikkei 225, fell to new 20-year lows.
The surveyed executives said they expected only slight improvement in three months and that capital spending at their companies would fall by 0.8 percent in the new fiscal year, which began today. Taken together, the results indicate that managers are bracing for a slowdown over the next six months.
"The war in Iraq is having a significant impact," said Keiji Tachikawa, president of NTT DoCoMo, the country's dominant cellular phone company. "Since the Japanese economy tracks the U.S. economy, the outlook for the April-September half-year is dim." 
Betting that rough times are ahead, investors bid up government bond prices today, sending yields skidding to record lows. At one point in the day the benchmark 10-year bond had a yield of just 0.685 percent. The Nikkei 225 stock index spent most of the day in negative territory before finishing with a 0.2 percent gain.
Consumer spending and strong exports helped Japan's economy keep growing, if slowly, throughout 2002, but signs are emerging that those two props are weakening. 
Wages are falling, companies are scaling back their hiring plans, and beginning this month, salaried workers are being required to pay more for health care.
Shipments to the United States and Europe of automobiles, steel and other finished products are slowing, an especially troubling development for manufacturers like Honda Motor and Matsushita Electric Industrial, which rely on American consumers. An early end to the war in Iraq may revive spending around the world, but for now, consumers seem to be sitting tight.
"It's impossible to separate the war from consumer confidence," said Howard Stringer, chairman of the Sony Corporation's American unit. "You can feel that everywhere. There's a sense that consumers are keeping their hands in their pockets."
Japan exports about 10 percent of its annual economic output, and exports have been one of the few reliable contributors to growth. Demand from overseas has kept many factories at home humming despite a rise in business bankruptcies. But the country's banks are under pressure to write off more bad loans and to cut off deadbeat borrowers, tactics that may lead to many more bankruptcies, more unemployment and more deflation.

HEADLINE: Trade Concerns as Canada Sits Out War 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, April 1 

 BODY:
During the 1991 Persian Gulf war, crews from Safety Boss put out 180 oil well fires in Kuwait and southern Iraq, more than any other firefighting company. But since the latest war began almost two weeks ago, the phone has yet to ring at Safety Boss's head office in Calgary, Alberta. 
 Mark Badick, the company's chief operating officer, thinks he knows why: Safety Boss is a Canadian company and, in contrast to 1991, the Canadian government has not joined the American-led coalition in combat this time. "It's pretty evident that, because of the stand that our government has taken, we aren't going to get anything unless the whole country goes up in flames," he said. 
 His concerns are shared by many other Canadian executives. Though opinion polls find that most residents support the Liberal government's decision to stay out of the war, business leaders say that little good can come from antagonizing the behemoth next door.
Perrin Beatty, the president and chief executive of Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, one of the country's biggest business groups, wrote to his members on Friday that political tensions with the United States could jeopardize contracts for Canadian companies. 
"With more than $1 million in trade taking place between our two countries every minute, and more than two million Canadian jobs on the line, we all have a strong interest in maintaining positive relations with our closest friend and trading partner," Mr. Beatty said.
With the help of a bilateral free trade deal struck in 1988 and the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1994, Canadian exporters now send 85 percent of their goods to the United States, up from 73 percent 15 years ago. The United States is also Canada's biggest source of foreign investment and tourists by far. 
The Canadian aerospace and tourism industries have each complained to the government in Ottawa about the potential commercial fallout of the decision not to back the United States in Iraq. Tony Pollard, the president of the Hotel Association of Canada, said that he knew of two American groups that had canceled conventions in Toronto because of Canada's stance on the war. 
There is also a broader risk, Mr. Beatty said, that poor relations between Ottawa and Washington will undermine Canada's ability to negotiate exemptions from United States customs and immigration procedures, or to resolve trade disputes, especially a protracted disagreement over Canadian exports of softwood lumber and the punitive duties imposed on them by Washington.
It has not helped, business people say, that several Liberal members of Parliament have publicly assailed or derided the United States and President Bush, sometimes with profanity. 
Mr. Beatty told his members, "We have made it clear that anti-American statements by government officials can have serious consequences for Canada and have urged that they stop." 
Though Canadian forces have not sent troops to join the attack on Iraq, the country is not on the sidelines completely. More than 50 Canadian naval and aerospace technicians and liaison officers are stationed at the allied headquarters in Qatar and at sea aboard American warships. A Canadian naval contingent -- a destroyer and two frigates -- is patrolling in the Persian Gulf, available to help in an emergency, according to Canadian military officials. Canada is also contributing militarily to operations in Afghanistan, with plans to send 2,000 Canadian troops later this year to relieve American forces that can be sent to the Persian Gulf.
Still, the United States ambassador in Ottawa, Paul Cellucci, told the Economic Club of Toronto last week that "there is a lot of disappointment in Washington" over the level of Canadian support for the war effort. "There might be some short-term strains," Mr. Cellucci said, adding that as far as the United States was concerned, "security will trump trade." 
According to an Ipsos-Reid poll published this week, 59 percent of Canadians are pleased that their country has stayed out of the fighting in Iraq, but 61 percent think that the decision will have "serious economic consequences" for Canada. Opposition to the war is especially strong in the predominantly French-speaking province of Quebec. 
Gordon M. Nixon, the chief executive of the Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest financial institution, said in an interview that it was "sad" that Canadians were being painted as anti-American. "The issue around policy is what is very challenging," Mr. Nixon said, but despite any disagreements, "the relationship between Canadians and Americans is unquestioned." 
Mr. Beatty's letter to the manufacturers' group members ended with a request that they pass on "any specific experiences you wish to report." But Carolyn Conner, a group spokeswoman, said that replies received so far were "mostly opinions, not a lot specific." 
Mr. Nixon said that the differences over Iraq had not had any impact so far on the Royal Bank's operations in the United States, including RBC Centura, a regional bank based in Rocky Mount, N.C. 
Mr. Nixon is one of about 90 Canadian business leaders who are scheduled to visit Washington on Monday and Tuesday to smooth the waters. The visit was organized months ago by the Council of Canadian Chief Executives to discuss border and free-trade issues. As Mr. Nixon sees it, these matters "have taken on an increased level of importance because of the tensions that now exist at the political level."

HEADLINE: Tourists Think Twice About Travel to Europe During War 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: NICE, France, March 28 

 BODY:
Akim Djabri knows it is springtime when the Americans come.
 "In April, May, June, traditionally it's the Americans and Canadians," he said, sipping coffee in the upstairs cafe of his slender 28-room hotel near the center of this Mediterranean resort. 
 This year, spring may be later than usual. Already, several cancellations have arrived from the United States. One, he said, began, "In view of the war . . ." 
The situation of Mr. Djabri, 38, who sold his gas station in Algeria seven years ago, brought his family to Nice and bought theHotel du Centre, is emblematic of European tourism on the whole.
Last year was "magnifique," he said, with visitors to Nice on the rise, even if they spent less in restaurants and on souvenirs. Now, he said, all bets are off.
Dominique Bourdais of HVS International Hotel Consultants said: "Travel had rebounded in the past year, and now it's going to level down. The question with the war is, Will it be short-lived?"
For Europe, with its stagnant economies and a need to replace traditional manufacturing with services, tourism is crucial. Yet wars frighten travelers. If the Iraq war ends soon, which few now expect, American animosity toward France and Germany, opponents of the war, may continue to curtail travel.
Economists at Oxford Economic Forecasting, a research group, recently estimated that a prolonged war could cost the European Union's 15 member countries as many as 260,000 jobs, and slice economic output by as much as 0.7 percent. That could drive some regions into recession.
In France, the world's leading tourist destination, travel and tourism account for more than $190 billion of business directly and indirectly, or almost 12 percent of gross domestic product, they estimated. In Italy, Spain and Britain, the industry does not lag far behind.
Moreover, as global economies have slumped, the battle among cities organizing trade fairs and conventions has intensified. Business travelers who frequent them are sought-after prizes, far outspending tourists.
In London, one foreign visitor in four now comes for business, said Louise Wood of the London Convention Bureau, yet these travelers generate a third of total tourist revenue. In France, they are 10 percent of the total, yet bring 35 percent of revenue. "It's definitely an industry with the wind aft," said Emmanuel Dupart, of France-Congres, an industry association.
The Cote d'Azur, with Nice at its heart, provides an example. A traditional beach resort area, the region now lures trade fairs and conventions to fill hotels in the off-season. Convention centers here and in Cannes, the site of the annual film festival, are being expanded and modernized; in nearby Monaco, a big new one, the Grimaldi Forum, just opened.
"There are few cancellations," said Mr. Dupart, whose organization represents 50 cities. "What we're seeing is a wait-and-see attitude. Rather than canceling orders, they're postponing them."
That is scant consolation for hoteliers and restaurateurs. And recent weeks have resounded with a cry of pain from the industry.
In Germany, the hotel federation announced that the industry might have to cut as many as 10,000 jobs. In Rome, Florence and Venice, ordinarily throbbing in springtime with art lovers and business travelers, hotel bookings are down by half so far this year compared with last year, according to Federalberghi, the largest Italian hotel federation.
In Paris, occupancy rates at luxury hotels dropped significantly last month, the industry association said. The posh Crillon, on the broad Place de la Concorde, was deserted, a victim of the huge barricades erected to shield the American Embassy nearby. Less expensive hotels were down by 10 percent.
Officials in Paris attributed the drop mainly to the absence of Americans, who accounted for 19 percent of all foreign visitors to Paris last year -- the largest foreign contingent. The pain is deep, since Americans spend more -- an average 328 euros ($358) a trip, compared with 133 euros by British tourists, and 78 euros for Germans. (Only the Japanese, at 652 euros, spend more.)
Tour organizers are also hurting. In Germany, TUI, the world leader, recently announced a $287 million cost-cutting program for next year, and the possible loss of 2,000 jobs, more than double the $122 million of cuts it plans this year.
European airlines are suffering, though they are not nearly so close to the edge as rivals in the United States like American Airlines. Europe's biggest carriers, including British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France, have all announced capacity cuts. Swiss, the airline that arose last year out of the ashes of Swissair, said recently that it was unable to operate profitably and would cut investment in new aircraft by 1 billion Swiss francs ($739,000).
Still, some experts say it is too early to say how lasting or deep the pain will be.
Some business travelers must stay aloft, or risk crippling their business.
"My only concern was, if something happened, I might have difficulty getting back home," said Bruce Frigeri, an executive from Parsippany, N.J., who visited a trade fair in France recently. In September 2001, Mr. Frigeri was in Toronto on business but left on Sept. 10; some associates stayed and were stranded for days. "That was my worry," he said.
The war is battering hotel chains just as the busy springtime sets in, "when they build up cash reserves after a slower winter season," wrote Eun Jee Park of Moody's Investors Service in a recent note to clients. Yet slower hotel construction, which is expected to rise 1.5 percent this year, down from almost 2 percent in 2002, would assuage the pain, Moody's said.
Then, too, many travelers will not cancel vacations, but simply go elsewhere. Travel agencies across Europe reported shifts from Middle Eastern and North African trips to the Caribbean and the United States, where, thanks to the weak dollar, travel is cheap for Europeans. Spur-of-the-moment services like lastminute.com, the British booking agency, are booming.
Francesco Frangialli, the secretary general of the World Tourism Organization in Madrid, remains optimistic. Sept. 11, he wrote in a recent letter to member states, provoked "the most serious crisis in the history of world tourism," yet the industry rebounded. In 2001, tourist arrivals fell globally by 0.5 percent, he noted, yet they rose 3 percent last year, to 715 million, despite a sour world economy.
Adjusting to crises accelerates shifts in consumer habits, Mr. Frangialli wrote, and encourages the creation of new operators, like low-cost airlines. "The need to travel, whether for business or leisure, is too deeply ingrained in our societies to be easily effaced," he said.
In the near term, of course, many European experts expect fear of violence and a threat of terrorism to have an impact. "When the whiff of cordite is in the air, the Americans tend to stay home," said Steve Martin, of Conference Advice and Management, a British company specializing in business meetings.
Harder to gauge is just how lasting an effect American anger at Germany and France will have on tourism.
Patrick Vece, the director of research at the Tourism Observatory, a government agency in Nice, said visitors from North America amounted to about 600,000 in 2001, and slightly fewer last year, or about 7 percent of the total, compared with 1 million each from Britain and Italy, the largest foreign groups.
"We observed in the past a very particular pattern," Mr. Vece said. "American tourism increased, then something happens and it goes down, by, say, 50 percent, and you rebuild."
In 1986, he noted, American visits collapsed after terrorist attacks in France; in 1991, they declined after the first gulf war.
"Now, again, we have to wait," he said. "We're just a tourist destination. But business will be down."
Mr. Djabri agrees. "We'll have to see -- some say they won't come. They remain welcome. It's in your head. That's all."

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
Land-Rich Museums Find New Income Source

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN MILFORD 

DATELINE: WILLIAMSBURG, Va. 

 BODY:
An outdoor history museum, where the grounds are dotted with staff members in period costume demonstrating how life was lived more than two centuries ago, seems an unlikely place for a shopping center. 
 But the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, through a for-profit subsidiary, has been a successful commercial developer since 1932, when John D. Rockefeller Jr. established a retail district to serve residents and visitors at the restored former capital of Virginia. 
 The 40 shops at Merchants Square, a foundation-owned complex bordering the campus of the College of William and Mary, ring up annual sales of $500 to $600 a square foot. By contrast, the country's enclosed malls generated an average of $330 a square foot in 2002, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers.
Now, the museum is building an additional 34,000 square feet of shops and offices in a complex designed to look like four 18th-century buildings at the corner of Duke of Gloucester and North Boundary Streets. The project will increase the shopping district by about 20 percent. 
The development comes at a time when outdoor history museums like Colonial Williamsburg look to real estate development to generate additional revenue in the face of declining admissions, sagging tourism and increased competition from entertainment alternatives. 
"I would say museum directors within the last five or six years have accelerated their interest in creative ventures to keep the revenue streams flowing -- or enhance them," said George L. Vogt, director of Hagley Museum and Library in Wilmington, Del., an outdoor industrial history museum where an office building is being developed on its grounds. "We aren't faring as well as we should in the competition for people's leisure time."
Last year 840,000 admission tickets to Williamsburg were sold, the lowest number since 1969, according to James L. Bradley, the museum's public relations manager. He said that the soft economy and the sniper attacks in the Washington area in the fall were among the reasons for the decline. Colonial Williamsburg's revenue from real estate, including Merchants Square, in 2001, the most recent year for which figures were available, represented 3.5 percent of its $184.8 million in operating revenue, Mr. Bradley said. 
Most outdoor history museums came into being in the early to mid-20th century under the direction of wealthy philanthropists caught up with the Colonial Revival movement. They tend to have sprawling campuses with dozens of buildings and gardens. 
The open spaces and buildings that are characteristic of these museums are sometimes being used in ways not envisioned by their founders. "They have more assets that are amenable to commercial use," said Edward H. Able Jr., president and chief executive of the American Association of Museums in Washington. "Especially now, museums are looking to whatever assets they have available that could be turned to revenue production." 
Hagley, a 235-acre industrial history museum on the Brandywine River where the DuPont Company manufactured black powder, has leased a historic machine shop at the entrance to its campus to a local developer who plans to spend $5 million to convert it into an office building.
Mr. Vogt estimates the development, if fully leased, could bring in at least $42,500 annually in rent to the museum, helping to offset the loss of $100,000 in admissions revenue over the last five years.
While additional revenue can be attractive, and even necessary, directors of outdoor history museums must be careful to balance development against the institutional mission, Mr. Able said. Moreover, tenants must be compatible with the museum's mission, and it is not unheard of for the board of trustees to review the leases, he said.
"A cigarette outlet or a liquor store or a topless bar is not something people would expect a public trust institution to be engaged in, even if they're just leasing the space," Mr. Able said. "Our institutions are keenly aware of the pedestal on which the public places these institutions." 
The 301-acre Colonial Williamsburg, the country's largest living history museum in terms of attendance, was one of the first to build a commercial structure on its property when, in 1932, it came up with the concept for Merchants Square, said Marina Ashton, director of commercial properties for the Williamsburg Foundation.
In commercial development terms, Merchants Square is considered a "lifestyle center," distinguished from other types of retail development in that it is not enclosed, is fashion-oriented and has parking close to the stores, said Kathleen F. Sawin, principal of the Sawin Group, a consulting group in Philadelphia that is working with Merchants Square.
In designing the original Merchants Square buildings, the Boston architectural firm of Perry, Shaw & Hepburn was inspired by the English houses and stores of the 1700's and early 1800's. Over the years, the complex has grown to 204,000 square feet, including the current construction.
Ms. Ashton said competition from developers constructing lifestyle centers in the surrounding Williamsburg area spurred the expansion on a piece of ground that has been vacant since the 1970's. The foundation thought it was necessary to add a few more local chains to keep the center vibrant, she said.
The museum has signed leases with Talbots of Hingham, Mass., a nearly 900-store women's specialty chain that will take 8,500 square feet. Chico's of Fort Myers, Fla., a chain of 392 women's clothing and accessories stores, will take 2,500 square feet. The merchandise in these two shops should appeal to the growing number of retirees in the Williamsburg area, Ms. Ashton said. 
There is also 6,500 square feet of office space, and the museum is negotiating with a single professional tenant.
Erith & Terry Architects of Essex, England, and Glave & Holmes Associates of Richmond, Va., have designed the project to resemble four buildings constructed over a number of years. The portion bordering Duke of Gloucester Street, for example, is neo-Classical in style, while another section will be more in the Virginia vernacular.
Ms. Ashton declined to give the cost of the new construction, but a person close to the development said it was about a $10 million project. The tenants pay for common area maintenance and advertising and pay a percentage of gross sales. Even at $45 a square foot annually, Ms. Ashton said, she is turning tenants away. A typical strip center would charge $30 to $35 a square foot, Ms. Sawin said.
The shops are expected to be open by November, in time for the holiday shopping season.
Like Colonial Williamsburg, Hagley came into being through the largess of a wealthy preservationist, Louise du Pont Crowninshield, a founding member of the National Trust. Hagley includes the du Pont family's original home, Eleutherian Mills, as well as gardens and the former powder mill buildings along the Brandywine.
One of the mill buildings, a stone machine shop built in 1906, has been vacant since it came into the museum's possession in the mid-1980's through the death of a du Pont family member. The 30,000-square-foot structure had been used for storage and as a stable, but no one has worked in the building since the 1920's.
Under the deal struck with JS Realty Partners, a Wilmington real estate development firm whose managing partner is Richard E. Stat, the developers will convert the building to class A office space. After 50 years the building, with all the improvements, will revert to the museum.
"It's a very good deal for us," Mr. Vogt said.
Leigh Johnstone, first vice president of CB Richard Ellis in Greenville, Del., said he was talking with a Wilmington law firm that could take half the space. Annual rental rates are being quoted at $28.50 a square foot with the tenant paying for electricity.
The ability of this development to attract a tenant in such a soft market illustrates the viability of distinctive projects, Mr. Johnstone said. The vacancy rate in the Wilmington suburban market is running about 16 percent, the highest since 1992, according to Insignia/ESG Inc.
"If someone is looking for unique properties, the economy has less of an effect," Mr. Johnstone said.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET -- SoHo; 
Still Seeking Best Mix Of Style and Rents

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Albert Laboz was on the verge of leasing his two-story building at 454 West Broadway in SoHo to a high-fashion retailer when terrorists destroyed the World Trade Center. The deal never closed.
 The terms would have been so sweet -- more than $300 a square foot annually for the ground floor -- that Mr. Laboz, a principal in United American Land, had paid his existing tenant, a Rizzoli bookstore, to move out. 
 Mr. Laboz eventually found a new tenant, Barry Kieselstein-Cord, an accessories company that sells belts priced from $900 to $2,200. But there was a catch: Kieselstein-Cord's rent was tied to its sales volume. After 18 months, if the store reached its sales goal -- an amount that neither tenant nor landlord would disclose -- the rent would be fixed at about 20 percent below the 2001 asking price, said the company's broker, Candice Dobbs, president of Dobbs Associates.
The Kieselstein-Cord deal is unusual, but it reflects the changes that have rocked the SoHo retail market. The ground-floor retail vacancy rate for SoHo is about 14 percent, or twice the average for Manhattan, according to a mid-February survey by the brokerage company Cushman & Wakefield.
Five years ago, luxury retailers began replacing the art galleries that had fled to Chelsea because of rising rents. But SoHo as Madison Avenue South proved to be a short-lived trend. Yves St. Laurent, Cartier and Ermenegildo Zegna are among the uptown retailers that leased space in SoHo but occupied it only briefly or never moved in. Last month, the jeweler H. Stern abandoned plans to open a store in a new building at Prince and Mercer Streets.
SoHo suffered more than most other Manhattan retail districts from the repercussions of the Sept. 11 attack, the absence of foreign tourists and the economic downturn. But brokers also say that rents soared out of control for a neighborhood that did not stand a chance of drawing the quantity of affluent customers found on Madison Avenue. "Some of the stores that opened didn't have any business going down there," said Jeffrey D. Roseman, an executive vice president of Newmark New Spectrum Retail.
With for-rent signs dotting the cast-iron buildings that were once used for light manufacturing, some landlords are negotiating month-to-month or short-term leases while they wait for the market to improve. Gene P. Spiegelman, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield, said that asking rents in the most desirable part of SoHo, from Broadway to West Broadway and from Houston Street to Grand Street, have declined to an average of $166 a square foot annually from $191 at the height of the market in early 2001. The highest asking rent, he said, has declined to $333 a square foot from $470. Fifty-seven retail spaces are now available, compared with 46 in early 2001, he said.
Brokers see SoHo as two retail districts. Broadway has chain stores that can be found in many malls (with a few exceptions, like Prada and its minimalist shop). A new Crate & Barrel store serves as the northern anchor, and Bloomingdale's plans to build its second Manhattan store in the Canal Jeans building to the south. H&M, a trendy but inexpensive clothing retailer, has leased space at 515 Broadway, only steps away from its store at 558 Broadway. Other new retailers include Levi's and Arden B.
West of Broadway, boutiques catering to young customers are taking space that was prepared in flusher times for marquee retailers. Recent arrivals representing well-known brands like Apple Computer, which moved into a former post office at Prince and Greene Streets, and Adidas, at 142 Wooster Street, have departed from their usual format to take advantage of the neighborhood's distinctive architecture.
New stores offering contemporary furniture and home furnishings are being added, particularly at the southern edge of the neighborhood, where rents are $75 to $90 a square foot, said Caroline P. Banker, an executive vice president at Douglas Elliman. Kartell, one of SoHo's first furniture retailers, is turning over its 1,800-square-foot space at 45 Greene Street to Catherine Memmi, a French home furnishings store, and moving into 3,500 square feet at 37 Greene Street.
Other new tenants nearby include Flou, a bed and bedding store, and Zollavari, which sells rugs made by nomadic tribes in Iran. At the northern edge of SoHo, Design Within Reach, a company that began as a catalog and Internet retailer of sleek home furnishings, opened its first New York retail store on Saturday at 142 Wooster Street.
Brokers who specialize in SoHo say their phones are ringing more often now that warmer weather is making the streets livelier. But most say rents should come down more.
"The asking prices are still high," said Bruce Sinder, the president of the Sinvin Realty Corporation, which represents both landlords and tenants. "If the price is right, there are tenants."

HEADLINE: Retail Group Downgrades '03 Forecast 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
Citing "geopolitical risks," the National Retail Federation, which represents more than one million retailers, downgraded its forecast for the year yesterday.
 In January, the group estimated that retail sales would grow 5.6 percent; yesterday, it lowered that estimate to 3.8 percent. 
 "The drumbeat toward war with Iraq has stymied fundamental sectors of the U.S. economy," the group said in a report. 
"A number of adjectives, all meaning similar things, can best describe the current state of the economy: subdued, sluggish, soft, tepid, fragile, muted," the report said. "This economic malaise has been with us for at least the past six months. It is likely to persist until the second half of the year."
If the report was not dispiriting enough, several analysts said the retail picture for 2003 might end up even more tepid and fragile than the trade group had predicted.
Brian Tunick, a retail analyst for J. P. Morgan, questioned the report's assessment that shoppers would be more willing to spend in the second half of the year. 
"For the last three years, everyone always starts out the year by saying the recovery will occur in the second half," he said. "With gas prices 50 percent higher than they were a year ago, and consumer confidence at a 10-year low, which was sliding months before the war, people figure things will only get better."
Thomson First Call, which compiles analysts' estimates and analyzes earnings, expects first-quarter earnings growth of 2.1 percent for the 137 retailers it follows, down from the 12.5 percent projected at the start of the year.
"That's a pretty dramatic downward revision," Ken Perkins, an analyst at Thomson, said yesterday. "Obviously, retailers have been feeling the heat."
If you take out Wal-Mart's growth -- and average the other 136 retail companies -- Mr. Perkins said the projected earnings growth dropped to negative 0.6 percent. And First Call has already revised downward its earnings estimates for the second and third quarters.
To Arnold H. Aronson, a managing director at Kurt Salmon Associates, a consulting firm that specializes in retail companies, it is only prudent to lower estimates. Like many other analysts, Mr. Aronson said that while the war in Iraq had certainly worsened an already lackluster retail climate, the situation had more to do with the economy than the war.
Rosalind Wells, the economist behind the Retail Federation's estimates, acknowledged that her analysis was basically a rosy one.
"The assumption is that the war will be not be terribly long," she said, "and that we will prevail. Any forecast has assumptions built into it."

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Index Declines For the First Time in 5 Months 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Business at the nation's factories contracted in March for the first time in five months, suggesting that the war in Iraq may be causing companies to retrench, a private survey released yesterday indicated.
 The Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index fell to 46.2 from 50.5 in February. A reading below 50 means that manufacturing activity is decreasing. 
 Analysts had forecast that the index would fall to 49.
The institute said purchasing and supply executives focused on the war, soft demand and rising prices. Demand slowed in several industries, including chemicals and industrial equipment.
But the institute refused to release the survey's cutoff date, making it hard to gauge how the start of the war affected responses. It said manufacturers tend to know their business levels by the 10th of each month; the war started on March 19.
"This was really built around the threat of what was going to happen," said Norbert J. Ore, who oversees the survey.
Besides war jitters, unseasonably severe weather and a decline in payrolls were factors in the drop-off, said Dan Meckstroth, chief economist at the Manufacturers Alliance, a research group in Arlington, Va.
"Declining production activity in manufacturing means that the overall economy cannot hope to achieve anything better than tread water in the months ahead," he said.
New orders had been above the 50 level for six months, but dropped in March to 46.2 -- 6.1 points lower than the reading in February.
The group's production index fell 9.1 points in March, to 46.3, indicating a drop in business and ending 15 consecutive months of growth in production, the survey found.
Factory employment again failed to recover in March, coming in below 50 for the 30th consecutive month.
"Consumer confidence affects spending on a real short-term basis," Mr. Meckstroth added, "but for the most part, people spend based on income and the buy ability of their job, and right now, we're just not getting employment growth."
A report from the Commerce Department yesterday showed that construction spending dipped by 0.2 percent in February, pulled down by a sharp drop in government spending for public works projects. Spending came to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of $872.2 billion, still brisk and better than analysts' expectations.

HEADLINE: U.S. Raises Some Fuel Economy Rules 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 1 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said today that it would raise fuel economy regulations for light trucks -- S.U.V.'s, pickups and minivans -- by 1.5 miles a gallon, or about 4.5 percent, by the 2007 model year. 
 The administration called the plan, which has been working its way through the regulatory system for several months, one of the biggest fuel economy increases in years. 
Environmental groups criticized it as a minuscule step at a time when gas consumption is a national security issue. 
 "The Bush administration is committed to improving vehicle fuel economy while protecting passenger safety and American jobs," Dr. Jeffrey W. Runge, the administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said in a statement.
David Friedman, a senior analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the measure's oil savings would be more than offset by a decision to continue credits automakers receive for making cars that can use ethanol. 
Daniel Becker, the top global warming expert at the Sierra Club, said, "Our troops are risking their lives in the Middle East for a war that is in part about oil, gas prices are skyrocketing, and global warming pollution is more of a problem than ever."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Large airlines, faced with their worst of times, have stepped up advertising despite the war.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
AIRLINES are slowly beginning to step up advertising despite the war, because the war may be the least of their problems.
 The slowdown in air travel since the war against Iraq began is only one difficulty confronting the airline industry, which is suffering through what is widely considered the worst time in its history. Advance domestic bookings have fallen 20 percent from a year ago, according to the Air Transport Association. That has left the supply of seats far above demand, which has been cut by the stagnant economy, the threat of terrorist acts, concerns about the financial health of many large carriers and now the war. 
 And to add illness to injury, there are increasing worries that air travel is helping spread a mysterious pneumonia-like disease, which led California officials yesterday to quarantine an American Airlines plane arriving at San Jose International Airport from Tokyo.
The additional ads in the last few days, from online sellers of airline tickets as well as the carriers themselves, reflect the industry's perilous condition. There is a widespread perception that, as the saying goes, in good times you should advertise, but in bad times you must.
"The war is having enough of a suppressing effect on bookings and traffic that we didn't need to compound it by making ourselves invisible," said David Messing, a spokesman for Continental Airlines in Houston, so the airline decided to continue "with our regular activities."
"We want travelers and potential travelers to know we're ready when they are," Mr. Messing said, unintentionally echoing an old slogan of a competitor, Delta Air Lines. The Continental efforts include print and outdoor ads by the Kaplan Thaler Group in New York, part of the Publicis Groupe, which carry a theme that seems particularly appropriate: "Work Hard. Fly Right."
At Delta, "because the war was slow-building, we developed a war contingency plan," said Carter Etherington, United States manager for marketing communications. The plan included television, radio and print ads in regional markets like Atlanta, Boston and New York.
"The majority of our advertising is geared toward how Delta is making travel safer, more efficient and more enjoyable," Mr. Etherington said, "and especially in New York, we're touting security and technology."
"If we were to stop our advertising, it would be a knee-jerk reaction," he added, "rather than to show support of the United States and the economy" by trying to stimulate business.
At Orbitz, the online ticket broker owned by a consortium of major carriers, "We started to see a definite decline in demand, especially in international travel, a couple of days before the war started, so we decided to pull back some marketing support," said Michael Sands, the chief marketing officer, in Chicago. Those cutbacks included newspaper ads and so-called pop-under ads on Web sites, he said.
"But now we see demand as coming back, so we're going to be aggressive in advertising," Mr. Sands said. "It's hard to countervail the American people's desire to travel, and people want to book their summer travel plans, particularly for early summer."
The pop-under ads on news Web sites, which were eliminated because "it would not have been appropriate to be there in the early stages of the war," he said, are returning this week; some came back yesterday.
That sensitivity to the national mood is prevalent throughout the industry.
"We may be taking a much closer look at consumer perceptions, hour by hour, so to speak, instead of day by day," said Eric Webber, a vice president at GSD&M in Austin, Tex., the Omnicom Group agency that has long created campaigns for Southwest Airlines.
"So far we're moving ahead and aren't making any changes," Mr. Webber said, other than "moving away our commercials from some news programming" after the war started.
"In fact, we just shot six new spots in the last couple weeks," he said.
Another low-fare carrier, JetBlue Airways, also filmed commercials in the last two weeks.
"JetBlue went off the air for 48 hours after the war started, then went back on with a regular schedule," said Brian Flatow, senior vice president at the Ad Store in New York, the JetBlue agency.
The new spots will be in the same humorous vein that has characterized the Ad Store's work for JetBlue, Mr. Flatow said, because "we feel our message is positive and uplifting." One commercial, meant to show "that you come off a JetBlue plane a happier person," he added, presents vignettes that include "3-year-old twins pushing their mom in a stroller and a dog kissing a cat."
Another carrier known for humorous campaigns is Virgin Atlantic Airways, part of the Virgin Group. Virgin Atlantic has continued its lighthearted pitches in "below-the-line channels like e-mail marketing, the Web and public relations, the sharpest tool in our marketing drawer," said John Riordan, the vice president for marketing in North America, in Norwalk, Conn.
Virgin Atlantic has not been running the more costly television and print ads, Mr. Riordan said, because the company is conducting a review for its creative and media account, with billings estimated at $12 million to $15 million.
"We have to balance market stimulation with cash conservation," he added. "We will choose the right time to get back in, and get back in we will."
Also husbanding its resources is US Airways, which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Monday. The carrier is going ahead with limited ad plans, said David Castelveter, a spokesman for the US Airways Group in Arlington, Va. Those include e-mail marketing and newsletters for members of the US Airways frequent-flier program, called Dividend Miles.
As US Airways emerged from bankruptcy, American Airlines, the unit of the AMR Corporation that is the world's largest carrier, reached tentative concession agreements with three major unions, helping avert a bankruptcy filing.
American "put advertising on hiatus," said Tim Kincaid, a spokesman, "to monitor how things evolved," and plans "to resume sometime in mid-April."
United Airlines, part of the UAL Corporation, has primarily been communicating with customers through e-mail, though it is also moving ahead with ads to which it has made long-term commitments.
"Right now, we're somewhere between not running ads and needing to drive revenue by starting to get butts into the seats," said Alex Leikikh, worldwide account director on the United account at the carrier's agency, Fallon Worldwide in Minneapolis, part of Publicis. "We're monitoring this on a daily basis, and we plan a meeting with the client this week to figure it out."

HEADLINE: HealthSouth's Legal Problems Ripple Across Its Hometown 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO and ALEX BERENSON 

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, Ala. 

 BODY:
Towering cranes stand idle at a half-finished $300 million HealthSouth hospital that was to have been the lodestar of the future this city wants. The builder, afraid it will not be paid, has stopped work, save for adding a temporary roof to keep the rain out.
 While the construction crews have gone home, the building next door is bustling. There, at the headquarters of HealthSouth, F.B.I. agents have been searching computers and questioning executives about an accounting fraud they say went on for 15 years. 
 The flood of agents and Securities and Exchange Commission investigators comes as a shock to a city and business community that regarded HealthSouth, the nation's largest chain of rehabilitation hospitals, as the leader in Birmingham's effort to refashion itself from the steel-making capital of the South into a center for the health care industry. 
The problems at HealthSouth come on top of the legal troubles of another Birmingham institution, McWane, a big maker of sewer pipes, which is under federal investigation for deaths and injuries at its plants.
But McWane, an old-line manufacturer, is Birmingham's past, while the bigger and fast-growing HealthSouth is its future. That is why, even with a war going on, business and community leaders find it hard not to talk about HealthSouth.
"HealthSouth is what the city wanted for its future, with its nonpolluting, pacesetting medical services," said Edward S. LaMonte, a political scientist at Birmingham-Southern College. "McWane is an after-image of the industrial past."
For a decade, Birmingham has watched HealthSouth and its founder, Richard M. Scrushy (pronounced SCROO-shee), with a mix of pride, admiration and resentment.
As HealthSouth expanded from a regional operator of rehabilitation centers into a national company with 50,000 employees at almost 2,000 centers, the city's establishment appreciated the economic benefits. HealthSouth became one of Birmingham's largest private employers, with 3,500 employees in and around the city.
At the same time, as Mr. Scrushy's wealth swelled and as he used charitable donations to make his name ubiquitous across the city, Birmingham's old guard, including the elite running its powerful banks, never fully embraced him. Mr. Scrushy's obsession with security, his seeming lust for publicity and his large pay made him an even more controversial figure.
Almost every significant institution in the city, from the University of Alabama to the science museum (called the McWane Center), has accepted donations from HealthSouth and Mr. Scrushy. Mr. Scrushy's name is on libraries, stadiums and stretches of highway.
"There was resentment among some people," said Richard Arrington Jr., a former Birmingham mayor. "There were those who resented his wealth and those who resented his style." 
Mr. Scrushy could not be reached for comment.
Mr. Scrushy, 50, is probably the only chief executive of a large Birmingham company who is not a member of the Birmingham Country Club, one of the favored clubs of old Birmingham. (Mr. Scrushy's humble upbringing in Selma, 90 miles south, would have ruled out his chances of acceptance at the Mountain Brook Country Club, the most exclusive redoubt of the city's power brokers.)
A person who knows the workings of the Birmingham Country Club said the club had kept out Mr. Scrushy because he was not properly deferential.
"People who apply to be members of the Birmingham club have to obtain dozens of letters of recommendation, which Richard did," he said. "After that he had to pay a visit to each of the 15 members of the club's board of governors. 'I don't need to do it,' Mr. Scrushy said. 'I am the C.E.O. of HealthSouth.' To which the club leaders essentially replied, 'You don't need to be a member.' "
Last week, Mr. Scrushy said he would resign from the board of trustees of the University of Alabama System, one of the most prestigious positions in Alabama.
Publicly, other trustees said Mr. Scrushy decided to step down independently and did so because he probably thought it was in the board's best interests. Privately, people who know the board's workings, including one trustee, said trustees felt uncomfortable with having Mr. Scrushy on the board while federal investigators were claiming he oversaw a fraud.
While Mr. Scrushy's detractors quietly gloat, his supporters say that the charges of fraud, if true, are a tragedy for the city. Two former chief financial officers and the company's former assistant controller have already pleaded guilty to charges of inflating HealthSouth's profits by $1.4 billion and are cooperating with the federal investigation. The company and Mr. Scrushy have not been charged.
The effect of the HealthSouth crisis on Birmingham has some resemblance to the way the Enron scandal disrupted Houston last year. But Houston, which has a metropolitan area of 4.2 million people and is home to the core of the energy industry and Continental Airlines, is already by almost any standard a major-league city. Birmingham, with a metropolitan area of a million people, would badly like to become one, or at least make up ground on Nashville and Memphis, its regional competitors.
Instead, Birmingham and Alabama must now face the fact that their most successful company and most prominent business leader are under investigation for fraud.
"I was a great admirer of his," said Susan Matlock, president of the Birmingham Entrepreneurial Center. "He didn't have a silver spoon. He's certainly self-made. When you didn't know this was in the offing, it was a source of pride."
Tim Taylor, a venture capitalist in Birmingham who specializes in investing in health care companies, said he "connected with the story and thought it was very impressive."
The accusations against Mr. Scrushy have "particularly bothered me because I looked up to Richard," said Mr. Taylor, who grew up in rural Mississippi. "Down in the Deep South, a guy who's come from a public school, public education, respiratory nurse -- those are rare stories."
A one-time respiratory therapist, Mr. Scrushy founded HealthSouth in 1984. The company rapidly gobbled up competitors to become the largest provider of rehabilitation services in the nation. The company's growth was the most visible symbol of Birmingham's move away from its industrial past, though not its only driver.
Four of the nation's top 50 banks have headquarters in Birmingham, more than in any other city except New York, and the University of Alabama at Birmingham has become a center for health care research.
For more than a decade, Birmingham's economy has grown strongly. Last year, unemployment in the metropolitan area averaged 4.2 percent, compared with 5.8 percent nationwide. The new prosperity is evident in the crowded parking lots of recently built malls in the city's wealthy southern suburbs, where Lincoln Navigators and other luxury sport utility vehicles jockey for space.
HealthSouth's headquarters is an anchor in one of the city's fastest-growing areas, across from the new Marriott Hotel and on Highway 280 just down from the new Saks Fifth Avenue at the new Summit Mall.
No one thinks the company's problems will permanently derail Birmingham's growth, but the investigations have been unsettling, said Dr. Mark S. Williams, an anesthesiologist at the HealthSouth Surgery Center in Tuscaloosa, about 60 miles southwest. Doctors at HealthSouth hospitals and medical centers are scrambling to make other arrangements for their patients in the event that the company files for bankruptcy and disrupts scheduled surgeries. Nurses and other HealthSouth workers are worried about their jobs.
The accusations against HealthSouth and Mr. Scrushy are a setback, both real and psychological, for Birmingham, Ms. Matlock said.
"You always want to be able to talk about role models and entrepreneurial heroes," she said, "and we've just lost a significant one."
Mr. Scrushy's plan to build the $300 million hospital perhaps best captures how his style affected Birmingham. HealthSouth officials called the project a "digital hospital" that would be the first medical center to keep all its records on crash-proof servers and connect doctors with patients any time, anywhere. At the same time, the officials threatened to move the project to another state if the Alabama legislature did not quickly approve legislation to allow HealthSouth to bypass the state's permit process for new hospitals.
Competing hospitals said that the hospital would be nothing new and that HealthSouth simply wanted a new hospital in one of Birmingham's most affluent areas.
HealthSouth easily defeated its critics, and the bill allowing the company to bypass the state's permit laws was signed into law in September 2001. Not even the Sept. 11 attacks could derail the bill. The Alabama Senate stayed in session after the attacks to pass the legislation.
But last week, the only people working on the construction site were a handful of roofers. "The digital hospital is a real big showpiece for Birmingham," said Dr. Williams, the HealthSouth anesthesiologist. "And people are thinking for a time it will be a showpiece to corporate greed."

HEADLINE: House and Senate Panels Approve Aid forAirlines 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 1 

 BODY:
The appropriations committees in the House and the Senate each voted today to give the airline industry about $3 billion in emergency assistance, enough to provide modest relief but nowhere near the amount needed to cure the industry's most acute problems.
 "You cannot call this a bailout," said Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority leader. "I believe the industry needs to work through their market problems on their own." 
 The House and Senate measures have significant differences, which will ultimately have to be resolved in a conference committee. But both would compensate airlines for additional security costs and both would impose limits on salaries and bonuses paid to airline chief executives. 
Administration officials vowed to push for a smaller package in the conference committee. "A considerable gulf remains between Congress and the administration regarding the amount and structure of this assistance," Norman Y. Mineta, the secretary of transportation, said.
Both measures were attached to bills to provide more than $75 billion to cover costs tied to the war in Iraq, which Congressional leaders want to pass before April 11, when the Congressional spring break begins.
White House officials originally opposed any additional money for airlines, saying that the industry's problems stemmed from overcapacity and high costs rather than from the war against Iraq. But administration officials have made clear that they will agree to at least some money, if only to ensure quick approval of money for the war.
Even so, analysts say the airline assistance pales in comparison to the problems of major air carriers like United Airlines, which is in bankruptcy proceedings, and American Airlines, which narrowly avoided bankruptcy on Monday by obtaining wage concessions from labor.
The Air Transport Association, an industry group, estimated that airlines were on track to lose nearly $7 billion this year and that the war in Iraq would probably increase those losses another $4 billion.
Passenger numbers dropped about 10 percent in the week the war began. Executives worry that anxiety about terrorist reprisals could depress revenue for some time to come. Despite those problems, the airlines received grudging sympathy, at best, here. Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike said the airlines' biggest problems were of their own making.
Among the criticisms: the big hub-and-spoke carriers like United, American, Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines failed to reduce their capacity enough; failed to control their labor costs; and wasted money long before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, by buying back their own shares at what turned out to be inflated prices.
Adding insult to injury, some say, airlines like Delta awarded their chief executives generous bonuses at the same time they were losing money and cutting jobs.
"A lot of mistakes have been made by the industry," said Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, who helped write the Senate's airline proposal. "I think they made bad management decisions, and they had a terrible record of caving into labor unions."
The hostility was bipartisan. 
"This is a let's-pretend industry," said Representative David Obey of Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. "They pretend they operate in the free market and they pretend they are standing on their own two feet. And then every couple of years they come to Washington and ask for dollars to help them out."
The House plan would provide about $3.2 billion in assistance. It would reimburse airlines for some of the security fees that passengers have been paying since February 2002. The Senate plan would provide about $3.5 billion over all. About $2.8 billion of that would go to extend the government's program of subsidized war-risk insurance; it would also relieve passengers from paying some of the additional security fees; and it would reimburse airlines for about $900 million for new security requirements like fortified cockpit doors.
But the biggest difference between the House and Senate plans is that Senate Republicans agreed to incorporate partof a proposal by Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, to provide additional unemployment benefits for laid-off airline workers and extra money to airports and airlines for security improvements. Those items brought the Senate plan's cost to $3.5 billion.
Regardless of the final details, Republican leaders in both chambers appear set on passing slightly more than $3 billion in assistance. That is much less than the $15 billion in aid to airlines that Congress passed shortly after Sept. 11, 2001.
It is also less than the airlines wanted. Earlier this year, the Air Transport Association suggested reimbursing airlines for about $4 billion in added security costs and perhaps giving them a one-year holiday from $9 billion in ticket fees and taxes that now go into a federal fund for airport infrastructure and operations.
But the airlines were reluctant to ask for big loan guarantees under the Air Transportation Stabilization Board, which Congress authorized to provide as much as $10 billion in loan guarantees to airlines reeling from Sept. 11.
Airline executives would prefer to receive tax relief or reimbursement for security costs that they would not have to pay back.

HEADLINE: In Trenton, Some Propose Raising Taxes On the Richest 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 1 

 BODY:
In a day of discouraging forecasts about New Jersey's fiscal future, some Democrats in the State Senate publicly called today for consideration of a tax increase on high earners that could alleviate some of the pain in Gov. James E. McGreevey's proposed budget.
 The suggestions were tentative, and the governor and most other Democratic leaders still oppose any income-tax increase. But after the first round of public hearings on the governor's $23.7 billion budget, legislators are casting about for any new sources of money. 
 Today the Senate Budget Committee heard the state treasurer and economists from Rutgers and from the legislative staff describe a faltering economy and anemic tax collections. The Office of Legislative Services projected revenues $321 million below Mr. McGreevey's estimates for the next fiscal year, a difference that is smaller than 1 percent but that is enough to wipe out the anticipated surplus.
The treasurer, John E. McCormac, also drew a grim picture, saying that with no economic rebound in sight, "We must slam on the brakes and bring all but essential spending to a halt."
But some committee members seized upon a projection that President Bush's tax cut proposal, if adopted in full, would provide $24 billion to New Jersey taxpayers and "an opportunity" for the state to tap into the benefits that accrue here.
"Maybe a piece of that should go to helping the poor, disabled and elderly," said Senator Bernard F. Kenny Jr., a Democrat from Hoboken. "We have a heavy moral responsibility here." Senator Kenny stopped short of endorsing a tax increase, as Speaker Albio Sires of the Assembly has done, but citing the "new reality of a massive tax cut" from Washington, he asked, "Why is it so out of the question?"
Proposals to raise the state's top income-tax rate, which are collectively being called a "millionaire's tax," have been circulating in Trenton for months. Last week a coalition of labor unions, religious groups and social service organizations proposed an increase in the top rate of 6.37 percent on incomes starting at $400,000 a year. The plan, to raise the rates by steps up to 9.5 percent on incomes over $1 million, would yield about $1 billion a year.
No such legislation has materialized, however, and until today the Legislature had never publicly discussed the idea.
"It's now on the table, and I'm totally opposed to it," Senator Leonard Lance, a Republican on the budget committee, declared after several Democrats said the top 1 percent or 2 percent of New Jersey residents would benefit disproportionately from a federal tax cut. "The notion that some of that revenue should be seized by the government in Trenton defeats the purpose of a tax cut."
And Senator Wayne Bryant, the Democratic co-chairman of the committee, said, "I don't think this is the time for us to be thinking about increasing taxes."
Mr. McCormac said that he and the governor also opposed any increases.
The suggestion of a windfall from Washington was made by Joseph J. Seneca, a Rutgers economist and the chairman of the state's Council of Economic Advisers, who presented his annual report to the Legislature on the state's economic conditions. Mr. Seneca said that President Bush's proposed $726 billion tax cut, which has been approved by the House, would result in $24 billion in benefits to New Jersey residents.
Mr. Bush's request has been cut in half by the Senate, however, and the cuts would take place over a 10-year period.
Barbara Buono, a Democratic committee member, said she would prefer a tax increase on incomes over $1 million to the plan in the governor's budget to cut property tax rebates to those making more than $100,000 a year.
"In my district, 3,253 households would be cut off under McGreevey's plan," Senator Buono said. "These are middle-income people."

HEADLINE: Detroit on a Mission: No Slip in Auto Sales 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 1 

 BODY:
Auto sales continued their sluggish pace last month, according to figures released today, prompting the Big Three automakers to broaden their no-interest loan offers.
 Sales actually fell less than many analysts had expected in March, just 0.4 percent from a year earlier, and cars were still selling at a fairly healthy rate. But automakers are clearly worried enough to offer a new round of deals that General Motors called unprecedented, setting up a test for the industry in April. 
 G.M. announced Monday eveningthat it would expand its incentives even beyond what it offered in its Keep America Rolling marketing campaign after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001. Today, Chrysler and Ford said they would offer similar deals. 
While zero percent financing has been part of the car-buying landscape for a year and a half, the deals were typically only on three-year loans or were longer-term deals used late last year to clear out 2002 models. G.M.'s new deals extend zero percent financing to loans of up to five years on all its vehicles except Hummers. Ford and Chrysler will offer five-year zero percent deals on many of their vehicles as well. 
Ford, which celebrates its centennial this year, has its own twist, saying it will offer $5-a-day leases on some Mustangs and Ranger pickups, with 10 percent down, as a way to commemorate the $5-a-day wage its founder, Henry Ford, started paying workers in 1914 so that they could afford to buy the company's cars. 
The new incentives recall those put in place after Sept. 11, when G.M. started a price war among the Big Three that led to record-breaking monthly sales in October 2001 and made the auto industry a rare bright spot in an otherwise stagnant economy. Once again, the economy is stagnant amid the backdrop of war. Reports this week showed shrinking manufacturing activity and sluggish retail sales.
"If a customer is in fear, they're afraid to buy," said Al Clements, a minister and auto salesman at Athens Chevrolet in Athens, Ga., which started offering G.M.'s new deals today. But he said that there was even more uncertainty before the war began. "It's like this," he said. "You still have a job. Gas hasn't gone to $4 a gallon. It went down. There's nothing to fear."
Analysts and economists are again divided about whether the industry can serve as an economic balm. Some contend that customers are taking zero percent in stride and that overall incentive spending is not increasing from its already high levels. But others say that they think that extending the zero percent deals to five years from three will allow some buyers to get far lower monthly payments and could push some others to buy more luxurious vehicles.
"What may be a little bit different this time around is that the industry has huge inventories, so they are not going to bump up production," said Robert Schnorbus, chief economist at J. D. Power. "But it will clean out inventories and sustain production when it was at risk of significant cuts."
Stephen J. Girsky, an auto analyst at Morgan Stanley, was more skeptical. 
"April will be modestly better than March," he said. "We've sold so many cars since 9/11 that anybody who wanted to buy a car has bought one. It'll give some boost, but it doesn't look like the consumer is in the position to carry the ball the way they were last time."
Sales in March decreased to a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 16.2 million vehicles from 16.7 million in the month a year earlier. Though not a bad performance, the sales this year have been well short of last year's rate of 16.8 million units.
"I don't think it's a stretch to say we'll see something in the high 17 to 18 range in April," said George Pipas, Ford's chief sales analyst. "I look for a very strong April."
Paul Ballew, chief sales analyst at G.M., was somewhat more cautious. 
"I can't say I'd be surprised if the industry ran 17 million units in April. Would I be surprised if the industry ran 18 million units in April? Yes I would." 
"What happens in incentives after April, we'll have to see," he said. "We'll see how it plays out."
For many buyers, there has been reason to wait. 
"I was ready in February, but then I had several other expenses come up and had to take care of them first," said Marty Jacobs, 40, an architect from Summit, N.J., who recently bought a Jeep Liberty after thinking about the more expensive Jeep Grand Cherokee. 
"It's a crazy time we are living in. The economy is sour, the job market is tough, the war could be going on for months," he said.
In March, sales in the critical United States market fell 3 percent for G.M. and Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, and 4.3 percent for Ford, according to the AutoData Corporation. Sales rose 9.2 percent at Toyota and 20.7 percent at Honda, underlining the competitive weakness of the Big Three, which spend far more on incentives. 
There were some signs of a shift to more fuel efficient vehicles. Though overall sales of S.U.V.'s remain strong, the best sellers are the smallest ones, like the Ford Escape and the Vue from G.M.'s Saturn brand. But G.M. officials have emphasized that too much should not be read into such a shift, and some buyers agree. 
In Denver, one car shopper, Juan Alonso, out car shopping, said he thought gas prices would top $2 a gallon next month. 
"It does make a difference," he said, "but gas is still cheaper than bottled water."

HEADLINE: Doubts on Tobacco Funds Hurt State Bonds 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The market is faltering for municipal bonds backed by revenues from the states' settlement with the tobacco companies, posing the prospect of higher costs to cash-short states.
 The State of Virginia delayed the closing of a $767 million tobacco bond sale yesterday after the ratings on $18 billion in similar bonds were cut by Moody's Investors Service. 
 The downgrading followed warnings from Philip Morris that it could not afford to post a $12 billion bond to appeal a court decision in Illinois. Those warnings came after an Illinois state court issued a $10.1 billion judgment against Philip Morris on March 21 and ruled that it would have to post a $12 billion bond in order to appeal. 
Philip Morris and rating agencies have said it could face bankruptcy, though Moody's said that outcome was unlikely. On Monday, Moody's lowered the credit rating of Philip Morris's parent, Altria, and Standard & Poor's said that it could lower the company's rating below investment grade, or to junk bond status.
The Illinois attorney general's office said yesterday that public documents from Altria showed that it could handle a bigger bond than it has acknowledged and that it was using bankruptcy as a threat. 
"It is not what it can afford to pay, but what it is willing to pay," said Melissa Merz, spokeswoman for Lisa Madigan, the Illinois attorney general. After talks with the state produced little progress, Philip Morris is expected to file a motion today to have the size of the bond reduced.
Virginia said it faced no immediate financing problem from the postponed bond issue. But many states, including New York, are working to bridge budget gaps by selling bonds tied to some or all of the first 25 years of expected payments from the tobacco companies, under a pact signed with 46 states that has been valued at $206 billion.
The tobacco bonds have sold off on the uncertainty. The tobacco bonds generally have been backed by the stream of revenue from the cigarette companies and not by revenues from the states or municipalities or counties that have sold them. This is why the Philip Morris bankruptcy threat has been so unsettling for the tobacco-backed bond market.
The states that want to issue the bonds may now have to pay more to entice investors. New York officials have considered backing the bonds with some state revenue to reduce the yields the state has to offer.
The sell-off has been swift. Josh Gonze, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management who considers tobacco bonds too risky to buy, said that yields on longer-term tobacco bonds shot as high as 8.25 percent yesterday. That is well above the 6.78 percent yield that resulted when Virginia priced its 30-year tobacco bonds in March.
For the month of March, the tobacco bond portion of the municipal bond market had a loss of 4.16 percent, in contrast to a total return of 0.06 percent for the entire municipal bond market, according to Lehman Brothers.
Because Moody's reduced the rating to A3 from A1 on the Virginia issue, the lead underwriter, Morgan Stanley, told the state it could not close the sale. The bonds were priced in late March with a closing date of April 3. They allowed purchasers to decline the bonds in case of a rating change before the sale closed.
"This was sold as an A1, and it is now an A3 and that is a material change," said Jody Wagner, the treasurer of Virginia and of the special corporation established by the state to sell the tobacco bonds.
Ms. Wagner said that she did not know what would happen to the sale of the bonds, but said that the state had breathing room because proceeds from the sale were not to be used to help close a budget deficit. The financing was to be used to endow a commission charged with revitalizing the state's tobacco growing regions.

HEADLINE: Health Workers, 2002 Pataki Allies, Jam Into Albany to Denounce His Cuts 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU and JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 1 

 BODY:
More than 30,000 health care workers thronged the mall in front of the Capitol today to protest $2 billion in cuts Gov. George E. Pataki has proposed in health care programs, just a few months after their leader, Dennis Rivera, gave the governor crucial support in his re-election bid.
 The demonstration was the largest in at least two decades, and many longtime politicians here said they had never seen so many protesters descend on the Capitol. Organizers say at least 37,000 health care workers came to town on chartered buses from Long Island to Buffalo. The union rented out the largest stadium in the capital region, the Pepsi Arena, and it still was not large enough to hold the crowds. 
 The protest was organized and financed by Mr. Rivera's union, 1199/S.E.I.U., and the Greater New York Hospital Association, an umbrella group for 220 hospitals, mostly in New York City. The event was laced with paradox. Just a few months ago, Mr. Rivera and many of the same health care workers stood squarely behind Governor Pataki, a Republican, and helped him win a landslide victory over the Democratic candidate, H. Carl McCall. The support of the union came after Mr. Pataki had pushed a bill through the Legislature a year ago to provide money for raises for Mr. Rivera's members. 
Yet today many of those same union members said they felt betrayed, as hospital executives warned that the governor's proposed cuts would lead to tens of thousands of layoffs. 
"When they go for election, they promise you that they are going to give you everything," said Yolanda Carela, 45, a home attendant who voted for Mr. Pataki. "But when they get elected, forget about it."
Ms. Carela echoed the bitter views of many other marchers on the capital today, who roundly lambasted the governor at every turn. But Mr. Rivera, other union officials and hospital executives who spoke to the crowds were careful in their remarks not to attack the governor. 
Instead of vilifying Mr. Pataki directly, Mr. Rivera and his top union officials acknowledged the state's budget problems, but contended that a tax increase on the wealthy would be a better choice than gutting the health care system. The union has also decided not to name the governor in a series of blistering television commercials and mailings urging New Yorkers to contact "Albany" to block the cuts.
Aides to the governor said that he was not surprised at the protest, but that he remained convinced that raising taxes would smother the economy, and that he saw no other choice than to cut health care, one of the fastest rising costs in the budget.
"It's not as if we went into this thinking we aren't going to take some heat, and the governor is prepared to do it because he thinks it's the right thing to do for the state," one senior aide said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Mr. Rivera said the show of force was necessary to send a message to the governor. "On this one, we believe the governor is wrong, and we hope and we pray that we can persuade him to change his mind," Mr. Rivera said.
Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said the intent of the protest was to educate the public about the effect of the governor's budget, not to hammer the governor. 
"I think we still want to maintain dialogue," Mr. Raske said. "But it could change at a minute's notice."
The demonstration wasa major logistical undertaking. The union spent about $2 million to charter 900 buses, which picked up protesters at hundreds of places around the state. There were so many buses that part of the Thruway was shut down temporarily as they tried to exit. Lines of buses snaked through downtown Albany for hours, dropping off people in an orderly fashion. 
Not all the protesters fit into the Pepsi Arena, which was crammed with 17,000 people, wearing T-shirts and buttons in purple and gold, the union's colors. Thousands carried noisemakers and whistles. They waved signs, stomped their feet and made a deafening noise that at times drowned out the speakers. The crowd chanted: "Job-killing cuts? They gotta be nuts," making fun of Mr. Pataki's oft-repeated vow not to raise "job-killing taxes."
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, both made appearances. Mr. Silver, who took the stage as the theme from "Rocky" blared, assailed the governor, saying he had made the "wrong choices" in his budget. Senator Bruno, a Republican who wore a purple-and-gold-striped tie in honor of the union, vowed to "restore what is critical to meet the needs of the people."
Later, Mr. Rivera and Mr. Silver led the throngs in a march to the mall in front of the Capitol for a noisy rally. On the mall, organizers had erected a stage with giant televisions and towers of speakers. As the weather worsened, the protesters tried to stay warm dancing to calypso, soca and other Caribbean rhythms, through speaker after speaker. 
Shivering in the cold, many workers expressed disgust with the fickleness of politicians, especially the governor. Yet very few were willing to criticize Mr. Rivera's leadership, saying he had successfully wrested money for raises from the administration last year. Some said Mr. Pataki had hoodwinked Mr. Rivera, betraying the union's interests after the election.
"This is his last term, so the governor thinks, what the hell," said Cyril Morgan, 52, a nurse's aide from Manhattan. "But if he wants the Republicans to get back in there, he's got to do something or it's going to hurt them."
Many in the crowd said they regretted voting for the governor. "The next time, I'm not going to vote for him," said Felicita Melendez, 54, a home health aide.
Others said the sluggish national economy was the culprit. Monica Afflick, 62, a clerk at Mount Sinai Medical Center, said the health care industry would probably be squeezed even if a Democrat had won the governor's office. But she added, "We put him in there, so we need him to reply, to do what needs to be done."
For Democrats like Mr. Silver, the huge protest was a vindication of sorts, another sign that the labor movement, after supporting Mr. Pataki in the last election, had come home to the Democratic Party.
"We all make mistakes," Mr. Silver said of Mr. Rivera's shifting allegiances. "He was happy to admit it. And now they are letting the governor know that they made the wrong choice."
Mr. Pataki stayed out of the public eye, meeting with legislative leaders behind closed doors while the protest raged outside. His spokeswoman, Lisa Dewald Stoll, said the protesters should recall that the governor had made enormous investments in health care programs during his first two terms.
Union leaders maintain that the cuts Mr. Pataki has proposed to Medicaid reimbursement rates, along with an increase in taxes on hospital bills, would shrink the revenues hospitals rely on to operate. Some hospitals will be forced to close, hospital officials and union leaders said. They also maintain that the cuts will eliminate more than 22,000 jobs.
What is more, they argue, the governor's budget does not take into account the extra hundreds of millions of dollars needed to prepare for possible chemical, nuclear or biological attacks from terrorists.
Mr. Pataki, however, has contended that every sector of society must become more efficient in these fiscally hard times. The state must find a way to close an $11.5 billion shortfall, and Medicaid costs are one of the fastest growing parts of the budget.

HEADLINE: Who Makes More Than Who in New York 

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
Most New Yorkers know they make more money here than they would doing the same job almost anywhere else -- even if what they are making never feels like enough. But who knew that fitness trainers and aerobics instructors make almost as much as sociologists and nearly twice as much as preschool teachers?
 Chief executives, lawyers, surgeons and brokers make more than most other groups, according to a report released yesterday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And the people who park their cars, do their pedicures, deliver their packages and care for their children are among those making the least. 
 In between those extremes falls a wide array of New Yorkers: architects earning less than fashion designers but slightly more than telemarketers; butchers whose wages top bakers'; public relations specialists making less than half what dentists earn but more than paralegals.
The report, the first of its kind by the New York office of the bureau, found that workers here earn on average 29.4 percent more per hour than the national average in their professions. In sales, which includes certain jobs in financial services, earnings exceeded the national average by more than 50 percent. Even those in the lowest-paid group, food preparation and serving, were making 25 percent more than the national average for that category.
The only region with a higher average wage than New York's is the San Francisco region, said Michael L. Dolfman, the New York regional commissioner for the bureau, which is a division of the United States Department of Labor.
There, average wages when last surveyed were 35.3 percent above the national average. The metropolitan area with the lowest average wage was Miami.
"For the first time, we've been able to quantify the difference in wages from the national level to the New York region," Mr. Dolfman said.
"People have talked about this but we believe this is one of the first reports that quantifies what that is, not only in general terms but by specific categories of employment."
The report is based on an annual mail survey of 400,000 employers nationwide. Using data collected in 1998, 1999 and 2000, the bureau estimated average wages in 2001. Employers were asked to report the number of employees they had in each of 12 wage groups. The groups range from "under $6.75 an hour" to "$70 an hour and over."
"If you're making $8 million, you're not going to tell us that you make $8 million," Mr. Dolfman said, referring to the leeriness with which some people approach federal questionnaires about income.
"So, the highest level on our scale is $70 an hour." He added, "People are willing to say that they make X if they really makes 10 times X."
For that reason, the report contains little detail about incomes at the high end of the spectrum. In addition, because the data were collected before 2001, the report does not reflect the effects of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack and the recession.
According to the report, the broad occupational groups with the highest average hourly wages in New York, as well as nationally, are management and the law.
Among managers, chief executives top the list. In the legal profession, the bureau put the hourly wage of the estimated 42,450 lawyers in the region at $52.21.
People in the category of securities, commodities and financial services sales had an hourly wage of $51.70. Surgeons and several other groups of medical specialists were equally or more highly paid.
At the other end of the scale, the report estimated the hourly wage of fast food cooks at $6.35, manicurists and pedicurists at $7.33, home health aides at $8.50 and couriers and messengers at $9.64. The average for child care workers was $10.01, preschool teachers $13.50 and maids and housekeepers $13.66.
The bureau estimated the average wage of fitness trainers and aerobics instructors at $24.49, sociologists at $28.62, architects at $31.70 and fashion designers at $33.65.

HEADLINE: Once a Home, Now a Museum of Fate Unknown 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: MARTINSDALE, Mont., March 25 

 BODY:
This is not the kind of place where you would expect to find a Chippendale chair or Sevres china. The heads and skins of animals, stuffed and mounted on the walls, are more in keeping with local tastes in decor.
 But Martinsdale, which has about 60 full-time residents and is about 100 miles east of Helena, is home to one of this state's biggest fortunes, part of which was on display in the Charles M. Bair Family Museum, which holds more Hepplewhite and Louis XV furniture than a Manhattan antiques store. 
 "Was" on display because the museum, which was the home of Bair and his family until the death of his daughter Alberta M. Bair in 1993, is to be closed this year so the advisory board that controls her $40 million trust can consider ways to make the museum more self-sustaining. 
"The financials are very, very difficult for this museum," Wayne Hirsch, a board member and president of U.S. Bancorp's operations in Montana, said, noting that fewer than 5,000 people visited the museum last summer. 
"We're not trying to do something sinister here," Mr. Hirsch said. "We're trying to make a decision on a very, very difficult issue."
 The local community, which depends on the museum for tourism, is in an uproar over the decision of the five-member board, which includes two bank representatives.
 Residents say the bank controls the board and would rather manage money than Navajo rugs and crystal chandeliers. They say they believe that if the museum is closed, it will never reopen and that its collection, once valued at almost $10 million by Sotheby's, will be dispersed or moved so it will lack meaning.
 "It would be kind of like moving Stonehenge," said Kelsey Miller, a freshman at Carroll College in Helena whose high school class did research at the museum for a Montana Heritage Project.
 Barbara O. Roberts, conservator at the Frick Collection in New York, concurs. She spent several months with Miss Bair before she died to get the collection museum-ready. "They have wanted to disperse the collection from the very beginning," she said of the bank.
"It means a tremendous amount to this community," Ms. Roberts said. "I do feel very strongly that it was her money, she understood she was being advised to do something else with it, and she still chose to make a museum."
 But Miss Bair gave the board the option to close the museum after five years if it "became an extreme burden on the trust," Mr. Hirsch said, while refusing to disclose the trust's exact terms. "For those people who knew Alberta Bair, she was a very, very fiscally responsible person." 
 Local residents say Miss Bair was tight-fisted. Many said they recalled seeing her and her sister, Marguerite, stop their white Cadillac on the road and step out in full-length mink coats to pick up cans and bottles and return them for the deposits. 
 The museum does not make much of a dent in Miss Bair's trust. Charlie Bair came to Montana as a railroad conductor with, legend has it, 14 cents and seven green apples in his pocket. He parlayedthat into a fortune in minerals, finance and sheep.
 Marguerite and Alberta were brought up as ladies, but Alberta shared her father's interests: ranching, hunting and wheeling and dealing. She was seldom seen without a tumbler of vodka over ice and a cigarette. It was Marguerite who picked the antiques, Alberta who bargained for them. The house was built around the collection they amassed during trips to Europe, and those who knew them have no doubt they intended it to be a museum.
 "Alberta always told me she was going to give the house to the state to keep as a museum, and she was outraged when the state wanted her to give the money to do that," said El-Donna Pierce, whose husband was the ranch foreman. "She said she might as well do it herself if she was going to have to pay for it."
 It costs $250,000 a year to run the museum, including a $149,500 management fee to the C. M. Russell Museum in Great Falls, Mont., Mr. Hirsch said.
 That is 0.48 percent of the $52 million in Miss Bair's trust on April 30, 2001, the last year for which data is available, and 0.15 percent of the $167 million left by her family. Mr. Hirsch said those assets have fallen 15 percent to 20 percent since then. 
U.S. Bancorp recently spurned an offer from the Tenderfoot Foundation, an environmental preservation group, that included a $2 million contribution for the museum. The foundation has been trying to buy 8,000 acres northwest of White Sulphur Springs that is held by the Bair Ranch Foundation, another repository of the Bair fortune. But the bank, which controls the Bair foundation, was not interested.
 Mr. Hirsch said that the $7.5 million offered for the land was not what the bank had expected and that the bank was concerned that a sale would incite more community ire.
 But $2 million would have gone a long way toward building an endowment for the museum, which is what local residents say they hope to do. They say the local community could run the museum more cost effectively.
 Russell Van Lieshout, a graphic designer and desktop publisher who lives in White Sulphur Springs, about 30 miles west of Martinsdale, has done an analysis that suggests that the museum could manage on a budget of $130,250 if it had 9,000 visitors and raised ticket prices. "The problem with this museum is not that it costs too much," Mr. Van Lieshout said, "but that it hasn't been properly advertised."
 Promoting the museum fell to the C. M. Russell Museum, and residents say that for the first year or so, the Russell ran billboard and print ads in Billings and elsewhere in the state and promoted the museum to the elderly, who came on day buses.
 The Bair Museum attracted at least 9,400 visitors in its first year and at least 7,600 in the second year, setting off the closest thing Wheatland and Meagher Counties, neither of which have a stoplight, have seen to an economic boom in recent history. With only 4,100 residents between them, 20 percent of whom live in poverty, the extra purchases of gasoline and lunch made a difference.
 "If the museum closes, I'll lose between 50 and 75 percent of my business," said Cheryl Marchi, who with her husband, Peter, owns the Crazy Mountain Inn in Martinsdale, which is famous locally for its chicken-fried steak. "Five thousand visitors may not sound like much to someone in New York City, but it's huge to people like us."
 After the initial promotion, very little has been done, residents say. Brochures for the Bair Museum list only the Russell Museum's phone number and address, as does the AAA guide. 
 Myrna Conrad, the museum's first caretaker, was forbidden to distribute brochures to visitors. 
 Mrs. Conrad said she was directed to steer tours away from the museum's three paintings by the Western artist C. M. Russell, a friend of Charlie Bair. In the spring of 1997, the Russell Museum removed them to Great Falls. "The director of operations and security at the Russell Museum said they were restoring the frames, and one did have a fragile frame," Mrs. Conrad said. "But then they informed me that the paintings weren't coming back, that they would be replaced by same-size photographic reproductions."
 She said she was told not to say anything about the removal of the paintings, but she told Lee Rostad, a longtime friend of Miss Bair who sat on the first advisory board. The paintings were returned. 
 Now they are gone again, as are several Henry Sharp paintings and two large Paul Storr wine coolers that have been taken out of the house pending the museum's reopening.

HEADLINE: A RESPIRATORY ILLNESS: HONG KONG; 
Virus Imperils Commerce And Economy In Asian Hub

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, April 1 

 BODY:
In the nearly six years since its transition to China, this former British colony has endured two recessions, an outbreak of avian flu, slumping confidence in government and a collapse in government revenues. But these setbacks are being dwarfed by this year's explosive outbreak of a new respiratory disease, which is spreading panic and rapidly undermining confidence in the future of one of the world's most dynamic cities.
 In a sign of just how far public confidence has fallen, crowds mobbed supermarkets today to buy up rice and other essentials in response to a rumor, spread partly by an Internet hoax, that the entire city would be labeled an "infected area" and face an international quarantine. The stock market fell, and the Hong Kong dollar came under pressure in currency markets as government officials went on television to deny the rumor and appeal for calm. 
 But such scenes, damaging to any locality, are devastating for a city that exists as the crossroads of Asia and a gateway to China.
Hong Kong has Asia's busiest airport for international passenger departures and international air freight. Its port handles more freight containers each year than any other port in the world.
The city's modern health, transportation and communications systems have helped induce nearly 1,000 multinational companies to put their regional headquarters here, creating an enormous service sector for the 100,000 expatriates who live here and even more who visit on business.
But it is precisely Hong Kong's position as a transportation hub and a desirable headquarters location that is now threatened by the outbreak of SARS, the severe acute respiratory syndrome. The disease has spread far faster here than anywhere else, partly because officials were slow to quarantine patients who then infected visitors.
Countries from Australia to the United States are actively discouraging their citizens from visiting, and a growing number are having doctors meet flights from here to assess the health of each passenger. (Today, an American Airlines flight from Tokyo was quarantined on the runway in San Jose, Calif., after two passengers and two crew members complained of SARS-like symptoms. A baby girl in Massachusetts was also thought to be suffering with the disease.) 
At the same time, many expatriate business people and affluent local residents are sending spouses and children to less disease-ridden cities elsewhere. Mark Simon, an American businessman here, has been performing the same calculations as many people with the financial wherewithal to leave. His 18-month-old son briefly needed hospital treatment for a minor illness before the current outbreak, and he worries whether quality medical care would be available for his son at this city's increasingly overburdened hospitals if a similar incident were to occur now.
So Mr. Simon's wife and son have moved into a hotel in Manila, and he worries that some companies may be less eager to invest here if it becomes harder to persuade employees to move here. "My wife won't come back until this is cleared up," he said, adding, "The spouses say, 'You dragged me out to Asia, and it was supposed to be safe.' "
Making matters worse, anyone who does fall ill with SARS is likely to be stuck here, most likely in one of the city's increasingly crowded pneumonia wards, where rows of patients lie curled up in balls on their beds, battling fever and chills. Medical evacuation, long offered by multinationals for overseas employees, has become virtually impossible. Commercial carriers are refusing to carry SARS patients under any circumstances, and even air ambulance services are now warning that they may not be able to move people with SARS.
International SOS, one of the world's largest medical evacuation and corporate security firms and the main provider of evacuations in Asia, is actively promoting its services now in Kuwait because of the war in Iraq, but it is virtually ignoring Hong Kong, a company spokeswoman said. Because of the difficulty in persuading governments and hospitals to accept SARS patients, as well as the uncertainty of how to transport them safely by air without infecting others, she said, "such patient movements are therefore unlikely."
A steady diet of similarly grim health news has emptied restaurants, hotels and shops as tourists flee and residents stay home. That has hurt the Hong Kong economy more than it would most Asian economies because most of the manufacturing that used to take place here has moved across the border to low-wage cities in mainland China.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL; 
Going Against the Grain

BYLINE:  By BILL PENNINGTON

DATELINE: AUBURN, Mass., March 27 

 BODY:
Although he has played baseball for most of his life, Drew Gribbons, a 16-year-old second baseman, had never held a wood bat in his hands. But because a ruling has led scores of Massachusetts high schools to ban metal baseball bats, Gribbons stood at home plate a few days ago swinging -- for the first time -- a polished piece of lumber.
 Gribbons might as well have been handed a Civil War musket. 
 "It stung my hands," Gribbons said with a look of bewilderment as he described wood meeting a baseball. "And the ball didn't go anywhere." 
Gribbons and most of his Auburn High School teammates are adjusting, even if it means aching hands and a loss of power. It is the rest of Massachusetts -- the first state to impose a wood-only rule after three decades of metal bat use at every level of youth baseball -- that is still in a state of bewilderment.
The movement back to wood bats, required only for the postseason this year but put into practice at most schools for the entire season, was prompted by safety concerns and a grass-roots urge to return to basics. Part legislative and part voluntary, it has fostered an ardent debate pitting coaches against school administrators and bat manufacturers against sports safety advocates. At the same time, baseball purists have been uplifted to see a rare reversal in the advance of technology.
The wood-versus-metal battle has evolved on philosophic and economic fronts, with entrenched camps disputing each other's data and motives, turning the discussion into something almost metaphysical, like the debate over global warming.
There is evidence that several other states are watching this wood bat experiment closely, wondering if it will, or should, spread. In Massachusetts, a state that considers itself the birthplace of the American Revolution, the crack -- and not the ping -- of the bat might become the shot heard round the sports world.
Or maybe not.
"We've broken three wood bats in practice already," Paul Fenton, the baseball coach at Auburn High School for 29 years, said in a Boston accent thick with disdain. "I'm sick of hearing about the crack of the bat. What if we run out of bats? Am I allowed to go into the other team's dugout and use their bats?"

Origins of Safety Concerns
Many trace the wood bat revolution in Massachusetts to a game in May 2001 in which Bill Hughto, a Wellesley High School pitcher, was struck in the temple by a line drive off a metal bat. Hughto had to be air-lifted by helicopter to a Boston hospital where he underwent emergency surgery for a clot on his brain. Although he was in a coma for days, Hughto recovered. His accident followed by several months another in eastern Massachusetts in which a high school pitcher sustained serious facial injuries when he was struck by a line drive off a metal bat.
The injuries emboldened a small group of coaches and wood-bat advocates in the state to press their case for a wood-only rule in high school baseball. Metal bats, they contended, were endangering players because pitched baseballs came off metal bats so quickly that the players did not have time to react. The wood bat advocates also believed the added firepower of metal bats was distorting the game with too much offense, turning legions of .220 hitters into .320 hitters.
Once referred to simply as aluminum bats -- and introduced because they did not break and, thus, saved youth baseball groups money -- metal bats are used by nearly everyone in baseball except Major League Baseball's players and minor leaguers. Metal bats are the choice of players in Little League Baseball and Softball, in high schools in 49 states, in the National Collegiate Athletic Association and in most recreational settings.
Aluminum bats are now commonly made of alloys and other high-tech materials. Few people question that they are easier to hit with, especially on mis-hits, when contact with the baseball or softball is made near the bat's handle or at its end. Few also question that players can hit the ball farther with metal bats -- indeed, that is how most metal bats have been marketed for decades. Several years ago, metal bats were particularly juiced, taking advantage of a trampoline effect at contact. There has been an effort to inhibit that effect, with restrictions, testing and certification guidelines.
More to the point, metal-bat proponents say, just because the baseball may go farther does not mean it injures more players in the field; they demand to see evidence that it does. In fact, there is no such irrefutable evidence, and organizations like Little League Baseball say injuries have diminished in the last 20 to 30 years, which has also been the growth period for metal bats.
"It is not a safety issue at all," said Jim Darby, vice president for promotions of Easton Sports, which makes wood and metal bats, and is one of the three major manufacturers of metal bats. "There are inherent risks to the sport, but aluminum bats are as safe as wood. We have data to back that up and everything else said about aluminum bats is anecdotal. In Massachusetts, they have no reason to force kids to use wood."
There has been no significant groundswell of opinion in the coaching ranks seeking change, although many college baseball coaches receive money and equipment from the bat companies. In Massachusetts, an informal survey by the state's baseball coaches association last year showed that 72 percent wanted to continue to use metal.
But the baseball committee of the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association was not swayed. On Oct. 31, 2002, after five hours of contentious debate -- one speaker had to be ejected from the building -- the committee voted, 9 to 6, to prohibit the use of metal bats in the state high school baseball tournament this spring.
Befitting the stormy nature of the issue, a number of public hearings and unexpected developments ensued. The state's sports medicine committee, which had originally recommended the switch to wood, reversed itself and concluded there was no safety risk associated with metal bats.
A task force was set up to determine whether there was a compelling safety hazard to justify an emergency rule change outlawing metal bats immediately, to take effect at the beginning of the regular season. The task force voted overwhelmingly against that measure, then it turned around and narrowly voted in favor of a recommendation asking the state's interscholastic board of directors to ban metal bats in the 2004 regular season.
That vote is scheduled for early May before the 17-member board of directors -- 16 of whom are principals or superintendents and not athletic department personnel.
Meanwhile, knowing that metal bats will be banned in postseason play this year, 21 Massachusetts baseball leagues voluntarily decided to switch to wood right away. Since four leagues had already voted to go to wood last season, that means 25 of the 40 Massachusetts high school leagues will be using wood when the season opens in early April.
That has far from quieted the public debate. At one of the public hearings, a coach rose to say that players from Massachusetts using wood bats would have lower batting averages, putting them at a disadvantage in the competition for college baseball scholarships.
A high school principal sitting on the panel overseeing the hearing responded, "I was not aware that was the reason we played high school baseball."

Fiscal Concerns
Other coaches said they feared financial difficulties if forced to use wood. The average high school team might have begun each season in the past by purchasing two metal bats at $250 each. Three dozen wood bats, an estimate for a full season, might cost $1,200.
Wood-bat advocates countered that most high school players (or their parents) buy their own bats. They would be relieved to be purchasing two or even three wood bats at $45 each instead of a high-end metal bat for $300. 
Some baseball coaches who are proponents of metal bats insisted that potential players would grow frustrated trying to hit with wood and quit the game.
"I'm worried about the future," said Frank Carey, the baseball coach at North Redding High School, who made an impassioned plea at the hearings. "Kids have trouble with failure and metal makes it easier to hit. Nobody likes to hit .200."
Alex Campea, the baseball coach at Catholic Memorial High School in West Roxbury, suggested that wood bats would improve the quality of games. "Those kids will also become better fielders and better bunters," Campea said. "We will have 2-1 games with speed and strategy. It's not supposed to be about who hits it farthest. We had too many 15-12 games. Those are football scores."
Back and forth they have argued, with those supporting metal bats waving studies proving that there is no real hazard or reason to change. The wood-bat proponents tend to contest that evidence with a more empirical view, contending that a specially engineered modern metal bat must deliver more force to a baseball than old-fashioned wood. And on the face of that, they say, is it safe for fielders who are waiting 60 feet away?
Bill Thurston, the baseball coach at Amherst College for nearly four decades, was for many years the rules editor of the N.C.A.A. baseball rules committee -- until he resigned three years ago, largely in protest over the association's unwillingness to vigorously examine metal bat safety. Thurston has compiled dozens of videotapes, mostly of pitchers being struck by batted balls -- teeth knocked out, jaws broken; the tapes were shown to Massachusetts officials until they felt compelled to cover their eyes.
"The bat manufacturers say there is no way to prove that these players wouldn't have been hit if the batter had been swinging a wood bat instead," Thurston said. "That's true. If I have a car accident going 70 miles an hour, I can't prove it wouldn't have happened if I were going 55 miles an hour. But I would like those chances."
For six years , Thurston has also done a statistical study of the Cape Cod League, where elite college players gather each summer in an all-star circuit that also serves as a showcase for major league scouts because the league uses only wood bats. Thurston has documented that players' batting averages in the league have declined an average of 91 points using wood bats, compared with their batting averages in their spring college season using metal bats. Home runs decreased by 61 percent and slugging percentage declined by an average of 190 points per player.
"What happened, they got weaker in the summer?" Thurston asked. "No, the wood bat is tougher to get started and tougher to control."
At Auburn High School, which is near Worcester in central Massachusetts, Fenton, the baseball coach, would hardly disagree. "But we don't use wood golf clubs anymore or peach baskets for the hoop in basketball, either," he said. "We change as equipment improves."
In the town of Randolph, 12 miles south of Boston, Steve Connors, a high school pitcher and first baseman, is more comfortable with the rhythms and nuances of a game played with wood bats.
"As a pitcher, when the bigger hitters were up with a metal bat, you thought about getting clobbered by a ball coming back at you," Connors said. "Now, maybe the ball doesn't go as far, but then, the fielders come in and you play a different game. It's real baseball."
Down the road, at the athletic powerhouse Catholic Memorial, Campea, the baseball coach, said he had scheduled two wood-only games with teams from Rhode Island, where metal is still the standard. "There is a lot of curiosity about this," Campea said. "I think other states might follow Massachusetts."
Carey, the coach in North Redding, has received different feedback. "I've gotten calls from coaches in Florida and Connecticut saying, 'What is wrong with you people up in Massachusetts?"' Carey said.
In Auburn, the baseball players had grown accustomed to baseballs flying 400 feet from home plate into the high school parking lot. But batting practice now often brings a few line drives and mostly catchable fly balls, with the occasional shot over an outfielder's head. As a group, the players seem split on the shift to wood. 
"We're all equal now," first baseman Adam Abderrazzaq said. "It's not the $350 bat hitting the ball, it's the player."
But Joe Germain, an outfielder, said: "The wood is not for me. I liked going up there hacking. Not now."
Drew Gribbons, meanwhile, has acquired batting gloves that he laces tightly, although he was still shaking the vibration and sting from his hands whenever he swung his new wood bat and missed the sweet spot.
"I'll get used to it," Gribbons said afterward, smiling. "Well, hopefully. I've got all year."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: THE HOME FRONT; 
Aching Town Rejoices When Soldier Is Found

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL with MONICA DAVEY 

DATELINE: PALESTINE, W.Va., Wednesday, April 2 

 BODY:
Deadra Lynch has been waiting by the telephone for nine days, wondering, she said Tuesday, whether it was going to bring good news or the worst possible information that a mother could hear.
 On Tuesday, Ms. Lynch said, she "got the telephone call I have been praying for." She learned that her daughter, 19-year-old Pfc. Jessica Dawn Lynch, an Army supply clerk who had been missing in action in Iraq, was alive and had been rescued in the vicinity of Nasiriya, near where her maintenance unit was last seen. 
 "It's just so exciting, overwhelming and exciting," Ms. Lynch said.
The news that the young woman was alive and safe sent Palestine, a tiny community 70 miles north of Charleston, into a frenzy. Ms. Lynch said that "everyone in town" was at the house and that they planned to celebrate all evening and early into the morning.
Her husband could barely contain his joy. "He just went crazy, screaming and yelling: Thank God! Thank God!" said Glenn Cogar, a family friend who was seated in the Lynches' living room when the Army rang with the news. "Everyone in that room just went crazy," Mr. Cogar said. "We were all just stunned. Everyone started crying and screaming. There won't be much sleeping around here tonight."
Details of what happened to Private Lynch were scarce. An Army official said Tuesday night that Private Lynch had been shot multiple times. The official said that it had not been determined whether she was shot during the rescue attempt or before it.
In Doha, Qatar, an official with Central Command said Private Lynch was found in the Saddam Hospital in Nasiriya, which was also being used as an Iraqi military facility.
Ms. Lynch said the military officials and others who called to provide scraps of information about the rescue said the effort to save her daughter was based on intelligence that had been gleaned from collaborators in Nasiriya.
Her mother said she was told her daughter had been wounded, but not seriously.
As the news spread, fire trucks and police cars, with sirens blaring, whipped around the hilly roads near Palestine, where Jessica Lynch grew up. Scores of pickup trucks and cars joined in the impromptu parade. Her old friends set off firecrackers. Church bells chimed. 
 About two dozen friends and relatives of Greg and Deadra Lynch gathered on the porch and in the front room of the two-story wood frame house one mile up Maybury Run Hollow.
In addition to the yellow ribbon tied around the Lynch family's mailbox, a strip of yellow crime scene tape was stretched across the driveway where two Wirt County deputies politely, but firmly, told uninvited visitors to wait until Wednesday morning before questioning family members about Private Lynch.
"I've always believed in the power of prayer," said Rodney Holbert, of nearby Elizabeth, whose wife is a cousin of the Lynches. "But this makes my belief even stronger."
Mr. Holbert arrived at the Lynches' house after attending a church meeting where he heard the news of Private Lynch's release.
"Everyone at the church was happy," he said. "But mainly they were crying."
Word of Private Lynch's release spread quickly through Elizabeth, Wirt County's only incorporated town, five miles to the north.
"Everyone's ecstatic," said Rose Ruble, manager of Hill's Exxon.
"People everywhere prayed for her," Ms. Ruble said. "I guess God's still in the miracle business."
 Ms. Lynch, who had complained to Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, last week that military officials were not doing enough to keep the family informed, now had nothing but praise for their efforts.
 "I just want to thank everybody for their prayers and their concern," she said. "Everybody has just been wonderful."
 When she joined the military in 2001, Private Lynch was a senior in high school. She followed in the footsteps of her father and brother, Gregory Jr., who is stationed at Fort Bragg, N.C., in the Army. 
Friends and relatives say she enlisted because of the lack of opportunities in this tiny impoverished community where the unemployment rate of 15 percent was the highest in the state.
Private Lynch, friends and relatives said, saw the Army as a means to pay for a college education that would allow her to teach in an elementary school.
Her kindergarten teacher, Linda Davies, described her as a shy 5-year-old who had developed into a "tough, competent lady" who is "excited about what she's doing." 
Ms. Davies expressed optimism last week. "Jessica is looking forward to coming and taking my place and teaching one of these days," she said hopefully, "and I'm looking forward to that, too."

HEADLINE: Turk Says He'll Try Again to Reunite Cyprus 

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, April 1 

 BODY:
Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said today that he was beginning a new effort to reunite the Turkish and Greek sectors of Cyprus, a development that could enhance Turkey's frustrated bid to join the European Union.
 Mr. Erdogan said that his foreign minister, Abdullah Gul, would visit Cyprus on Thursday to talk with Turkish Cypriot leaders, and that he and Mr. Gul would discuss the issue with Greek leaders at a Balkans summit meeting in Belgrade next week. 
 "We're not about to give up on searching for a solution," Mr. Erdogan told lawmakers here today, referring to the collapse last month of a reunification deal promoted by Kofi Annan, the secretary general of the United Nations.
"We want to make new initiatives, new openings," the prime minister said.
He did not provide any details on what Turkey would propose or how it would differ from the United Nations plan, which called for two "constituent" states under a central government in charge of foreign policy. Both Turkish and Greek Cypriot leaders rejected that settlement.
But the deadlock was attributed largely to Turkey, and European Union officials have said that in the absence of a settlement, the union will admit only the Greek part of Cyprus next year, when 10 new countries are scheduled to join.
If that happens, it would diminish Turkey's chances of future membership. Turkey has not yet been given a firm start date for membership talks and already faces plenty of obstacles.
European Union officials have long complained about Turkey's record on human rights, especially its treatment of ethnic Kurds, and are watching closely for any movement by Turkish troops into the Kurdish region of Iraq during the war there. They have warned those troops away, saying Turkey's future membership in the union could be at stake.
At the same time, the war has badly damaged Turkey's relationship with the United States, leaving the country's Western alliances on shaky ground.
Mr. Erdogan's announcement about Cyprus was a public signal of discomfort with that, and it raised the possibility that Turkey's rift with the United States would prod it to reach out more aggressively to Europe.
"If Turkey manages to alienate both the E.U. and the U.S., then it's got no friends at all in the world," said Heather Grabbe, an expert on European expansion at the Center for European Reform in London.
"Turkey doesn't have a lot of friends to play with," Ms. Grabbe said. "It's a really critical moment, when Turks have decisions to make about how their future foreign policy is going to work."
While Turkish Cypriots seem to be strongly in favor of the reunification of Cyprus, which has been divided since 1974, the Turkish Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktash, has been an obstacle.
Mr. Denktash has long been supported by Turkey's powerful generals, who see Cyprus as strategically valuable and are not close to Mr. Erdogan.
"There will be strong resistance to resolving this problem," said Rusen Cakir, a Turkish political analyst.

Shares Rise on Expectations of Strong Growth After War

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks rose for the first trading day in five yesterday as some investors speculated that economic growth would accelerate once the war with Iraq ends.
 Shares of SBC Communications gained on reports that it would not bid for the DirecTV satellite television unit of General Motors. Shares of Concord EFS, which owns a large network of automated teller machines, surged on speculation the company was in talks to be acquired by First Data, a processor of credit card transactions. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 10.30 points, or 1.2 percent, to 858.48. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 77.73 points, or 1 percent, to 8,069.86, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 7.13 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,348.30. 
Benchmark indexes dropped the last four trading days on concern the war would last months and was already curbing business spending.
"There are no indications that things will soften a great deal more from here," said Peter Conrad, an analyst at Kopp Investment Advisors, which oversees about $1.5 billion. "We're close to a bottom, and it's just a question of when things start to turn."
Stocks extended gains after Iraq's information minister appeared on television in place of Saddam Hussein, who had been scheduled to speak. The Iraqi leader's absence renewed speculation among some investors that Mr. Hussein had been killed or injured,
"We were expecting Saddam Hussein to speak," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. His absence "increased the confidence of folks who are in the camp that maybe he's no longer with us."
SBC was among the gainers, jumping $1.32, to $21.38. Since its interest in DirecTV first surfaced, its stock had slid 20 percent on concern the purchase would increase its debt.
Concord EFS rose $2.47, to $11.87, while First Data sank $2.33, to $34.68. First Data is said to be considering paying as much as $7 billion, a third above Concord EFS's value at the close of trading on Monday.
ICN Pharmaceuticals gained $1.59, to $10.50. Some doctors have sought to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, with ribavirin, a hepatitis treatment made by the ICN unit Ribapharm Inc. The illness has infected at least 1,804 people in 17 countries, killing 62, the World Health Organization said.
AMR climbed 90 cents, to $3, giving it a two-day gain of 90 percent. The company's American Airlines unit said it would reduce pilot pay by 23 percent and cut 2,500 jobs to help avoid bankruptcy.
The Altria Group, the parent of Philip Morris USA, was among the losers. Its shares slumped $1.86, to $28.10, affecting both the Dow and the S.& P. 500. Philip Morris failed to reach a compromise with a lawyer for plaintiffs to reduce a $12 billion deposit required to appeal a verdict over deceptive advertising.
Stocks briefly erased their gains after an industry report at 10 a.m. showed manufacturing contracted in March for the first time in five months. The Institute for Supply Management's factory index declined to 46.2 from 50.5 in February as production slowed because of waning consumer confidence as war approached.
The bond market retreated on the stock market's gains. The benchmark 10-year note fell 3/32, to a price of 100 17/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.81 percent from 3.80 percent Monday. The 30-year bond also dropped 3/32, to 108 13/32. Its yield climbed to 4.83 percent from 4.82 percent Monday.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a four-week bill:

HEADLINE: Report Said Directors of Union-Owned Insurer Should Return Unfair Trading Profits 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
A long-suppressed investigative report has concluded there was compelling evidence that many officers and directors of Ullico, a union-owned insurer, had enriched themselves at the expense of shareholders and should return more than $6 million in profits they made from trading the company's stock.
 The report, prepared by James R. Thompson, the former governor of Illinois and a special outside counsel to Ullico, singled out Ullico's chairman and chief executive, Robert A. Georgine, saying he netted another $6 million in trading profits and arguably awarded large amounts of stock to himself without proper authorizations. 
 The Ullico affair has become a stinging embarrassment to the labor movement because it is seen as an example of how some union leaders put their own financial interests above those of their unions and union members. Labor unions and their pension funds own almost all of Ullico's stock. 
 On March 25, a special advisory committee to Ullico's board, acting at Mr. Georgine's behest, rejected Mr. Thompson's advice and voted 6 to 2 against requiring directors who engaged in the stock trades to surrender their profits. The special committee also concluded that the directors who traded Ullico stock had done nothing wrong.
 Mr. Georgine, who is also trying to reverse Ullico's financial crisis, seized on the committee's vote as vindication. "I am pleased the special committee has concluded that there was no wrongdoing by any corporate officer or member of the board," he said on Friday.
 The Thompson report found that the officers and directors who traded Ullico stock, many of them current or former union presidents, had breached their fiduciary duties and probably violated some states' securities laws. That finding was seconded by an expert on state securities laws hired by Mr. Thompson, Mark A. Sargent, dean of Villanova University Law School. 
 Mr. Thompson concluded that no Ullico directors or officers had violated criminal laws because he found no evidence of criminal intent, even though he found they had improperly favored themselves in financial transactions. The Ullico trades are being investigated by the United States attorney in Washington, the Department of Labor and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Five labor leaders have quit Ullico's board, upset that the board was not dealing with the scandal more aggressively. John J. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, quit in December, and last Friday, John J. Wilhelm, president of the hotel employees, resigned. Mr. Wilhelm was one of the two directors on the special committee to vote to require that the directors surrender their profits. The other was Terence O'Sullivan, president of the laborers.
 The Ullico board decided to keep the Thompson report confidential and not distribute it to shareholders after it was completed last November. But last Friday, Ullico's board, under pressure from shareholders, said it would release the report to shareholders this week. One shareholder made the 138-page report available to The New York Times. 
 A Ullico spokesman said yesterday that Mr. Georgine would not comment on the report. But a person who attends Ullico board meetings and spoke on condition of anonymity defended Mr. Georgine and the Ullico board, noting that the Thompson report found neither criminal violations nor violations of federal securities law.
 The person said that Mr. Thompson was wrong to conclude that Ullico's directors had violated their fiduciary duties under the laws of Maryland, where Ullico is incorporated. The person said Ullico's board had acted on the advice of two respected law firms, Arnold and Porter and LeBoeuf Lamb.
 The report also noted that from 1999 to 2001 Mr. Georgine's total compensation was $10.7 million, including salary and stock sales from deferred compensation.
 The Thompson report found that Jake West, former president of the iron workers, made $837,760 in pretax profits selling Ullico stock, while Bill Casstevens, former secretary-treasurer of the auto workers, made $603,080. Martin Maddaloni, president of the plumbers, made $418,880 in pretax profits, the report found, as did Douglas McCarron, president of the carpenters. Mr. McCarron has quit Ullico's board and agreed to return his profits. 
 Last Friday, in announcing plans to release the report, Mr. Georgine said, "With the steps we are taking today, we can put these allegations of wrongdoing behind us and move forward to continue to provide our customers with the highest quality products and services." 
 In December 1999, Mr. Georgine invited Ullico directors to buy up to 4,000 company shares each at $53.94 a share. It then seemed inevitable that the stock would rise because Ullico owned many shares of Global Crossing, a telecommunications company whose stock was soaring. In May 2000, Ullico's board raised the share price to $146, though Global Crossing shares had fallen nearly 50 percent. In November 2000, Ullico's board approved a stock repurchase at $146 a share, enabling directors to sell all or almost all their shares, while letting the shareholding unions sell only a small fraction.
 Mr. Georgine and several other Ullico directors sold at $146, for a profit of $92 a share. Six months later the board lowered the price to $74.
 The report noted that the officers and directors owned 1.83 percent of the stock, but in the repurchase program got 31 percent of the proceeds. 
 "The November 2000 stock repurchase program failed to treat all shareholders equally and indeed greatly favored the very people, Ullico's directors and officers, who had formulated, approved and implemented the program," the report concluded. 
 The report said investigators were "unable to discern the precise business purpose" for the repurchase plan and noted that these offers carried "virtually no risk" and were "poorly suited" to align directors' and shareholders' interests.
 Mr. Thompson found that Ullico's officers and directors may have violated securities laws by making material misstatements or omissions regarding its stock repurchase offer. The report said the board's compensation committee had approved the repurchase plan even though its members were prohibited from deciding any matter relating to their compensation.

Tobacco Bond Sale Delayed After Moody's Downgrade
Virginia delayed the closing of a $767 million tobacco bond sale after Moody's Investors Service cut the ratings on $18 billion in similar bonds.
 The market for municipal bonds backed by revenue from the states' settlement with the tobacco companies is faltering because of concerns the tobacco businesses may not be able to pay. The downgrade by Moody's followed warnings from Philip Morris, a division of Altria, that it could not afford to post a $12 billion bond to appeal an Illinois court decision. Page C9.

HEADLINE: Queens Politicians Oppose Airport-Trade Center Land Swap 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Few people in Queens took it seriously last summer when the Bloomberg administration proposed swapping the land beneath Kennedy and La Guardia Airports for the World Trade Center property.
 But now that the city appears to be inching closer to a deal with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site, residents near the airports and local politicians are crying sellout. 
 City Hall would be giving up control of two of the "potentially greatest economic assets" of the city, Helen M. Marshall, borough president in Queens, said in a letter to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg on Monday.
The city would give the Port Authority the 5,610 acres beneath the two city airports in exchange for the 16-acre trade center site and more than $700 million it desperately wants for its budget. The Port Authority, which is run by commissioners from New York and New Jersey, operates the airports, but leases the land from the city. If an agreement is reached, it is still weeks or months away, but city and state officials say momentum for a swap is growing. 
"We're talking about nothing short of selling out Queens," said State Assemblyman Michael N. Gianaris, who represents Astoria and Long Island City, neighborhoods just west of La Guardia Airport. "We're ceding control of a huge chunk of Queens County to New Jersey."
On Monday, Mr. Gianaris, Assemblyman Barry S. Grodenchik and four of their colleagues introduced a bill in the Assembly that would block the city from transferring or selling airport land. They say a companion bill will be filed in the Senate.
"I think it's the worst land deal since the Indians sold Manhattan," Mr. Grodenchik said. "I don't understand why we would give up almost 10 percent of the county of Queens, and put the airports under the control of an authority, half of whose directors are from New Jersey. They'd have no reason to deal with us because we no longer own the land."
Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff has said the city would continue to play a role in the Port Authority's plans for the airports, despite the sale of the land. The city would also gain control over the development of the trade center site, an important swath of Lower Manhattan, Mr. Doctoroff said, as well as the insurance proceeds from the attack on the trade center and $120 million a year in rent from the developer who leases the commercial portion of the trade center.
The city has long complained about the rent it receives from the Port Authority for use of the airports and the fees from the trade center site. Although the airports generated a net income of $188.4 million in 2001, the authority paid only $13.3 million in rent. Last year, that dropped to $3.5 million. At one time, the city sought to raise the rent as high as $80 million a year.
Queens politicians and other critics of the deal agreed that the Port Authority had grossly underpaid the city. But they said Mayor Bloomberg should negotiate for a higher rent rather than sell the land for a one-time windfall.
"It's an act of folly by people who think there's a big payoff in the World Trade Center site," said Henry J. Stern, the former commissioner of the city's Parks Department. "It's a dry hole as far as revenue is concerned because of the monuments and the demand for open space and cultural institutions."
Hugh O'Neil, a former Port Authority executive, also questioned the economic wisdom of the deal.
"The city is in effect trading off a long-term increase in revenues from the airports for greater control over the trade center site and a one-shot contribution to its budgetary problem," said Mr. O'Neil, an economic development consultant. "The city's making a series of assumptions about what it gets out of the deal that I'm not certain about."

HEADLINE: Drastic Backup City Budget Has Up to 15,000 Layoffs 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration is drafting a drastic backup budget plan calling for another billion dollars in cuts and as many as 15,000 layoffs in case the city does not win the help it wants from Albany and the unions, city officials said yesterday.
 The city's fiscal picture has gone from bleak to bleaker in recent months. A deadline for winning concessions from the city's unions passed yesterday with no agreement. Gov. George E. Pataki's preliminary budget not only would not give the city most of the help it requested, but proposed cutting state education aid to the city. And city officials fear that the economy could be further depressed by the war in Iraq. 
 Several fiscal monitors have cautioned recently that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's preliminary budget plan was overly reliant on help from outside sources -- including Albany, Washington and the unions -- that may not materialize. But the city has a deficit of $3 billion to $4 billion in the fiscal year beginning in just three months, on July 1. So the Bloomberg administration has begun making a Plan B.
"It would be totally irresponsible if we didn't constantly look at every agency and say, if something worse than what we have currently budgeted were to occur, how would you react?" Mayor Bloomberg said at a news conference at Police Headquarters. "You don't want to wait until the event occurs to discuss a reaction. You want to do that now."
Administration officials said that they were simply being prudent by coming up with a fallback plan in case things do not go their way. But other fiscal monitors and budget experts suggested that having the backup plan could also be a tactical step: a way of pressuring the unions and Albany into cooperating by putting the onus of drastic cuts on them.
The mayor danced around the question of layoffs, telling reporters that they would have to wait until he releases his next budget proposal on April 15 to see what it includes. But other city officials said yesterday that the total number of layoffs in the budget proposal, with the contingency plan, could reach 15,000, the most the city has faced in decades.
This is already the second contingency plan of this budget cycle. In February, Mayor Bloomberg called on city agencies to come up with $600 million in contingency cuts in case the city did not get the $600 million in union concessions that it is seeking. But as the economy continued to stall and tax collections fell further below expectations, the mayor said the city would need to make the $600 million in cuts in any case.
"The bottom line is, the $600 million that we said we were going to cut is not the only cuts that we need in order to balance the budget," the mayor said yesterday.
One city official said yesterday that the administration expected the $600 million cut to include around 5,000 layoffs. A $1 billion contingency cut, the official said, could include 5,000 to 10,000 more layoffs.
In past rounds of cuts, the Office of Management and Budget sent letters to city agencies asking for suggested cuts and then spent weeks negotiating cuts with each agency. This time there was no letter, and city officials said there would be few negotiations: the budget analysts would tell agency officials what to cut.
The unions are already preparing to fight layoffs. District Council 37, the largest municipal union, plans a rally on April 29 to protest the layoffs that have yet to be announced. 
"Our jobs, our pay and our benefits are all in the gravest danger we have faced since the mid-1970's, when more than 50,000 city employees lost their jobs," Lillian Roberts, the union's executive director, wrote recently in a union newspaper. 
Several fiscal monitors have recently warned that the mayor's budget plan relied too much on help from outside parties. The New York State Financial Control Board, which can take over the city's finances if the city ends a year in the red, estimated that the city was counting on outside sources to close $2.9 billion of a $3.4 billion deficit.
The biggest piece of that is the nearly $1 billion that the mayor hopes to net from a commuter tax. That tax is opposed by Governor Pataki and the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, whose permission would be needed to enact it. The governor's budget plan calls for cutting aid to city schools by $450 million.
The City Council speaker, Gifford Miller, said the contingency plan showed how important it is for Albany and Washington to help the city.
"I think he's underlining the point that I've been making all along," Mr. Miller said. "Unless we can get significant help from the federal and state governments, the city is in really dire straits. We've cut our budget significantly already, we've raised taxes already, and we are still way behind the eight ball because the state and federal governments take more from the city than they give back." 
Mayor Bloomberg said that he was still counting on winning permission to impose a commuter tax, but that he had to have a fallback.
"The current operating thesis is that we will get from Albany permission to raise taxes and bring in roughly a billion dollars," he said. "It assumes that there are no cuts in aid from Albany. That was the last time we published a budget, which was before the governor published his. We have to come up with a budget that deals with a variety of potential outcomes of the discussion between the governor and the Albany Legislature."
Asked yesterday about the contingency cuts that could be needed if the commuter tax is not approved, Senator Bruno said, "Well, he's managing the affairs of the city as best he can, and we want to be supportive as best we can."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: ESTRANGED ALLIES; 
Europe Assesses Damage To Western Relationships And Takes Steps to Rebuild

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: PARIS, April 1 

 BODY:
European governments, reeling from the political earthquake the war in Iraq touched off on their own Continent, are struggling to dig out from the rubble and rebuild relationships with the United States and among themselves.
 The war has estranged the United States from the antiwar group led by France and Germany, and has led to denunciations of Washington by Russia, which the Bush administration had regarded as a firm friend. It also has fractured Europe itself, with Britain and Spain the most prominent European countries supporting the Bush administration's decision to go to war. 
 While no one in Europe is predicting the death of NATO or the European Union, the damage is evident in the renewed willingness of Germany and France to consider a military policy separate from either institution. But the larger obstacle may be the widespread perception across the Continent that a political Rubicon has been crossed, and that divisions will not be bridged easily, or soon. 
Yet governments are beginning to mend relations because they have to. In France, Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin said his government was re-engaging with Britain as a first step toward finding common ground with the United States.
"There is a temptation to caricature our relationship with Britain, but the reality is more complex," Mr. de Villepin said in a telephone interview on Monday. "Our priority is to reforge our relationship with Britain based on areas of agreement and then try to do the same thing with the United States."
Mr. de Villepin identified three areas of agreement with Britain: the future reconstruction of Iraq through the United Nations, moving forward urgently on the "road map" for an Israeli-Palestinian peace and the continued process of European unification. And he proposed high-level discussions between the United States and Europe to focus on the spread of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, the Middle East and religious radicalism.
Elysee Palace has ordered French officials not to criticize America's conduct of the war in Iraq. Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin told Parliament today that "it is indispensable to be vigilant against all displays of anti-Americanism, which would be unacceptable."
Mr. de Villepin and the French president, Jacques Chirac, have taken the position that the strains between Paris and Washington are only temporary. They dismiss the American-led campaign to boycott French products, and ignore personal insults like the current campaign by New Orleans politicians to cancel an invitation to Mr. Chirac to a re-enactment in December of the Louisiana Purchase from France 200 years ago.
"I am not worried that the differences cannot be overcome because we are friends and allies and that will not change," Mr. Villepin said. "Our relationship with the United States is irreplaceable."
But many other voices in Europe speak with a greater sense of alarm. "This is a watershed moment, as crucial as Suez," said Daniel Gros, director of the Brussels-based Center for European Policy Studies. The 1956 Suez crisis, when Britain and France seized the Suez Canal from Egypt only to be pressured by the United States into a withdrawal, was the first major postwar milestone for American-European relations.
Like the French, the Germans are pursuing two tracks simultaneously. Chancellor Gerhard Schroder's top aides are strategizing about ways for Germany to take part in the postwar reconstruction of Iraq, which they see as part of an effort to reassert the German-American alliance.
Meanwhile, Mr. Schroder is making bold public statements about the lessons of the failure to prevent war in Iraq and has developed a concept of "core Europe" or "more Europe" in which France and Germany, but not Britain, will lead Western Europe toward a common defense and foreign policy.
The first test of this concept is the meeting scheduled for April 29, when Germany and France, along with Belgium and Luxembourg, are to discuss closer military cooperation. Backers of the war including Britain, Italy and Spain were not invited, a snub that can only deepen the rift within the European Union, which has thus far failed to make headway on its grand vision of a common foreign and defense policy, including a joint rapid reaction military force of 60,000 soldiers.
"This meeting is a mistake and risks accentuating the divergences between partners," Italy's European affairs minister, Rocco Buttiglione, was quoted as saying in the French newspaper La Tribune today.
French officials said today that the meeting should be opened to others, and Britain has signaled that it would attend if it was a European Union-wide affair. In the interview on Monday, Mr. de Villepin insisted: "We are not creating new alliances. The Franco-German relationship is at the heart of European unification. It's not Europe against the United States."
The trip scheduled by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to the European Union and NATO headquarters in Brussels on Thursday is seen here as a welcome first step toward repairing ties with Europe and a test of whether America really cares about it.
But European officials agree that the Bush administration does not seem to be aware of the seriousness of the trans-Atlantic divide. Last week in Brussels, Alan Larson, the under secretary of state for economic affairs, predicted that the damage to the alliance would be temporary, European officials said.
He was trying "to put a positive face on it, saying, 'For goodness' sake, let's recognize all the things we share,' " a European official said. "We replied that unfortunately, on the contrary, this is a watershed moment in the Atlantic alliance, in Europe and in Washington as well."
European officials have scoffed at Mr. Powell's characterization of the role of the United Nations in the reconstruction of Iraq as that of a "chapeau" (the French word for hat) that would give legitimacy to American decisions, and a "vessel" through which international aid could be funneled.
"Some of the damage in the trans-Atlantic relationship can be repaired if the United Nations plays the lead role in Iraq's reconstruction," a senior European Union official said. "That simply won't happen if the United States thinks the U.N. is merely a chapeau for an entirely American-run operation."
In Britain, meanwhile, there is great apprehension over the damage done to European unity and the trans-Atlantic alliance and a deep awareness that there needs to be postwar reconstruction both in Europe and across the Atlantic.
The British prime minister, Tony Blair, who has argued repeatedly that Britain is well placed to "bridge" the Atlantic, told a Downing Street news conference last week that there would need to be a postwar "reckoning" between the United States and Europe and among the bickering nations of Europe itself.
Much as he might be out of favor at the moment on the Continent, Mr. Blair is seen by some as the essential mediator between the United States and its estranged allies.
European governments, wrote the British columnist William Rees-Mogg, "know that Europe will have to do business with the United States, which is the European Union's most important trading partner."
"They know that the Iraq war, and the behavior of France on the U.N. Security Council, have brought U.S.-European relations to their worst state since 1945," he wrote. "They know that these relations will have to be repaired. And now they know that Tony Blair is the only European leader with any chance of restoring them."
A poll of Germans this month indicated that only 11 percent consider the United States to be the best friend of Germany, down from 50 percent in 1995. By contrast, 30 percent consider France to be Germany's best friend, up from 17 percent in 1995.
The raw feelings of the French public are also evident in a poll published in Le Monde today. It found that only 53 percent favored an British-American victory over Iraq, while 33 percent are either strongly or somewhat opposed to such an outcome.
It is trends like these that have motivated Mr. Schroder to talk of the need for "more Europe." Among the ideas that are being aired in Germany are moving forward in a concrete way to create the European rapid reaction force that was agreed to, but never acted on, at the European Union summit in 1999; ending conscription in Germany and instituting a professional army; and planning for European military integration.
What is needed now, said Mr. Gros of the Center for European Policy Studies, is "a European politician with some vision who comes up and says to everyone in Europe, 'Put together one percent of your G.D.P. for a common strike force.' That would mean $80 billion to $100 billion. We could do something with that."

HEADLINE: A Catalog Entrepreneur Takes the New York Test 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER HAWTHORNE 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
THE topic at Rob Forbes's penthouse on Russian Hill here was supposed to be furniture: to be exact, how Mr. Forbes was planning to fill his converted ballroom atop a building from the 1920's. Given Mr. Forbes's credentials -- he is founder of Design Within Reach, the Internet and catalog retailer of modern furniture whose first New York outlet opened on Saturday -- it seemed reasonable to expect that he might turn his 2,200-square-foot apartment, bought at the end of last year, into a high-design laboratory.
 But Mr. Forbes, 51, a potter with an M.B.A. from Stanford, explained that he was concentrating on living in the apartment for a while and absorbing its stunning view of skyscrapers, the Golden Gate and Bay Bridges, sailboats and the distant green hills of Berkeley and Oakland. 
 Six weeks after he had moved in, the penthouse was still a little bare, offering a mixture of ad hoc chic and bachelor-pad minimalism. Mr. Forbes had installed some of his own vintage pieces (a small table and chairs by Alvar Aalto, a bench by Hugh Acton and a pair of Pelican chairs by the Danish designer Finn Juhl) and reproductions, including a Noguchi sofa and a red table by Piero Lissoni. 
"You know, I really like this place without anything in it," he said. "The space and the view are luxuries on their own."
Mr. Forbes and his partners take a decidedly more aggressive approach to running Design Within Reach, which offers midcentury classics and pieces by younger designers and has expanded rapidly since its founding. Indeed, even as Design Within Reach continues its Web site (www.dwr.com) and its catalogs -- sending out more than 500,000 each month -- the company has pursued an ambitious expansion into retail outlets over the last 18 months. The 10th Design Within Reach store is a 3,500-square-foot split-level space on Wooster Street in Manhattan designed by the architect Alberto Rivera, who also oversaw the company's new studio in Beverly Hills. Another New York store, in the meatpacking district, and two locations in Florida are also planned.
The stores represent a shift in strategy for a company founded as a streamlined New Economy business in San Francisco in 1999, in the midst of dot-com mania in the Bay Area. Wayne L. Badovinus, chief executive of Design Within Reach, who met Mr. Forbes while both were working for Williams-Sonoma, the housewares company, in the early 1980's, said they had vowed that "we weren't going into the bricks and mortar business."
Mr. Forbes said: "It turns out that a lot of people just like talking to people and the eye contact instead of filling in forms online. For many people, the activity of shopping is a huge pleasure."
The new Design Within Reach stores appear at a time Mr. Forbes's own profile is rising. Last year he joined the executive board of the International Design Conference in Aspen and served as a juror for Cooper-Hewitt's national design awards and for I.D. magazine's annual design review; he is an increasingly visible presence on the furniture fair circuit.
The Design Within Reach catalog includes an ever-shifting cast of new discoveries to go with its standbys by Ray and Charles Eames and Philippe Starck, reflecting the fruits of Mr. Forbes's frequent research trips. Jennifer Carpenter of Truck Product Architecture in New York said that even when the company was developing its earliest furniture designs, she hoped for a deal with Design Within Reach, as opposed to bigger retailers. Truck Product signed an exclusive deal with the company this year to carry two versions of its 2-Way table, which features a powder-coated lacquer top and a reversible plywood base.
"My goal, absolutely, was Design Within Reach," said Ms. Carpenter. "It's a well-edited collection, full of things that when I was practicing as an architect, I would have specced for a job."
What the company buys, she said, is news in the design world. "I've found that people read the catalog like a magazine," she said. "And every architect I know gets it."
Design Within Reach, whose original backers include Reed Business Information, the publisher of Interior Design magazine, and Jesse Hansen & Co., a San Francisco equity firm, is privately held. Mr. Badovinus declined to say if the company is profitable but confirmed that sales have increased by at least 50 percent in each of the last three years, to about $60 million in 2002.
Despite that growth, the move to New York is a risky one. Their DWR Studio at 142 Wooster Street, near Prince Street, is already open; a sister store is scheduled to open in May at 408 West 14th Street, near Ninth Avenue and the new Vitra store. But Design Within Reach is entering Manhattan in a sluggish economy and a war in Iraq and in the wake of several recent signs of trouble in the furniture business. Herman Miller Inc., based in Michigan, had a 34 percent drop in sales in its 2002 fiscal year, and shuttered its modestly priced Herman Miller Red line.
Other casualties include the modern-furniture retailer Palazzetti, which declared bankruptcy last month after 22 years in business, and Full Upright Position, an online and catalog retailer that provided early competition for Design Within Reach. Sergio Palazzetti, the founder of the Palazzetti chain, worried about the chances of Design Within Reach succeeding with retail outlets. "They were successful because they had no stores," he said, "no overhead. There are problems to opening a chain of stores and managing locations from a distance. They're changing their formula."
There are signs, meanwhile, that the revival of midcentury modernism may be tapering off, replaced by a taste for more daring and eclecticism in interior design.
"It's a really tough time in the industry," Mr. Forbes acknowledged. "But we think there's a healthy discipline in operating in an economy where things don't come easily." He also suggested that a retail niche big enough to drive an Airstream trailer through remains between the mass market offerings of Ikea and Pottery Barn and high-design boutiques like Moss and outlets of European manufacturers like Kartell and Vitra. Or for that matter like Palazzetti.
Even as it seeks a broader public profile with its retail outlets, Design Within Reach is hoping to solidify its relationship with professionals. This month it is introducing services under the Profile name aimed at professional designers, architects and decorators, a group the company estimates accounts for about half its sales. A new annual catalog, called Profile Workbook, will offer more product details and fewer glamour photographs of the furniture. It will be accompanied by a second DWR Web site (www.dwrprofile.com) and a chatty, tabloid-size magazine, both of which are pitched to the trade. "We think if we lose that sense of direct connection with professionals, we diminish our place in the market," Mr. Badovinus said.
With its $3,795 sofas and $2,300 credenzas, Design Within Reach does not exactly offer rock-bottom prices; indeed, some younger fans of the company in California have nicknamed it DNQWR, for Design Not Quite Within Reach. But the company's combination of competitive pricing and ready-to-ship inventory has helped set it apart.
Keven Wilder, a retail consultant in Chicago, praised the company's strategy. She drew a distinction between the old-school approach to modern furniture, "where you order it and put a chunk of money down and you wait," and a new model, practiced by Design Within Reach, aimed at a younger and less patient consumer. "These days, especially if people are ordering online, they want it right away," Ms. Wilder said.
In its effort to sell classics of midcentury design at relatively low prices, Design Within Reach has navigated some tricky byways of the furniture business. One example is the steel and leather chair created by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe for the German Pavilion at the 1929 International Exhibition in Barcelona. 
Knoll, based in Pennsylvania, has been the licensed manufacturer of the chair since 1948, and holds a trademark on the Barcelona name. But the design itself reverted to the public domain more than five decades ago.
Manufacturers argue that unlicensed versions of well-known designs cost them millions in revenue each year. In 1998, Herman Miller sued Palazzetti over a famous lounge chair and ottoman by Charles and Ray Eames. A court ruled that Palazzetti could legally sell the chair, but not under the Eames name. Design Within Reach sells a version of the Mies Barcelona chair that is not manufactured by Knoll -- Mr. Forbes says it is made in an Italian factory -- and sidesteps the trademark issue by calling it the Pavilion chair. The Knoll Barcelona chair can sell for $4,500 and take 12 to 14 weeks to be delivered. Design Within Reach charges $1,995 for its Pavilion chair, and ships it within two to four weeks from its warehouse in Union City, Calif.
"We think people come to Knoll for that chair because we worked with Mies and have been careful to conform to the original specifications," said Liz Needle, general manager of Knoll Studio. "Is it frustrating that people sometimes don't buy Knoll quality but think that's what they're getting? Sure."
Mr. Forbes defends the craftsmanship of his company's Mies chair. He adds that while he was unable to strike a deal with Knoll to carry its products, he has done so with Herman Miller and other well-known manufacturers.
A weekly e-mail newsletter sent to 170,000 subscribers has helped create Mr. Forbes's persona, which hovers somewhere between fan and tastemaker. The electronic dispatches detail his trips to European furniture fairs and architectural landmarks and his visits with designers around the world. Last month, for example, he wrote about chatting with the German lighting designer Ingo Maurer in an Italian trattoria.
Mr. Badovinus, who maintains a low public profile compared with Mr. Forbes, said that the company's customers had responded warmly to Mr. Forbes and his efforts. "Sometimes modern design can seem cold or hard-edged," he said, "and Rob helps soften that. In essence what he's saying is, 'I'm a design enthusiast, you're a design enthusiast, and isn't this stuff cool?' "
That attitude was certainly on view in Mr. Forbes's apartment, where he spent several minutes singing the praises of some of his favorite possessions, the Aalto chair ("I love the way the back connects") and Acton bench ("See those feet on it, how they look like they're walking?"), before heading into his bedroom.
A patchwork quilt, produced by a group of women in Gee's Bend, Ala., whose work was recently shown at the Whitney Museum, lay across the bed. Almost neon-bright, it offered a jarring contrast to the Oriental carpet on the floor. Mr. Forbes said he bought it from Odd Fellows Antiques, in Maine. "It's what an Amish quilt would look like if the Amish had more sex," he said.

HARMONY IN HOUSTON -- Musicians of the Houston Symphony Orchestra voted on Tuesday to end a strike that began on March 9. The three-and-a-half-year contract agreement between the 97-member orchestra and the Houston Symphony Society was reached after 36 1/2 hours of negotiations that began at 9 a.m. Saturday. The agreement calls for a two-year pay freeze before increases during the contract's remaining months. The agreement also calls for a joint effort by the musicians and the society to improve fund-raising and concert subscriptions. Performances are to resume on Saturday with a concert featuring the percussionist Evelyn Glennie. Ed Wulfe, the prominent Houston real-estate developer asked by the city's mayor, Lee P. Brown, to assume the role of special mediator in the dispute, said he turned to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's office in New York to seek tips from Frank J. Macchiarola, who mediated last month's strike of Broadway musicians. Recalling that Mr. Macchiarola kept the parties talking at Gracie Mansion without food, Mr. Wulfe said, "Toward the end, the difference was he wouldn't feed them till they got through, and we brought in more pizza."

WHY CAN'T YOU BUY A TICKET? -- The violinist Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, left, and the pianist Anne-Marie McDermott will open a new recital series at Town Hall at 5 p.m. Sunday. Three more recitals are scheduled before the inaugural programs end on June 29 with a performance by the violinist Joshua Bell. All the artists involved will be making their only New York recital appearances this season. And no one can buy a ticket. That's because this new series is open to the public without charge. Called Free for All at Town Hall, the program offers tickets first come first served, limited to two per person. They will be available at the box office, beginning at noon on the day of the concert. The bassist Edgar Meyer and the pianist Amy Dorfman will perform on May 11, and the cellist David Finckel and the pianist Wu Han will perform on June 8. All the recitals are at 5 p.m.

FROM RUSSIA WITH MASTERWORKS -- Spanning the centuries from the 17th to the 20th, and schools of art from classical and Rococo through Romantic, Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and Modernist, 76 paintings from the State Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow are to make their only Southeastern appearance beginning on Saturday at the High Museum in Atlanta. Before this tour, 52 of the paintings, which include works by artists like Claude Lorrain, Poussin, Renoir, Pissarro, Monet, Degas, van Gogh, Gauguin, Cezanne, Picasso and Matisse, had never been on view in the United States. Exhibited previously at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, "Old Masters, Impressionists and Moderns: French Masterworks From the State Pushkin Museum" will remain at the High Museum through June 29 and will be seen at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art from July 27 through Oct. 13.

GRAMMYS IN MIAMI -- The Latin Grammys, first awarded in 2000, are finally coming to Miami, the Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences announced on Tuesday. Los Angeles, host of the inaugural ceremonies, replaced Miami in 2001 after a threatened protest by Cuban exile groups opposed to performers from Cuba, but those ceremonies were canceled after the terrorist attacks. Last year's show also took place in Los Angeles. CBS is to show the 2003 ceremonies live on Sept. 3.

SOME LIKE IT AMERICAN -- What happens when Max and Alex, two Russian ballet dancers from the Imperial Theater, come to the United States to seek their fortune and instead find themselves unemployed and pursued by gangsters? They disguise themselves as women and go to work in a nightclub. The story unfolds in the Russian choreographer Boris Eifman's newest ballet, "Who's Who," which will receive its New York premiere when the Eifman Ballet of St. Petersburg opens its City Center season at 8 p.m. tomorrow. The final three performances of the engagement, ending April 20, will bring the return of Mr. Eifman's children's ballet, "Pinocchio."

TALKING ABOUT WRITING -- The New Yorker writer Adam Gopnik will discuss Guy de Maupassant at 7 tonight when the French Institute Alliance Francaise presents the first in a series of literary conversations by American authors about their favorite French writers. The series, "Authors on Auteurs," with Leonard Lopate of WNYC as host, takes place at Florence Gould Hall, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan. On April 24, Andre Aciman will discuss Marcel Proust, and on May 15, Paul Auster will talk about Joseph Joubert.

FOOTNOTES
The ninth annual Avignon/New York Film Festival of French and American independent works, roundtable discussions, sessions with filmmakers, receptions and prizes for emerging directors, opens an eight-day run on Saturday. The official opening attraction is Alexandre Rockwell's "13 Moons," to be seen at 8 p.m at the Screening Room, 54 Varick Street, just below Canal Street, TriBeCa.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
What will be the model for peace in postwar Iraq -- Germany after World War I or after World War II?

BYLINE:  By Alan B. Krueger; Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University and a co-editor of The Journal of the European Economic Association. E-mail: akrueger@princeton.edu.

 BODY:
"EVEN if it did not sow the decay of the whole civilized life of Europe," an ominously prescient John Maynard Keynes wrote in 1919, it was "abhorrent and detestable" to impose financial reparations on Germany after World War I. 
 Although untold battles lie ahead and the extent of destruction is yet to be determined, there will eventually be a postwar Iraq. Historians will judge the success of the war by the success of the peace. Will the consequences resemble the tragedy of Germany after World War I or the success of Germany after World War II? The Bush administration has much riding on an outcome approximating the latter, but it has done little publicly to describe its postwar plans other than to give lucrative contracts to former business associates in closed bidding and to request $3.5 billion -- a down payment -- for postwar relief and reconstruction in its recent $75 billion supplemental spending bill. 
 Even without punitive war reparations, the financial burden on Iraq already poses a big obstacle to reconstruction. The fog of finance is almost as thick as the fog of war in Iraq, but analysts have pieced together a balance sheet that looks, well, wildly out of balance. Saddam Hussein borrowed heavily to finance his war with Iran, the invasion of Kuwait, and the first Persian Gulf war. On top of this, the United Nations Compensation Commission received $320 billion of claims for damages against Iraq related to its invasion of Kuwait. 
Iraq's total potential obligation -- from war-related compensation claims, foreign debt and pending contracts -- is $383 billion, according to Frederick D. Barton and Bathsheba N. Crocker of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Their report, "A Wiser Peace: An Action Strategy for a Post-Conflict Iraq" (available at www.csis.org/isp/pcr/index.htm), should be required reading for anyone looking for a blueprint of how to rebuild Iraq successfully after the war.
"In any reconstruction there is a make-or-break issue," said Mr. Barton, a veteran of United States and United Nations efforts to rebuild war-torn regions like Bosnia, Haiti and Rwanda. "Debt is the make-or-break issue for Iraq."
To gain some perspective on the crushing financial burden facing the Iraqi people, note that with a population of 24 million, pending obligations work out to $16,000 for every man, woman and child. The Central Intelligence Agency estimates, probably optimistically, that Iraq's per capita gross domestic product is $2,500. So, for the average person, financial obligations exceed income by a ratio of more than six to one. 
If 50 percent of Iraq's future export income is diverted to paying down the debt -- more than three times the percentage extracted for German World War I reparations -- it would take more than 35 years to pay off current obligations fully, even after allowing for reasonable growth in oil exports. 
The ratio of debt to G.D.P. in Iraq is more than 10 times what it is in Argentina or Brazil. 
Even if the Barton-Crocker estimates are way off, the debt load facing future generations of Iraqis is overwhelming. 
What would happen if an occupied Iraq simply defaulted on the debt? 
Patrick Bolton, an expert on sovereign bankruptcy at Princeton University, said creditors could seize Iraq's assets in their countries or sue to block future creditors from collecting money owed to them, creating an obvious disincentive for anyone considering investing in Iraq. Creditors might even be able to block the United States from using Iraqi oil reserves for the Iraqi people, as the Bush administration has promised. 
Indeed, the United Nations has been siphoning off 28 percent of Iraq's oil export revenue to compensate claimants from the invasion in Kuwait -- and so farhas processed only half of all claims from that war. There could be additional claims after this war, and much of the country's infrastructure will need to be rebuilt or repaired. The United Nations has awarded 30 cents on the dollar for individual and family claimants; claims by companies, governments and international organizations remain to be settled. 
To give Iraq's economy a chance to recover, Mr. Barton and Ms. Crocker recommend a five-year moratorium on external debt, along the lines that the Paris Club creditors agreed to for Yugoslavia in 2001. They also call for an immediate halt to the United Nations deduction of oil revenues to compensate claimants.
Michael Kremer and Seema Jayachandran, two Harvard economists, go even further. They propose that debts incurred by all illegitimate, repressive regimes should be made nontransferable to successor governments. Because Iraq has the potential to generate foreign exchange, unlike Rwanda or Haiti, a debt moratorium or write-down could generate short-term investments to help the economy get back on its feet. 
Relieving Iraq's debt crisis is a particularly delicate diplomatic challenge, however, because Russia -- with its own economic problems and veto on the Security Council -- is owed $64 billion by Iraq. Ms. Crocker cautions that the United States should not unilaterally cancel contracts executed between other sovereign nations; this should be left to a multinational body. 
"Nations are not authorized, by religion or by natural morals, to visit on the children of their enemies the misdoings of parents or of rulers," Keynes proclaimed. As matters stand now, future generations of Iraqis will be saddled with Mr. Hussein's debts.
Ironically, the Bush administration -- on whose watch the projected 10-year budget of the American government morphed from a surplus of $5.6 trillion into a deficit of $4 trillion -- must address Iraq's debt for reconstruction to succeed.
It is easy to underestimate the hardship that severe financial burdens impose on a people trying to recover from war. In his 1920 critique, "The Economic Consequences of the Peace," the celebrated University of Chicago economist Thorstein Veblen wrote, "the measures hitherto taken in the execution of this peace treaty's provisional terms throw something of an air of fantasy over Mr. Keynes's apprehensions." The next two decades proved Mr. Keynes's apprehensions correct. 
Let's hope Mr. Barton and Ms. Crocker's apprehensions are taken seriously.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Stocks Rally As Hopes Rise For Brief War

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
With United States troops closing on Baghdad, investors bid up stocks yesterday, sending markets worldwide strongly higher.
 More than any economic or corporate profit news, the war is driving stock, bond and oil prices, investors and Wall Street analysts said. Last week, stocks fell amid fears of a long war. This week, hopes that the United States and Britain will score a quick and decisive victory are propelling shares higher. 
 Yesterday, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 22.42 points, or 2.6 percent, gaining most of the ground it gave back last week. The Nasdaq composite index, which includes leading technology stocks like Microsoft, gained 48.42 points, or 3.6 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 215.20 points, or 2.7 percent.
Overseas, shares in Europe and Asia posted solid gains.
As long as the United States remains at war, "the market is going to go up and down more on emotion than valuation," said Scott Black, the president of Delphi Investments in Boston. "If we topple this regime in the next couple of weeks, and we don't have too much collateral damage, which is a fancy name for not killing too many women and children, the market's poised for a huge rally."
The rally yesterday was broad and deep. Of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow, 28 rose, while only 2 fell. Technology and cyclical companies, which are businesses perceived to benefit most from strong economic growth, had the biggest gains. Caterpillar rose $2.06, or 4.2 percent, to $51.71, while Walt Disney, whose theme parks may suffer if a war drags on, gained 87 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $17.98. Microsoft rose $1.37, or 5.7 percent, to $25.72.
"The industrials have been doing well of late," said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, which oversees $110 billion. "It's pretty war related, with growing evidence that we're moving into Baghdad without much resistance."
Mr. Paulsen is highly bullish. He predicts the S.& P. 500 could reach as high as 1,150 within a year if the war goes well, a gain of about 30 percent from its current levels. "I think that ultimately the war is going to end, and we get a sense that there's still a discount in the bond and stock market because of it," Mr. Paulsen said.
Investors ignored another bad piece of economic data, a report from the Commerce Department that factory orders fell 1.5 percent in February, a bigger drop than economists had expected. That report followed other weaker-than-expected economic reports this week. But investors largely discounted the data, which bullish analysts think may have been distorted by the wintry weather in February. 
Stocks have been quite volatile in the last month because the market is having a difficult time reading how long the war will last, said Byron Wien, the director of investor strategy at Morgan Stanley. As a result, some large institutional investors are sitting on the sidelines, leaving hedge funds, which sometimes rapidly change their strategies in pursuit of short-term performance, to trade with each other.
"A lot of people don't think you can actually invest in such an uncertain environment, so they trade," Mr. Wien said. "No enduring theme has captured the imagination of investors."
But Mr. Wien thinks that stocks are cheap based on their price-earnings ratio and that they will probably rise more than 12 percent over the next year. "I think the S.& P. 500 will be above 1,000 in a year," he said.
While stocks rose, oil fell. The price of oil for May delivery dropped $1.22 a barrel, or 4.1 percent, to $28.56, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In late February, oil briefly traded as high as $39.99 a barrel.
Lower oil prices are unequivocally positive for the economy, freeing up money for consumers to spend and businesses to invest, economists say. Each $1 increase in the price of a barrel of oil is estimated to cost consumers and businesses $7 billion a year, while a $1 decrease has the reverse effect.
At the same time, bond prices fell. Traders view the potential for a short war and stronger economic growth as bad for bonds, because stronger growth raises the risk of inflation. The price of the benchmark 10-year note dropped 21/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, climbed to 3.93 percent from 3.81 percent on Tuesday. Still, the yield is near 40-year-lows, reflecting bigger concerns about growth.
The 30-year bond also fell, losing 1 15/32 , to 106 28/32 . Its yield climbed to 4.92 percent from 4.83 percent.
Mr. Black of Delphi said that in their rush to bid up stocks on the war news, investors are ignoring the fact that economic fundamentals are still weak and stocks still not cheap. By his calculation, the S.& P. 500 has total profits of only about $43 a share, giving it a price-earnings ratio of more than 20. Considering that profit growth will probably remain weak this year, investors would be wise not to chase a war rally, he said.
"On fundamentals, the market's fully valued already," Mr. Black said.
Here are the results of yesterday's auction of 12-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Predictions for TV commercial sales for the fall season are cut because of the war in Iraq.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE ebullient forecasts for a record upfront market this spring -- when the television networks will sell most of their advertising for the 2003-4 season -- are being tempered as the war in Iraq enters its third week.
 The less optimistic predictions, which lower the consensus estimates of increases to the single digits from 12 percent to 15 percent, are a marked change from the first few days of the war. Network executives had confidently predicted that the conflict was unlikely to adversely affect the demand for commercial time. 
 But the outlook for the upfront market has become cloudy as setbacks in the war effort compete for news media attention with the successes. 
"Right now it's murky, and uncertainty is not good for the advertising economy," said Joe Mandese, editor of Media Markets Daily in New York, a newsletter published by Primedia.
The original forecasts by analysts and network executives called for the broadcast networks to take in perhaps as much as $9 billion in the upfront market, compared with the $8 billion booked in advance of the 2002-3 season. The cable networks, by comparison, were expected to ring up as much as $5.5 billion, compared with $4.6 billion ahead of the current season. And the sellers of syndicated series were predicted to book as much as $2.4 billion, compared with $2 billion before this season started.
"There was a euphoria on the seller side that there would be strong demand, up by double digits, but then it quieted, big time," said William Cella, chairman at Magna Global USA in New York, part of the Magna Global media-negotiating agency owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies.
The prices paid by advertisers are likely to increase, he added, but by percentages in the low single digits rather than in the high double digits.
Besides the question marks generated by the war, "the economy started slowing before the war happened, and it's still crummy," Mr. Cella said.
"Even if the war is out of the picture, all it would mean is that we could concentrate on the bad economy."
The economic outlook, particularly centered on consumer confidence, is being closely monitored by Madison Avenue. Mullen, an Interpublic agency in Wenham, Mass., plans to update regularly the results of a survey taken at the start of the war to gauge shifting sentiments.
The first update, released yesterday, showed that Americans "are more comfortable with, or less fearful of, the day-to-day risks we all must take to live our lives in a somewhat normal manner," said Ted Nelson, managing partner and director for brand and strategic planning at Mullen.
"However, expect everything to change," he added, "should our worst fears be confirmed and a terrorist event does in fact occur in the U.S."
Consumer sentiment is particularly important in determining whether big-ticket items are bought or ignored. Sales were sluggish last month for automobiles, which account for more advertising spending than any other product category. That led three analysts at Morgan Stanley in New York, in a report released on Tuesday, to predict that "auto ad spending will disappoint investors in 2003-4, as current levels are unsustainable."
Not surprisingly then, a report from Morgan Stanley on the 2003-4 upfront market took issue with the consensus estimates for increases of 12 percent to 15 percent in the total revenue for all TV commercial time. Rather, the report concluded, increases of 5 percent to 7 percent are more likely, and for the time frame of two seasons, through 2005, not one.
Mr. Mandese of Media Markets Daily said he was concerned about the results of a survey of chief financial officers by Financial Executives International and the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University. Two-thirds of those responding to the survey, released last week, said they expected their company's ad and marketing spending in the next 12 months to be flat or decline.
"While C.F.O. confidence could improve by the time the 2003-4 upfront action starts in May or June," Mr. Mandese said, "their sentiment will be shaped largely by the developments in the Iraq war."
William Drewry, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in Atlanta, said he believed that what happens on the battlefields in the next two to three weeks "may determine which direction the advertising market takes."
"If the war is nearing an end or is over (wishful thinking perhaps), then the advertising numbers would probably start to pick up," Mr. Drewry wrote in a report.
"If the news flow is relatively stable and the coalition forces are making progress, then the market may start to pick back up as well as advertisers step back into the market."
Mr. Cella at Magna Global said he also believed that "we'll be able to get a better, clearer picture in two weeks."
One analyst, Jack Myers, chief economist at Jack Myers L.L.C. in New York, which publishes media and research newsletters, is more bullish than most others. He continues to forecast a strong upfront market before the fall season begins, citing evidence like current robust demand for commercial time, bought shortly before spots run, in what is known as the scatter market.
"Those in scatter are paying prices as much as 50 percent higher than what was charged in the upfront for 2002-3," Mr. Myers said, "so they'll want to push into the upfront market."
"Marketers are certainly cautious," Mr. Myers said, "but the upfront is about 2004, and the hope is that the war will be past history in 2004 and marketers will be really focused on rebuilding their businesses."
The Summer Olympics and elections in 2004 will also stimulate demand, he added.
While the upfront market "is unlikely to meet the original bullish hopes of the networks," Mr. Myers said, "it's certainly realistic to expect an increase of 5 percent to 7 percent for the broadcast networks" along with gains of 7 percent to 15 percent for revenue for cable networks and increases of 5 percent to 10 percent for revenue for spots in syndicated shows.
Those predictions, he added, are predicated on an assumption that "the war does not stretch beyond mid-May" and a concurrent "return of positive economic indicators."
Otherwise, Mr. Myers said, "all bets are off."

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Fall; Military Sales Rise 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2 

 BODY:
Factory orders dropped 1.5 percent in February, the Commerce Department reported today, adding to suggestions that the approach of the Iraq war took a toll on manufacturing and the economy.
 The decrease, reflecting reduced demand for commercial aircraft, computers and chemicals, came after a 1.7 percent gain in January. Excluding transportation, orders fell 2 percent, the largest drop in a year. Bookings for military goods surged 27.1 percent, the third rise in four months. 
 The drop in orders over all caused manufacturing to contract last month for the first time since October. Companies trimmed orders and factories reduced production as consumer purchases slowed in January and February.
"There was a wait-and-see mentality among businesses" as the threat of war approached, said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh.
Manufacturing accounts for one-seventh of the economy and employs more than 16 million people. Economists had expected factory orders to fall 0.8 percent.
The decline was the largest since a 2.4 percent drop in September.
Factory inventories expanded 0.4 percent in February after a 0.1 percent gain in January. With shipments falling, the inventory-to-shipments ratio, a gauge of how long goods remain in warehouses, rose to 1.34 months from 1.32 months.
The drop in February orders is probably "setting the stage for a pullback in output in March, especially since inventories began to rise rapidly in February," said Jade Zelnik, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Conn.
The decrease in orders was led by a 1.6 percent drop in bookings for durable goods, those intended to last at least three years. Orders for commercial aircraft fell 27 percent.
Military capital goods were 23.3 percent higher in February than a year earlier. Raytheon said it would accelerate production of a new version of its Tomahawk cruise missile.
Bookings for military communications equipment surged 14 percent after a 10.3 percent rise.
Industrial machinery orders plummeted 29 percent, to $2.8 billion. Orders for computers dropped 17 percent, to $3.9 billion.
Orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft, a proxy for business investment in equipment and software, decreased 3.7 percent after a 5.2 percent rise the previous month. Shipments of capital goods, which are used in calculating the gross domestic product, declined 3.1 percent after gaining 3.1 percent.

HEADLINE: Industry Says Decision Won't Set Back Managed Care 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Insurance industry officials said yesterday that they would not let a Supreme Court decision on health plans hobble managed care, but some industry experts said the ruling was part of trend that is shrinking the role of insurers. 
 Rejecting an appeal by Aetna, Humana and other insurance companies, the court unanimously upheld a 1994 Kentucky law that opens membership in insurance networks to any doctor willing to accept an insurer's rules and payment rates. 
 Spokesmen for employers and insurers said the decision could add to health costs, but the American Medical Association called it "a major victory for patients" and a spokesman for hospitals said it was "clearly a plus" for them.
Doctors are now covered by these "any willing provider" laws in eight states: Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Virginia and Wyoming. Pharmacies and pharmacists are covered in about 20 states. 
Insurance companies can limit their networks in most parts of the country to a fraction of local doctors. That raises the insurers' bargaining power in negotiating with doctors on fees.
Industry officials said the court's decision would not affect rules that steer patients to favored doctors by permitting them to pay a lower share of the costs. 
The Supreme Court's decision weakened a federal benefits law, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or Erisa, which generally insulates employers and insurance companies from state health care regulations, industry officials said.
Some industry experts said that the trend toward limiting Erisa's precedence over state laws would transform the $550 billion health insurance industry in the next few years. This points to "a sea change in society," said Jack Reichman, an insurance analyst at Standard & Poor's, the credit-rating firm. 
"The kind of special privileges that Erisa gives health plans are being whittled away," Mr. Reichman said.
Anthony J. Knettel, a health policy expert at the Erisa Industry Committee, which represents large employers, said, "This is one of the numerous areas where gradual inroads are being made on Erisa." By giving state laws more authority, Mr. Knettel said, health care is made "more costly and less efficient."
In other Erisa cases, the Supreme Court has ruled that a state can require health plans to pay for a review by an independent board, and it said some decisions that combine administrative and medical factors could be subject to state malpractice laws. Two direct challenges to federal rules that prohibit state suits concerning the denial of payment under insurers' "medical necessity" guidelines are working their way through the courts, Mr. Knettel said.
Dr. Donald Palmisano, president-elect of the American Medical Association, which supports the state laws, hailed yesterday's ruling as "a rare unanimous decision in which the justices have asserted that health insurers cannot escape compliance with state laws intended to protect patient access to care."
Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Federation of American Hospitals, a nonprofit group, added, "The patients and their physicians can make the decision on where they are going to be treated." 
Mr. Kahn said the courts were "taking the Erisa law structure apart piece by piece."
"We really do have an untenable situation," he added. "Part of insurance is clearly regulated by the states and the federal part is relatively unregulated under Erisa."
Damage awards are limited under the federal law for patients who say they are denied care, he noted, but not under state law.
Spokesmen for two of the largest health insurers said their business would not be hurt by yesterday's ruling.
"We have been operating in Kentucky under this law for nine years," said Tom Noland, a spokesman for Humana, based in Louisville, Ky. "However, it is a law that has the result of raising health care costs for consumers, which is particularly difficult for them in the current environment of 15 percent yearly health cost inflation in the private sector."
Mark Lindsay, a spokesman for UnitedHealth Group, the nation's largest insurer, called the ruling "a validation of our commitment to open networks" and said a preliminary reading suggested "no effect on our business."
Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, a managed care trade group, said insurers had widened access for plan members over the years since the Kentucky law was enacted. 
But Ms. Ignagni said the decision "reaffirms the need for careful and responsible state legislation to enhance quality care for consumers and restrain costs." 
She noted that two states, California and Massachusetts, had established commissions to review state laws regulating health insurers.

HEADLINE: States Can Force H.M.O.'s to Accept Any Qualified Doctor, Supreme Court Rules 

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2 

 BODY:
States can require managed health care plans to accept any qualified doctor who wants to be a participating provider, the Supreme Court ruled today in a unanimous decision that resolved a significant legal dispute about state health care regulation.
 At the urging of doctors and patients, many states have enacted what are generally known as "any willing provider" laws, to prevent H.M.O.'s from limiting the pool of doctors or from retaliating against doctors who recommend too many treatments or complain about working conditions. 
 The Kentucky law the court upheld today dates to 1994 and is one of the broadest. While about half the states have such laws on their books, most apply only to pharmacies rather than the full range of medical care. 
The managed health care industry has resisted the provider laws on the ground that they interfere with one of the basic economic calculations underlying managed care: that medical costs can be held down, to the benefit of patients, only if participating doctors have a patient volume sufficient to earn a reasonable income despite lower fees. The ability to limit the number of providers is essential and costs will go up without it, the industry has argued.
The Supreme Court today did not resolve, or even address, this policy debate. Rather, the legal issue in the case was whether states are free to engage in this type of regulation, or whether these laws are pre-empted by a federal statute, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, known as Erisa.
Erisa pre-empts all state laws that "relate to any employee benefit plan," a phrase the court has interpreted to include employer-provided health benefits. But Erisa's pre-emption provision contains an exception for state laws that "regulate insurance, banking, or securities." So the legal question in this case, Kentucky Association of Health Plans v. Miller, No. 00-1471, was whether an "any willing provider" law is a regulation of insurance.
It was a question that had split the lower federal courts: in this case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, had found the Kentucky law to be a state regulation of insurance and thus not pre-empted by federal law. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Virginia, ruled the same way in upholding Virginia's law. But two other federal circuits, the Eighth and the Fifth, had reached the opposite conclusion, striking down laws in Arkansas and Louisiana.
The justices today concluded that these laws do regulate insurance, "by imposing conditions on the right to engage in the business of insurance," as Justice Antonin Scalia put it in his opinion for the court. "Those who wish to provide health insurance in Kentucky," he said, "may not discriminate against any willing provider."
The court rejected arguments made by a group of Kentucky H.M.O.'s that sued the state, and by managed care industry organizations that supported them, that the law was not a regulation of insurance because it did not regulate an insurance practice or the actual terms of insurance policies. That was not the test, Justice Scalia said.
He acknowledged in his opinion that the guidance to lower courts the Supreme Court's previous discussions of this issue had been less than clear. It was time for a "clean break" and a simplified test, he said. The opinion examined a variety of factors the court had considered in the past and, whittling them down to two, announced a simplified test. 
Justice Scalia said that from now on, a state law would be considered a regulation of insurance, exempt from pre-emption, if it was "specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance," as opposed to a general law that happens to have an impact on the insurance industry; and if it also substantially affected the "risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured."
By this, Justice Scalia said he meant "the scope of permissible bargains between insurers and insureds." By eliminating the prospect of a closed network of health care providers, the Kentucky law did have such an effect on the allocation of risk, he said.
The Bush administration supported Kentucky, as did the American Medical Association, other doctors' organizations and the Council of State Governments, which called the law a "classic instance of state insurance regulation." Such regulation, the council's brief said, was "one of the states' historic police powers."
The Alliance of American Insurers, an industry trade association, said the decision would result in higher health costs because "any willing provider" laws "make it difficult for networks to negotiate for volume discounts from a select group of providers."
Because of the stalemate in passing federal health care legislation, states have become increasingly active in the area. The complexities of the Erisa statute have resulted in a number of heated debates concerning health care policy arriving on the Supreme Court's docket as highly technical cases, all but divorced from their policy context.
In another health care case last year, the court upheld state laws that require outside review of a managed care plan's refusal to authorize a particular treatment. These state initiatives were also challenged by the industry as barred by Erisa.

HEADLINE: Circuit City Stores Posts a Sharp Drop In Quarterly Profit 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Va., April 2 

 BODY:
Circuit City Stores Inc., the electronics retailer, reported sharply lower earnings for the fourth quarter today, citing economic and national security worries as well as difficult comparisons with results from the previous year.
 Net income totaled $75.3 million, or 36 cents a share, in the three months ended Feb. 28, compared with $159.3 million, or 73 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. 
 Excluding charges related to store remodelings and relocations and the costs of converting the company's sales force to hourly pay from commissions, earnings were $83.2 million, or 40 cents a share. 
Circuit City, based in Richmond, had raised its earnings forecast last month, saying it expected earnings of 33 to 36 cents a share. Wall Street analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call had expected 36 cents a share.
Sales for the quarter amounted to $3.19 billion, down from $3.36 billion in the period a year earlier. Sales at stores open at least a year, considered the best measure of a retailer's health, fell 6 percent.
The chief executive, W. Alan McCollough, said sales of high-margin digital satellite systems, wireless telephones and personal computers weakened late in the year, in part reflecting "lingering economic and national security concerns." 
Those worries are likely to affect Circuit City's results this year, Mr. McCollough said. 
"Near term, we have seen a softening in our business, coincident with the onset of the war with Iraq," he said. "We believe the softening reflects consumer preoccupation with geopolitical events. It is too early, however, to understand the impact these events may have on results for the first quarter."

HEADLINE: Labor Leader Wants Insurer's Directors to Give Up $6 Million 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O, John J. Sweeney, yesterday called on the officers and directors of Ullico, the embattled union-owned insurance company, to return the more than $6 million in profits they made trading Ullico stock.
 Mr. Sweeney made this recommendation the day after The New York Times and The Washington Post reported that a long-secret report prepared by a special counsel said many Ullico directors had violated their fiduciary duties and should give up their profits. 
 "When the labor movement is fighting as never beforeto protect workers' retirement savings, Ullico must live up to the standards we ask others to meet," Mr. Sweeney said. 
He quit Ullico's board last December because he was upset that the board was not dealing aggressively with the stock-trading uproar and had refused to give Ullico's shareholders the special counsel's report. The report was prepared by James R. Thompson, former governor of Illinois. 
In response to Mr. Sweeney's statement, Ullico's lawyers noted that a special advisory committee of eight Ullico directors had disagreed with the Thompson report and voted against requiring the directors to return their profits. The committee also concluded that the directors had not breached their fiduciary duties. 
The company's lawyers released a study yesterday by an expert on Maryland corporate law, James J. Hanks, who said neither Robert A. Georgine, the company's chairman, nor the other directors had violated their fiduciary obligations.
Mr. Georgine said yesterday that the leak of the Thompson report to the news media on Tuesday "without benefit of the company's review and analysis does in fact constitute a breach of trust and, what's more, appears intended to be hurtful."
"I find that to be a most disappointing aspect of this situation," Mr. Georgine said. 
Andrew L. Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, called yesterday for Ullico's top managers, including Mr. Georgine, to step down. Not only has Ullico been rocked by accusations of insider trading by its directors, but it also faces a financial crisis because of operating losses and because insurance rating companies have downgraded the company.
"The business is suffering, and it's time for new people to come in and turn it around," Mr. Stern said. "I'm really concerned about what happened with the stock trading because it undermined confidence in the company, and I'm extremely concerned that all this is costing Ullico a significant amount of money in legal bills and other areas."
The stock trading is being investigated by the United States attorney in Washington, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Labor and the Maryland insurance commissioner. 
Under Ullico's stock repurchase program, officers and directors bought thousands of shares of the insurer's privately held stock starting in 1998 at prices that were nearly certain to rise when the directors reset the price. In November 2000, when it was certain that Ullico's share price would be set far lower, the board invited the officers and directors to sell back their shares at a high price, permitting them to make large profits while Ullico absorbed the losses.
Martin Maddaloni, president of the plumbers union, who made $418,880 in pre-tax profits by trading Ullico stock, said, "The directors have given Bob Georgine their full support in running the company, and we're not asking him to step down."
"As far as president Sweeney and president Stern, they can make all the requests they want, but I believe it's an internal labor issue, and they should keep it in their own house," Mr. Maddaloni added. "If they're not that smart, that's their own problem."

HEADLINE: 2 Hijackers Seize Havana Ferry and Sail for Florida 

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY with DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: MIAMI, April 2 

 BODY:
Two armed men commandeered a ferry today in Havana and set a course for Florida, the second time in two days that Cuban hijackers have taken hostages as they tried to flee to the United States.
 The F.B.I. said 15 to 20 people were aboard the 45-foot government-run ferry, which runs between Havana and Casablanca, across Havana Bay. The vessel was overtaken at 1:30 a.m. on Wednesday and followed by two Cuban Border Patrol vessels, the Foreign Ministry said. 
 "We're hearing from Cuban patrol that this ferry had been hijacked by two armed individuals," said Judy Orihuela, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Miami. 
The Border Patrol headquarters in Havana notified the Coast Guard in Miami that the ferry was headed for Florida. It was drifting in international waters 60 miles from Key West, with Cuban patrol boats nearby.
F.B.I. negotiators went to the scene on a Coast Guard helicopter, Ms. Orihuela said, adding, "We're in a holding pattern." 
A spokeswoman for the Coast Guard said that it was monitoring the situation and that the ferry and its occupants were the responsibility of Cuba. The Foreign Ministry in Havana acknowledged in a statement that the ferry was under its jurisdiction.
"The vessel and those hijacked are Cuban, and that is why the concrete measures to be taken are Cuba's responsibility," the ministry said. 
The Cuban government said it was urging the hijackers to surrender. The men, with three guns, had demanded fuel and threatened to throw passengers overboard if their demands were not met.
In an incident on Tuesday, a man saying he had grenades took over a Cubana de Aviacion plane heading to Havana and after refueling in Havana directed it to Key West International Airport. The plane landed in Key West escorted by F-15 fighters from the Air Force and a Black Hawk helicopter.
The man was taken into custody and found with fake grenades. The 31 other people on the plane, including six crew members and the man's wife and 3-year-old son, remain in the custody of immigration officials. 
That incident followed a hijacking of a Cuban plane on March 19 that was also diverted to Florida. In that incident, a Cuban DC-3 landed in Key West after having been commandeered by a group that wielded knives and an aircraft hatchet.
Six men were arrested and charged with conspiracy to seize an aircraft, a felony punishable by 20 years in prison. A federal judge held the suspects on $100,000 bonds, rejecting prosecutors' arguments that they should not be released. They remain in jail. 
Of the 31 passengers and six crew members on the flight, 14 decided to stay in the United States. 
Cuban officials faulted what they said was Washington's leniency toward earlier hijackers for prompting the second plane hijacking. Experts on Cuban affairs said Washington's handling of passengers and hijackers in the first incident might have contributed to more Cubans' trying to flee using similar methods.
"It gets the attention of those who are on the fence and persuades them to do the same," said Gerardo Le Chevallier, director for Latin America and the Caribbean at the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, a group in Washington. "If the U.S. gives asylum to all who take a plane or a boat, it is like inviting others to do it, too."
Representatives of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington did not return calls for comment.
Prominent exile groups in Miami and other experts on Cuban affairs said there were other possible explanations for the hijackings. Some said Cuba's struggling economy and increasing domestic tensions were likely factors and might lead to an exodus from the island.
The once-robust sugar industry was sharply scaled back last year in the face of cheaper competition, and the tourism industry, which generates most of the foreign exchange, faces a downturn as would-be visitors fear traveling during the war in Iraq, experts said.
"Conditions are such that you may see more people begin to leave," said Wayne S. Smith, chief of the United States Interests Section in Havana from 1979 to 1982. 
"No matter where they turn, they just don't see very good prospects," said Mr. Smith, now a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, another group in Washington.
Some experts said the poor economy could deteriorate to a level similar to the hardships that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba's patron. That decline set off an extensive exodus for Florida on rafts in 1994.
President Fidel Castro allowed the exodus, which prompted President Bill Clinton to adopt the "wet foot dry foot" policy that permits Cubans who land in the United States to remain but sends back those picked up at sea. The policy gave Cubans more incentive to reach American soil, which increased the number of people seeking faster, more efficient ways to go to Florida, like planes or motorboats.
"We've long had a very liberal policy with respect to Cubans who make it to our shores, and I'm sure Cubans in Cuba are aware of that," said Cheryl Little, executive director of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center, a legal services organization in Miami.
The new hijackings occur as Cuba increases pressure on people considered disloyal to the government. The Castro government recently cracked down on dissidents, arresting scores of journalists and political opponents on charges of conspiring with American diplomats.
"It comes at a time when there are heightened frictions between the Cuban regime and the United States," Mariela Ferretti, a spokeswoman for the Cuban American National Foundation in Miami, said of the hijackings. "And it comes at a time when the United States has its attention focused on the conflict with Iraq. 
"We have to consider the possibility that these people are being manipulated in order to provoke further friction between the United States and Cuba."

HEADLINE: A Yearlong Decline in the Dollar Is Little Help on U.S. Trade Gap 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
For many economists, the dollar's jagged yearlong slide is just a side effect of an inevitable contraction in the nation's huge trade deficit. But current economic and political conditions are making the process more perilous than it might otherwise have been.
 Recently, the dollar's exchange rates have bounced up and down with news from the Iraq war: late yesterday, on news of American military progress toward Baghdad, it reached 118.98 yen, up 0.76 percent from Tuesday. But the dollar's overall trend in the last year has been distinctly downward. Weighted by the volumes of trade with other countries and adjusted for inflation, an average of the rates dropped 4.4 percent from March 2002 to last month. 
 A deeper decline could be on the way, though. The run-up to the war in Iraq hurt the American economy, and fears of similar conflicts to follow could deter foreigners from holding dollar-denominated securities. With less demand for the securities, there would be less need for dollars.
"Perceptions are very important," said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, chief economist of Salomon Smith Barney. "If people believe that the events we've seen in Iraq are not one-off events, it will affect their investments." 
The falling dollar has helped some American companies to increase their exports, but not enough to counteract the effects of a middling global economy.
"It's only offset part of it," said Frank Mendizabal, a spokesman for Weyerhaeuser, the paper and building materials maker. The company exported 18 percent of its sales last year, and the weaker dollar helped it compete with producers in Latin America and Asia. But factors like a stagnant housing market in Japan still restrained demand, Mr. Mendizabal said.
Several forces may be combining to dull the effect of the exchange rate on exports. Mr. Schoenholtz said that weakness of incomes and demand abroad was "a very significant portion of the reason" why the deficit in international transactions had not narrowed more. Heightened world competition is also adding to the difficulty of American exporters' task.
"I can't think of an exchange rate at which U.S. exports might be competitive with those from a very low-cost country like China," said John G. Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investors Service. And in China's case, Mr. Lonski said, the currency is tied to the dollar, which helps prevent a narrowing of its trade imbalance with the United States.
Despite the decline in the trade-weighted value of the dollar, from October (when the dollar reached a peak) to January (the last month for which the Commerce Department has data), exports barely changed and imports rose 5 percent, seasonally adjusted. At least in the short term, the dollar's movements seem to reflect foreigners' willingness or reluctance to hold American securities more than the balance of trade.
"The recent confrontation with Iraq may have convinced investors of a need to better diversify their investment portfolios away from dollar-denominated assets," Mr. Lonski said. Though he did not forecast any large-scale dumping of American securities, Mr. Lonski said that "in view of the U.S.'s record-breaking current account deficit, it seems like some decline in the dollar appears to be overdue."
Last month, according to a report by Morgan Stanley, foreign investors' demand for Treasury securities suddenly slackened. And well before the possibility of war in Iraq began to concern investors, corporate scandals pushed foreigners to shift their portfolios away from American securities, said a senior executive based in the New York office of a major European bank.. 
"It was more that than anything else initially, and now it has to do with them feeling uncomfortable about the war," said the executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
In addition to the changes in portfolios, the pace of foreigners' direct investment in the United States has slowed. The euro zone has outpaced the United States as a target for foreign direct investment for six consecutive quarters, according to figures compiled by Morgan Stanley.
All American companies, exporters or not, could suffer if foreign capital being pulled out of United States investments is not replaced by domestic savings. Though household savings rose to about $330 billion last year from $200 billion in 2001, the budget deficit of $158 billion cut the nation's total savings in half. This year, the overall deficit will probably be $250 billion to $300 billion, according to the latest estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.
With national savings near zero, almost all new investment by American businesses would essentially be financed with foreign money. "The only way we can grow is to get capital from abroad," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist of Morgan Stanley. "What we're seeing now are some early warning signs of how this will play out over the next several years."
The Treasury also needs foreigners to remain interested in dollar-denominated securities. According to estimates by the Bond Market Association, a trade group, foreigners hold about 35 percent of the nation's outstanding debt. The Treasury's borrowing requirements seem likely to balloon as a result of the Iraq war, the sluggish economy and President Bush's tax cuts. If demand for that debt falls at the same time, interest rates could rise.
"We're asking the world to give us too much of their surplus savings," Mr. Roach said. "That's just not a sustainable way to run the economy, period."
Mr. Schoenholtz says he thinks the United States could regain its attractiveness to foreign investors. "If concerns about the war fade, and oil prices recede sharply," he said, "then you'll be back in a position where you could argue that the chance of an economic pickup would be greater for the U.S. than in Europe or Japan." In that case, he said, the United States would be likely to resume its position as the preferred market for foreign investors.
Indeed, investors may still be hard pressed to find a better place to invest. "The European economic data has been as bad or worse than the U.S.," said Ifty Islam, head of United States fixed-income strategy at Deutsche Bank Securities. "Just because this is not a European war, it doesn't mean Europe is not suffering."

Reality Versus Albany

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
A SCENARIO has been making the rounds in Albany lately about how the stressed budget will finally be balanced. It goes like this: the Legislature will, over the public disapproval but secret acquiescence of Gov. George E. Pataki, pass a budget that raises taxes. Mr. Pataki will -- wink wink -- veto it. Then legislators will (more winks) override his veto -- balancing the books but letting the governor preserve his anti-tax image.
 Now, this idea is politically preposterous. It would require a level of bipartisan cooperation unheard of in Albany, for one thing. For another, why would any governor risk appearing powerless or transparently devious? 
 But the very fact that this plot line has some currency in Albany gives New Yorkers a valuable insight into the politics of the state capital. With the budget in the worst shape in years, the game-playing seems even more intense than usual. 
The governor and legislative leaders have to find money (in part because Mr. Pataki and lawmakers spent handsomely last year) or risk fiscal chaos. That means significant tax increases, sharp spending cuts, more borrowing -- an unpalatable combination -- or help from Washington that remains elusive.
The governor, it emerged yesterday, is even trying to get his administration's hands on federal domestic defense funds intended for New York City -- a nice source of money that could go to budget relief instead of local defense. Money is money. 
Small wonder Mr. Pataki is looking to Washington, now that his plan to borrow against the 1998 settlement with the big tobacco companies (which was supposed to be spent on health care -- money is money) is falling apart. Philip Morris, responsible for more than half the settlement, fell into deep financial difficulty, undermining the bonding scheme. 
"It would have been better to go in December, and that's why I was pushing it in December," Mr. Pataki said this week. 
In other words, it would have been fine to let investors hold the bag? That raises not only a matter of principle, but also one of realities. If bonds backed by the tobacco settlement lost value, "it would have been the moral obligation of the state to pay," said Alan G. Hevesi, the state comptroller. "If it didn't, the credit rating of the state would collapse. That's untenable."
The other matter that tells a lot about how Albany works (or does not work) is the subtext of the large demonstration in the capital this week by health care workers protesting the governor's proposed health care cuts. 
The demonstration, underwritten by the Greater New York Hospital Association and the large hospital union, 1199/S.E.I.U., mirrors their advertising and direct-mail campaign.
The TV ads have an ominous tone. In one, a woman runs through anonymous streets with a child in her arms, to the accompaniment of eerie music. She reaches the door of a hospital emergency room, to find it closed. Because of budget cuts.
A bit of a scare tactic, because changing hospital services requires state approval. Trying to close an emergency room is like trying to close a fire house -- very difficult.
MORE revealing about the advertising campaign and protest is what is left out. Mr. Pataki's budget plan is in contention. But he is never mentioned in the ads, nor was he the focus of the protest. 
"They don't want to bite the hand that feeds them," said one Albany budget expert. Especially since it is the same hand that fed them last year. Even as the economy was weakening last year when the governor was running for re-election, he and the Legislature gave raises to members of 1199, using spent money that would otherwise have gone to health care programs; the union's leader, Dennis Rivera, then endorsed Mr. Pataki.
So now the beneficiaries of Pataki largess are protesting thunderously, but treading lightly. And treating the governor as if he were the man who wasn't there. 
The union still hopes to have "a dialogue" with the governor, explained the union's legislative director, Jennifer Cunningham. "We had very significant legislative victory last year," she said, adding, "That was then and this is now." 
Ken Sunshine, Mr. Rivera's public relations adviser, offered a different perspective. "One thing he is not," he said of his client, "is stupid."
And so, another week passes in Albany, where the budget is always late, the players always opaque and the politics best taken with a large measure of self-protective humor.

HEADLINE: On Rewarding Friends 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Nations have alliances, based on short-term strategic or economic interests. But peoples have friendships, based on memories forged in times of trial. These are the times that make and break friendships among peoples.
 Start with a small-nation example. Latvia was one of the Soviet "captive nations," ultimately freed by the U.S. victory in the cold war. Recently, as some of us had long urged, Latvia gained greater security when the U.S. lobbied for the Baltic nations to be brought under NATO's umbrella, despite Russian disapproval. 
 Under President Vaira Vike-Freiberga, Latvia has been an outspoken U.S. ally in the campaign to liberate Iraq. But polls show a possible switch: Latvians, swept up in a wave of European pacifism, may send Americans a message by turning her out of office in June. Democracy gives Latvians the freedom to ride that anti-U.S. wave -- but should the Russian bear growl, Americans would be free to remember that message. 
A more costly example of strains on friendship comes from Turkey, the ally that the U.S. hoped would lead the Muslim world to secular democracy. After dickering about an entry fee, its new Islamist government refused the U.S. request for transit of our troops to start a northern front in Iraq. Such cooperation would have shortened the war, saved lives and made Turkey a partner in extending freedom throughout the Middle East. 
Then the Turks added insult to injury. Turkey's military is threatening to grab northern Iraq's rich oil fields if the Kurds, recently ejected from the area by Saddam, dare to return to their stolen homes in Kirkuk. 
Secretary of State Colin Powell was in Ankara this week, pouring soothing syrup, pretending the political betrayal doesn't affect our "strategic partnership." And Israeli officials privately remind us of their quiet military relationship with Turkey, acting as if Ankara could still be relied upon.
But trust is shot. With our ships laden with troops and tanks offshore, Turkey suddenly embraced neutralism. Generations of Americans with memories of gallant Turks fighting alongside us in the Korean War -- and saving refugees after the first gulf war -- are being replaced by a generation that will remember the slamming of Turkey's door in our faces.
Of course, it is France, once identified with "the rights of man," that is most eager to bestride the world stage in gleeful confrontation with the U.S., and led the defense of Saddam's dangerous despotism in the U.N. The majority of French people care not a whit for the consequences.
Some of those will be economic. The U.S. will live up to its eight-year, $881 million contract with the French company Sodexho to provide domestic mess-hall meals to our Marine Corps (provided the souffles don't fall). And most U.S. consumers will not boycott French perfume or wine (though Australian merlot deserves a try).
But on future big deals that require a trustworthy ally, public opinion will drive public policy. Right now, our Department of Energy is about to award a $30 million contract to design a system for its nuclear waste program in Yucca Mountain, Nev. The consortium that wins will have the inside track on a billion-dollar deal transporting nuclear waste within the U.S. in years to come.
Three bids were invited by D.O.E.'s general contractor, Bechtel. One is from an American-Japanese group; another is from an American-British combine; the third's from a mainly French, partly German nuclear conglomerate named Cogema. 
Assuming the expertise and price are in the same ballpark, which outfit should not get this sensitive project financed by American taxpayers? In light of President Jacques Chirac's torpedo into the Atlantic alliance, the question answers itself.
What cements strategic and economic alliances is public sentiment among peoples. Britain and the U.S. are strategic allies, but Brits and Yanks are also genuine friends -- free to disagree and compete, but when wartime chips are down and alliance has a cost, tightly together. That, as Winston Churchill and Tony Blair understood, is what makes the relationship "special." 
Peoples have memories that profoundly affect international ties. Those memories are being forged right now, and Americans won't forget our friends.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: MOBILIZATIONS; 
Thin Work Force of North Dakota Gets Thinner as Residents Go Off to War

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

DATELINE: BISMARCK, N.D., March 30 

 BODY:
As the National Guard and reserves mobilized, North Dakota State University had 95 students called to duty. The Sherwin Williams paint store in Bismarck had four out of its five employees deployed. The Bobcat factory in Gwinner, population 700, lost 14 employees. Hillsboro lost half its police force.
 Of course, the town only had two officers to begin with. "One minute you have a full-time guy, the next minute you are working all by yourself again," said Ray Weber, the police chief for the town of 1,500. 
 All across the sparsely populated plains of North Dakota, the invasion of Iraq is taking a toll on a state where enlistment is high and where younger people had already been leaving in search of work elsewhere. Part-time military service is considered a good deal in North Dakota's cyclical and depressed rural economy. "If you start talking a hundred dollars a day for a family man, that's good money for him," said Dale Moser, who has been the top recruiter for North Dakota's National Guard for three years running. In addition, they receive educational benefits, health insurance and supplementary income.
The costs of that bargain come during war. North Dakota now has 1,550 members of the reserve and National Guard suddenly activated -- approximately one out of every 250 people between the ages of 18 and 65. That exodus is leaving gaping holes in the social structure.
To help ease the strain, the state government is considering a campaign to encourage people to take on additional part-time jobs and to get retirees back to the workplace.
"I could see using a patriotic theme," said Maren Daley, director of the North Dakota Job Service.
But rallying the people at home does little when certain skills simply are not available. The North Dakota Department of Transportation had already been struggling to fill five full-time engineering positions for about three years. "We're not viewed necessarily as a garden spot in the world for young graduates to come to," said Bob Evans, director of human resources. 
Then the war came and siphoned off another six critical engineering employees. "It's a real challenge for us," Mr. Evans said.
For Darlene Bohl of Flasher who saw three of her four sons sent off to the Persian Gulf, the war has forced wrenching decisions. Without the help of her sons on the family's 1,500-acre ranch, Ms. Bohl, a 55-year-old widow, was forced to sell 90 percent of her cattle.
"There were just too many cows, and I couldn't take care of them all by myself," Ms. Bohl said. "It was awful. I cried for a couple of days. I just couldn't imagine my yard without any cows."
Ms. Bohl works full-time as a state tax auditor, but the farm is her primary income. "We just hope and pray we make ends meet," she said.
Selling off her cows also required her to let go of a legacy from her marriage and her husband. "He brought his cattle, and I brought my cattle, and together we started a herd," she said.
The war's reverberations are most deeply felt in small towns like Cando, which is "not at the end of the world, but you can almost see it from here," as Mayor James Gibbens describes it.
The town, population 1,400 and declining, has sent 20 residents off. Last week, 500 people showed up for a parade with flags, sirens and speeches. The Police Department lost a third of its three-man force. It also lost a registered nurse. The local pasta factory lost three men.
Of course, in a town whose name is derived from "Can do it," everyone is willing to pitch in. But it is the emotional, rather than economic, strain that is most acutely felt in an area where people 50 miles away are still considered neighbors.
In the tumble of relations that make up a small town, everyone in Cando is either related to, a childhood friend of or has worked with someone who has been deployed. The deployment wall at the local crafts store has 64 hearts for friends and family members who have been sent to war. The elderly monitor CNN during their afternoon coffee hour at Dee's Cafe. The owner of Gordy's Bar is getting regulars to sign a card for one of his favorite customers. He would have put together more cards, the barmaid observed. But most of those who have gone off to fight the war are not customers, she said. They are not yet old enough to drink.

 (For those who don't know, prosecutors are moving to overturn the convictions of everyone seized in an outlandish drug sting conducted by a single wacky undercover officer.) 
 But there is another issue crying out for immediate attention. With the eyes of most Americans focused on the war, the Bush administration and its allies in Congress are getting close to agreeing on a set of budget policies that will take an awful toll on the poor, the young, the elderly, the disabled and others in need of assistance and support from their government. 
The budget passed by the House is particularly gruesome. It mugs the poor and the helpless while giving unstintingly to the rich. This blueprint for domestic disaster has even moderate Republicans running for cover.
The House plan offers the well-to-do $1.4 trillion in tax cuts, while demanding billions of dollars in cuts from programs that provide food stamps, school lunches, health care for the poor and the disabled, temporary assistance to needy families -- even veterans' benefits and student loans.
An analysis of the House budget by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that its proposed cuts in child nutrition programs threaten to eliminate school lunches for 2.4 million low-income children.
Under the House plan, Congress would be required to cut $265 billion from entitlement programs over 10 years. About $165 billion would come from programs that assist low-income Americans.
This assault on society's weakest elements has been almost totally camouflaged by the war, which has an iron grip on the nation's attention.
The House budget does not dictate the specific cuts that Congress would be required to make. In its analysis, the center assumed (as did the House Budget Committee) that the various entitlement programs would be cut by roughly the same percentages. If one program were to be cut by a somewhat smaller percentage, another would have to be cut more.
The analysis found that in the year in which the budget sliced deepest:
*"The cut in Medicaid, if achieved entirely by reducing the number of children covered, would lead to the elimination of health coverage for 13.6 million children."
*"The cut in foster care and adoption programs, if achieved by reducing the number of children eligible for foster care assistance payments, would lead to the elimination of benefits for 65,000 abused and neglected children."
*"The cut in the food stamp program, if achieved by lowering the maximum benefit, would lead to a reduction in the average benefit from an already lean 91 cents per meal to 84 cents."
When's the last time one of the plutocrats in Congress waded through a meal that cost 84 cents?
The Senate budget is not as egregious. It calls for a total of about $900 billion in tax cuts, and there is no demand for cuts in entitlement programs. But it is not a reasonable budget. In fact, there's something obscene about a millionaires' club like the Senate proposing close to a trillion dollars in tax cuts for the rich while the country is already cutting social programs, running up huge budget deficits and fighting a war in the Middle East.
At least in the House budget the first -- if not the worst -- of the cuts are in plain view. In the Senate plan the inevitable pain of the Bush budget policies remains concealed.
"There is a significant human toll in the Senate budget, but it's in the future," said Robert Greenstein, the center's executive director. "What I mean is that given the deficits we're already in, you can't keep doing tax cuts like this -- you can't keep cutting your revenue base -- without it inevitably leading to sharp budget cuts."
House and Senate conferees are now trying to resolve the differences in the two budget proposals. They will do all they can to minimize the public relations hit that is bound to come when you're handing trainloads of money to the rich while taking food off the tables of the poor. So you can expect some dismantling of the House proposal.
But no matter what they do, the day of reckoning is not far off. The budget cuts are coming. In voodoo economics, the transfer of wealth is from the poor and the working classes to the rich. It may not be pretty, but it's the law.

HEADLINE: More Schools Are Exempted From New City Curriculum 

BYLINE:  By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
More than 300 schools -- approximately one-quarter of all New York City public schools -- will be exempt from all or part of the city's new standard literacy and math curriculum next year, city education officials said yesterday. 
 The tally came as officials announced the results of an appeals process in which 233 schools said they did not want to follow the new curriculum, which is a centerpiece of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's aggressive effort to overhaul the schools. 
 In February, when Chancellor Joel I. Klein identified 209 schools that were considered good enough to be exempt from the uniform curriculum, the list quickly became the public education system's version of Hollywood's celebrity A-list.
Some parents, teachers and principals were jubilant, while others vowed to fight the decision, even as few people fully understood the parameters of the uniform curriculum. Education officials had built in an appeals process, anticipating objections. 
Yesterday, officials announced that 31 more schools or honors programs operating within larger schools had been granted two-year waivers from the standard curriculum in reading, math or both. 
But if anyone thought the appeals process would give Mr. Klein an easy way to mollify critics, particularly among the middle class, it did not work out that way. Fewer than half of the schools that appealed for waivers got them, and many that sought full exemptions got only a partial reprieve.
The appeals, like the original 209 exemptions, were determined using a formula intended to ensure some degree of racial and economic diversity. The schools that won two-year exemptions came from wealthy and poor districts alike. 
Officials also said that 45 more schools had received one-year exemptions, 10 because they had made significant improvements in recent years, 33 because there was no testing data available to gauge student performance and 2 because of special needs. 
Finally, officials said, 43 more schools have been granted one-year exemptions because changing their curriculum would jeopardize grants that were specifically awarded to carry out other reading or math programs. 
Mr. Klein's spokesman, David Chai, said that officials had pored over school data, crunching and recrunching the numbers as they considered waiver applications. 
"We really wanted to make sure that in every single case, there is justifiable reason why they got a waiver " Mr. Chai said. 
The formula focused on a combination of standardized reading and math test results but was weighted to avoid rewarding only the top schools, where students are predominantly middle class and white or Asian. 
The formula divided schools into three categories -- high-, medium- and low-need -- based on poverty data, the number of students for whom English is a second language, and the number of special education students. 
In each category, schools were judged on the percentage of students scoring at or above grade level on the reading and math tests. The cutoff level for exemptions was set highest for low-need schools and lowest for the high-need schools. 
In deciding the appeals, school officials used the same formula, but instead of using combined test results, they analyzed math and reading separately. One result is that some schools will be exempted only from math while others will be exempted only from reading. 
The Department of Education granted appeals to 11 honors programs that operate autonomously within larger schools, including the Booker T. Washington Middle School in Manhattan and the Marie Curie School in Bayside, Queens. 
The Education Department declined to release the list of 88 schools that had received one-year exemptions. Among them are 10 schools whose test scores have improved so much over the last three years that officials said they expected the schools to qualify for exemption by next year anyway.
Mr. Chai said that officials expected yesterday's appeals decisions to generate yet further grumbling. But the nuanced process, Mr. Chai said, underscored Mr. Klein's commitment to leave successful programs alone, imposing change only where necessary. 
City Councilwoman Eva S. Moskowitz, chairwoman of the Council's education committee, said she mostly supported plans for the standard curriculum and cautioned educators and parents against jumping to negative conclusions. "This uniform curriculum should not be viewed as punishment," she said.
Some parents and educators complained that the standard curriculum would hurt smaller schools that employ more creative teaching methods. A coalition of such schools, the Progressive Education Network of New York, said that most of its members had applied for waivers from the curriculum but were denied.

HEADLINE: A RESPIRATORY ILLNESS: ECONOMIC IMPACT; 
From Tourism to High Finance, Mysterious Illness Spreads Havoc

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, April 2 

 BODY:
As the highly contagious respiratory disease that began in China continues to spread, its impact on business activity is stretching from Hong Kong around the globe, disrupting complex supply chains and forcing industries from airlines to banking to adjust their operations. 
 UBS, the Swiss bank, is ordering employees returning to its European offices from trips to Asia to stay home for 10 days before reporting to work. Intel is canceling two major conferences in Asia for suppliers, customers and computer programmers. And KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has warned that the disease, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, is hurting international air travel more than the war in Iraq. 
 Further disruption seemed probable after the World Health Organization yesterday urged travelers to avoid Hong Kong and Guangdong Province in China, the first time the W.H.O. has ever issued a global warning against travel to an area because of an infectious disease. 
The warning from the W.H.O. came as the Centers for Disease Control said there were 85 suspected cases in 27 states, and China admitted yesterday that it had 1,190 suspected cases, not 806, and 46 deaths instead of the 34 it had previously acknowledged. Page A11. 
Health officials still do not know if SARS will spread further throughout the world or burn out on its own. At the moment, the number of cases is relatively small compared with some other respiratory diseases. 
During an average year in the United States, influenza kills about 36,000 people, most of them elderly or with underlying diseases. As far as health officials can calculate at the moment, the death rate from SARS is about 3 percent, about half that of West Nile fever.
But because so little is known about the highly contagious disease and because, aside from standard nursing care and help in breathing, there is no treatment or vaccine, health officials here and around the world remain deeply concerned. 
Fears about SARS are affecting so many businesses that economists at many of the big investment banks reduced their estimates today for economic growth in East Asia, especially in Hong Kong and Singapore. Goldman Sachs, for example, estimated that the disease would reduce economic output in the current quarter by seven-tenths of a percentage point in Hong Kong, half a percentage point in Singapore, three-tenths of a point in Taiwan, and two-tenths of a point in Thailand.
The immediate impact is most severe in the travel and tourism industries. In a survey released Tuesday by the Business Travel Coalition, an advocacy group for business travelers, 27 percent of the respondents were banning travel to Asia and 8 percent were considering a ban.
Kevin P. Mitchell, president of the advocacy group, estimated that the survey's participants spend an average of $734,000 a day, or $268 million a year, on air travel to Asia.
Entertainment in Asia is also being affected. The Rolling Stones, Moby and Carlos Santana have canceled or postponed concerts. 
Businesses across East Asia, especially here in Hong Kong at the epicenter of the SARS outbreak, are being forced to develop a new approach to workplace health.
J. P. Morgan Chase has splitsome important departments into two shifts that take turns working a week in the office and then a week at home, in the hope that if one shift becomes contaminated with the virus, the other shift can take over. 
The hardest-hit company here appears to be HSBC, a bank so dominant in Hong Kong that it used to be said that its branches were more common than rice shops.
Five HSBC employees -- one each in treasury, trade finance and private banking and two in branches -- have fallen ill here with SARS. On the advice of its doctors, HSBC is sending home only those workers who had close contact with workers who became ill, and it is not clearing out an entire floor each time. 
As a precaution, however, HSBC sent 50 fixed-income bond traders home last Thursday with instructions that all those who stay healthy for seven days -- the disease's usual incubation period -- should then report to a backup site at the other end of the harbor from the bank's headquarters.
Fears about the disease are affecting many companies in other parts of the world as well.
Intel, the computer chip maker, has decided to cancel two conferences it planned to hold this month in Taipei and Beijing for about 1,000 suppliers, customers and computer programmers, according to Chuck Malloy, a spokesman. 
In Switzerland, the government barred visitors from China, Vietnam, Singapore and Hong Kong from working at exhibitions at the 86-year- old World Watch and Jewelry Show in Basel and Zurich.
Of 650 stands registered for the Zurich fair, 400 were closed because the employees of the stands, most of whom were already in Switzerland, were not allowed to work. 
In Canada, where more than 100 people have been infected with SARS, Chinese restaurants and shopping areas in Toronto were shunned today while face masks and thermometers were big sellers. For a few businesses, however, the SARS outbreak is proving to be a boon.
"We've seen a reasonable increase in sales," said John Mozas, general manager of Grocery Gateway Inc., which operates an online supermarket. But Grocery Gateway, too, has made changes to accommodate customers' concerns. For the time being, all its delivery people are required to wear gloves and to leave orders at customers' front doors.
The biggest question now is how much the SARS outbreak will affect China. Taiwan in particular has been strongly discouraging its citizens from visiting the mainland after a spate of SARS illnesses among recent arrivals from there. 
Taiwanese companies working with mainland factories produce much of the world's desktop, laptop and notepad computers and dominate the market for wireless local access network equipment, for example. But because few factories on the mainland have many engineers of their own, Taiwanese and other companies fly in engineers to oversee the design of products as well as the construction and equipping of new factories.
Manufacturers have tried to accomplish the same tasks through videoconferencing and the Internet, but they have mostly been unsuccessful. If the current difficulties cause a delay in tight schedules for the introduction of new computer models and the construction of factories, multinational companies may seek additional sources of supply.
"One of the imponderables here is how this will affect perceptions of China," said Russell Craig, the research director for semiconductors at the Aberdeen Group, a market research firm in Boston. "Until this happened, it was the absolute hot spot in terms of the electronics industry."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Coping With an Epidemic"Big companies with operations in Asia have been struggling to respond to outbreaks of a new respiratory illness in southern China, Vietnam, Singapore and Hong Kong. Here are some of the measures being taken in Hong Kong. Establish a command center to take reports of illnesses and then order all employees near the infected individual sent home for 7 to 10 days and the office fully cleaned and disinfected. Send a small team responsible for trading, settlement and computer operations to a backup site in case headquarters staff are infected. Arrange for overseas operations to cover at least some of the activities of Hong Kong operations. Reduce international trips to lower the odds that foreign offices of the same company will become contaminated. Test backup equipment and procedures. Clean and disinfect offices more regularly. Contact outside suppliers of any essential services to make sure that they also have contingency plans.

HEADLINE: Trenton Budget Talks Leave Dim Hope of Recovery Soon 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: TRENTON, April 2 

 BODY:
This week, as the New Jersey Legislature opened its public deliberations over Gov. James E. McGreevey's proposed budget, everyone wailing about the forecasts presented could be assured that there is indeed something worse than the dismal year they are facing. That would be the year after.
 For that matter, the economists and state officials who testified Tuesday and today made it clear that any visions of recovery were rapidly receding and with them the hope of repairing state government without fundamental, longstanding changes in taxing and spending habits. 
 "You're going to see budget deficits as far out as you can imagine," said David Brunori, a contributing editor of State Tax Notes magazine. "The states that have managed to balance their budgets for this cycle are predicting massive deficits for the next cycle."
Mr. McGreevey's budget, for the second year in a row, closes the gap between income and expenditures largely with spending cuts and one-shot measures. The $23.7 billion spending plan borrows the remainder of the state's expected proceeds from the tobacco settlement, increases taxes that cannot easily be increased again and defers payments to pension funds.
Mr. McGreevey's budget also reduces prescription drug benefits to the elderly, removes many poor and disabled adults from state health insurance plans and ends property tax relief for about 300,000 families making over $100,000 a year. In freezing aid to most towns and school districts and cutting state university budgets it will almost certainly force property tax and tuition increases.
Senator Wayne Bryant, the Democratic cochairman of the Budget Committee, said after the hearing that "those who are held flat in this year's budget ought to be grateful to the governor." 
Since Mr. McGreevey and most legislative leaders have vowed not to increase any broad-based taxes, the state's fiscal recovery depends almost entirely on its economic recovery, and particularly on rising personal income. The state's total revenue from income taxes dropped 14 percent in the 2002 fiscal year, and is expected to remain flat this year. 
The McGreevey administration is projecting a 7.6 percent increase in income tax revenue next year, but the state treasurer, John E. McCormac, testified that there was "no major economic rebound yet in sight." 
James W. Hughes, the dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, told the Senate Budget Committee on Tuesday that the state was likely to see a "long, shallow recovery" and a "half-speed-ahead economy." After his testimony, Mr. Hughes, describing "an unprecedented fiscal crisis," said, "We are in the process of dismantling some very important state operations." 
Mr. McCormac said his office had no projections beyond the 2004 fiscal year, which begins July 1. Referring to the budget gaps he has confronted since Mr. McGreevey took office 15 months ago, Mr. McCormac said, "We dealt with nearly $15 billion in the last two years, and we'll deal with '05." 
That fiscal year, ending five months before the gubernatorial election, is especially important for Mr. McGreevey. Barring a dramatic turn in the economy, it would be his third year without any significant new spending programs. Worse, it would be the third year with significant cuts. 
Mr. McGreevey's already dismal poll numbers have slipped a little more in recent weeks, according to a Quinnipiac University Poll released today, with 44 percent of respondents disapproving of his job performance and 38 percent approving. Fifty percent disapprove of his handling of the budget. 
Meanwhile, he has fewer and fewer potential new revenue sources like the ones he proposed to tap next year: the extension of the sales tax to hotel rooms and meals given to casino gamblers and, most important, the tobacco settlement funds. 
Mr. Brunori said most states were trying to patch together budgets without tax increases. "And virtually every public-finance expert I've spoken to said it won't work," he said. 
"There are only two things that could turn around the fiscal crisis: a resurgence in the economy, and nobody is predicting that, or some fundamental changes in state government finances, both in terms of what we spend our money on and how we collect taxes."
Mark Zandi, the chief economist at economy.com, an economic research firm, said New Jersey might fare better than other states in the next few years because it has an unusually diversified economy. But he added: "There are going to be some hard choices to be made. None of them are good choices."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: THE HOMETOWN; 
Rescue in Iraq and a 'Big Stir' in West Virginia

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL and JAYSON BLAIR 

DATELINE: PALESTINE, W.Va., April 2 

 BODY:
Even today, Linda Davies was still clutching the note that Pfc. Jessica Lynch, her former kindergarten student, sent six weeks ago from the desert of Kuwait, set out on pastel paper in a schoolgirl's round handwriting and marveling at how far she had come from her home in rural West Virginia.
 "I can say I've been to places that half of Wirt County will never see," Private Lynch, 19, wrote with the wonder and awe of a country girl who had not visited Charleston, the state capital, until she graduated from high school but had now embarked on what she plainly saw as a great adventure. 
In just a few months, the private wrote on Feb. 21, she had visited Mexico, Germany and Kuwait and now, as a young Army supply clerk, was poised to set out toward Iraq as soon as President Bush gave the order.
"I will still be a teacher," Mrs. Davies said in summing up Private Lynch's plans for the future. "But I want to travel first." 
Private Lynch's friends and relatives never imagined that her travels would include days of captivity in Iraq, a daring rescue by American commandos, and a flight on a military transport plane that rushed her today to a hospital in Germany. Page B10. 
Her family said military officials told them that she has broken legs and gunshot wounds.
This morning, hours after Private Lynch was rescued from an Iraqi hospital, Ms. Davies and others here said they were sure she had been saved by the power of prayer and by the resilience fostered by her modest West Virginia roots.
"I know there were people all over the world who were praying for Jessi," said Ms. Davies, who taught Jessica Lynch in kindergarten 14 years ago and had remained close to her. "We know a miracle has occurred."
Outside the Lynch family's tin-roofed, white wood-frame home at the end of a single-lane gravel road, Private Lynch's father, Gregory Lynch Sr., 43, a self-employed truck driver in heavy boots and blue jeans, put it a different way.
"What she has learned growing up in the country and woods, and by what her brother put her through, that kind of prepared her for a lot," Mr. Lynch said.
Asked what he might tell his daughter, Mr. Lynch grinned through his exhaustion.
"The little brat's caused a big stir in this county," he said, adding: "As soon as she's capable, we're planning one heck of a big shindig." He got his chance to talk to her this afternoon.
Dozens of people, some traveling from more than 100 miles away gathered today outside the home, surrounded by woods and farmland in the heart of Appalachia, to congratulate the family. They listened to a radio on the hill tuned into a popular country music station in Charleston, WQBE-FM, that was playing dedications to Private Lynch all day. 
Private Lynch, the second of three children, joined the Army in 2001, not as a career but as a way station, her friends and family said today, a path to the college education that her family could not otherwise afford and, ultimately, to a job as a kindergarten teacher.
It is a route that is not unusual in Wirt County, about 70 miles north of Charleston, with a population of about 5,000 and an unemployment rate of about 15 percent. Private Lynch's older brother, Gregory Jr., 21, enlisted in the Army on the same day as his sister; her younger sister, Brandi, 18, now a high school senior, has also enlisted and is due to begin her military service in August.
But the speed, then the horror, and now the relief of Private Lynch's personal journey has left people in this community overwhelmed, first with shock and now with jubilation for a young woman who had seen little of West Virginia, much less the world, when she left for the Army.
"She kept saying that this is what New York City must be like," said Glenda Nelson, a family friend who took Private Lynch on her first visit to Charleston for a shopping trip, just before she left for her Army post at Fort Bliss, Tex.
The two spent several hours shopping for clothes and other items Private Lynch needed, and Ms. Nelson said the young woman was much impressed by the lights and buildings in the state capital, a city of about 200,000.
"She is nothing but a wholesome West Virginia country girl," Ms. Nelson said. "I told her that she needed to get out and see some of the world. I didn't mean Iraq."
Ms. Nelson and her husband, Donald, sat in their kitchen today, staring at their own letter from Private Lynch, which arrived on Monday. In the time it took the letter, dated March 18, to make its way from Kuwait, Private Lynch's unit, the 507th Maintenance Company, was attacked during some of the first fighting in Nasiriya, she was declared missing in action for five days and yellow ribbons began to pop up all over town.
"We just bawled like babies when we got the letter," Mr. Nelson said today. "It just tore us apart to think of how scared she was or what might have happened to her."
But on Tuesday, a day after the letter arrived, the Nelsons and just about everyone else in this community quickly learned that the Lynches had received a telephone call saying their daughter had been rescued.
The news sent Wirt County into a frenzy, with friends, relatives, teachers, politicians, state troopers, firefighters and other residents descending upon the Lynch house at the end of Mulberry Lane.
This afternoon, Mr. Nelson said the ordeal just re-emphasized the power of community, prayer and what a special woman Private Lynch is. "She was smart and gentle, a good country girl," he said. "I think the reason she survived through this is that she is a true angel and God knows that he wants her with us for some more time."
"I hope to God that the whole country does not forget about what a special hero we have in Jessi Lynch," Mr. Nelson added, making clear that he had in mind some antiwar protesters who he believes have been too hard on the soldiers fighting in Iraq.
At Wirt County High School this morning, in Elizabeth, the county seat, the 300 students gathered in a packed auditorium to sing songs like "God Bless America" in honor not just of Private Lynch but also of other soldiers, some of them the brothers and cousins of students.
"When students here get out of school," said Rodney Watson, the high school softball coach, "it seems like there are two things they can do, which is either hang on the corner or go off to college or the military, and college takes money."
He remembers Private Lynch as the feisty right fielder who played for four years on his team. "Being scrappy probably helped her get through this thing," Mr. Watson said.
Gregory Jr., an Army private home on emergency leave from his base at Fort Bragg, N.C., acknowledged he had not been enthusiastic about his sister's decision to join the Army, partly out of brotherly concern and partly because he wondered whether a woman of her small stature could succeed as a soldier.
But he said of his sister: "She's strong-headed, and now that I've seen Jessi do it, I realize that it's possible."
This morning both West Virginia University and Marshall University, also in West Virginia, offered Private Lynch financial assistance to attend college and pursue her dream of becoming a teacher.
"We've read about her reason for joining the military," said David C. Hardesty Jr., the president of West Virginia University, "and along with her love for her country and her concern for the plight of the Iraqis, she wanted to better her life through a college education."
Aides to West Virginia's governor, Bob Wise, a Democrat whose office sent an official to assist the Lynch family the day she disappeared in Iraq, said he was considering issuing a proclamation declaring a "Jessica Lynch Day." The aides said dozens of calls of congratulations from other states have come in for the Lynch family and for West Virginians.
"I really do consider this a miracle in the mountains," Governor Wise said.
Ms. Lynch, who will turn 20 on April 26, had been assigned at Fort Bliss with the 507th Maintenance Company. She had recently re-enlisted for another four-year stint and was scheduled to be reassigned to duty in Hawaii starting in November.
From Kuwait, where she arrived with her unit in February, she found time to write to friends like Mrs. Davies and the Nelsons about the decisions that had taken her so far from home. "I've been traveling so much, but it's cool, because I want to," she wrote to Mrs. Davies on Feb. 21, adding: "Keep me and all soldiers in your prayers and thoughts, and we will do our best to protect you all."
Apart from brief glimpses of her strapped on a stretcher in video footage on television this morning, Private Lynch's relatives had learned little more about her condition today beyond what they first heard on Tuesday in a 6:15 p.m. telephone call from an Army colonel whom they would not name: that she had been rescued.
Pamela Nicolais, a cousin of Private Lynch, said that a military official told the family that she had "limped to a hospital in Iraq" after her unit was ambushed, and had been turned over to Iraqi forces.
Senior military officials provided only a few details about the intelligence that led to Private Lynch's rescue, but family members said they were told that she was located because an Iraqi doctor handed a note to a Marine indicating that she was at a hospital, listed the room number and added that she was being tortured.
Family members said they were told that she had a gunshot wound in the leg that military officials believe occurred during the ambush of her unit. But the family members also said they were heartened by the images they saw on television that showed her looking clear-eyed. 
The military did not publicly disclosed Private Lynch's injuries, but one military official confirmed that she did have multiple gunshot wounds and broken bones. No further details about how the injuries occurred were provided.
Through the nine days when Private Lynch was missing, the family held nightly prayer gatherings at their home, relatives said, and her parents in particular had never abandoned their belief that she was alive.
Inside her cramped living room, where she sat on an overstuffed green loveseat, Private Lynch's mother, Deadra, 40, said a motherly intuition she felt earlier on Tuesday had given her confidence her daughter would be found.
"I was up and down, but I just knew yesterday was going to be the day," Mrs. Lynch said. "A mama knows."

CORRECTION-DATE: April 4, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about rejoicing in Palestine, W.Va., over the rescue of Pfc. Jessica Lynch, a hometown soldier taken prisoner in Iraq, misstated the name of her street and the population of Charleston, the city she visited for the first time before leaving for the Army. The address is Mayberry Run, not Mulberry Lane. The population of Charleston is about 55,000, not 200,000.
CORRECTING THE RECORD; The Articles; Witnesses and Documents Unveil Deceptions In a Reporter's Work

On Sunday, May 11, 2003, The Times published a two-full-page accounting of misrepresentations and plagiarism by Jayson Blair, who resigned on May 1 as a reporter. This article was among those described. The description:

Rescue in Iraq And A 'Big Stir' in West Virginia
APRIL 3, 2003

WHEREABOUTS -- Hotels in the vicinity of Palestine, W.Va., had no record of Mr. Blair. His co-writer, as well as a photographer who was stationed at the Lynch home for The Times, said they did not see Mr. Blair. Mr. Blair gave his editors and his co-writer a number where he could be reached on April 2, the day the article was written. The number belonged to Glenda and Donald Nelson, friends of the Lynch family; the Nelsons said that they never met or spoke to Mr. Blair. The Nelsons live in Marmet, W.Va., about a two-hour drive from Palestine.

PLAGIARISM -- Mr. Blair describedthe Nelsons' talking about Private Lynch and a letter they had received from her: "Ms. Nelson and her husband, Donald, sat in their kitchen today, staring at their own letter from Private Lynch, which arrived on Monday. In the time it took the letter, dated March 18, to make its way from Kuwait, Private Lynch's unit, the 507th Maintenance Company, was attacked during some of the first fighting in Nasiriya, she was declared missing in action for five days and yellow ribbons began to pop up all over town.
" 'We just bawled like babies when we got the letter,' Mr. Nelson said today. 'It just tore us apart to think of how scared she was or what might have happened to her.' "
In an Associated Press article that ran on April 2, Ms. Barker wrote: "Before the war started, Private Lynch wrote a letter to family friends Glenda and Don Nelson. The letter, dated March 18, arrived on Monday. 'She said she was ready to go to war and was just waiting on President Bush's word, but I could tell she was scared,' said Don Nelson. 'We bawled like babies when we read it. It tore us up.' "
Mr. Blair also used details and quotations about a shopping trip to Charleston that was recounted in an Associated Press article from March 25. 
In addition, Mr. Nelson's quotation about Private Lynch being "a wholesome West Virginia country girl" appears to have been adapted from a comment in the April 2 Associated Press article made by Lorene Cumbridge, a cousin of Private Lynch. "She's just a West Virginia country girl. Warm-hearted. Outgoing," Ms Cumbridge said.
Readers with information about other articles by Jayson Blair that may be false wholly or in part are asked to e-mail The Times: retrace@nytimes.com.

HEADLINE: Former Mayor of Asbury Park Is Accused of Bribery Attempt 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, April 2 

 BODY:
A former Asbury Park mayor and a political aide were arrested today on federal charges that they had conspired to bribe a City Council member with the promise of "a seven-figure" payment in exchange for supporting a developer's bid to renew the city's oceanfront.
 Kenneth E. Saunders Sr., 58, who was mayor from 1996 to 2001, and Rayfield James Jr., 46, a local political operative, were arrested this morning at their homes in Asbury Park, a city in central New Jersey. The arrests brought to five the number of Asbury Park figures who have been charged with corruption by the United States attorney for New Jersey, Christopher J. Christie, in the last eight months. 
 According to the six-count indictment handed up by a grand jury, the two men tried in a series of meetings in the first six months of 2000 to persuade a council member to join a voting bloc supporting a redevelopment proposal for the city.
Prosecutors charge that the defendants told the council member that the developer would pay them for their votes through Mr. James in some instances, and in others give them an interest in the resulting project. The council member was secretly working with federal investigators and recorded many of the conversations, investigators said.
The indictment names neither the council member nor the developer.
Mr. Saunders, who also faces five counts of tax fraud, also promised that he would take steps to remove a local tax lien from a property owned by the council member, according to the indictment.
No money ever changed hands, said investigators, and the tax lien was never removed. But in recorded conversations, Mr. James, saying that he was acting as intermediary between the developer, Mr. Saunders, and the bloc of council members, promised that they would all be millionaires if they helped approve the $750 million to $1 billion redevelopment project, according to the indictment.
Mr. Saunders and Mr. James, in leg shackles and handcuffs, made their first appearance in Federal District Court here today. Magistrate Judge Mark Falk set $50,000 bail for each man and required Mr. James to undergo drug testing and drug treatment.
Mr. Saunders's court-appointed lawyer, Anthony Iacullo, said that his client had assured him that he had done nothing wrong. Mr. James's court-appointed lawyer, Kenneth Kayser, declined to comment, saying that he had yet to discuss the charges in any detail with his client.
Last October, an Asbury Park developer, Philip Konvitz, and a former city councilman, James Condos, were indicted on bribery and extortion charges in connection with the oceanfront redevelopment effort, and they are awaiting trial. Shortly after that, the Asbury Park city manager, Terrance Weldon, who was also the elected mayor of Ocean Township and a protege of Mr. Konvitz, was indicted on charges of accepting bribes from local developers in his role as mayor. Mr. Weldon pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing.
Mr. Christie, speaking after the court appearances, said, "Rest assured this office is not done in Asbury Park and Monmouth County."

Supreme Court Upholds State Law on Managed Care
States can require managed health care plans to accept any qualified doctor who wants to be a participating provider, the Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision that resolved a legal dispute over state health care regulation.
 The court upheld a 1994 Kentucky law that prevents H.M.O.'s from limiting the pool of doctors or from retaliating against doctors who recommend too many treatments or complain about working conditions. About half the states have enacted similar laws, known as "any willing provider" laws. Page A16.

HEADLINE: Paul H. Boeker, 64, Dies; Former Ambassador to Jordan 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, April 2 

 BODY:
Paul H. Boeker, a former United States ambassador to Jordan and Bolivia and president of a San Diego research institution aimed at strengthening ties between North America and Latin America, died on Saturday at his home in San Diego. He was 64.
 The cause was a brain tumor, his family said. 
 In 27 years in public service, Ambassador Boeker helped broker meetings between Jordan and Israel and assisted in Bolivia's transformation to democracy in the 1970's.
Mr. Boeker's foreign service career included postings in Germany and Colombia and service on the State Department Policy Planning Staff under Secretaries of State Henry A. Kissinger and George P. Shultz. From 1980 to 1983, he was director of the Foreign Service Institute, which trains government employees in foreign affairs and languages.
He was appointed ambassador to Bolivia by President Jimmy Carter, and served there from 1977 to 1980. He received the State Department's Superior Honor Award for protecting American lives during a coup in 1979.
Mr. Boeker later helped Bolivia shift its government structure from a military dictatorship to a democratic system, said Alexander Watson, a former ambassador to Peru who worked with him.
Under President Ronald Reagan, he was ambassador to Jordan from 1984 to 1987. He was credited with brokering secret meetings between Jordanian and Israeli officials on many issues, including telecommunications, counterterrorism and water sharing.
For the last 14 years of his career,he was president of the Institute of the Americas, on the campus of the University of California at San Diego. The privately financed institute works to strengthen political, economic and social ties between North America and Latin America.
Mr. Boeker was born in St. Louis on May 2, 1938. He graduated magna cum laude from Dartmouth College and received a master's degree in economics from the University of Michigan.
His wife, Margaret Macon Campbell Boeker of San Diego, said he had decided to become a diplomat in high school when he was an exchange student in Germany.
Besides his wife, he is survived by two daughters, a son and two grandchildren.

That Rare Mix: Passion, Politics and Urban Vision

BYLINE:  By David W. Dunlap 

 BODY:
IT does not speak well of the sum of impassioned expertise on urban planning at the highest levels of government that much of it was buried Monday at Arlington National Cemetery.
 Daniel Patrick Moynihan was all but unique among the nation's most prominent elected officials in having a vision of the built environment. That is less an elegiac sentiment than a reflection of the fairly low political stature of urban planning,a necessarily long-range endeavor that suffers in a system churned by election cycles and driven by popularity polls. 
 "There's nobody now to step into that empty niche," said David M. Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, an architect whose career intersected Mr. Moynihan's at two important junctures: the planning of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington in the late 60's and, more recently, the expansion of Pennsylvania Station into the James A. Farley Building across Eighth Avenue. 
Credited by admirers with having had a native eye for architecture, Mr. Moynihan, a four-term Democratic senator from New York, also benefited from sheer endurance. His most significant planning effort, the redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue, survived three presidential administrations. The transfer of Governors Island from federal to local control survived two.
And Pennsylvania Station has been gestating for a decade, through three mayors and two governors, though state officials say it will soon begin in earnest. (They have only been saying that since 1997.) Now scheduled for completion in 2008, it will be called the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Station.
"He said urban planning is not for the short-winded," recalled Alexandros E. Washburn, an architect who served on Mr. Moynihan's Senate staff and then as president of the Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment Corporation.
Mr. Moynihan was not short-winded. In either sense. He badgered balky federal agencies and "dithering" city and state officials over whom he had little or no control. Fairly typical was his outburst 20 years ago when the General Services Administration seemed to be taking too long to renovate the landmark Custom House on Bowling Green.
"I got $29 million authorized and appropriated to get on with it," Senator Moynihan said at the time. "What do we have to do? Go to court and get a writ of mandamus? Fix up the building!"
But he played more roles than sideline agitator. He was largely responsible for the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, which broadened the ways in which states could spend federal transportation money.
And long before his election to the Senate, he was vice chairman of the President's Temporary Commission on Pennsylvania Avenue. In that role, he seemed to be heir to the planning hubris of the day.
"We might build the first fully modern, fully human inner city setting in the nation, possibly in the world," Mr. Moynihan wrote in his foreword to the plan. But the tone of the document -- even the graphics -- told a different story. In 68 illustrations, one could count only about a dozen recognizable people, all of them white, to depict a city that was by then 75 percent black.
Contemporary critics, among them Clifford L. Alexander Jr., who had been chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the Johnson administration, deplored the focus on a ceremonial avenue when the city was trying to recover from the devastating riots of 1968. "Some of the scars are still there," Mr. Alexander said in an interview this week.
PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE does not have the vitality it could and should have had," said Mr. Alexander, who is now president of Alexander & Associates in Washington, a management consulting firm. "Mixed use doesn't mean a few grand spaces. It means jazz clubs and small townhouses and open parks where people actually come to play chess and basketball."
Though Mr. Moynihan was hailed as a preservationist, the 1969 plan called for demolishing the historic Willard Hotel and tearing down all but the tower of the cavernous Post Office Building. Both were saved and rejuvenated.
Ultimately, Pennsylvania Avenue was transformed into an imposing boulevard of plazas, squares, landscaping and new buildings. "The steadying hand of time weeds out some of the worst follies," said Mr. Childs, who was director of the plan. "Unfortunately, it also weeds out some of the best ideas."
One lost idea embraced by Mr. Moynihan involved relocating the Joe DiMaggio Highway from an elevated viaduct along the Hudson River, between 59th and 72nd Streets, to ground level. Invited by several civic groups in 1989 to tour the area, the senator took off zestfully into the rat-infested waterfront marshes.
"He's scrambling over the rocks, rattling on about the Peloponnesian War, DeWitt Clinton and chiding the labor guys about how much it costs to hire a bulldozer driver," said Kent L. Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society, one of the groups. "At the end of it he decided, 'This highway ought to be moved.' Moynihan's instant ability to see value in things wasn't exactly democratic, but it was visionary."

HEADLINE: Doomsday Budget 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
For months Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who prides himself on his salesmanship, has used the soft sell when it comes to Albany. 
 The mayor has continued to heap praise on Gov. George E. Pataki even after the governor proposed a budget in January that would hurt, not help, the city. And while he flew Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, on his private jet to Bermuda for some golf last year, both officials, who are in heated state budget negotiations, say that they have not felt much pressure from him lately. 
 Now Mr. Bloomberg is preparing to let his April 15 budget do his talking for him.
The mayor is preparing a doomsday backup plan with $1 billion in further spending cuts, and as many as 15,000 layoffs in it, in case the city fails to get the help it is seeking from Albany. The implications are clear: if state officials do not approve a $1 billion commuter tax, and all the other help that the city is seeking to balance its budget, they could end up shouldering the blame for draconian cuts and layoffs. 
For the tacit threat to work, though, it must be believed. 
Asked if she thought the contingency plan that is being drafted was a pressure tactic or a real possibility, Diana Fortuna, the president of the Citizens Budget Commission, noted that the two possibilities are not mutually exclusive.
"If these new cuts put pressure on Albany and the unions to act, so much the better," Ms. Fortuna said. "It's not as if these cuts are unrealistic. The city is going to have to cut another billion dollars if the commuter tax doesn't go through. It's going to have to cut another $600 million if the union savings don't go through."
Mayor Bloomberg says that he is simply doing the sensible thing: coming up with a plan for balancing the budget in case Albany does not come through or the economy takes longer to recover. "To sit here and wait for a problem is not prudent," he said.
And Bloomberg administration officials say that even if the billion-dollar backup plan can be averted, the city is still looking at roughly 5,000 layoffs in its next budget. That kind of budget pain, they say, can hardly be called crying wolf.
But this is not the first time that the mayor has come up with contingency cuts.
Last year at this time, when the city was also seeking help from Albany, Washington and the city's unions to balance its budget, the mayor came up with a $500 million backup plan that called for closing eight fire engine companies, shutting 15 centers for the elderly and eliminating some youth programs. 
Although the mayor did not get all of the outside help he was seeking, and the city's economy continued to worsen, further driving down tax collections, those contingency cuts were never fully made. The mayor found a way to get the federal government to pay for some centers for the elderly. He continues to try to close firehouses, but a year later, the issue is still being discussed by a commission he formed. 
Instead the mayor ordered many other, less onerous cuts, and persuaded the City Council to pass an 18.5 percent property tax increase to keep the budget in balance.
The news that Mayor Bloomberg was drawing up contingency cuts came as some of the city's budget partners were wondering about his game plan. 
Mr. Silver said this week that the mayor should be applying more pressure to get the commuter tax reinstated. "I think he hasn't been as vociferous about that part of his overall financial plan as he has to be," Mr. Silver said. 
When Mr. Bruno was asked if he had been lobbied heavily by Mr. Bloomberg, he said: "No, I've talked with him, you know, regularly. But I wouldn't say that any more than you'd expect."
And a union official who met recently with the mayor said that he had yet to take the unions up on their offer to press the state for him. "We offered to be the orchestra, with him as the conductor," the official said. "He hasn't raised the baton."
Come April 15, city officials say, the mayor hopes to shout out his own message. Whether the state listens this time is another matter.

HEADLINE: Amid Balking in Congress, Bush Will Fight for Smaller Tax Cut 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2 

 BODY:
Administration officials acknowledged today that it would be difficult for President Bush to persuade a skeptical Congress to pass his entire 10-year, $726 billion package of tax cuts, even though they said he would continue to fight for as large a plan as he could.
 "We understand that the president proposes, Congress disposes," said Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, in recognition of the reality that while the House passed the president's version of the tax cut, the Senate voted to reduce it by half, to $350 billion. The Senate vote reflected unease in the president's own party about cutting taxes in the middle of an expensive war. 
 Although Mr. Fleischer insisted that he was not signaling an administration willingness to compromise with Congress on the plan, prominent Republicans on Capitol Hill said they were now assuming that Congress would end up splitting the difference between the House and Senate versions, and that White House officials had told them they were coming to the same conclusion. 
"Publicly, they're going to say $726 billion until the bitter end, as they should," said one Republican member of Congress. "But we can provide a significant economic growth package at a $500 to $550 billion level."
Even at $550 billion, the Republican said, the tax package would be large enough to accommodate, with some delays, all the main provisions sought by the administration, including the elimination of the tax on stock dividends.
An administration official acknowledged the logic of that, even as he said that a $550 billion package was not yet agreed on.
"We've got a dilemma here in that 350 won't pass the House and 726 doesn't have a home in the Senate," the administration official said. "Based on the realities, how do we move forward? I don't think anybody has a solution right now."
Publicly, the administration kept up a determined front today. This afternoon, the president met with 13 Wall Street economists who avidly agree with him on the tax cut. Afterward, some in the group extolled the virtues of the plan to reporters waiting in the West Wing driveway as Treasury Secretary John W. Snow stood by. A number of the comments closely echoed the White House talking points on the plan. 
John Rutledge, the chief investment officer for Rutledge Capital, said that the tax cut was "not a Wall Street event, it's a Main Street event," and that "most of the benefits will be felt in the coffee shops."
Lizann Sonders, the chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab & Company, said the tax cut is "the answer to the economy, is the answer to the stock market and maybe most importantly it's the answer to bringing back trust and fairness and faith in the system."
The group did not include any of Wall Street's most prominent economists, many of whom are lukewarm on the plan. Nor did it include representatives from Wall Street's most prestigious investment firms: Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan Chase.
Edward F. McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs, said today that neither he nor anyone else from his firm had been invited.
Mr. McKelvey said he thought Mr. Bush's plan cost too much for the benefits it would provide to the economy. "Will it be stimulative?" Mr. McKelvey said. "Probably. Will it be greatly stimulative? Probably not."
Despite the White House public insistence that the Congress pass the entire $726 billion tax cut, Mr. Fleischer also said today that $3 billion proposed by Congressional committees to help the ailing airline industry was "excessive."

HEADLINE: Sour Mood Pervades the Economic Front 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 2 

 BODY:
While American optimism about the war in Iraq rose sharply today, American spirits about the economy are still being battered.
 Stock markets surged on hopes that American and British forces are closing in on victory in Iraq, but the mood among business executives and consumers is sour. 
 Every survey of manufacturers over the last month has shown a sharp increase in pessimism as executives complain about slumping demand for their own goods and higher prices for the materials they use to make them.
The Commerce Department reported today that factory orders dropped 1.5 percent in February, the steepest drop in five months. On Friday, economists predict, the government will report that unemployment rose again in March. 
Though the increase in joblessness is expected to be modest, the economy has already shed more than 600,000 jobs since November and two million since President Bush took office.
Consumers, whether because of anxiety about the war or because they have been preoccupied with the television coverage, have slowed their spending. Car sales declined last month, airline travel has dropped and retailers have reduced their expectations of growth for the year.
The trend is even worse in Europe and Japan, where growth has almost stalled entirely. As if that was not enough, tourism and travel through Asia are now being hurt by fears of the spread of the disease known as severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.
In effect, President Bush is being forced to fight wars on two fronts. Anxieties about the war in Iraq have slowed the economy, with businesses still reluctant to invest in new factories or expand their work forces.
But a growing number of analysts are skeptical that the economy will snap back quickly after the shooting subsides. The aftershocks of the stock market bubble still appear to inhibit investor confidence and corporate spending. 
"We have had three consecutive quarters of below-trend growth," said William C. Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs. "To explain all that on the basis of the war in Iraq seems to be a stretch."
Initial data from retailers indicates that consumers slowed their spending noticeably in the first week of the war. But it remains unclear whether they will rush back into stores when the war dies down.
On Tuesday, Instinet Research's survey of chain stores found that sales dropped by 2.8 percent last week, compared with those in the week a year earlier, and that March sales were off 1.5 percent.
A significant part of that decline stemmed from unusually bad winter weather, as well as the fact that the Easter weekend fell earlier last year.
But consumer surveys suggest that Americans have curbed their urge to shop. The most recent poll by ABC News and Money magazine, released on Tuesday, showed that consumer confidence remained near its lowest point in nine years.
In a poll by The New York Times and CBS News, taken from March 20 to 24, about 49 percent of the respondents said the economy was bad while 50 percent said it was good. 
Those attitudes constituted an improvement over the month before and may have reflected the initial surge of optimism that the United States and Britain would defeat Iraq within days.
In follow-up interviews today, at least some participants had returned to their earlier pessimism.
"I would not make any purchases at this time," said Robert Micheo, a retired probation officer in Los Angeles. "The economy is going down day by day, and it's going to get worse."
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has continued to express a comparatively sunny view that confidence will revive as soon as the "geopolitical uncertainties" abate.
But Fed officials say the uncertainties about the economy are so numerous that they cannot make any predictions. And the surveys of business sentiment by Fed regional banks have been extremely gloomy.
Earlier this week, the Philadelphia Fed's survey of manufacturers showed deteriorating conditions in several areas. Companies in the region reported that new orders and hiring declined sharply in March and that its broadest measure of manufacturing conditions had plunged.
The survey also relayed widespread complaints that the costs of inputs were rising while the prices for many finished goods declined slightly. The apparent conundrum stems in part from higher energy prices, but it may also reflect the effect of the dollar's decline, which pushes up the cost of imported goods.
The Fed banks in New York and Richmond, Va., reported similarly bleak assessments, while other surveys cast doubt on the chances for a quick rebound in industrial activity after the war. On Tuesday, a closely watched index of manufacturing activity by the Institute of Supply Management showed a much steeper drop than analysts had expected and reached its lowest level since November 2001. For the first time in five months, the index suggested that factories were contracting rather than expanding.
It remains unclear how much of this sluggishness stems from anxieties during the run-up to war. Analysts note that the economy has been hit by bad weather, the ripple effects of corporate governance scandals and the continued skittishness of investors who want to see stability rather than gangbuster growth.
Robert Mellman, senior economist at J. P. Morgan Chase Bank, said the war had almost certainly damped consumer spending at a time when consumer spending has been the only source of economic growth in this country.
"Consumer spending really has slowed down," Mr. Mellman said. "Part of it is because they're just staying at home and watching TV, but partly they are concerned."
Despite the economic woes right now, Mr. Mellman said he remained optimistic that the economy would speed up after the Iraq war. But that acceleration will probably not show up until at least midyear, he said, and unemployment is not likely to decline significantly before the end of this year.
Michael Prell, an economic consultant and former director of research at the Federal Reserve Board, said he was more skeptical. Even if the United States wins a quick victory in Iraq, he said, President Bush's strategy of pre-emptive action could create new tensions and political anxiety for multinational corporations and international investors.
"Even if the geopolitical outlook brightens, it could still take some time for the corporate sector to get up the nerve to increase investment and hiring," Mr. Prell told a conference in Washington last week.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY; 
This Fan's Fantasy Was Examining the Fine Print

BYLINE:  By RICHARD SANDOMIR with STU HACKEL 

 BODY:
When a Los Angeles Kings fan named Philip Propper read earlier this season that the Kings had lost $103 million since 1996, he thought the team had to be fiddling with its finances.
 "How could things be so bad?" wondered Propper, a portfolio manager and equity analyst with the Trust Company of the West, whose offices in Los Angeles are two blocks from Staples Center, the home of the Kings. 
 Propper thought it would have been easy for the Kings' owner, the Anschutz Entertainment Group, to manipulate profits into paper losses, then cry bad hockey economics, he said yesterday. "How could a team getting this many fans not be making money?" he said. 
Any fan, even one like Propper who is as savvy about profits and losses as he is about goals and assists, would feel whipsawed by wildly different financial figures. For example, Forbes reported that the Kings made $7 million in operating profits last season. To refute the report, the team let The Los Angeles Times look at its financial records late last year; a loss of $103 million, projected through the end of this season, was found in a seven-year period.
On a whim, Propper wrote a letter in February to Tim Leiweke, the Kings' president, volunteering to examine the team's financial statements.
"Mr. Leiweke, I am quite skeptical regarding this claim," Propper wrote, referring to the huge losses.
Rather than taking the conventional view -- that letting an outsider, a fan no less, audit the financial guts of a privately held corporation was a form of insanity -- the Kings embraced the idea, certain that even a skeptic like Propper would see what they saw: big losses. 
The team would not have opened its books to any old Kings fan with a jersey and a cap and a beer-cup holder, but they were comfortable with Propper's financial background. Leiweke told Dan Beckerman, the team's chief financial officer, to cooperate with Propper. 
"We wanted to set the record straight," Beckerman said. "We're not happy about losing all this money, and we're not bragging about it. But the flip side is we're also not complaining about it."
And so, Propper spent 10 hours over three days in February at Staples Center. "I went in with the bias that they were lying," Propper said.
Propper analyzed seven years of financial records, along with invoices that backed some expenses, and he peppered Beckerman with questions.
"Quite frankly, it was more thorough than most of the other audits we go through," Beckerman said. 
Propper emerged with surprising conclusions: that things were aslousy as the Kings said they were, that the team was not hiding money or shuffling it around the A.E.G. empire.
In a 21-page report he posted last night on a fan Web site, letsgokings.com, Propper estimated that the team's overall losses would be even higher than The Times's estimate. He said the team would post a cash loss of $12.5 million this season, bringing Anschutz's losses since acquiring the team to an unenviable $108 million. The biggest loss, $31.7 million, occurred in the 1998-99 season, he said.
Might fans eager to see him prove that the Kings were misers feel that Propper, their surrogate analyst, had betrayed them?
"At the end of the day, most intelligent people want to know the truth," he said. "They want to understand the numbers. But there are some who have emotional preconceptions that you can't change."
Propper, 42, grew up a Rangers fan on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, but after moving to Los Angeles in 1989, he slowly turned his allegiance to the Kings. His hockey-loving daughters turned him into a rabid fan, and now he splits a pair of season tickets in the back row of Section 119 at Staples Center.
"It's right on the blue line, where the Kings attack twice a game," he said.
A central conclusion of Propper's detailed financial analysis is that the rate of growth of the the Kings' payroll outstripped the team's increasing revenue. Over the past seven years, player costs grew 19 percent annually, while revenues increased 15 percent a year.
He estimates that if salaries had grown only 10 percent annually in the years since A.E.G. acquired the Kings, the Kings would have generated a $7 million cash profit last season.
"Why did Anschutz buy this team?" Propper said he had asked himself. "They figured that they'd build Staples, and knew what revenues would look like and thought salary growth would be about 8 to 10 percent. But salaries grew too fast. They may not have bought the team had they known this."
He said the Kings had not spent enough in marketing to fill the new arena with more than an average of about 15,000 paid customers each game.
Winning a Stanley Cup, of course, has also eluded the Kings.
Propper's sharpest criticism is reserved for the National Hockey League. He said that under Commissioner Gary Bettman, the league had needlessly overexpanded to 30 teams, forcing salaries higher and creating a wide revenue gap between the most affluent and poorest teams. His proposed solutions include eliminating four to six teams through contraction and consolidation.
A league spokeswoman, Bernadette Mansur, said of Propper's proposals: "A fan's look at the economics of one team provides a totally insufficient basis upon which to draw leaguewide conclusions. It appears the conclusions he drew were completely unrelated to the material he reviewed."
Although Beckerman would not comment on Propper's critique of the league, he agreed with one of Propper's fundamental points. "The current economic system," he said, "does not work for the Los Angeles Kings."

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW; 
Amnesia Closes One Door But Then Another Opens

 BODY:
"The Man Without a Past" was shown as part of last year's New York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from A. O. Scott's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 2; the full text is online at nytimes.com/movies. The film, in Finnish with English subtitles, opens today in Manhattan.
 Amnesia, at least of the kind that tends to afflict characters in movies and books, is both a terrifying condition and, at the same time, an appealing one. The title character in Aki Kaurismaki's lovely new comic fable, "The Man Without a Past," certainly does his share of suffering. A metal worker who arrives in a strange city by train, he is brutally mugged on a park bench and left for dead. His face shrouded in bandages, he stumbles out of the hospital and collapses on a riverbank. When he comes to, he has lost, in addition to his money and his shoes, his ability to recall anything about his previous life, including his name. (The final credits identify him simply as "M.") 
 But though he is estranged from himself and set adrift in an urban Finnish landscape that is shadowed by poverty and bureaucratic indifference, the man (played with soulful deadpan by Markku Peltola) is also liberated.
His hands are callused from work, and his handsome, double-thick pork-chop face has clearly weathered hardship and disappointment, but the new life he finds on the margins of society is touched by a peculiar kind of grace. He gains friendship among the homeless and destitute, a home in an abandoned shipping container, and love with a melancholy Salvation Army worker, Irma (Kati Outinen), who ladles out free soup by day and lies awake in her dormitory at night, listening to rock 'n' roll with intent, almost religious devotion.
Mr. Kaurismaki's previous film, "Juha," was black-and-white and silent. This one is full of bright color (including the glorious wind-scrubbed blue of the Nordic sky), exquisitely strange dialogue and music. As if struggling against an innate reticence, the people in "The Man Without a Past" speak slowly and formally, and the antic poetry they utter sneaks up on you after a beat.
The characters, in spite of their air of forlorn impassivity, reveal their quirks, their passions and the oddball dignity that unites them, with similar deliberateness. In addition to Irma, the man's new companions include an amiable drinker (Juhani Niemela) and his family, and Antilla (Sakari Kuosmanen), a security guard who is landlord of the shipping-container shantytown and who fancies himself a ruthless and fearsome enforcer of law and order.
The director is clearly a man very much enamored with the past: with old music and even older movies. The man, whose taste for what he calls "rhythm music" (meaning rockabilly, blues and vintage R&B) has survived his injury, transforms the Salvation Army band into a swinging combo, with the thrift-shop manager (Annikki Tahti) stepping in to sing lead when a woman's voice is required. The jukebox he salvages from a junk pile fortuitously reflects his preferences: the first selection it plays is "That Crawlin' Baby Blues" by Blind Lemon Jefferson.
Mr. Kaurismaki's cinematic reference points are similarly antiquarian, which is not to say that they are dated, or that his use of them is based on nostalgia or allusion for its own sake. "The Man Without a Past" has a sly, controlled silliness that recalls Preston Sturges, and a vision of resilience and nobility in hard times that suggests Charlie Chaplin without the sleeve-tugging sentimentality, or Frank Capra without the weakness for speechifying.
And like the great films of the 1930's and early 40's, it is at once artful and unpretentious, sophisticated and completely accessible, sure of its own authority and generous toward characters and audience alike -- a movie whose intended public is the human race. 
In a director's statement distributed with the publicity materials for "The Man Without a Past," Mr. Kaurismaki, with characteristically impish forthrightness, writes that "my social, economical and political views of the state of society, morals and love can hopefully be found from the film itself."
On the evidence of this hilarious and humane movie, these views are, like those of any great artist, at once perfectly clear and not easily summarized. His ethical ideals are perhaps most succinctly expressed in an exchange between the hero and a worker from the municipal utility company who runs a cable from a nearby power line to the man's makeshift home (and later helps repair the jukebox).
The electrician brusquely refuses payment, asking only the promise of future consideration in exchange for his favor: "If you see me lying face down in the gutter," he says, "turn me on my back."

HEADLINE: HAVENS; 
Drawn by Siren Call of Antiquing

BYLINE:  By AMANDA HESSER 

 BODY:
MY husband and I sat down on an old Napoleon III settee and took in the view. Around the room were all the makings of a 19th-century salon on the Left Bank -- French chests and armoires, a large red velvet divan -- and two well-dressed men occasionally glancing our way, assessing our worthiness to be there.
 The men were the owners of this shop, Alain Pioton Antiques in Hudson, N.Y., and we were tired shoppers seeking refuge on their tiny sofa. They have watched an endless stream of shoppers -- and shops -- pass through town in the 18 years since they opened there. 
 "In and out, in and out, they go," Byrne Fone, an owner of the shop, said. "Lots of people think it would be great fun to buy and sell junk." 
And an increasing number of them seem to be doing it. Hudson is now home to more than 50 antiques shops and has gained a reputation for being the antique maven's equivalent of nirvana. 
For my husband and me, antiquing was never an activity that sprang to mind, other than in jest. But an unfurnished apartment after a long renovation and an eternally bleak winter can lead people to desperate acts. We had done some shopping in New York City, where we live, and a trip to Denton & Gardner in SoHo sent us over the edge. We loved everything in the store, and could not afford any of it. A small end table for $2,500 drove us straight out of the place. A friend urged us to take a weekend trip upstate, where prices and pressures were lower.
Shortly after, we found ourselves in a rental car barreling up the Taconic State Parkway toward Hudson, a city of 8,000 that lies in a tight cluster on the eastern side of the Hudson River. The town was founded by whalers from Nantucket, but when the whaling industry declined, so did Hudson. Then, like many towns in the Northeast, it had brief industrial successes interspersed with stretches of depression. In the 1990's, antiques dealers began appearing, and they found (and were found by) weekenders who, with the economic boom, had money to burn. 
The antiques shops are mostly on Warren Street, a milelong strip that begins at the river and rises up the riverbank, cutting through the center of town. It was 11 in the morning when we parked our car on the east end and plotted our attack. We would go all the way down one side of the street and up the other, dismissing any stores that did not immediately interest us. When we arrived at the first store and pushed on the door, it did not budge. The shop was dark inside, despite the hours stated on the door. So was the next one. We looked up and down the street. There were cars whizzing by, but no people, other than a man far down the street, sweeping the sidewalk. Soon we were zigzagging our way down the street, trying to find a store that was open. 
Could it be a holiday? Or were all the dealers away at an antiques conference?
"No," one shopkeeper told us. "It's just like thatin Hudson. They come when they like."
One store's hours were listed as "Fri-Sun 11-5 or by chance."
And the dealers are laid back when they are there. One shopkeeper stayed out of view in a back room while we walked around the store. Somehow, from where our footsteps halted, he sensed that we were looking at a pile of old mug shots. "You like the convicts, eh?" he called to us from his desk. (They were $40 each after haggling.) Few dealers give the hard sell. Generally, they respond to a shopper's presence more like a sleeping cat hearing a familiar noise. They shift position in their chair, nod vaguely or sigh. 
The dealers seem to fall into three categories, those who specialize in a particular period or country of origin, those who have eclectic tastes and may show Windsor chairs with a shag rug, and those whose stores are more like junk shops, piled high with things like Bakelite-handle knives, dolls and old milk bottles.
The period shops are like time capsules. As we strolled through a store called 20th Century Gallery, it felt as if we were walking through the set of "North by Northwest." There were sofas with low squared arms, tall brass lamps, chrome tables and plenty of blue and olive. 
Warren Street is wide, offering an expansive sense of the air and sky. For city dwellers, it felt like an escape to the country, with all the rejuvenating qualities we desired. Antiquing is a workout for the legs and the mind, too. It stirs up memories, gives ideas and calls into question design choices from the past. My husband, whose normal tolerance for shopping is about 10 minutes, was leading the way down the street, keeping a mental list of everything that interested us.
"I've noticed a pattern in these stores," he commented over lunch at Earth Foods, a bustling natural foods diner that smelled deliciously of sauteed onions. "The smaller and more unpleasant-looking the dog, the smaller and more expensive the antiques." 
In many stores we had to step over a dog to make our way inside. The dogs had learned long ago that it wasn't worth moving for every customer.
We saw just one cat in town. Its name was Blackie, and it reigned lazily over an odd and engaging shop called Keystone at the top of Warren Street. Blackie lay on a counter near a collection of male mannequins. Beyond them was a vast array of porcelain sinks ($150 to $1,200), old solid-oak doors, iron heating grates, worn butcher blocks ($225 to $350) and even a lamppost or two, should one be needed. 
Perhaps the most likable aspect of Hudson, other than Blackie, is its clash of cultures. Wedged between antiques shops at the top of Warren is Samuel Sutty & Son, a place that time forgot. Inside are a roasted-peanut cart and an old brass scale for weighing candy. The store is operating, we were told, but not when we were there on a Saturday afternoon. Down the street is an orthopedic shop with a window display that appears not to have been changed in 50 years. And sprinkled around the center of town are at least three old firehouses, or "hose companies" as their signs say, each boasting its company name.
Gallery East, a tiny store with walls painted celadon green and a brilliant selection of Asian antiques, is one of the newer arrivals in Hudson, having opened in May. The owner, Michael Corsentino, regularly travels to Asia on buying trips and keeps in his store a tailored collection, from a standing 16th-century Buddha for $11,000 to antique Thai silk bed quilts, which range from $125 to $250. It was here that we made our first big purchase, a Burmese prayer box with clawfeet and a slot on top for dropping in prayers. 
Our last stop was Kitchen. It was open, not surprisingly, way past its stated hours. As in most of the places we visited, we were the only shoppers, marveling at an old butcher table so worn that its surface was like a roll of waves ($850), white ironstone platters veined from age ($50 to $90) and a cabinet with sections marked "grocery clean," "grocery soiled," "meat clean" and "meat soiled" ($825). 
The next day, we decided to hit two smaller burgeoning antiques towns nearby. Millbrook, whose main street is more of a dash on a map, has a few shops that are worth a detour. Red School House specializes in early American furniture and art, and Red Coral, down the street, sells a selection of antique pieces reupholstered with high-energy modern prints. (The town is also home to the Tinhorn, a small low-key restaurant with a fireplace and a good chef who prepares dishes -- like Caesar salad, baby chicken over polenta and apple cobbler -- with restraint.) 
The antiques highlight was yet to come. On the way out of Millbrook, we stopped at Yellow Church Antiques. In the cavernous shop is a collection of magnificent antiques. It is difficult not to gasp like a yokel, as my husband did, at the prices -- a George II walnut bureau bookcase for $185,000 -- but then it's a treat to see such rarefied furniture. 
On our way back to Manhattan, we stopped in Cold Spring, where one store specializes in old clocks and another in vintage toys. And there is quite a good restaurant called Le Bouchon, with red lacquered walls and a marble hearth. Tired from shopping and all the fresh air, we ate quietly, nibbling a croque-monsieur and pork rillettes on toasts with a glass of Cotes du Rhone.
We were back by late afternoon. We had bought that French settee from Alain Pioton Antiques at what we considered a bargain price, and during the week that followed we decided to buy a Syrian mirror that we had seen, as well. There was no hurry. It is not like shopping at a store in Manhattan where if a shopper pauses to consider the purchase, the piece is gone.
We negotiated with a trucking company and had the settee and the mirror shipped to us. The settee looked better and worse than we had remembered. The shape worked perfectly in our den. But en route its base had cracked. So I guess we won't sit on it.

HEADLINE: POP AND JAZZ GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.

CLAUDIA ACUNA QUINTET, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Ms. Acuna, a young jazz singer from Chile, is committed to the idea of a jazz singer as an inseparable part of the band -- or better, as a bandleader. She is working with a great crop of New York musicians, including Jason Lindner, Omer Avital and Avi Lebovitch, and they play around with mambos, Middle Eastern scales and improvising that goes far beyond mere accompaniment. Tonight through Sunday night at 7:30 and 9:30; cover charge is $20, $15 on Sunday (Ben Ratliff).

ALBITA, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. Albita Rodriguez, a Cuban singer now living in the United States, brings a rocker's stage presence and a deep, gritty voice to old-fashioned songs filled with an expatriate's nostalgia and a lover's passions. Tonight through Sunday night at 8 and 10:30; $35 cover and $5 minimum at tables, or $20 admission at the bar (Jon Pareles).

* STEVEN BERNSTEIN'S DIASPORA SOUL, Leonard Nimoy Thalia Theater, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400. Best known for leading the raucous jazz-funk party band Sex Mob, Mr. Bernstein, the trumpeter, has done a little intuitive musicology and a little searching of his own roots to draw a connection among the cha-cha, Southern soul music of the 60's and the harmonic movement of the Jewish hora. The surprise is that the results don't sound too mixed up; the album "Diaspora Soul" (Tzadik) is full of stately moments. Tonight at 8:30; tickets are $21, $16 for members, $18 for students and 65+ (Ratliff).

* COMMON, GANG STARR, TALIB KWELI, FLOETRY, Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Common's most recent album, "Electric Circus" (MCA), was hit and miss; it's now clear that he should leave the singing to the singers. But live, he remains one of hip-hop's most exciting performers, leading his band through long, loping phrases while hardly pausing for breath. He is to be joined by the traditionalist duo Gang Starr, the long-winded Talib Kweli and the sing-rapping act Floetry; it should be a great show. Sunday at 6:45; tickets are $31 (Kelefa Sanneh).

CORY BRANAN, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. Cory Branan, from Memphis, has women on his mind throughout his album, "The Hell You Say" (Madjack). His songs recall his crushes backed by raw-boned country rock or stripped-down acoustic guitar, with a blunt economy that hints at both Steve Earle and Loudon Wainwright III. Sunday night at 7, with Bottle of Justus, Freeloader and the Honorary Title opening; admission is $8 (Pareles).

GEORGE COLEMAN QUARTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662. Mr. Coleman, the tenor saxophonist probably best known for the great couple of years he spent with Miles Davis's early-60's quintet, often plays around town with the pianist Harold Mabern. These two men, adept at the postbop rhythmic and harmonic vocabulary, are from Memphis and have a lot of history between them, and it shows. Mr. Mabern is on hand in this group, along with the bassist John Webber and the drummer Joe Farnsworth. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $20 (Ratliff).

DEICIDE, L'Amour, 1545 63rd Street, near 15th Avenue, Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, (718) 837-9506. The Florida band Deicide, for all its militancy -- lyrics vilifying Christianity, studded breastplates, beefy arms -- makes unremarkable meat-and-potatoes death metal: buzz-saw guitar themes in minor modes gave way to fast, narrow two-beat drum thrashing. Glen Benton, leader and demagogue, uses the genre's generic low growl; it's business as usual, no big deal. (He also prefers to present himself as being against organized religion rather than, uh, pro-Satan.) But here at L'Amour, the New York area's main metal club, the band stands a better chance of creating an interesting scene. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $18 (Ratliff).

DJ LE SPAM AND THE SPAM ALLSTARS, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. This party imported from Miami puts a disc jockey together with live musicians, mixing Latin rhythms with electronic beats. Tonight at midnight, with music till dawn; admission is $12 (Pareles).

DORGON AND JAMIE SAFT, Roulette, 228 West Broadway, at White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-8242. Dorgon plays the C-melody saxophone, and he's a bit of a practical joker; one of his recent albums gave no information other than to say that it was recorded in 1949 aboard a ship called the Bhutan, with the Lennie Tristano Big Band. (How far can you trust a guy named Dorgon?) But he makes modest, likable free jazz with different partners; tonight it's with the keyboardist Jamie Saft, who loves to add sound-warping effects to his Fender Rhodes. Tonight at 8:30; admission is $10 (Ratliff).

* GREEK MUSIC FESTIVAL, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400; Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-2824 or (212) 545-7536. The World Music Institute's fourth annual Greek festival reaches deep into Mediterranean traditions. The first night presents something rarely seen in New York: the Greek shadow-puppet theater called Karaghiozis, performing a tale of warfare and heroism that could have unexpected contemporary resonance. Athos Danielis leads a troupe that includes puppeteers and a full live orchestra with Greek instruments. Tonight at 8 at Symphony Space; tickets are $26, $21 for World Music Institute members. "Emigration Blues" presents a program that ranges across a century of urban songs, from the street-life tales of rembetika to laiko folk songs, performed by Petros Gaitanos, Sofia Papazaoglou and an eight-piece band. At Town Hall tomorrow at 8; tickets are $25 to $40. The festival concludes Sunday with music and dance from Asia Minor, where Greek and Turkish, European and Asian elements intertwine, performed by the Gledistades Ensemble from Lesbos and by a quintet of musicians with roots in Smyrna. At Symphony Space on Sunday night at 7; tickets are $26, $21 for World Music Institute members (Pareles).

VIVIAN GREEN, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. With songs like diary entries, Vivian Green surveys the emotional roller coaster of love. She's a neo-soul songwriter who's fond of slinky 1970's funk, and her tautly focused singing can hint at the specifics that her psychobabble lyrics often lack. Tonight at 8; admission is $15 (Pareles).

* FRED HERSCH AND NORMA WINSTONE, Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8770. Mr. Hersch, the pianist, who has a rare command of the piano as a solo instrument or when backing up a singer, will appear with the vocalist Norma Winstone, playing music from a lovely, contemplative new record they've made, "Songs and Lullabies" (Palmetto). Sunday night at 7:30; cover charge is $15 (Ratliff).

FRANK LACY QUINTET, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, below Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063. Mr. Lacy is one of the most charismatic trombone players in jazz -- a pretty charismatic bunch to begin with -- and his music is raucous and funereal, frightful and happy and mournful, from bebop to rhythm-and-blues to free improvisation. For a long while in the 90's, he was a member of Roy Hargrove's sextet, and he was part of the incredible band that backed the rhythm-and-blues singer D'Angelo, playing honest-to-God jazz solos for crowds of thousands. Tomorrow night at 9 and 10:30; admission is $12 (Ratliff).

* LOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO THE MAMAS AND THE PAPAS, Fez, 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. The pop archivists of the Loser's Lounge revisit the mid-1960's hits of the Mamas and the Papas, the transplanted Greenwich Village folkies whose chiming harmonies helped define California pop. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; admission is $20 (Pareles).

THE LOST CHAMBERS OF THE FIFTH ELEMENT, CB's 313 Gallery, 313 Bowery, at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 677-0455. Onomatopoeia turns into hip-hop rhythm when the microphone is in the hands of beatboxers like Doug E. Fresh. He is presenting dozens of human beatboxers at this show. Tonight at 6:30; admission is $8 (Pareles).

HUGH MASEKELA, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. The South African fluegelhornist Hugh Masekela has more to offer than his international hit "Grazing in the Grass." For decades, he has brought together the three-chord lope of South African pop with the zigzagging possibilities of jazz. He's leading a band featuring South African musicians who performed in the documentary "Amandla!" and the La Guardia High School Symphonic Choir. Tonight at 8; tickets are $23 to $74 (Pareles).

* THE NOTWIST, the Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. Introspection meets programming in the songs of the Notwist, a band from Bavaria. Markus Archer sings gently about his doubts and estrangement over backdrops that might mix a lone banjo or piano with computerized ticking and pulsations. The easy comparison is Belle and Sebastian meets Stereolab, but the songs reveal their own brittleness and depth. Tonight at 10, with James Yorkston and Styrofoam opening; tomorrow night at 10 with Styrofoam and the Burnside Project opening. Tickets are $12 in advance, $15 the day of the show (Pareles).

OF MONTREAL, Europa Night Club, 98-104 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723. Of Montreal, part of the Elephant Six collective of neopsychedelic bands in Athens, Ga., plays giddy, optimistic, harmonically rambling songs by Kevin Barnes, who is clearly a Beach Boys and Beatles fan. It shares the bill with Cory McAbee and Marshmallow Coast. Sunday at 9; tickets are $10 (Pareles).

WILLIAM PARKER'S LITTLE HUEY ORCHESTRA, the Center at Old St. Patrick's Cathedral, 268 Mulberry Street, Little Italy. There have been as many as 27 members in this big band, playing in the language of free jazz even if they're actually playing compositions, and it's full of sustained ferment; the sound of the music has connections to Charles Mingus's most pugnacious work of the 1950's, with musicians piling into the fray one by one and fighting for space. Also on the bill both nights are a duet of Hyoshiko Chuma and Frank London, and Patricia Nicholson's PaNic. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; admission is $20 (Ratliff).

* HOUSTON PERSON QUARTET, Rose Center for Earth and Space, American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100. Mr. Person, a veteran tenor saxophonist, keeps things pleasurable. His background is in the 1950's, when a good deal of jazz was completely submerged in rhythm and blues, and he's one of the few mainstream jazz performers today who can routinely find access to the deep language of pleasure from that time. (Most of the others became session musicians, went deeper into the studiousness of jazz or into the meat and potatoes of rock 'n' roll or disappeared.) Mr. Person has an elastic, sequential solo-building style that links him to Sonny Rollins, and occasionally a fat, breathy tone that links him to Ben Webster. Enjoy him. Sets are tonight at 5:30 and 7. Suggested admission: $12; $9 students and 60+; $7 ages 2 to 12. (Ratliff).

PROJECT OBJECT, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144. Frank Zappa's music was never easy to play. It called for players who loved both basic three-chord rock and all the whizzing, swerving, whimsical complexities that Zappa could devise. Musicians are still willing to devote themselves to its wayward intricacies, and Project Object has been working its way through the Zappa repertory for years; it has material from a new CD. Tomorrow night at 8, with Homunculus opening; admission is $20 (Pareles).

* WILLIS ALAN RAMSEY, MALCOLM HOLCOLMBE, Village Underground, 130 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 777-7745. Willis Alan Ramsey made his self-titled, one and only album in 1972, but his bluesy voice and jovial eye influenced countless sly, down-home songwriters, notably Lyle Lovett, who went on to collaborate with him on songs like "That's Right (You're Not From Texas)." A song he tossed off, "Muskrat Love," became a hit for the Captain and Tenille and left him financially secure. Asked if he would make a follow-up album, Mr. Ramsey reportedly replied, "What was wrong with the first one?" Still, hopes remain. But since the album's rerelease in 1999 (on Koch), he has been giving rare performances outside Texas. Sharing the bill is Malcolm Holcombe, whose grizzled, slurred voice sounds completely convincing in folky songs about endless, uncertain wanderings. Sunday night at 6; admission is $10 (Pareles).

* RUSTED ROOT, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. The neo-hippie spirit lives on in Rusted Root, a jam band with the supposedly tribal sound of a drum circle at its core. Tonight at 9; tickets are $24 (Pareles).

SCENE CREAMERS, MIIGHTY FLASHLIGHT, Europa, 98-104 Meserole Avenue, at Manhattan Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718) 383-5723. Scene Creamers is the new band from Ian Svenonius and Michelle Mae, who made a joyless noise together in the faux-gospel group the Make-Up. The debut Scene Creamers album is "I Suck on That Emotion" (Drag City), a batch of cagey, stylized songs that draw from a wide range of late-60's rock. Miighty Flashlight is a mysterious (and often compelling) folk-rock solo project from Mike Fellows, formerly of the pioneering emo band Rites of Spring. Tonight at 9, with the Holy Ghost; admission is $8 (Sanneh).

SUSAN TEDESCHI, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. The singer and guitarist Susan Tedeschi stirs together blues, soul and funk, singing about love troubles in a clear, forthright voice and leading a first-rate band that can carry the songs into jam-band territory. Tomorrow night at 8, with Paul Rishell and Annie Rains opening; tickets are $22.50 in advance, $25 tomorrow (Pareles).

* 2 MANY DJ'S, FC/KAHUNA, Pianos, 158 Ludlow Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 505-3733. The Belgian duo 2 Many DJ's never disappoints: its approach -- juxtaposing and remixing familiar songs in unexpected ways -- may be obvious, but it's also just about foolproof. FC/Kahuna, a British duo, recently released a CD called "Machine Says Yes" (Nettwerk), a seductive album that moves from grimy electro to glamorous disco. This should be a euphoric night of dance music, provided you can get in, so arrive early and be prepared to stay late. Tomorrow night at 10, with Errol Alkan and many other DJ's; admission is $10 (Sanneh).

WADADA LEO SMITH, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. An icon of 1970's jazz vanguardism and one of jazz's great mystics, Mr. Smith is originally a trumpeter, but in performance he can be a poet or a flute player or whatever he wants to be that day. Tonight he performs with Ikue Mori, on electronic percussion; tomorrow with the saxophonist Anthony Braxton, another great cult figure of the same vintage. Both nights at 8 and 10; admission is $15 tonight and $25 tomorrow (Ratliff).

JAMES SPAULDING AND SOUND SPECTRUM, Up Over Jazz Cafe, 351 Flatbush Avenue, at Seventh Avenue, Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, (718) 398-5413. The saxophonist and flutist James Spaulding has often worked as an unheralded sideman: in the World Saxophone Quartet and in bands led by David Murray, Max Roach, Horace Silver, Wayne Shorter and on back to a Sun Ra band in the late 1950's. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $20 (Ratliff).

TRIBUTE TO LIONEL HAMPTON, Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121. The vibraphonist Terry Gibbs leads the tribute, with David Newman, Joey DeFrancesco and Howard Alden as guests; the Eugene Maslov Trio will also appear.

HEADLINE: Royal Ahold to Sell Its South American Businesses 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, April 3 

 BODY:
Royal Ahold, the troubled multinational food retailer based in the Netherlands, said today that it planned to sell its South American businesses, including the Argentine store chain where some of its problems arose, to raise cash and reduce debt.
 The announcement presents the other grocery heavyweights who have ambitions in the region -- Carrefour and Casino of France, and Wal-Mart Stores -- with an opportunity to expand rapidly, particularly in Brazil and Argentina. 
 But, given the odor of scandal hanging over Ahold's management, its accounting practices and its choice of partners in the region, analysts say that prospective buyers will be able to demand a considerable discount off the asking price, thought to be around $850 million. And they will want to go through the company's books with great care before closing a deal. 
Ahold, the world's third-largest retailer, said it wanted to reduce its $12.9 billion in debt by selling the 429 supermarkets it owns in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Peru, with total sales of $2.5 billion last year. 
It was already in talks to sell its Chilean stores to Cencosud, a local group, when the accounting scandal at the company became public Feb. 24. The company said then that it had found inflation of profits in its American distribution unit, U.S. Foodservice, and in its Argentine chain, Disco. Its chief executive and chief financial officer resigned.
Market interest so far is focusing on the units that are seen as the jewels in Ahold's Latin crown -- the Bom Preco and G. Barbosa chains in Brazil, with combined sales last year of $1.4 billion, and Disco, No. 2 in Argentina behind Carrefour, with sales of $820 million. 
In Brazil, analysts said, interested buyers may include the local market leader, Pao de Acucar; Carrefour, its main rival; and Wal-Mart, which is far behind at about 2 percent of the market. Grupo Sonae of Portugal, whose Big and Modelo chains now have nearly 5 percent of the Brazilian market, is also mentioned. 
For either Carrefour or Pao de Acucar, which is part-owned by Casino, Carrefour's French rival, the Ahold chains would be an especially good fit, because the Ahold-owned stores are mainly in the country's northeast, where neither French-owned chain has a strong presence; buying them would give either a nearly nationwide network.
For Wal-Mart, buying the Ahold stores would more than triple its market share at a stroke, to more than 7 percent. 
The new head of Carrefour's Brazilian operations, Eric Uzan, said last month that his company planned to grow by building stores rather than buying them, and would invest $175 million in the country this year. But the temptation to snap up the Ahold stores could prove hard to resist. 
The same may be said of Casino, a unit of Rallye, and Wal-Mart in Argentina. For either, buying Disco would instantly lift it to a market position just behind Carrefour, the market leader. 
"All the three big global groups are natural candidates," said Adriano Petoli, retail sector analyst at Tendencias, a Sao Paulo consultancy. "The question is, who is willing to pay, and how much." 
There is also the question of financing. The market's appetite for new bonds from European retailers is much lower than two years ago, analysts said, especially to finance foreign expansion, where many European retailers have burned their fingers in recent years. 
Opinions on how much Ahold will ask for its South American operations ranged from $540 million to $850 million, with some $400 million of that for Brazil.
"That's no small ticket," said Daniel Pasquali, retail analyst at Fator Doria Atherino, a Sao Paulo brokerage firm. "I don't think there's going to be a mad rush." 
One London-based banker involved in putting together the sale predicted that buyers would demand a sizable discount, because Ahold is effectively juggling three scandals in three countries. 
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission began investigating Ahold's accounting practises in February after the company, which owns the Stop & Shop and Giant supermarkets in the United States, admitted to overstating 2002 earnings by $500 million. 
Then Ahold itself said that it was looking into its own acquisition of Disco from Grupo Velox, a family business empire with banking interests in several countries. Several Velox executives have been arrested and jailed in Uruguay on suspicion of illegal financial transactions. 
A third component appeared just this week, when Ahold's auditors, Deloitte & Touche, refused to sign off on the sale of Ahold's Chilean unit, Santa Isabel, and the company's shares were suspended on the Santiago bourse. 
All that will probably depress the sale price. 
"The early pitches will be low balls," the banker said. "And then, we can expect the due diligence to be pretty extensive, to say the least. What would normally be taken on trust, will be closely scrutinized. People will do their damnedest to find any quirks in the numbers."

HEADLINE: Service Industries Contracted Last Month 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3 

 BODY:
Service industries contracted in March by the greatest amount since October 2001 and jobless claims last week were the highest in almost a year, government and industry reports showed today.
 The Institute for Supply Management said its index for retail, financial services, construction and other nonmanufacturing businesses fell to 47.9 last month from 53.9 in February. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction. 
 The beginning of the United States-led war against Iraq on March 19 contributed to the first decline in demand for services in 14 months as consumer confidence hit a decade low and companies cut jobs. The Labor Department said today that initial claims for jobless benefits rose 38,000, to 445,000, last week, a sign that the monthly jobs report Friday may be weaker than some economists forecast.
"The run-up to war brought the economy to a near standstill," said Jade Zelnik, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Conn.
David Rosenberg, the chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch, said the claims report was consistent with his prediction that unemployment in March would be higher and job losses greater than most had estimated. The Labor Department is expected to say that the economy shed 35,000 jobs last month and the jobless rate rose 0.1 percentage point, to 5.9 percent, based on the median forecasts of 67 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
The service index was expected to show slower growth by slipping to 52, based on the median forecast by 50 economists. The index is based on a survey of more than 370 retailers, wholesalers and other nonmanufacturing firms.
"A substantial amount of the drop can probably be attributed to uncertainty -- people not doing anything," said Ralph Kauffman, chairman of the institute's nonmanufacturing business survey committee. "The potential for growth is there after the war, and we'll just have to see whether it comes to pass."

HEADLINE: Moody's and Fitch May Cut Reynolds Tobacco Credit Rating 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings said yesterday that they might cut the credit rating of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings in the near future.
 A downgrading of the credit rating could intensify the turmoil in the market for municipal bonds backed by revenue from the 1998 settlement between the states and the four big cigarette makers. 
 Moody's helped start a sell-off in the so-called tobacco bond market on Tuesday after it reduced the credit rating for Altria, the parent of Philip Morris, two notches, to Baa1, and cut the credit ratings on $18 billion of existing tobacco bonds. All the new ratings are still investment grade. 
Yesterday, Moody's said that R. J. Reynolds faced the same problems that prompted it to downgrade Altria. These problems include a lawsuit similar to the one that Philip Morris lost on March 21 in an Illinois state court. The $10.1 billion judgment against Philip Morris requires the posting of a $12 billion bond before an appeal can be made. The possibility that the size of the bond could lead Philip Morris to file for bankruptcy -- and threaten the annual payments that back the tobacco bonds -- is what has upset investors in this market.
In discussing the case against R. J. Reynolds, which was also filed in Illinois, Moody's said that it "believes that given the difficulty of the jurisdiction, a loss for R. J. Reynolds has a significant chance of occurring if the trial does take place.
"In case of loss, R. J. Reynolds's bonding requirements could potentially be of the same magnitude as for Philip Morris USA," Moody's said.
Fitch said that R. J. Reynolds "may face severe strain on its financial flexibility if the company receives a material adverse judgment in this case and Illinois bond-cap legislation has not passed by that time."
A panel of Illinois state legislators yesterday rejected one version of bond-cap legislation that would have reduced the $12 billion bond that Philip Morris needs to post while it pursues an appeal. Under the proposal the panel rejected, the company would have had to put up just $1.2 billion during the appeals process.
A Philip Morris spokesman said that it did not testify on behalf of the bill and that it anticipated that Illinois lawmakers would soon consider another proposal that the company viewed as more favorable.
"We are encouraging the legislature to come up with something more reasonable," the Philip Morris spokesman said.
The current Moody's credit rating for R. J. Reynolds senior unsecured debt is Baa2, while the Fitch rating is BBB. Those are both still investment grade. But because R. J. Reynolds's current ratings are lower then the new rating for Altria, a two-notch downgrade by each credit agency would cut the R. J. Reynolds rating to noninvestment grade, or junk bond status.
In a separate move yesterday, Fitch downgraded Altria's credit rating two notches, to BBB+, and the credit ratings on the existing tobacco bonds.

HEADLINE: Officials Warn Of Cuts' Impact On Health Care 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 3 

 BODY:
An association of county health officials warned today that proposed reductions in state aid next year would lead to drastically curtailed health services, affecting everything from cancer screenings to home health care and possibly leaving their communities vulnerable to disease outbreaks and bioterrorism.
 Members of the New York State Association of County Health Officials said at a news conference here that their resources had already been stretched thin by local budget cutbacks, as well as the increased costs of immunizing people against smallpox and responding to anthrax and the mysterious respiratory disease SARS. 
 "We will not have a workable public health system if this budget goes through," said Dr. Lloyd F. Novick, the association's president and the health commissioner of Onondaga County, which includes Syracuse. 
Facing an $11.5 billion budget gap in the next two years, Gov. George E. Pataki has proposed reducing state aid to local health departments to $168 million from $213 million next year. State officials said the $45 million cut would come from a reduction in the reimbursement rates to local governments, to 30 percent from 36 percent, for health services required by law. The state would also no longer reimburse optional health services like home health care and efforts to prevent West Nile virus. 
But many local health officials say the state cuts go much deeper, because a large chunk of the $168 million in state aid -- about $68 million -- would be used to reimburse the counties for expenses they had already incurred. 
Kevin C. Quinn, a spokesman for the State Division of the Budget, said that even allowing for the proposed cuts, state aid to local health departments was 30 percent, or $39 million, more than it was when Governor Pataki took office in 1995. 
"The fiscal challenges that New York is facing have required difficult choices," he said. "But Governor Pataki knows that if we make the right choices today, that will create new jobs and strengthen the economy so that we will have new revenues in the future to continue making investments in these types of programs."
The New York State Association of County Health Officials has intensified its lobbying efforts with health officials and lawmakers. Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, chairman of the Assembly Health Committee, said restoring money for public health was one of his priorities. 
"It's an easy target for cutting," Mr. Gottfried said. "But the money goes for a broad range of things that are, literally, life and death."
Dr. Novick said that while the counties receive federal grants to prepare for bioterrorism -- about $1 per resident under a new program -- that will not be enough to make up for the state cuts.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
American companies are adjusting almost everything that represents them overseas.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
WITH the recent surge in petition drives, demonstrations, even physical attacks that equate brands born in the United States with imperialism or militarism, advertisers are confronting perhaps the most sustained anti-American feelings abroad since the Vietnam War.
 For marketers like the Northwest Airlines division of the NWA Corporation, which introduced a redesigned look for its fleet of airplanes yesterday, the current conditions were carefully considered. 
 In developing the new look, "we led off with the idea that this is a time for a conservative brand strategy in a conservative world, a sobered America," said John Diefenbach, partner at TrueBrand in San Francisco, a consulting company.
The graphic overhaul, in which the letters "NWA" are played up more than the Northwest name, represents a balance, Mr. Diefenbach said, in that "NWA is more global than Northwest, but at the same time it's about being a very proud American company that represents the American heartland" from its headquarters in Minneapolis. 
The changes at Northwest are indicative of shifts being studied by United States-based corporations with multinational businesses in the wake of backlash over the war in Iraq.
For instance, the Adbusters Media Foundation in Vancouver, British Columbia, which fights what it considers the overcommercialization of culture, is organizing a protest called Boycott Brand America; a petition on its Web site (www.adbusters.org) had almost 36,000 signatures as of yesterday. And the Qibla Cola Company in Derby, England, which is selling its soft drink as a Muslim alternative to Coca-Cola or Pepsi-Cola with a campaign carrying the theme "Liberate your taste," urged consumers yesterday to boycott American brands sold globally.
"It's an incredible challenge," said Christie Nordheim, assistant professor of marketing at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. "The fortunes of these companies hinge on the fortunes of the Bush foreign policy."
"Until now, American brands have reaped the benefits of being associated with America," she added. "Now, they're suffering the consequences."
As a result, marketers are scrutinizing everything that represents them internationally, from ads to package designs to promotions.
"Some of our companies have made adjustments to accommodate the current environment," said Richard Detweiler, a spokesman for the Frito-Lay International and Pepsi-Cola International divisions of PepsiCo in Purchase, N.Y., after taking steps "to protect employees, first and foremost, and assets."
Mr. Detweiler declined to discuss specific changes being made by the companies, which sell products under locally based brand names in addition to American names like Fritos and Pepsi-Cola.
Ms. Nordheim differentiated between marketers under fire for their "American-ness," which include the McDonald's Corporation, and those like the Procter & Gamble Company, which "are more embedded in the countries in which they operate."
Clearly, those most closely associated with the American way of life "are going to suffer the greatest harm," Ms. Nordheim said.
At McDonald's, Walt Riker, a vice president in Oak Brook, Ill., said that while the company was "very recognized" for the American values and lifestyles that inspired its products, "we are absolutely decentralized."
"Our operations in 118 countries around the world are run by locals who know what's best for their markets," Mr. Riker said. "McDonald's France is a shining star in the McDonald's system because it's run by smart national management that knows France a lot better than Oak Brook, Ill., does."
The French operators of McDonald's have worked hard to distinguish themselves from their United States parent, offering unique menu fare, designing the restaurants to look different from the American stores and even establishing a brand identity for McDonald's as "McDos." They also run campaigns stressing the local nature of their operations.
"These are messages run periodically in local countries," Mr. Riker said, "that remind people that while McDonald's is an American brand, it's a brand that stands for local ownership and local jobs."
Similar messages are increasingly being delivered by the overseas divisions of other marketers based in the United States.
"Boycotts hurt the local economy, the local bottlers, the local employees" in the more than 200 countries outside the United States in which Coca-Cola products are sold, said Kelly Brooks, a spokesman for the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta.
"We have acknowledged that boycotts have had an impact on our business in general, without being specific," he added. "And any changes in advertising or marketing would be made locally, based on situations in particular countries."
At Procter & Gamble, said Gretchen Mutchnick, a spokeswoman in Cincinnati, "though our headquarters is in the United States, we've worked really hard to establish strong local roots in each country in which we operate, and we will continue to do that." Procter has operations in more than 80 nations.
Several multinational marketers with American heritage have sold products abroad for so long from so many indigenous offices that they are widely perceived as locally based rather than American icons.
"Yes, we're an American company and we know we're on some boycott lists, but we haven't found it to be much of an issue for us," said Jack Kennedy, general manager for strategic communications at the H. J. Heinz Company in Pittsburgh.
"In the United Kingdom, people say we're a British company because we've been there more than 100 years," he added. "And our products are not always sold under the Heinz name; in Italy, we sell Plasmon, the leading baby-food brand that just celebrated its centenary."
The Gillette Company, which sells products in 200 countries and territories, has operated overseas for nearly 100 years, said Eric Kraus, a spokesman in Boston, so in countries like France and Germany, "we are very much a part of the local culture, the local fabric." Gillette also benefits from selling brands under non-American names like Braun, the German appliance maker.
Local ties developed overseas over the course of a century by the Ford Motor Company are the reason that "so far this hasn't been an issue with us," said Jennifer Flake, a Ford spokeswoman in Detroit.
Of course, dislike for products with American identities was not born out of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Those with long memories can recall the outcries against "Coca-Colonialism" in the 1950's and 1960's that were spawned by Communist attacks against capitalism and the resentment of colonial nations before they were freed from the control of American allies like Britain or France.
Such protests even became part of the American popular culture, as seen in the 1961 Billy Wilder film "One, Two, Three," a cold war comedy that lampooned the influence of United States business culture abroad as symbolized by Coca-Cola.
"As a cultural historian, I'd have to say, This too shall pass," said James B. Twitchell, a professor of English and advertising at the University of Florida in Gainesville.
"Thirty years ago, people burned effigies or U.S. flags to express outrage," Mr. Twitchell said. "Now, destroying the Golden Arches is an act of rebellion."
"If I were with one of these companies, I'd do absolutely nothing," he added, "because calling attention to it only exacerbates it."
Besides, said Marc E. Babej, president at Reason Inc. in New York, a marketing strategy company, "people in Arabic or European countries protesting against American brands were not likely to love America, or be the biggest buyers of those brands, in the first place."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Are Modestly Lower as Investors Hedge Their Bets

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wall Street closed modestly lower yesterday, under pressure from disappointing economic reports and investor caution even as American forces pushed toward Baghdad.
 Analysts said some investors were disheartened by the data released on claims for jobless benefits and on the services sector. But others postponed decisions on stock commitments, awaiting further developments in Iraq. 
 "As we near Baghdad, people are wondering how quickly things are going to go," said Brian Pears, head equity trader at Victory Capital Management. "They know this is the key battle. A long, drawn-out battle could certainly depress investors. Conversely, if the government fell quickly, people will be euphoric." 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 44.68 points, or 0.54 percent, at 8,240.38, having gained 292 points in the previous two sessions. Earlier in the day, blue-chip stocks had risen more than 50 points.
Broader indexes were also modestly lower. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 4.45 points, or 0.51 percent, to 876.45. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index slipped 0.14 point, or 0.01 percent, to close at 1,396.58. 
Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered those advancing by a margin around 6 to 5. The direction of Nasdaq stocks was close to even. Big Board volume fell to 1.36 billion shares from 1.60 billion on Wednesday.
United States forces attacked Baghdad's international airport and some units reached the outskirts of the city.
Trading has been choppy as traders focus on headlines from the war and make bets on how long the fighting may last. They fear that a protracted conflict would stifle any revival of business spending -- something considered critical to economic recovery.
Ryan Smith, managing director of equity trading at Banc One Investment Advisers, said: "As our troops get closer and closer to Baghdad, and people get more optimistic, I think we'll have a potential for a rally. But I don't think it will be gigantic until the war is in fact over."
The reports on unemployment and the services weighed on stocks. The Labor Department reported that jobless claims rose last week by a seasonally adjusted 38,000, to 445,000, the highest level of new claims since April 2002. The figure was worse than expected.
And the Institute for Supply Management said that its nonmanufacturing index slid to 47.9 in March from 53.9 in February, indicating a contraction in service industries after 13 months of growth. Economists had forecast a reading of 52.
"The reports are definitely a bit of a drag today," Mr. Pears said. "As the war goes on, you'll hear more talk of how well the economy is doing. But no matter what comes out, good news from the battlefield is good news for stocks."
Decliners included JDA Software, which dropped $1.15, to $9.19, after the company said it expected first-quarter revenue to fall short of Wall Street estimates, citing in part the weak economy.
The Borders Group fell 40 cents, to $14.30, after the company said it expected to miss its previous estimates of first-quarter profit.
But Dell Computer rose 58 cents, to $28.67, after it reaffirmed fiscal first-quarter estimates.
Bed Bath & Beyond gained 77 cents, to $36.25, after it reported a jump in fiscal fourth-quarter profit that surpassed analysts' expectations; the company also said it was comfortable with estimates for the first quarter.
In the markets in Europe, the benchmark index in Paris climbed 1.63 percent; British stocks advanced 0.47 percent; and the DAX index in Frankfurt declined 0.75 percent.
Bond prices were mixed. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note climbed 5/32, to a price of 99 23/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.91 percent from 3.93 percent on Wednesday. The 30-year bond rose 5/32, to 106 23/32. Its yield rose to 4.93 percent from 4.92 percent.

HEADLINE: Retail-Space Developer Balks At the Design for Ground Zero 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The company that holds the right to develop retail shopping space at the World Trade Center site has told its landlord that it believes that Daniel Libeskind's design violates the company's right to build appropriate shopping areas. 
 The company, Westfield America, which is based in Los Angeles, first expressed its opinion in a March 14 letter to Joseph J. Seymour, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site. 
 "We have reviewed the most recent version of the Libeskind plan and do not believe it is consistent with the Port Authority's obligations to us or, based on our expertise and experience, the type of retail that we believe is most appropriate for the site and its potential," the letter states. 
Peter S. Lowy, Westfield's chief executive, said in an interview yesterday that the company had not yet received a reply but that it expected to be included in discussions about the detailed design of shopping areas at the trade center site.
"We do have an understanding that there are a number of constituencies here, and we are not by any means the largest or most vocal," Mr. Lowy said. "But we do as a company have real expertise in this area, and that expertise should be used as part of the input into the development of the retail space."
Port Authority officials played down the idea of a dispute between the parties.
A disagreement has the potential to derail, at least temporarily, the progress that rebuilding officials and Mr. Libeskind are making toward the completion of a detailed design.
"We have a cooperative, working relationship with Westfield, and we fully expect that relationship to continue," said Greg Trevor, a spokesman for the authority.
But Mr. Lowy emphasized that Westfield would not accept a design that might even inadvertently diminish the value of one of the most lucrative retail franchises in the country.
In its letter, Westfield stated that unless its differences with the Port Authority were quickly resolved, "we will be forced to take appropriate steps to protect our interests." An article about the letter first appeared yesterday in The New York Post.
Mr. Lowy would not say what steps it might take. But its interests are clear. The retail space that existed at the World Trade Center before Sept. 11, 2001, was some of the most successful in the nation, in large part because it was in an underground mall through which 150,000 people walked each day.
When it was destroyed, the trade center had roughly 430,000 square feet of retail space, nearly all of it below ground. Westfield's lease with the Port Authority allowed it to expand that to 650,000 square feet, and the company was considering building new retail stores on the plaza area at the base of the twin towers.
The Libeskind plan, which was selected in February as the winner of a design competition, provides for 880,000 square feet of retail space on the site. About 480,000 square feet of that is below ground, mainly in the concourses linking the site with subway lines and PATH commuter rail lines and in the new transportation hub.
The remaining 400,000 square feet of retail space would be above ground, mainly in street-level storefronts at the base of office buildings.
That configuration is favored by city officials and community groups, which want to enliven the street areas on and around the site. But the layout makes it less likely that the same amount of foot traffic would pass by each store.

HEADLINE: Leaseholders at Brooklyn Port Worry What Study May Bring 

BYLINE:  By TARA BAHRAMPOUR 

 BODY:
The city has hired a consultant to study uses for approximately 100 acres of Red Hook waterfront that now serve as Brooklyn's last active port, raising the possibility that the site will become a park, a museum or luxury housing. 
 In February, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the city's Economic Development Corporation hired Hamilton, Rabinowitz & Alschuler, a Manhattan consulting firm, to come up with possible uses for the site, whose 1.3 miles of shorefront property offer expansive views of Lower Manhattan and New York Harbor. The same firm developed a plan for the adjacent Brooklyn Bridge Park three years ago. 
 But the port's two current leaseholders, American Stevedoring and American Warehousing, are angered by the study, saying they have worked hard to make the port a viable business that reduces traffic and provides jobs. 
Sal Catucci, the chief executive of American Stevedoring, said that since his company came in nine years ago, the port has blossomed from a failing operation into one that employs more than 500 workers and handles up to 100,000 shipping containers a year, in addition to break-bulk, or noncontainer, shipping.
"We grew this pier from no cocoa to the largest cocoa port in the U.S.," Mr. Catucci said, adding that the port also receives coffee, lumber and other goods. "We expected to lose money the first year, but we made money." 
It is a small reversal of a 50-year trend in which most of New York City's marine cargo activity moved to New Jersey ports. Supporters of the Red Hook port say that bringing some of that activity back allows goods to go directly to destinations in Brooklyn and Queens and on Long Island, avoiding the time and expense of trucking it from New Jersey. Opponents say that the larger New Jersey ports receive goods to distribute throughout the United States, making it impractical to funnel them directly to Red Hook.
The port, which includes Piers 6 through 12, is bounded by Red Hook, Carroll Gardens and Cobble Hill. Mr. Catucci said several businesses were interested in leasing space there, including a company that would store and distribute beer, bringing in 650 more jobs. The site's uncertain prospects could jeopardize such contracts, he said, adding that he was surprised when he heard about the study from a community group.
Steve Coleman, a Port Authority spokesman, said the study should not come as a surprise to anyone because the tenants' two-year lease extension expires in 2004. And he said the study does not necessarily suggest that the port is doomed.
"Last year, when the lease was renegotiated, we went into it with an understanding that we were going to look at possible uses," he said. "It might be maritime, it might not."
Hamilton, Rabinowitz & Alschuler is scheduled to make its recommendations in July. On Monday night, representatives are to meet with members of Community Board 6, the Port Authority, the Economic Development Corporation and the current tenants to discuss the site.
Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the development corporation, said the city was waiting to see the study's findings. "Things have changed with Brooklyn Bridge Park and Governors Island," she said. "We want to make sure it fits in that whole context."
An important factor in the port's future is a barge that ferries cargo between Red Hook and Port Newark. Its use alleviates truck traffic, reducing noise and emissions on city streets. But it costs $7 million to $10 million a year; about 40 percent of that comes from the Port Authority, which does not want to continue paying for it. 
Mike Scotto, president of American Warehousing, said the barge could be used less if the Port Authority would organize shipments destined for New York City to be dropped off in Red Hook before landing in Newark. 
Mr. Scotto and Mr. Catucci said the Port Authority seemed to favor New Jersey ports over theirs.
But Mr. Coleman said that was not the case. "We've been supporting the facilities that we operate on both sides," he said of the Port Authority, "and will continue to do so."
Jerry Armer, chairman of Community Board 6, said it was important that the site continue its maritime use. "That doesn't mean it has to remain a container port," he said, noting that it could have other maritime-related businesses. One possibility is a cruise line; Carnival Cruises has expressed interest in using one pier as a terminal. 
But some say Brooklyn's maritime days are over. Buddy Scotto, a community leader who is not related to Mike Scotto, called Brooklyn a "third-world waterfront," and said he would like to see it become like Battery Park City or the South Street Seaport in Manhattan. "The views that we have on that waterfront are absolutely spectacular," he said. "We have developers in here right now falling all over themselves to get in there."
That does not comfort Bette Stoltz, executive director of the South Brooklyn Local Development Corporation, who said she worried that luxury waterfront housing would be too expensive for most neighborhood residents. 
She also called the elimination of maritime activity shortsighted. "We need to consider what New York is going to need in another 30 years," she said. "I mean, this is your port you're talking about. This is not a replaceable commodity."

HEADLINE: Export Apple Of China's Eye Is, Er, Apples 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: XIAN, China 

 BODY:
This is where much of America's apple juice now comes from the outskirts of historic Xian, where the orchards stretch for miles and miles. Apples are so plentiful here that they are often left to rot in the fields. They are scattered on the ground in old farming villages and pitched against walls by playful little boys like red and gold baseballs.
 There are so many apples in China -- which over the last two decades turned itself into the world's biggest apple grower -- that the world price for apple juice concentrate has been depressed for nearly five years. Apple juice makers in the United States purchase more of China's cheap concentrate every year -- though they do not like to talk about it -- and every year American apple growers complain of devastating losses. 
 But do not expect growers in Xian, or any other part of China, to abandon their apple orchards. 
"Yeah, prices are low, but I'm sticking with my apples," says Wang Aimin, a 40-year-old grower in Lining, a village about 40 miles northwest of Xian. "Life is better now. I used to grow corn and wheat, but you couldn't live on that."
These are the economics of modern agriculture in China -- and the market psychology of the modern Chinese farmer. Even a deeply depressed market is preferable to what farmers suffered through for decades, when they could not expect to make even $1 a day selling crops to local markets.
After China opened its agriculture to the broader export market in the 1980's, farmers here started growing apples, backed by government largess. These days, China produces 1.5 billion bushels of apples a year -- about half the world's supply, and nearly seven times the American production of about 215 million bushels a year.
And China is working to improve the productivity of its relatively low-yielding orchards. Apples are one of 11 commodities that the government recently said would get aggressive development over the next five years.
"There's a potential in the future that they're going to have even more apples," said John Skorburg, a senior economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation. "And it's going to put even more pressure on the apple industry."
For years, American apple growers have complained that China has dumped apple juice concentrate into the American market at prices below the cost of production, and the Chinese for years have denied the charges. 
Three years ago, the Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission, a United States government agency, ruled in favor of American apple growers, and Washington imposed duties of up to 52 percent on most apple juice imports from China.
A decision is expected soon on China's appeal of the rulings. In the meantime, the Chinese share of the American apple juice concentrate market has jumped from about 1 percent in 1994 to about 16 percent in 2001, while American growers' share has been tumbling.
Nearly all the concentrate pressed at the Tongda Liquan Fruit Juice and Beverage Company processing plant near Xian is shipped abroad in giant bacteria-free drums. The concentrate ends up in the United States, Russia, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Australia and elsewhere. 
"We're selling all this to the export market," said Yang Bingfeng, 40, the assistant manager, as he passed through a yard of drums ready to be shipped. "But we think the domestic market has a great potential to grow."
In January, Congress stepped in to help American growers with $94 million in compensation for losses suffered in 2000, partly because of rising sales of Chinese apple juice concentrate.
Officials in China, which joined the World Trade Organization in late 2001, say that the American charges smack of trade warfare.
"Since China joined the W.T.O., China will follow all W.T.O. principles and other relevant trade agreements," the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said in a statement issued in response to questions about the apple dispute. "But China is also opposed to trade protectionism under the name of antidumping."
It was the Beijing government that fueled the beginnings of China's apple boom in the late 1980's.
At the time, Chinese apples, small and tasteless, were largely shunned on the world market. But then China, newly export-minded, began importing Red and Yellow Delicious apple seedlings, and new techniques were employed to improve the quality of local varieties like the Guoguan and the Jinguan. 
Soon, farmers started planting huge apple orchards in the central and northeastern parts of the country, particularly in Shaanxi and Shandong Provinces, where the yellow soil is rich and deep and the amount of daylight is optimum for apple growing, according to industry experts.
By 1997, China had seven million acres under cultivation, and Chinese apples were being exported to Russia and the Netherlands. Farmers in the Xian region rejoiced. "We've had some very good years," said Lei Zhilin, 48, an apple grower in Liquan, a town just north of Xian.
Apple prices, however, have been tumbling in recent years because of oversupply. Some growers in China have pared back apple acreage to plant other fruits and vegetables. Yet with improving yields, apple production has continued to soar, reaching 21 million metric tons in 2002.
Most of that production is for domestic consumption, of both fresh apples and apple juice; as China grows more affluent, it is becoming more health conscious.
Still, with yields rising and apple consumption in China relatively flat, some industry experts say China has begun to throw some of its big surpluses of fresh fruit onto the world market, as it has with juice concentrate.
"We already see apples going into Vancouver, and that is close to home," said Nancy Foster, president of the U.S. Apple Association, a trade group. "We're concerned about dumping apples as a possibility."
There are certainly more than enough apples in China.
In Lining village, apples are stocked in caves, cellars and long tunnels ventilated by huge, chimneylike structures that rise high above the orchards. And the abundance delights the apple growers.
"I made 400 yuan when I planted corn and wheat," Mr. Wang said, recalling the time in the 1980's before he transformed his one-acre field into an apple orchard. "Now, I make 5,000 yuan. And in some years 10,000." (One yuan is worth about 12 cents.) In the best of times, some apple growers in Lining said they made 50,000 yuan.
Over the last decade, the apple growers have slowly begun to transform their tiny village of mud houses by building brick homes -- people here call them palaces -- with electricity, televisions and three or four sparsely decorated but well-constructed rooms.
"Look over there," Mr. Wang said, pointing and laughing as he and five other apple growers pruned trees one recent afternoon. "You see those houses -- those mud houses? That's where we used to live. Look at those places. Now, look next door. That's the new place."
Wang Shengli, a tall, quiet 42-year-old apple grower who is not related to Wang Aimin, offered a tour of his home -- seven spacious rooms for him, his wife and four young children. The house cost 200,000 yuan, he said, or about $24,000, noting that the home was bought during boom times.
Apple growers here expect those times to return. Apple prices will rise again, they say. And even if they do not, today's depressed apple market -- with its bruised and abandoned apples splattered on the village grounds -- looks quite glorious, compared with what people here knew before.
"We'll be planting more apples, because there's no other choice," Wang Shengli said. "We're not going to go back to planting wheat; that's yesterday's crop."

HEADLINE: Latin Sweatshops Pressed by U.S. Campus Power 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: VILLA ALTAGRACIA, Dominican Republic, March 31 

 BODY:
When workers first tried unionizing the BJ&B hat factory that is the town's biggest employer, the streets were abuzz with rumors that the factory would rather close down than negotiate. 
 Two years later, not only is the factory still around, but there also is a union, and it recently negotiated a labor contract that provides raises, scholarships and other benefits that are unheard of among the country's 500 foreign-owned plants. 
 The pact, signed last week, was the latest victory for a once unlikely coalition of United States college students, labor activists and world-class brands like Nike and Reebok working to improve labor conditions in the factories in developing countries that make caps and clothing emblazoned with university names and mascots. 
The BJ&B factory, which employs about 1,600 people, was the focus of the first campaigns on American campuses against sweatshop labor that grew out of the protests against globalization in the 1990's. Labor leaders here and abroad now say it is probably the largest factory among the free-trade zones of the Caribbean, Central America or Mexico to have been unionized. 
The zones were set up in recent decades with tax breaks and other incentives to create jobs by attracting international manufacturers. But only a handful here, or elsewhere, have unions at all. The union at BJ&B was the first formed in a free zone in five years. 
The success follows a similar victory for labor leaders in Mexico. The organizers here hope that it may provide incentive to other factories, though most workers will lack the leverage that came from the coalition of students, universities and big American brands. 
BJ&B itself has made caps for major companies like Nike and Reebok and for athletic powerhouse schools like Penn State and the University of North Carolina. 
"I never thought a group of students, thousands of them, could put so much pressure on these brands," said Ignacio Hernandez, the general secretary of the Federation of Free Trade Zone Unions. "We were determined to win, but without them it would have taken us five more years. And it would have been more traumatic without them because all wewould have was the pressure to strike."
Still, the process was not easy -- the factory had to be pressured several times into rehiring union members who were dismissed on the flimsiest of pretexts. At one point, the American brands brought in outsiders who spoke about the rights of workers to choose a union or not. Yet it was accomplished without the kinds of violent clashes or shutdowns that have marked organizing efforts elsewhere.
The BJ&B factory that opened here in 1987 sits in the shadow of a dilapidated and long-abandoned sugar mill that once sustained the local economy. Down the road sits another empty hulk that was once a government-owned paper factory, now abandoned, in this rural town about an hour north of Santo Domingo, the capital. 
Amid such reminders of tough times, the BJ&B factory is the best hope for many people here to land a job. It occupies most of the buildings in the Free Trade Zone, which it shares with a smaller dress factory. 
Workers said they had tried to form a union about six years ago because managers were forcing them to work overtime, sometimes dismissing them without reason when they tried to leave early to attend night school. Other said that supervisors would often insult workers or threaten to hit them.
"Even if you missed work with an excuse, they would not pay you," said Jenny Perez, who used to work at the factory. "They would treat you in ways they should not. They would humiliate you verbally, but you took it because there was no other place to work."
When a group of 20 workers declared to the company they were organizing a union in the fall of 2001, they were soon fired, prompting the first of several interventions from abroad. In time, they were rehired, only to be assigned to collecting trash. More pressure ensued, workers said, after supervisors told them that the union was a bunch of "terrorists" who would lead them to economic ruin. 
The stateside groups began to lobby the brands that had contracts with the factory. United Students Against Sweatshops, a group that at one point sent thousands of letters to the factory, also sent a student volunteer for most of last year to help the union organize. University officials, brand executives and officials from a consortium of campuses, unions and students visited with the union and factory managers. 
"We were trying to convince the factory managers through ongoing pressure from Nike and Reebok that it was not in their interest to allow this to continue," said Scott Nova, the executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium. "Gradually, the factory came to recognize that, and we eventually persuaded them to produce a public letter signed by managers pledging neutrality, no intimidation and that the workers had the right to make their own choice." 
Yet even after the union eked out a majority late last year, the factory began layoffs that labor leaders said singled out union members. Factory managers said the dismissals, which were based on productivity, involved mostly workers who had not supported the union. 
Rehiring those workers -- about 10 of whom remain unemployed -- became one of the first points of the contract talks, which began earlier this year. 
Alberto Yang, the factory administrator, said that while the company had always met or exceeded local labor laws, it agreed to the union's demands. He said that the contract only codified practices that the company had followed, although labor leaders said the company had been inconsistent at best in the past.
"Our company is not hidden, it is famous and all the international brands work with us," he said. "With global companies, you have to accept global standards, not just local ones." 
The campus groups said that the large American brands had to be pushed several times to be more aggressive in responding to concerns over the treatment of workers. 
Today executives with the American brands said that they were pleased with the outcome, saying the process allowed both the union and the factory to learn how to negotiate.
"This is an excellent example of the limits of individual parties acting alone and the strength of many parties acting synergistically," said Doug Cahn, vice president for human rights programs at Reebok International Ltd. "There are few other examples like this where difficult issues were resolved."
Within that process, the universities and students were able to bring to the table a certain influence usually absent during such negotiations: the reputation of the school whose name is on the cap or the student who is eagerly courted by the athletic wear companies. 
"We are the target market of a lot of these brands and they want a positive image on campus because they want consumers for life," said Molly McGrath, development director at United Students Against Sweatshops. "We also have the moral and ethical argument being on the side of a university, so we can pressure the university to use their leverage in society to change the policies of the brands." 
She would like to see the brands act a little faster in the future, she said, to avoid the kinds of repeated firings that marred the BJ&B negotiations. Union leaders said the average wage now for workers was about $31 a week. 
That a pact was reached at all was perhaps the most surprising and gratifying turn of events for Rut Tufts, who manages the licensing program for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which nets some $4 million annually. He had gone to Villa Altagracia to visit with workers last year.
"I have been in their houses and see how they are trying to hold things together, and this collective bargaining agreement has got to make a difference in their lives," he said. "I hope it's what they need or a step to what they need."
So does Patricia Graterox, a factory worker and single mother who looks forward to the 10 percent raise. She hopes to be able to study nursing with help from the factory's scholarship fund.
"Before, you could not do that," she said. "Now you can. At least, I think I can."

HEADLINE: An Official Says Gunman Who Injured 3 Was Troubled 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT HANLEY 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, April 3 

 BODY:
The gunman who went on a rampage Wednesday night, wounding two police officers and a cabdriver before he was killed near his home here, had apparently been suffering from emotional problems recently, a law enforcement official close to the investigation said today.
 The gunman, Abraham M. Santiago, 28, had been behaving in a hostile manner and exhibiting other psychological problems lately, and detectives are trying to determine whether those problems touched off his 30-minute crime spree, the official said. 
 The Hudson County prosecutor, Edward DeFazio, said the investigation into Mr. Santiago's background and motivation was just beginning. 
"I'm not going to speculate on what was going on in Mr. Santiago's mind," Mr. DeFazio said at a news conference here today. "But he clearly was on some extraordinary path of destruction."
The authorities said Mr. Santiago began his rampage in Hoboken about 8 p.m., when he shot a taxi driver in the legs after the driver refused to surrender his vehicle on the city's busy commercial strip, Washington Street. Minutes later, they said, Mr. Santiago shot a Hoboken police officer who had tried to question him. 
He then stole a Ford Explorer at gunpoint a few blocks from the first shooting, drove to his home in Jersey City and shot at two Hudson County sheriff's officers as they tried to question him, Mr. DeFazio said. The officers shot back, and Mr. Santiago was killed by a single shot in the back.
The Hoboken officer, John Aquiar, 29, escaped serious injury when a bullet Mr. Santiago fired through the windshield of the officer's patrol car lodged in his bulletproof vest. A second bullet hit Officer Aquiar's shoulder. He was discharged from St. Mary Hospital in Hoboken today.
Hoboken's mayor, David Roberts, praised Officer Aquiar today as a hero, noting that despite his wounds, he chased Mr. Santiago for about two blocks before collapsing. Mayor Roberts said he planned to nominate Officer Aquiar for the Police Department's highest award for bravery.
One sheriff's officer, Sgt. Christian Araujo, a 28-year-old father of two, was recovering from an abdominal wound in the Jersey City Medical Center today. The cabdriver, identified as Mohamad A. Hamad, 27, of Riverdale, was recovering from leg wounds at St. Mary Hospital.
The .45-caliber gun Mr. Santiago used had been reported stolen on March 26 from a sporting goods store in Wanaque, a small community in Passaic County, Mr. DeFazio said. Two other .45's stolen then from the store, along with a "large number" of bullets, were found today in a second-floor apartment Mr. Santiago shared with his mother on Hopkins Avenue here, Mr. DeFazio said. He said detectives did not yet know who had stolen the guns or how Mr. Santiago had obtained them.
A woman who answered the door at the apartment today said she was the dead man's mother, but declined to say anything about Mr. Santiago. She said only that she hoped that the three wounded men recovered. 
Later, a man who said he was Mr. Santiago's uncle said outside the apartment that he was concerned only about the wounded men, not his nephew. "What led to this?" he asked. "It's baffling. Only Abraham could tell us."
Mr. DeFazio said investigators believed that Mr. Santiago was unemployed. Most recently, he said, Mr. Santiago had worked at the Hackensack University Medical Center, where his mother is a secretary. From 1990 to 1995, he worked at St. Mary Hospital -- where two of the wounded were treated -- as an orderly, delivering mail and surgical supplies, said Joan Quigley, a hospital spokeswoman.

HEADLINE: A RESPIRATORY ILLNESS: THE DISEASE; 
China Defends Actions in Battling Contagious Illness

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN and ERIK ECKHOLM 

 BODY:
As a mysterious respiratory illness appeared in new countries and more cases were reported from already affected countries, China defended itself against criticism that its initial refusal to be more open about the disease had contributed to its spread.
 The Chinese health minister acknowledged that scientists had initially been slow to recognize the threat from the disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and that it might be a new infectious agent, one that still has not been conclusively identified. But the minister defended the work of Chinese public health agencies and said they had cooperated fully with officials in Hong Kong and from the World Health Organization in the investigation of the disease, which can cause pneumonia. 
 "What we have done is to give timely notice about the pneumonia, in accordance with our national conditions and law," Zhang Wenkang, the minister of health, said at a news conference. 
Mr. Zhang also said that international curbs on travel to China were unnecessary because the outbreak of the disease was "under effective control" and the number of cases was declining.
"It is safe to come to China to live, work and attend conferences," he said.
Meanwhile, there were more developments about the spread of the disease. South America reported the continent's first case of the illness, one imported into Brazil from Asia.
Vietnam, where the World Health Organization had thought the spread of the disease had been checked, reported its first new case in more than a week, suggesting that it represented a new chain of transmission.
The case occurred in a man who was treated in a provincial hospital about two hours from Hanoi, which has been the center of the illness in Vietnam. The unexpected appearance of a new case raised the specter that the disease had spread into the countryside and might have infected health care workers in an area where infection control measures are substandard. Masks, gowns and other barrier nursing equipment are being sent to the hospital to help improve its infection control. But there was concern about the potential need for similar measures elsewhere in Vietnam.
In Japan, the chief cabinet secretary, Yasuo Fukuda, reported the country's first 14 suspected cases and said all were travelers to affected areas.
In the United States, the total number of suspected cases rose to 100 -- 15 more than on Wednesday. The cases were from 27 states, led by California with 24 and New York with 16. No deaths were reported. Suspected cases were reported in all age groups. The overwhelming majority were in travelers to affected countries.
In Ontario, Canada, where there are 146 confirmed and probable cases, a seventh victim died of the disease Wednesday night -- the fourth to die since Saturday. She was identified as a 57-year-old woman who had a previous health problem that apparently contributed to her death at Stoufille Hospital in the Toronto suburb of Markham. She was exposed to the disease at Scarborough Grace Hospital, the epicenter of the disease in that city. The hospital has been linked to all the deaths and 139 of the cases.
Ontario health officials said all seven victims who died had previous health problems and that five were in their 70's.
More than 2,000 people are wearing masks and in isolationat home in the Toronto area. Health officials asked four of them to stay in isolation; the remainder did so voluntarily. Elective surgery has resumed in Ontario hospitals.
About 34 additional suspected cases have been reported from other Canadian provinces.
In trying to calm the public, Ontario health officials asked public subway, bus and street car drivers to stop wearing masks. "There is no medical reason to mask in public and we are advising against that," said Dr. James Young, the Ontario commissioner of public health.
The disease has begun to take an economic toll in Canada. The American Association of Cancer Researchers canceled a weekend conference that promised to bring more than 12,000 scientists and health practitioners to Toronto. A main reason for the cancellation was the fear that many of the returning doctors might have to stay in isolation if they came in contact with a suspected case. Tourism officials put the loss to the city at more than $6 million.
Earlier this week, the World Health Organization recommended against travel to China's southern province of Guangdong, where the disease was first detected in November and which has had the most reported cases. The organization also recommended against elective travel to Hong Kong, which has been more recently hit by the virus.
To the alarm of Chinese leaders, who fear a serious impact on business and tourism, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta gave a more sweeping warning, urging travelers to postpone unnecessary travel to any part of China. A number of corporate conferences and entertainment events, including a concert by the Rolling Stones, have been canceled and some foreign companies are evacuating families from China out of fear of the illness.
"I hope they will reconsider these decisions," Mr. Zhang said of the various cancellations and travel curbs that are already causing a drag on the airline and tourist industries.
"People in Guangdong are working and living normally," he said. He added that there was no evidence that the virus was spreading widely in Beijing. Chinese officials have been stung by accusations that they concealed or ignored information about the disease in the initial months, and failed to act promptly. At yesterday's briefing, the minister sidestepped questions about why China had been so slow to reveal details about the illness or to involve the World Health Organization in its control, and why it had sharply restricted coverage of the disease by the domestic press.
Some residents of Hong Kong, where the virus is now fulminating and schools have been shut down, blame Beijing for not sharing information about the brewing epidemic more quickly, possibly allowing stronger countermeasures early on.
Three World Health Organization teams of experts have visited China since early February, Mr. Zhang said. But only yesterday was the first team allowed to visit Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province. But Reuters reported that the team did not appear to have unrestricted access to the information it seeks.

HEADLINE: In Chinatown, An Outbreak Of Fear; 
Herb Shops and Rumors Thrive on Virus Panic

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SAULNY 

 BODY:
Chivy Ngo found himself in the awkward position this week of hearing the details of his own demise, a horrible death that was said to have happened on Monday after a lost battle against SARS, the mysterious, sometimes fatal respiratory disease.
 Mr. Ngo owns a restaurant on Bayard Street and is well known in Chinatown. So news of his death, which was widely and wrongly circulated on the Internet and in the local Chinese press, caused pain among his friends. It also caused widespread alarm in the community, a dense enclave of tens of thousands of people with close ties to Asia who feared the worst: that severe acute respiratory syndrome had come to Chinatown. 
 "It's absolutely untrue," said Sandy Mullin, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Public Health. "A rumor. We checked it out, and there was nothing to support the story as it circulated." The source of the rumor has not been identified. 
Although there have been roughly 20 suspected cases of SARS in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- all in people who had traveled to the Far East -- as of yesterday, not one was known to have occurred in Chinatown, city health officials said.
No matter, the damage had been done. Mr. Ngo got condolence calls, and many other people got face masks, bleach and antibacterial soaps. Concerned shoppers have nearly depleted neighborhood herbalists' supplies of isatis root, which, according to Eastern tradition, wards off infection in the lungs.
"Hot herbal tea available that prevents SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and cleans your system!" read a sign outside T's Herbal Inc., on Hester Street in Chinatown. A store clerk said she sold about 40 cups at $1 each yesterday.
But beyond drinking more tea, some people have begun to change their routines.
"I think people are scared -- I'm scared, too," said Kay Cheng, the manager of the Excellent Pork Chop House on Doyers Street. "On my day off, I stay in my home. I don't want to go out."
Sandy Sang, a photo shop worker from Bayside, Queens, bought 20 face masks yesterday at a pharmacy on Canal Street. "My friend asked me to do her a favor and buy them, and I'll keep some for my family," she said. "At least we'll have something to protect us, because you never know. And everybody's buying them, so why not? It's only $2. I spend it and then my family feels comfortable."
As Mr. Ngo looked through some e-mail messages yesterday about him and his restaurant, he said: "The messages are so cruel. It's terrible. They are not just against me. They say, 'Don't go to Chinatown for a while. They have SARS.' I thought, 'What kind of April Fool's is this on our community?' "
According to business leaders in the area, Chinatown suffered tremendously after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, just blocks away. Dozens of Chinese-Americans died when the towers collapsed. Chinatown was off-limits to visitors right after the attack, and trucking restrictions slowed shipments in and out of the area to a trickle. The neighborhood, home to 100,000, has been hit hard by the general economic downturn.
A few restaurants went out of business. Dozens of garment factories closed. Many workers were laid off.
"And now this," Mr. Ngo said. A native of Vietnam who fled on a boat in 1975, Mr. Ngo, 36, runs Bo Ky, a modest but popular restaurant, with his mother, Jenny Wong, and brother Chi Hung Ngo. Bo Ky was closed for six weeks after the 9/11 attack, and the family and the restaurant's dozen workers suffered financial hardships, Chivy Ngo said.
"They ought to sue whoever started this rumor," said Chan Ming Chien, the vice chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of New York. "They, and all of Chinatown, are only almost recovered from 9/11. Something like this that is not a fact hurts everyone here."
He and others said they wanted the city and the world to know that it was O.K. to visit Chinatown, that it was clean and safe. He said residents and businesses were concerned about SARS and were taking reasonable measures to protect themselves; some people are canceling plans to travel to Asia, he said.
If anyone should be worried about the disease, it should be the residents of Chinatown, said Ying Bin Hon, a salesman for a Chinatown florist. "You can take precautions, like wearing a mask, but if it comes, it comes and what can you do?" he said. "Eventually, I think it will go around the world. People who are too worried about this just don't have enough to do."
Nevertheless, the disease has caused great concern worldwide, because it is highly contagious and, though its fatality rate is only about 3 percent, there is no vaccine or treatment other than nursing and help in breathing. 
Grace Ho, a prominent Chinatown herbalist,said many people have been coming to her "wanting to buy something to clear the lungs, to prevent the disease."
"They are asking because of some of the rumors on the street and in the papers, but I think it's overexaggerated," Ms. Ho said. "It's not good for Chinatown or New York or the U.S.A. 'We have a lot of problems already,' I tell people. 'Why add what's not true?' "
Ms. Ho said that people come to consult her in the small, sweet-smelling Kam Tat Trading Store on Mott Street where she works and that she advises them to "have a healthy lifestyle and a positive attitude instead of being scared." She added, "That's good for preventing any disease, not just SARS."
Ms. Ho also advises her customers to buy a $5 package of herbs. She prepares what she says is a protective herbal cocktail, combining honeysuckle (to get rid of infection) and licorice root (an antioxidant, she says) with chrysanthemum, isatis root and many other herbs. 
She has sold so much of the formula that only half a bag of one ingredient, the isatis root, remains.
"The market is almost completely out of this because of the rush," she said, looking at the root. "Everyone is trying to get it."
At Bo Ky, business is trickling back, but some customers are as interested in Mr. Ngo's health (which a doctor has reassured him is good) as they are in eating his noodles and dumplings. When diners walk in, he has begun to ask: "Are you here for takeout or for the rumor?"

HEADLINE: Mistaken Holocaust Connection Is Hurting Business, Owner Says 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

 BODY:
The chief executive of a roommate referral service based in Connecticut said yesterday that her business had been hurt because Internet users had confused her company with a similar company run by a man who runs a Web site that questions historical accounts of the Holocaust.
 Sharon R. Ballin, the chief executive of Roommate Finders, whichdoes business through the Web site roommatefinders.net, said that sales had fallen 60 percent from the comparable period last year. The problem, she said, was not the economy, but rather confusion among potential customers who falsely associated her business with another service, which does business through the Web site roommatefinders.com. 
 The roommatefinders.com Web site was featured in The New York Times on Jan. 20. The article noted that users of that service had received unexpected e-mail messages from its founder, Michael Santomauro, that questioned historical accounts of the Holocaust. Mr. Santomauro also operates a Web site, www.reportersnotebook.com, that comments on the Holocaust and other matters. The Times article made no reference to Ms. Ballin's company or Web site.
An article written by Mr. Santomauro criticizing The Times article and commenting further on the Holocaust has been posted on the Web site, www.adelaideinstitute.org/Dissenters/santomauro.htm. He did not return a phone message yesterday seeking comment.
She said that her business, the one operated through roommatefinders .net, charges clients $35 apiece to provide referrals to potential roommates. She declined to disclose the revenues of the company, which is privately held, but said that from a pool of 53 schools she finds 10 to 50 students per school per day to register as clients. Ms. Ballin said that a search of the phrase "roommatefinders" using the Internet search engine www.google.com retrieves Web sites advising people not to use her service.
A search conducted in that manner yesterday prominently displayed links to both Mr. Santomauro's and Ms. Ballin's Web sites, as well as to Web sites offering links to the Times article about Mr. Santomauro. One link cited the article and recommended that people not use "roommatefinders," but did not specify roommatefinders.com or roommatefinders.net.
Other reasons for the decline in business at services that help people find roommates could include low interest rates that are enticing people to buy apartments rather than rent and a sluggish employment market that is discouraging people from moving to the region, said Michael Moran, a managing director of Corcoran Group Rentals, a brokerage firm.
But Ms. Ballin attributes the decline in business to confusion.
"People ask me on every single phone call if we are anti-Semitic," Ms. Ballin said. "The irony is that I am a nice Jewish girl."

HEADLINE: Out of Iraq: The Rescue of Pfc. Jessica Lynch 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 It was heartwarming to read of the rescue of 19-year-old Pfc. Jessica Lynch ("Aching Town Rejoices When Soldier Is Found," news article, April 2). 
 What is dismaying is that she and her hometown of Palestine, W.Va., could not be rescued from "the lack of opportunities in this tiny impoverished community" with an unemployment rate of 15 percent and that a generous young woman who wanted to become a teacher had to join the military "as a means to pay for a college education." 
Such is the dilemma forced on many young people today by Washington's neglect of the American economy that such a beautiful young person was forced to choose to learn to kill before she could learn to teach others not to.

HEADLINE: More Wireless Internet Access Set for Lower Manhattan Parks 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
A downtown business improvement district is planning to establish free high-speed wireless Internet access in six parks and public spaces in Lower Manhattan next month, significantly expanding the availability downtown of wireless connections to the Internet. 
 Officials of the Alliance for Downtown New York, the business improvement district that encompasses most of Manhattan south of City Hall, said yesterday that the organization will set up wireless access points, which are known as Wi-Fi connections or "hot spots," in City Hall Park, the South Street Seaport area and Bowling Green. 
 In addition, the wireless access points will be available in Vietnam Veterans Plaza on Water Street north of Broad Street; in Liberty Plaza, at Broadway and Liberty Street; and in Rector Park in Battery Park City. 
In those areas, plus at least one more for which the service is still being negotiated, anyone with a properly equipped laptop computer or personal digital assistant can enjoy free, high-speed access to the Internet through a system paid for by the Alliance.
The networks will be similar to a wireless network set up in Bryant Park in midtown Manhattan that has grown in popularity since it was introduced last year. 
Although access is also available in a few other parks in the city, like Tompkins Square and Madison Square, those services are made available by individuals who live or work nearby and might not be accessible in all areas of the parks.
Last year, the Downtown Alliance set up an experimental wireless network at Bowling Green. Dormant since last fall, it will be reestablished on May 1, at the same time as the five other downtown networks. The network should allow anyone in Lower Manhattan to walk to a free, wireless Internet connection within five minutes, said Shirley Jaffe, a vice president for economic development at the Downtown Alliance. 
"At a time when there is a lot of doom and gloom over Lower Manhattan, this certainly demonstrates that downtown does have a future," Ms. Jaffe said.
The system is being created for the alliance by Emenity, a for-profit company formerly known as Cloud Networks. The company is affiliated with NYC Wireless, a non-profit organization that encourages the establishment of wireless networks.
Anthony Townsend, the chief operating office of Emenity and a co-founder of NYC Wireless, said that the Lower Manhattan project will be one of the largest free wireless networks in the country. 
The Downtown Alliance says its effort will establish the first wireless business district in the country, although the claim is difficult to verify. Wireless networking is often a communal activity, where individuals hang an antenna for their own system out a window, making Internet access available to anyone who wants it. 
NYC Wireless has mapped 141 such hot spots in the New York City area, where individuals or companies make their networks available for public use. Another nonprofit organization, the Public Internet Project, mapped more than 13,000 places in Manhattan alone where signals from home or office wireless networks can be detected and used by a computer user.
Mr. Townsend said Long Beach, Calif., has established a wireless network in the area of its convention center, and he said organizations in a growing number of cities are expected to begin offering similar services beginning this spring.

Casting Stones Where Bullets Aren't Flying

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
HERE in New York, the world capital of news media and navel gazing, many of us have our priorities straight in this war.
 The fighting in Iraq? It certainly makes for an interesting story, no doubt about it. But let's be serious. In New York, a big concern is not the war itself so much as how the war is being covered by the many news organizations that call the city home. 
 It stands to reason. The communications industry is to New York what the government is to Washington. Naturally, people focus on what matters to them, and in this mediacentric city, the big picture is as clear as high-definition television.
What's the fate of a remote country compared with the more compelling question of whether news gatherers are knee-jerk radicals propagandizing for Saddam Hussein or bobblehead dolls shilling for an adventurist American administration?
Even more important: who gets under your skin more -- Peter Arnett or Geraldo Rivera?
This ordering of priorities is good for New York's economy. That's because of the way the business of news gathering and opinion mongering is structured. There are, at the risk of oversimplification, two basic groups to consider in this regard.
One is made up of men and women who put themselves in the line of fire, sometimes while on their own, sometimes alongside American soldiers in the desert. They endure heat and sandstorms and food that falls on the far side of edible. They get to sleep two or three hours a night, and have to wear ungainly chemical warfare suits much of the time.
These people are called reporters.
The other group consists of men and women who rarely leave their offices. Some have never left their offices. The biggest hazard they face is a paper cut. Oh, and they also find it terribly inconvenient to have the batteries go dead on the TV remote while they're flipping channels to keep up with the latest on the war.
These people are called pundits.
When it comes to sustaining New York, there is no question about which group is more important.
Reporters sleeping in chemical warfare suits are useless. They are far away, off in the Iraqi desert spending no money.
But pundits, sometimes called columnists, are always around; they don't have to go anywhere. They do, however, have to eat. Some also have to drink. That makes them very important for the city's economy, a significant part of which depends on thriving restaurants, bars and cafes.
War correspondents do not carry their weight for New York. Pundits do. That's why people pay attention to them -- because they know what a burden it is to stay put, watch television and go out only to eat and drink.
WITH responsibilities so large, it is easy to stumble on occasion, especially if you have trouble leaving the office. You might start seeing everyone out there as the enemy. It can happen to anybody.
Why, it happened just this week to The New York Post. That's the newspaper with an American flag on the front page and an Australian editor at the helm. The Post seems to have decided that news coverage failing to conform to its own ideological line is traitorous.
"4th Estate: 5th Column?" read one headline. The question mark did little to soften the accusation.
"Peter Arnett's Treason" was the headline above another column. This was after Mr. Arnett, in Baghdad for NBC News and other outlets, made what by his own admission was a thoroughly boneheaded decision to appear on Iraq's state-controlled television attacking the American war plan.
Somehow, the column had nothing to say about the patriotism of Mr. Rivera, who had revealed -- on the air for Fox News -- the positions and future movements of American troops. In theory, he put the lives of United States soldiers in jeopardy. The Army certainly believed so.
Ignoring Mr. Rivera while damning Mr. Arnett must have been an oversight on the pundit's part. It couldn't possibly have had anything to do with the fact that The Post and Fox are sister units in the same news conglomerate.
Well, you have to sympathize. A pundit's burden, as we said, is great in a city like New York.
All of this, however, does bring to mind what a colleague who worked for another newspaper once said about his first days of covering the Vietnam War. It dawned on him, he said, that his job was to go to places that other people, more sensible, were leaving.
That is one of many things that pundits, including those quick to cry treason, never have to do.

Women's Season a Lead-In to World Cup

BYLINE:  By JACK BELL 

 BODY:
The Women's United Soccer Association was created from the astonishing success of the 1999 Women's World Cup, which was played in and won by the United States. In the euphoric aftermath a handful of media conglomerates recognized the potential of an eye-popping demographic and launched the eight-team league. 
 Now the W.U.S.A. has come full circle. Its third season leads into the 2003 World Cup. 
 "This year is going to be different than any other, having a professional league prior to the World Cup," said Mia Hamm, the most recognizable star of the women's game and FIFA's 2002 female player of the year. "But these challenges are exciting ones. Not only the U.S., but teams across the world are stronger because of their participation in the W.U.S.A." 
For example, last season France sent little-known Marinette Pichon to Philadelphia, where she finished as the league's second-leading scorer, with 14 goals. She later helped France qualify for the World Cup, which is being played in China starting Sept. 23. Norway and Germany each have five potential national team players in the W.U.S.A.; Australia and Brazil each have four; and Canada has three. 
Perhaps the pivotal difference this year, particularly for the United States team, is the absence of the full-time residency program that was in use before the previous three Women's World Cups. In the past, national team players gathered at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Fla., for intensive training periods of a month or more. This year, the Americans have no such luxury. Instead, they will be limited to playing one exhibition match each month of the W.U.S.A. season. 
The Chinese, who are playing host to the World Cup, have recalled players like Sun Wen for their own residency camp. Last year the league had nine Chinese players; this season there are only three: Bai Jie and Gao Hong in Washington, and Zhang Ouying in San Diego. 
"Residency was nice in that you got to play with teammates every day, but it wasn't really realistic because in the long term you're not developing players," said Julie Foudy, the San Diego midfielder and national team veteran. "Where once the pool of players was 25, now the pool is 125 who are training and playing at the highest level. There's more depth, and it's not a coincidence -- it's a product of the league." 
Tom Sermanni, the New York Power's new coach, directed the Australian national team in the 1990's and had to cobble together a team with minimal preparation. 
"I took over the Australian team for the 1995 World Cup and we barely had a game in two years," Sermanni said. "But really, the issues were different then. I think this league gives an enormous benefit to the U.S. national team, because players are playing against high-level competition every week and they are training full time with the best players in the world. My only concern is the large number of games at a high level we are asking them to play in." 
The Power has five players whose time with the club could be affected as their nations begin to prepare for the tournament: Tiffeny Milbrett and Christie Pearce of the United States, Cheryl Salisbury and Joanne Peters of Australia, and Anita Rapp of Norway. Leaguewide, nearly 50 players could be on their nations' rosters in China. 
"The World Cup will have an effect on the league, but it does not have to be detrimental," said April Heinrichs, coach of the United States national team. "In a way, the W.U.S.A. has helped American players gain more respect for other players like Birgit Prinz and Sun Wen. The women will get more attention in a World Cup year, and the public support in America, China and elsewhere will bind us all together in an even grander form to help promote the women's game around the world." 
Although Heinrichs probably has more than 90 percent of her roster set, that does not preclude the emergence of players like Boston midfielder Angela Hucles, who had played for Heinrichs at the University of Virginia but was selling plumbing fixtures when she was drafted in the 12th round, and San Jose goalkeeper LaKeysia Beene. 
"When you have a team in residency it's hard for a player to break in who might be playing well," said Tony DiCiccio, the W.U.S.A. commissioner and Heinrichs's predecessor as national team coach. "Players are getting the opportunity to play in this league, and you want them playing on the cutting edge." 
Off the field, some difficult economic realities led to months of negotiations between the players and the W.U.S.A., a single-entity operation in which the league owns all player contracts. 
The women from the '99 United States World Cup team, also known as the founding players, are entering the third year of five-year guaranteed deals and have agreed to take a 25 percent pay cut, to $60,000 from $80,000 to $85,000. In addition, the average salary this season will be about $37,000, nearly a 20 percent decline from 2002. Roster size was trimmed from 20 to 16, with two reserve players and two developmental players. 
"We had to take a good hard look, and if you look at the economic environment that is going on right now, it is something that had to be addressed," Hamm said. "For us to think that this doesn't affect us would have been naive." 
The league's TV landscape has also changed a bit from last year, when the relatively obscure cable network PAX TV broadcast W.U.S.A. games in direct competition with Major League Soccer matches at 4 p.m. Eastern on Saturdays. This year, ESPN2 will televise four games: tomorrow's match between Washington and Carolina, the All-Star Game (United States vs. the World) on June 17 in Cary, N.C., a playoff game on Aug. 17 and the championship game (Founders Cup III) on Aug. 24 in San Diego.

Anti-Doping Executive Plans to Prod Pro Leagues

BYLINE:  By BILL PENNINGTON 

 BODY:
The man who helped devise a new uniform standard for banned substances and drug testing in all Olympic sports says he plans to ask North America's four major professional sports leagues why they have not signed on to the new regulations.
 Dick Pound, the chief executive of the World Anti-Doping Agency, the organization that devised the comprehensive code, said he intended to contact the commissioners of Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League to ask them to adopt the new guidelines and penalties, which include a fixed, two-year suspension for steroid use. 
 More than 1,000 Olympic, political and sports leaders representing nearly 200 countries convened in Copenhagen early last month to adopt the new world doping code, a 53-page pact detailing banned substances, strict penalties and uniform drug testing rules for all sports -- from badminton to basketball -- under the International Olympic Committee umbrella. 
Now, Pound said, he would like to turn his attention to the North American leagues, each of which has its own anti-drug regulations. "I'd like to meet with each and ask, 'Why not adopt a code approved by a worldwide group of countries, federations and national organizations?"' Pound said in a recent interview. "In the interest of the integrity and health of your sport, and understanding the influential role American athletes have on American youth, why wouldn't you want to join an alliance trying to get serious about banning drugs in sport?"
But pressuring the American professional sports into change is going to be exceedingly difficult. There is a long history of indecision on the subject, not to mention issues of worker rights. And the I.O.C. has no jurisdiction over play in those professional leagues, and little leverage.
American professional players who have competed in the Olympic Games have been subject to drug tests as will those who compete in the 2004 Olympics in Athens. But those tests were administered over a short period. The new world doping code calls for year-round testing and, most important, a two-year ban from competition for certain violations, like steroid use. A second offense can bring a lifetime suspension.
Imagine George Steinbrenner's reaction if he were to lose one of his highly paid players for two years because baseball wanted to adhere to the global doping code. Imagine a Pro Bowl quarterback lost for the same period. Imagine a player barred for life after a second offense.
American professional leagues are not the only ones that have balked at joining with the new global code. European professional soccer leagues have not agreed to the strict penalties adopted under the I.O.C. umbrella. Cycling officials have also been reluctant to sign on.
"It's true that it is not just the American leagues," said Pound, who is a lawyer in Montreal and an I.O.C. member. "In the soccer leagues they test, but many sanctions tend to fall in the four-to-six-month range, cycling even less, and they might let them serve the penalty in the off-season."
Also, in some sports worldwide, testing has been spotty and extremely selective. An entire team, for example, may not be tested.
Still, ever since Mark McGwire hit 70 home runs in 1998 while taking androstenedione, an over-the-counter supplement frequently called a steroid precursor and banned by the I.O.C. as well as the National Collegiate Athletic Association, there has been an international focus on American professional athletes. When a major sport like baseball does not try to enforce a prohibition on steroids, amphetamines or ephedra with extensive testing regulations and strict penalties, the impression of American pro athletes as cheaters widens. Particularly in Europe, American athletes are depicted as artificially crafted behemoths thumbing their noses at well-intentioned, if flawed, international drug policies and tests.
As Jacques Rogge, the I.O.C. president, said recently of the American professional leagues: "There is a little bit of a feeling that double standards have been used in the past. If a U.S. track and field athlete or U.S. cyclist can't use ephedra, why would a professional baseball player be allowed to?"
Pound said: "I plan to go to the American leagues and say, 'You can lead the way for the rest of the world. Are you serious about banning drugs in sports, or are you not?'
"An American baseball player has enormous influence on youth, so the focus is on him. The fact is, he has a responsibility that is greater than it is for a Bulgarian weight lifter. Again, why not lead the way?"
Officials of the four major North American leagues were largely noncommittal on the new international doping regulations. Some, like the N.F.L. -- which already tests periodically for ephedra, steroids and andro, and has a penalty structure for offenders -- insisted they already had a strong anti-drug program for their players.
N.B.A. officials reacted similarly, saying the league tests its veteran players in the preseason for steroids, amphetamines and marijuana and has had talks with the N.B.A. players' union about adding ephedra to the list of banned substances.
"We understand that the I.O.C. has a different drug program that may be appropriate for them, but we don't think it necessarily is applicable to the N.B.A.," said Russ Granik, the N.B.A.'s deputy commissioner. "We don't see any reason why they should be asking the N.B.A. to alter its drug program. The I.O.C. has to deal with different athletes -- weight lifters and cyclists -- sports that deal directly with raw strength and endurance.
"We have a drug program we are very comfortable with that has worked very well for us. Obviously, when our athletes are in the Olympics we comply with their guidelines, and our N.B.A. athletes have had no problems."
Major League Baseball, which does not test for amphetamines or ephedra and has just launched an experimental and anonymous steroid survey testing program that has, as yet, no finite penalties connected to it, indicated that it would be happy to meet with Pound or Rogge.
"But whatever changes considered would have to be negotiated through the collective bargaining agreement," Rich Levin, a spokesman for Major League Baseball, said. 
Asked if baseball management would support additional drug testing for steroids and other drugs in future negotiations with the players' union, Levin said: "That would be a difficult thing. We've just started a new process. We'll evaluate it after this year and deal with it from there."
Minor league baseball players are banned from using certain drugs -- ephedra was banned shortly after the death last month of Baltimore Orioles pitcher Steve Bechler -- but the union for major league players has opposed most drug testing.
The N.H.L. does not test for any I.O.C. banned substance unless a player is identified as part of the league's substance abuse program. The current collective bargaining agreement expires after this season; talks over a new agreement are expected to be contentious, an atmosphere that might make the creation of a new drug testing program even more thorny.
Still, N.H.L. players who competed in the 2002 Olympics were tested by the I.O.C. Bill Daly, the N.H.L. executive vice president and chief legal officer, said the league had kept in close contact with those responsible for drafting the new worldwide doping code.
"While we strongly believe in the importance of maintaining our independence to tailor a program that meets the specific needs and circumstances of our business," Daly said, "there is no doubt that we agree with the stated purposes underlying the new code and the stated reasons for its adoption."
As for Pound's personal efforts to coax the leagues into adhering to the new code, representatives of each of the leagues said they would have to wait to see what Pound proposed.
"We would be glad to listen and would consider any invitation brought to us," Levin said.
Greg Aiello, a spokesman for the N.F.L., said the league had no position on the new doping code. Asked if the N.F.L. was considering change in its drug policies, Aiello said: "We have a very strong program and continue to monitor it as warranted. It is an evolving, on-going process."
Pound is undeterred in his zeal to press the issue on the big business of North American professional sports.
"If they have players taking drugs to improve their performance, then that's cheating," Pound said. "If one player has 14-inch wrists from taking steroids, he is stealing from the players who have 7-inch wrists who don't take steroids. That is an economic crime. Well, now we have a code, adopted by a world of groups, that can do something about that.
"I plan to go to the commissioners of the major American sports and ask them to be come and be a part of that. I may be Pollyannaish, but to me, that's an invitation that is hard to ignore."

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Queens: 43 Arrested In Drug Raids 

BYLINE:  By Shaila K. Dewan (NYT) (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez) 

 BODY:
 After a yearlong investigation, New York City law enforcement agents moved to break up six drug rings in Ozone Park and Howard Beach, Queens, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly and District Attorney Richard A. Brown of Queens said yesterday. The police arrested 43 people and confiscated illegal drugs, 7 guns, 10 luxury cars and nearly $150,000 in cash, the officials said. 
Most of those arrested, Mr. Brown said, were "unemployed mob wannabes" who spent time dining at expensive restaurants and visiting tanning salons. Among those arrested were three people believed to have ties to the Gambino crime family, and the actor Richard Maldone, the police said. Mr. Maldone, who played Albert Barese in several episodes of "The Sopranos," was charged with one count of selling ketamine, a drug popular in nightclubs. Shaila K. Dewan (NYT)

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Asks 3 Food Makers About Dealings With Dutch Chain 

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
The federal investigation into Royal Ahold, the Dutch grocer, appeared to broaden yesterday when three of the largest food manufacturers in the United States said that they had been contacted by regulators about their dealings with Ahold's distribution business.
 General Mills, H. J. Heinz and Kraft Foods said they had been asked by the Securities and Exchange Commission to furnish investigators with documents regarding their transactions with Ahold's U.S. Foodservice division. The companies said they were cooperating with investigators, but declined to provide any further details about what information regulators were examining or what they are seeking to learn. 
 Royal Ahold said in February that it had overstated earnings by $500 million for the last two years because of accounting problems connected to payments made to U.S. Foodservice. The problems involved the inflation of promotional payments from suppliers, falsely increasing the unit's profit.
Two top Ahold executives have resigned, and others from U.S. Foodservice have been suspended. The Justice Department and the S.E.C. are now investigating the company's accounting. 
The payments in question are paid by the manufacturers to distributors like U.S. Foodservice as incentives for putting their products on grocers' shelves.
Last week, ConAgra Foods, Sara Lee and Tyson Foods acknowledged that they had been contacted by federal regulators regarding the investigation of Ahold and its subsidiaries.
At a conference with industry analysts yesterday, Stephen W. Sanger, the chairman and chief executive of General Mills, said his company would continue to supply products to Fleming, the food distribution company that filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday after losing its biggest customer, Kmart.
The S.E.C. is investigating how Fleming accounted for payments to suppliers and how it reported its revenue and earnings. Analysts and other industry experts are concerned that Fleming's suppliers will halt shipments or demand immediate payment.
"We're working actively with Fleming to ensure that we can continue to supply products," Mr. Sanger said in a statement.
Neither the troubles at Ahold nor Fleming are expected to affect General Mills' previously released financial statements or its 2003 earnings, Mr. Sanger added.

HEADLINE: Bush Is Planning to Give States Control of Housing Vouchers 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 3 

 BODY:
The Bush administration wants to give states control of federal vouchers that help nearly two million families pay their rent, which would be a major change for one of the government's largest housing programs.
 Administration officials say states could more efficiently manage the vast program, known as Section 8, which covers 2,600 local housing authorities. About $1 billion in vouchers went unused last year, roughly 8 percent of the program budget. 
 "Section 8 is sort of broke," Housing and Urban Development Secretary Mel Martinez told a Senate subcommittee recently.
Critics of the proposed shift, mainly Democrats and advocates of low-income housing, say they fear that states would establish different standards for who could qualify for the subsidies. They also say the change would further burden states. 
"The voucher program could use some improving," said Irene Basloe Saraf, legislative director for the National Low Income Housing Coalition. "But not to the extent and the type of change that the Bush administration is proposing."
The Section 8 program was started in 1976. Families that make less than 50 percent of an area's median income are eligible for vouchers, with some exemptions available for the elderly and disabled.
People apply for vouchers locally and can use the money to rent private housing. Typically, participants pay no more than 30 percent of their monthly income in rent, with vouchers covering the rest. 
Barbara Thompson, executive director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies, said the proposal could improve the program if there is limited federal regulation and adequate financing for states.
Some cities have long waiting lists for vouchers. Federal rules require that three-fourths of families who get vouchers after waiting be from the lowest income brackets.
Critics say they fear that states would not be required to abide by that rule if HUD makes the switch. The administration is not proposing enough money to keep pace with rents, said Beth Cooper, of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials.
Mr. Martinez envisions a Section 8 program that works with state welfare systems. Congress overhauled the nation's welfare programs in 1996, letting states institute tough eligibility rules and work incentives. 
Full details of planned shift have yet to be released, but critics fear states may be allowed to limit the time someone receives vouchers. 
Mr. Bush proposed the change in his 2004 budget, which includes $13.6 billion for the vouchers, $1 billion more than 2003. That would cover the 1.8 million families on vouchers now, plus a reserve of 100,000. 
Under the plan, which is subject to approval by Congress, money would go to the states, which would distribute the vouchers to local housing agencies that apply for them.

HEADLINE: Editorial Observer; 
To Imagine Iraq After Saddam Hussein, You Must Think Like an Iraqi

BYLINE:  By ETHAN BRONNER 

 BODY:
Every journalist abroad wants to tell his readers at home two contradictory things. The first is: "The people here may look and sound strange, but they are no different from you and me. They want security and dignity; they seek a better life for their children. What you share with them far outweighs your differences." The second message is the opposite: "Yes, people here hunger and hurt and love; yes, they enjoy ice cream and action movies. But if you think that by knowing that, you know them, you are mistaken. These people are very different from you."
 In eight years of reporting from the Middle East, I found myself whipsawed by these two perspectives and never more so than in the five reporting trips I took to Iraq during the 1990's. Since Saddam Hussein had led his country into two disastrous wars and his people live under harsh international sanctions in a pariah state, it was natural to assume that most Iraqis despised him and would dance in the street at the prospect of his removal. Yet that is not necessarily what I found. 
 Since the start of the current American-led war, it has been widely noted that celebration by Iraqis has been muted. The most common explanation is that Iraqis are afraid -- both of government goon squads and of the possibility that we will withdraw prematurely, leaving them at the mercy of whoever comes next.
This is clearly true. But what I found during my visits is that many Iraqis, perhaps a majority, seemed to believe in and identify with Mr. Hussein. While they feared their ruthless leader, what they feared even more was life without him.
I know this seems unfathomable. How could any people support a leader of such cruelty and megalomania? Don't Iraqis, like other people, thirst for freedom? Maybe, but political freedom is such a foreign concept that most Iraqis have no context in which to thirst for it. The contours of debate within Iraq are so narrow that there is no meaningful way to discuss negative feelings about Mr. Hussein. Indeed, the language of Iraqi politics has been so degraded that it provides no framework for opposition, let alone for what might be imagined as an alternative. It is, as one diplomat put it to me, "like a church -- people don't stop to ask if the God they are praying to is good."
This is not to say that Iraqis would not want to live one day in an honest, decent, free society. But it is to suggest that they are likely to misinterpret everything about such a plan, at least in the short term. They believe that the United States, which has led the international boycott of their country, has been keeping them down for the past 12 years. Tell them the same country has decided to spend billions and risk its young people to liberate them, and they will probably have no idea of what you might be talking about. 
Wherever I went during my visits to Iraq, often without a government minder at my side, I kept finding people who said Iraq's problem was the United States, not Mr. Hussein. Washington was responsible for sanctions, and Americans clearly feared a strong, independent Arab power, they said. That's why the United States opposed Mr. Hussein.
I also found the opposite: former government officials and professors, whose sadly elegant homes on the Tigris River were crumbling as their fixed salaries grew worthless. They despised what had become of their once-cosmopolitan lives, and they blamed Iraq's leadership more than Washington's.
An art gallery owner I met, a woman with impeccable English, said that without Mr. Hussein, factions within the Kurds and Shiites would be at each other's throats, and that fundamentalists would take over the government. She cited the modernization of roads, the economy and education, and the progress made by women under him. Iraq had a bloody history, she said, and without someone strong, even brutal, at the top, it would descend into chaos. 
In 1995, Mr. Hussein held his first popular "referendum" and "won" more than 99 percent of the vote. Everybody abroad dismissed it, but my sense was that an honest poll would still have given him a victory -- with 55 or 60 percent.
Part of the explanation is the nature of totalitarianism: millions of Soviets wept when Stalin died. Part of it is the nature of being held hostage. Iraq is a nation of Elizabeth Smarts. But part of it seems to have to do with the current state of the Arab world -- and here we face the "they are like us; they are different" conundrum. Regardless of how any of us feel about our political leaders, we do not worship them, nor do we consider it appropriate to do so. Iraq, on the other hand, is immersed in a cult of personality, and it is not the only Arab country where that is true. 
Nearly every state in the region develops what is to us a bizarre and harmful devotion to its ruler, hanging his portrait on every corner and considering criticism of him an insult to the entire nation. And this extends beyond the state's own borders. One can understand why Iraqis are afraid to criticize Mr. Hussein, but how to explain why Egyptians, Bahrainis and Palestinians have not made him the special target of contempt? Who has killed more Muslims in the modern world than Mr. Hussein? Yet there is no Arab literature devoted to his misdeeds. 
All of this suggests that when the war is won, engaging the Iraqi nation in the project of building an open society could prove extremely challenging. Public service has no meaning in Iraq. Each layer of bureaucracy lords its power over the one below it.
This does not mean we shouldn't try. But we must do so with eyes open to the nature of the task. If there is a ray of hope, it comes perhaps from the fact that one of the most clear-minded critics of Arab and Iraqi politics over the past 20 years -- Kanan Makiya -- is also among the strongest advocates of this war. Mr. Makiya, an Iraqi dissident, has been unflinching in his criticism but remarkably determined as he looks ahead. And indeed, it may be true that once the dictator is gone, his support will vanish with him.
Mr. Makiya wants a federal, demilitarized, democratic Iraq. "We have gone down one road as far as any group of human beings can," he says of the horrors of the Iraqi state. "Now we must try to go down another." That makes sense. Will Iraqis get it? I hope so. But very little from my time there gives me cause for optimism.

HEADLINE: Spanish Premier's Support for War Is Hurting Him Politically 

BYLINE:  By EMMA DALY 

DATELINE: MADRID, April 3 

 BODY:
Only a few weeks ago, the Spanish Prime Minister, Jose Maria Aznar, was basking in the glow of international attention, a privileged visitor to George Bush's ranch in Texas, an A-list participant in Anglo-American meetings on Iraq.
 But two weeks into the war, with little to show for his fervent support of the American-led operation and local elections looming, Mr. Aznar is under intense criticism. Millions of Spaniards have taken to the streets to protest the war and to condemn Mr. Aznar as an imperialist lackey (and worse); he is trailing in the polls and cracks are appearing in his party's united front. 
 "War sinks Aznar's popularity," proclaimed El Pais, Spain's leading daily newspaper and a critic of the Aznar government. A poll taken for the paper five days into the invasion showed Spaniards citing the war as the second main issue of concern, after unemployment. Mr. Aznar's approval rating, already flagging after seven years in power, had fallen 10 points in three months.
"The electorate demands that the PP change course," was the headline on a recent editorial in the daily El Mundo, which argues that the Popular Party will fare badly in local elections called for May 25, in part because of the war.
Florentino Portero, an analyst with the Strategic Studies Group in Madrid, said, "Spain is now facing an election campaign, so Aznar will try to speak less about the war and try to regain all the ground lost over the past few months." 
Mr. Aznar has long argued that supporting the war was the right thing to do, emphasizing the issue of terrorism to a country beset by the violent separatist group ETA. He plans to step down before general elections next year, which, until recently, the Popular Party was expected to win. Now potential successors are said to be afraid that voters will stay home to punish the party.
"They will not say so publicly, but many senior members of the PP disagree with Aznar's handling of the war," said Felipe Sahagun, a political commentator for Spanish state television. "They think he is jeopardizing the interests of Spain and the party for an action that is illegal."
He added, "If Baghdad falls soon, and the end of the war comes quickly, it will limit the damage because it will clearly be an American victory."
In the last two weeks, the party has lost Manuel Pimentel, a former minister, who resigned his party membership because of his opposition to the war. Almost every day, local officials follow his lead. Perhaps more significant, Felix Pastor, a senior party official, castigated the official line from a conservative perspective: "The idea of the PP as moderate, humanitarian and Christian has been blown away," he told El Mundo. "The Christian vote will be lost because of the government's complete indifference to the positions of Pope John Paul II." The Catholic right has been irked by the pope's anti-war pronouncements. Mr. Aznar has used the Iraq crisis to fulfill his desire to see Spain as a global player, but critics say he has been unable to display any tangible benefits.

HEADLINE: Big Board Abandons a Plan To Restrict Some Press Access 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
The New York Stock Exchange backed away from a plan yesterday to stop Wall Street analysts from talking to newspapers, television networks or other media outlets that do not disclose the analysts' potential conflicts of interest in their reports.
 The exchange also said yesterday that it had nominated William J. McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, who has announced plans to retire in July, to be a public representative on its board. 
 Richard A. Grasso, the chairman of the exchange, is moving to quell a pair of controversies at a time when the Big Board's position as the world's dominant stock exchange appears more secure than it has been in years. While the Nasdaq stock market has fallen 72 percent since the technology stock bubble burst in 2000, the Big Board has lost less than one-third its value. 
The exchange dropped plans to bar Wall Street analysts from talking to journalists who do not disclose that the analysts, or their firms, have potential conflicts of interest concerning the stocks the analysts rate. When the exchange's proposal was disclosed last fall, newspapers complained that the Big Board had no right to try to regulate whether its members could talk to them and said the proposal might violate the First Amendment.
Edward A. Kwalwasser, the Big Board's group executive vice president for regulation, said at a news conference yesterday that analysts would be required to tell journalists about potential conflicts of interest between their firms and the companies they rate. The conflicts could include bids for investment banking business, other securities-industry-related business or even services provided by corporate affiliates of the investment bank, he said. For example, an analyst for Smith Barney, which is owned by Citigroup, would have to disclose that he had a potential conflict if a mortgage on the headquarters of a company he rated was provided by another Citigroup subsidiary.
But analysts will not be penalized if the journalists who are interviewing them do not disclose those conflicts in their reports, Mr. Kwalwasser and Mr. Grasso said.
"What the media does with it, that's entirely up to them," Mr. Grasso said.
The nomination of Mr. McDonough to the exchange's board comes less than two weeks after Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of Citigroup, withdrew from consideration for the same board seat. Mr. Weill's nomination was criticized by people who said that as the head of a giant financial institution, he could not fairly represent the public's interest at the exchange. The sharpest complaints came from Eliot Spitzer, the New York State attorney general, who said that Mr. Weill's nomination was a "gross misjudgment and a violation of trust," and promised to fight the nomination.
Mr. Grasso said at the news conference that if he had anticipated the response to Mr. Weill's nomination, "I would have counseled in a different direction."
He said the exchange planned to review its rules for nominating directors, which have not been changed substantially in more than 30 years. The exchange board now has 12 directors who are supposed to represent the public, 12 directors who represent the securities industry and 3 exchange executives, including Mr. Grasso. But under the exchange's convoluted rules, Mr. Weill could not qualify as an industry representative, Mr. Grasso said.
The Big Board also said it had nominated Robert B. Fagenson, vice chairman of the specialist firm Van der Moolen, to join the board as a securities industry representative.
In response to questions from reporters, Mr. Grasso also provided an update on the Big Board's disaster contingency plans. The exchange has decided not to have two trading floors operating simultaneously, he said. Instead, it will keep all trading at its heavily fortified headquarters complex in Lower Manhattan, while maintaining a smaller backup floor.
For cost and logistical reasons, Mr. Grasso said, the exchange decided against running two floors. In addition, moving traders away from downtown would further damage the city's economy, and the exchange did not want to do that, he said.
Finally, Robert Zito, the exchange's head of communications, said that the Big Board planned to continue to talk to journalists from Al Jazeera, the Arabic-language news network, whom it barred last week from its floor. The exchange revoked the journalists' credentials because of concerns about Al Jazeera's coverage of the war.
While the move has generated some complaints of censorship from outside the exchange, many Big Board members have strongly supported the decision, Mr. Zito said.

Luxury Rentals on Yonkers Waterfront

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
The first residential development in downtown Yonkers in more than 30 years, a luxury rental complex with 266 one- and two-bedroom apartments, is nearing completion on the city's burgeoning waterfront. Called Hudson Square, the $60 million complex includes 22,000 square feet of office, retail and restaurant space.
 For Yonkers, the opening of the apartment complex represents a major step in the rebirth of its downtown waterfront, a former industrial site that fell into disrepair in the 1950's and 1960's. According to Edward A. Sheeran, the Yonkers director of economic development, Hudson Park is the single largest private investment in the waterfront in the city's history. 
 Larkin Center, the new 200,000-square-foot home of the Yonkers Public Library and the city's Board of Education, opened in October across the street from Hudson Park on the former site of the headquarters of Otis Elevator, which left in 1972. 
Next to the apartments, the Metro-North Railroad station is undergoing a $35 million renovation of its historic Beaux Arts structure. The revived waterfront also features the newly opened Esplanade Park, a 1.5-mile promenade with unobstructed views of the Palisades on the opposite shore.
The developer of the Hudson Park complex is Collins Enterprises, which is based in Stamford, Conn. Collins, which specializes in the redevelopment of urban properties, has built a number of residential and office projects in Connecticut. The latest is an $18 million, 75,000-square-foot office complex on the site of a former American Cyanamid factory on the Stamford waterfront. 
Collins, in a joint venture with Avalon Bay Communities, built the Avalon, a 110-unit, $26.5 million rental complex completed in 1998 in Bronxville in Westchester County. A year and a half ago, Collins sold its interest in the project to Avalon Bay. Arthur Collins II, president of the company, said his concern, which also has several housing projects in Norfolk, Va., was actively considering other sites in Westchester.
Because Hudson Park is situated next to the Getty Square Station on the Metro-North's Hudson line, the apartments are being marketed to professionals in their 20's and empty nesters, many of whom want to be close to Manhattan, Mr. Collins said. The express train from Getty Square to Grand Central Station at rush hour takes 28 minutes. But with the location convenient to major highways, Mr. Collins said he was also focusing on renters working in Westchester.
The new apartment complex is comprised of two brick buildings, each of which are staggered in height from four to nine stories to maintain views of the waterfront for the public from other vantage points in the city. The apartments range from 697 square feet to 1,147 square feet, with rents beginning at $1,575 a month for a one-bedroom apartment and going up to $2,936 for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom unit with a den on the ninth floor with a full view of the river.Tenants are being offered the first month's rent free.
Included in the rent are amenities like membership in a fitness center, use of an on-site business center and concierge service. All apartments include washers and dryers. Parking in a covered area costs $75 a month; in outside areas, it is $50 a month.
The architect for the project, Do H. Chung of Stamford, who has worked with Collins Enterprises since 1975, said he designed Hudson Park so that as many apartments as possible had views of the Hudson. Because of the manner in which the buildings are massed and the way their heights are staggered, at least 80 percent of the apartments have at least partial river views, he said.
Brick was used for the facade of each building, in four different colors and sizes to give the impression of many separate buildings, Mr. Chung said, and the style of the eaves and trim varies.
He said his firm, Do H. Chung & Partners, followed design guidelines for the Yonkers waterfront established by Ehrenkrantz Eckstut & Kuhn, the firm that produced the master plan for Battery Park City.
Under an agreement with the Yonkers Industrial Development Agency, Collins is leasing the two and a quarter acres of waterfront land on which its buildings sit from the city. The developer will make payments in lieu of taxes to the city for the first 15 years; for the first 10 years, these payments will be $70,000 a year, after which they will increase in steps to about $1 million. After 15 years, Collins will be responsible for about $1 million in annual property taxes.
A rental office is open at the site, and occupancy is to begin on May 15.

Cablevision Provision Could Benefit YES

BYLINE:  By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
For all the bitterness that existed between the YES Network and Cablevision over the past year -- and that still exists, despite their finally signing a deal on Monday -- they agreed on a provision in which Cablevision essentially becomes a financial defender of YES.
 The provision in the one-year contract involves indemnification. It requires that Cablevision reimburse YES for lost subscriber fees, advertising revenues and legal costs under two conditions: if other local cable operators claim economic loss because Cablevision is not carrying YES as an expanded basic cable channel, or if those cable systems follow Cablevision's lead by selling YES only in premium packages or as an a la carte service. 
 The issue was first raised at about 10 a.m. on March 12, about eight hours before Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced a tentative deal between the companies at Gracie Mansion. That deal fell apart on March 28, but was resuscitated three days later. 
From March 12 to the March 31 signing of the contract, the financial fundamentals of the deal remained the same: Cablevision will pay YES a monthly subscriber fee of $2.12 for every customer who receives the channel, and it will guarantee payments based on 51 percent of its 2.9 million local subscribers.
But because Cablevision is selling YES only as a premium channel -- unlike all other cable operators in the metropolitan area, as well as DirecTV -- Cablevision felt it had to make a serious concession that could prove costly.
James L. Dolan, the president of Cablevision, suggested that he would indemnify YES against losses, as a tradeoff for the agreement by YES to permit Cablevision to carry the sports channel as a premium channel instead of on expanded basic; that means that YES will not automatically be seen by the vast majority of Cablevision's local subscribers.
Dolan vehemently expressed his belief that Cablevision should make the offer, believing that Cablevision would end up paying YES little or nothing, according to several executives at the meeting. Yet, one Cablevision official said, Dolan could live with paying as much as $20 million. 
That payment would come on top of the minimum $37.6 million that Cablevision must pay YES this year for the right to carry the Yankees' channel. The indemnification is based on what the cable operators serving the inner markets that are closest to New York City do, along with DirecTV. 
The inner markets, which are called Zone 1, include 5.2 million TV households, more than half of which are in Cablevision territory. That leaves between 2.2 million and 2.3 million households served almost entirely by Time Warner and Comcast, as well as homes with DirecTV's satellite service.
Dolan is betting that those cable operators who have carried YES on expanded basic since last year will not take the chance of enraging customers by triggering a clause in their contracts (called a "most favored nation clause," or M.F.N.) that would allow them to switch YES to a premium tier or to sell it as a stand-alone channel. If they do not take advantage of that opportunity, these operators could argue that they have been economically hurt and seek the damages that Cablevision has agreed to finance.
Mark Harrad, a spokesman for Time Warner, said yesterday, "We're looking at the M.F.N., to see what the ramifications are for our agreement. There's no way to see how this will come out right now."
Michael Thornton, a senior vice president of DirecTV, said it was likely that the satellite service would seek damages "based on the economic advantage that Cablevision has in tiering YES." He said that taking YES off DirecTV's version of expanded basic would be unfair to subscribers.
All losses would be determined through arbitration or litigation; until those determinations are made, Cablevision would have to pay YES.
But asserting their rights does not mean that Time Warner, Comcast or DirecTV would get their way. If they claim economic loss, YES could challenge them on Cablevision's behalf. 
This is the fun part: first Cablevision pays damages for YES, then YES plays Perry Mason for Cablevision.Theoretically, cable operators would love to put YES, along with every other regional sports network and ESPN, on a premium or sports tier. They are aghast at the price of carrying sports, and would love to reduce the increasing (and unregulated) price of basic cable by selling sports services only to those subscribers who want them.
Some officials of large cable operators insist that the sports cable economic model is broken; once upon a time, sports networks were cheap enough to keep on basic cable. 
But now, they say, the rise in players' salaries have forced teams to seek increasingly higher rights fees from cable channels who in turn force cable operators to pay more, passing that cost along to all expanded basic consumers, including those who do not want those services.
"What's broken is the relationship between distributors and content providers," James O. Robbins, the president of Cox Cable, said recently. "The rise in cable rates are predominantly driven by sports programming costs."

HEADLINE: Visions and Revisions of Child-Raising Experts 

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA COHEN 

 BODY:
Parents have never lacked for expert advice. "Kissing the baby after it has been fed is very likely to cause it to vomit." "Never let them sit on your lap." "Shake hands with them in the morning." "It's your problem, not your child's." 
 Ever since the science of child development was invented in the beginning of the 20th century, experts have offered parents a goulash of advice on how to raise the little marvel (or monster), creating as much anxiety and confusion as they are supposed to assuage. "I try to do just what you say," one 1920's mother complained, "but I am a nervous wreck just trying to be calm." 
 Given the proliferation of books about how Americans should raise the baby, it was inevitable that scholars would eventually turn to the question of why Americans are so obsessed with raising the baby. In a string of new books, social and cultural historians are trying to figure out just what it is about American parents that makes them so anxious -- and so eager to turn to the experts. Their theories differ, but what they do agree on is that there's a lot more to child care advice than simply child care. 
Views on family values, cultural trends, social developments and economic conditions have often turned out to be more important than any research. (The time-consuming child-centered approach wouldn't have had a chance in the 1950's if affluence hadn't made washing machines and vacuum cleaners commonplace in middle-class homes). "It wasn't firm data that drove child rearing expertise," Ann Hulbert points out in her forthcoming book, "Raising America: Experts, Parents and a Century of Advice About Children" (Knopf), "but changing social concerns that seemed to dictate its swerves and emphases."
The very development of "modern" child rearing practices was prompted by industrialization's disorienting shifts. As far back as 1909, Margaret Mead declared that "so longstanding and so rapid have been these processes of change that expectation of change and anxiety about change have been built into our character as a people."
She continued, "We have become correspondingly more anxious that they" -- our children -- "should be perfectly equipped before they go."
With these unsettling and rapid turns, early reformers declared it was time for science to take over and produce well-adjusted children who were prepared for the brave, not to mention complex and unpredictable, new world. The Progressive Era was fascinated with science and professionalization, and child-rearing trends, not surprisingly, mirrored those obsessions. 
Intellectuals, too, were preoccupied with replacing hoary traditions and religious practices with rational logic and science. Scientific education got further impetus after World War I, when army recruits were given I.Q. tests for the first time, Julia Grant writes in "Raising Baby by the Book" (Yale University Press, 1998). Half were graded at below-normal intelligence, causing an uproar that America was raising half-wits and incompetents. 
The creation of the child development field also proved a socially acceptable path for the increasing numbers of women who were earning college degrees. "Educators defined motherhood as valuable work requiring extensive knowledge and training," writes Ms. Grant, an associate professor at James Madison College at Michigan State University. Meanwhile, she continues, "the notion that the proper practice of motherhood demanded esoteric knowledge allowed women to reconcile their intellectual interests with their everyday lives in the home."
Anxiety over women's roles was not the only impetus for standardizing child-rearing practices. So were racial fears. Child-rearing advice became part of a larger project of Americanization, a way to assimilate immigrants and African-Americans more quickly, Ms. Grant argues. 
Soon bringing up baby was seen as too important to be left to amateurs. "It is beyond the capacity of the individual parent to train her child to fit into the intricate, interwoven and interdependent social and economic system we have developed," Ray Lyman Wilbur, the president of Stamford University, told a White House conference on children in 1930. 
Yet even after the novelty of industrialization and immigration faded, parental anxiety and the advice industry remained. Some scholars pointed to the cultural and geographical isolation that accompanied the move to the suburbs, when aunts, grandmothers and cousins were no longer nearby for kitchen klatches.
Others offered a different analysis. In the 1950's, the influential psychologist Erik Erikson argued that the loosening of religious strictures had left some parents without an outlet for their self-punishing impulses and therefore psychologically predisposed to feel anxious. "In certain cases and at certain times, whatever you say will be interpreted in such a way that a sense of guilt is produced in order to gratify a need to feel guilty," Erikson wrote.
Many researchers accused the media of fanning anxiety with sensational reporting of violence, freak accidents and health scares, says Frank Furedi, a sociologist at the University of Kent and the author of "Paranoid Parenting" (Chicago Review Press, 2003). Mr. Furedi argues that an even bigger culprit is "the breakdown of adult solidarity," or the notion that everyone shares responsibility for children (the it-takes-a-village approach). 
And most recently, Janna Malamud Smith, in her book "A Potent Spell: Mother Love and the Power of Fear" (Houghton Mifflin, 2003), argues that society has exploited maternal anxiety, tying mothers even closer to the home in order to avoid governmental responsibility for child welfare.
The expert advice that has fed -- and been fed by -- that parental anxiety has seesawed between two poles at a dizzying speed: what various scholars have called hard and soft, strict and permissive, nature and nurture, parent-centered and child-centered, Lockean and Rousseauean. Proponents of each approach can be found in every era, but if you want to know which has had the upper hand, take a look at what is happening outside the home.
Cultural critics in the 1920's, for example, warned against cloying motherly love, fearing it would fail to prepare children for the impersonal industrial world they were to enter. This concern paved the way for behavioralists like John B. Watson, who boasted of being able to program children as if they were microchips. 
During World War II, when the draft and the growing numbers of working women disrupted family life and fears of fascism ran high, the pendulum swung the other way: child experts now fretted about insufficient motherly attention. Coercive child-rearing produced frustrated, aggressive children, some experts argued. This was the period when the philosopher Theodore Adorno, a refugee from Nazism, wrote "The Authoritarian Personality," in 1950, arguing that stern, unloving homes produced prejudiced and authoritarian children. "A determination grew," Christina Hardyment writes in "Perfect Parents: Baby-Care Advice Past and Present" (Oxford Univerity Press, 1995), "to allow the children of the free world to be more free than children had ever been." 
It was into this atmosphere that the most celebrated child expert of all, Dr. Benjamin Spock, introduced the best-selling baby guide in history. Dr. Spock's warm and friendly approach offered more freedom to parents and children. The collaborative thinking that he endorsed was part of a cultural trend. As Ms. Hulbert points out, in 1946, the same year that Dr. Spock published his first edition of "Baby and Child Care," the political scientist Peter Drucker published "The Concept of the Corporation," which argued for more worker-management partnerships and more worker autonomy.
By 1968, though, Dr. Spock's outspoken opposition to the Vietnam War caused many critics to equate his politics with what they believed was his permissive brand of parenting. "The politics of child rearing and the politics of the nation had rarely been so clearly linked in the popular imagination," Ms. Grant writes. 
And until the 1970's, experts warned working mothers about the damage they were inflicting on their children by their absence. Only after the women's movement shifted public opinion did the experts shift too. (Dr. Spock himself switched positions frequently over the years as fashions changed, on everything from working women to drinking milk.) 
Subtle -- and not-so-subtle -- ideological agendas can also be discerned in the current brain research, as a new crop of baby experts use neuroscience to argue that children's personalities and abilities are either determined before they're out of diapers or remarkably malleable.
Yet among parents' obeisance to the books, there has been a subversive strain that has bridled at the tyranny of the expert. Even Arnold Gesell, one of the most famous child experts (who reassured us that "it's just a phase"), was told by his daughter-in-law, Peggy, after the birth of her second child in the 1940's, that "science is as nothing to me compared to a few minutes more sleep." 
That all-in-the-family skepticism has continued to spread. By the time of the 1950 White House conference on children, expert advice had so proliferated that overdependence on it was now the chief topic of concern.
And now one can read books with subtitles like the one Mr. Furedi put on his: "Why Ignoring the Experts May be Best for Your Child." "Parents are no more ignorant than the experts," Mr. Furedi declares, so "we might as well ignore them and act on our instincts." 
But why should the run-of-the-mill parent accept that advice? 
Because an expert tells them so.

HEADLINE: Creating a New Lure to Catch Crowds for Classical Music 

BYLINE:  By ANNE MIDGETTE 

 BODY:
In the current economy classical music is often said to be in trouble. Selling tickets in New York is a competitive business. Organizations are struggling with the question of how to attract wider audiences. 
 Jacqueline Taylor and Omus Hirshbein, longtime classical music presenters and administrators, have come up with a way to offer their art that addresses these problems. 
 They're giving it away.
"Free for All at Town Hall," their new concert series, opens tomorrow with a recital by Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg and Anne-Marie McDermott, the noted violinist and pianist, playing Schubert, Faure and Beethoven. Tickets will be distributed at the Town Hall box office, starting at noon on the day of the concert. Cost: nothing.
The point is to make great music available to an audience that cannot afford a high-priced ticket. Ms. Taylor, 38, who for six years was executive director of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, and Mr. Hirshbein, 68, who for 20 years oversaw a cultural renaissance at the 92nd Street Y, have cast their nets wide. They have placed ads in a host of publications that presenters often overlook. 
The catch: none, beyond the obvious difficulty of raising money during an economic downturn. Ms. Taylor's and Mr. Hirshbein's nonprofit organization, Twin Lions Inc., has amassed money from private donors, foundation grants and their charter corporate sponsor, WQXR, which is owned by The New York Times Company. But with the costs of renting the hall and paying the artists they still need to raise $100,000 to complete their four-concert season. "If it's meant to be, it's going to happen," Ms. Taylor said last week, sitting in Mr. Hirshbein's elegant West Side apartment, where Twin Lions has commandeered a spare bedroom. "It's God's work." 
The idea had its seeds in "Beethoven 2000," a cycle of the Beethoven quartets that the Chamber Music Society offered in Ms. Taylor's final season. During a Lincoln Center council meeting about ways to mark the year 2000, one director mentioned his dream of filling the halls of the complex with a kind of public open house, and Ms. Taylor promptly went to David Shifrin, the Chamber Music Society's artistic director, who was planning a Beethoven cycle with the Orion String Quartet. "I said, 'We should make it free to the public, in celebration of 2000,' " Ms. Taylor said. "Everyone around me thought I was crazy," she added, "because you can sell out the Beethoven quartets at Lincoln Center, so why would you give them away?"
One answer: because of the long lines snaking down Amsterdam Avenue before every concert. "They were of all ages, races and dress codes, exactly the target audience classical music organizations everywhere are trying to attract," Anthony Tommasini wrote in his review in The New York Times. "And when the final quartet ended, the players were greeted with a standing, whooping ovation."
Ms. Taylor said the experience had been unforgettable. She had already announced that she was leaving the Chamber Music Society and going back to graduate school. But she said, "All I could think about was what I had just experienced, how to keep doing more of that."
Ms. Taylor's excitement touched a spark in Mr. Hirshbein, her former boss and mentor at the Y. After subsequent stints at the National Endowment for the Arts and the New York Chamber Symphony, Mr. Hirshbein was "loose," as he put it, and ready not only to listen to Ms. Taylor's vision of a nonprofit organization to present free concerts, but to act on it. "Without him, it would have just been talk," Ms. Taylor said.
Mr. Hirshbein approached Patti Cadby Birch, an art collector and philanthropist, and convinced her of the idea's merit. Mrs. Birch committed $100,000, and the project was under way. In its first season, "Free for All" is presenting four major New York recitals. Edgar Meyer, the bassist, will appear on May 11; David Finckel and Wu Han will play all of Beethoven's cello sonatas on June 8; and Joshua Bell, the star violinist, appears on June 29. 
In addition to the appeal of its mandate, the series offers the lure of Town Hall, once an obligatory station in a musician's career. "I feel like I'm making my debut," Wu Han said. 
The music is not in question, but the future is. Fund-raising has been tough: "It's a mess out there," Ms. Taylor said, and it is not as if the team can look forward to a boost from the box office. Nor are there advance sales to help estimate the turnout. Mr. Finckel, the Emerson Quartet's cellist and Wu Han's husband, said it was up to the artists to make it work. "I put a lot of responsibility on us," he said. "Hopefully a lot of people will come that have not heard a classical concert before, so the quality of performance has to be as great as any performance can possibly be." 
Ms. Taylor said, "The point is to have excellence." She added: "When I'm sitting in the fourth row of the Metropolitan Opera listening to some of the most exquisite music that exists on the planet, all I can think is, 'Who is this for?' Humanity has given the world incredible gifts, and I just want more of it to be available to more people without any connection to their ability to buy a ticket."

HEADLINE: Alcoa Says Its Profit Fell 30% in the First Quarter 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Alcoa Inc., the aluminum producer, said yesterday its first-quarter profit fell 30 percent because of higher energy costs and softness in the aerospace and commercial building markets.
 Alcoa, the first Dow component to report earnings, posted net income of $151 million, or 17 cents a share, down from $218 million, or 26 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. 
 Excluding special items, the company posted earnings of 23 cents a share. Analysts had expected earnings of 15 cents to 24 cents a share, with a mean forecast of 19 cents, according to the tracking firm Thomson First Call. 
Alcoa is cutting costs and restructuring its businesses as oversupply and slowing demand in the aerospace and energy industries have hurt aluminum prices.
Fewer airline passengers and falling ticket prices have led to a decline in new aircraft orders, while low wholesale electricity prices and the poor credit quality of many energy companies have forced the cancellation or delay of new power plants.
But new acquisitions and strong demand from the automotive sector helped increase revenue 4 percent, to $5.11 billion in the quarter.
The company, based in Pittsburgh, also cited aggressive cost-cutting for its quarterly earnings. Alcoa said it had now achieved $808 million of the $1 billion in cost savings it is aiming for by the end of 2003, and it remained "solidly on track to meet that challenge."
It said in January that it would eliminate 8,000 jobs, or about 6 percent of its work force. Most of the jobs will be cut this year from smelters and from businesses serving the aerospace, gas turbine and auto industries.
Alcoa said it achieved $52 million in cost savings in the first quarter.
Shares of Alcoa rose 13 cents yesterday, to $20.04, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Alcoa announced its earnings after the close of regular trading. The shares rose as high as $20.75 after hours.

HEADLINE: The Fragility of Iraq 

 BODY:
The good news about the looming humanitarian crisis in Iraq is that it is not yet a crisis. There are pockets of desperate need but no widespread suffering. Ifsufficient military power can be brought to bear quickly to guarantee the security of aid workers, it should be possible to supply all the food, water and medical supplies needed. 
 Allied officials and nongovernmental organizations have been surprised and relieved that no major humanitarian shortages have yet developed. There has been no mass movement of war refugees fleeing from desperate conditions in southern Iraq, and the exodus of thousands of residents from Baghdad is driven more by fear of being caught in the midst of a battle than by deprivation. 
 Supplies of food and water are clearly short in some areas. The first relief trucks into towns in southern Iraq triggered near-riots as residents scrambled to grab food rations and water bottles. But over all the food supplies in Iraq are mostly adequate. The Iraqi government distributed enough food before the conflict began to last the average family to the end of April, so it will be a few weeks before the situation becomes desperate.
Strenuous efforts by the allies to avoid bombing water pumps and treatment plants, and the electrical systems they rely on, have mostly succeeded, guaranteeing most Iraqis a clean supply of drinking water. The worst potential problem -- a water crisis in Basra when a pumping station was knocked out by the loss of electricity -- has been largely solved through the heroic efforts of the International Committee of the Red Cross, whose engineers put the plant back on line. A water crisis in Umm Qasr has been mitigated by opening a water pipeline from Kuwait, though distribution remains chaotic. There has been no major outbreak of disease in Iraq.
Still, the situation is extremely fragile. The port of Umm Qasr, which was declared open with great fanfare this week when a small British relief ship delivered its supplies, is still threatened by mines, in need of dredging and short of the skilled manpower needed to unload large relief ships. The overriding problem throughout the south is that the same armed resistance that slowed the military thrust to the north continues to render most areas too dangerous for civilian aid workers.
The supplies and money for large-scale humanitarian assistance are being assembled. This week, the U.S. Agency for International Development pledged to contribute $200 million in cash to the United Nations World Food Program to buy emergency food for Iraq from other countries in the region, thus short-circuiting the need to wait for shipments from the United States. The U.N. itself has taken temporary control of an Iraqi oil-for-food account to pay for humanitarian aid, and some supplies trickled into the south yesterday. But all this will go for little unless the military devotes enough resources to suppress the armed resistance quickly and make all areas of Iraq safe for humanitarian workers to perform their lifesaving jobs.

HEADLINE: New York's Horror Budget 

 BODY:
Albany's three top leaders are circling one another warily, trying to figure out who will be the first to admit the hard truth: New York State's budget is in such horrendous shape that it will take a mix of taxes, cuts and borrowing to fix it.
 Until recently, Gov. George Pataki was virtually useless in responding to the fiscal crisis, which includes both a monstrous $11.5 billion gap and the possibility that the state could actually run out of cash later this spring. So far, his main concern seems to be making sure that his name is not wedded to any increases in what he calls "job killing" taxes. But this is a sham -- his own budget includes $1.4 billion in fees and sales taxes, which particularly touch the middle and working classes. His cuts in school aid have already forced local communities to start raising property taxes, in some cases more than 30 percent. 
 Mr. Pataki has finally begun to get engaged. Sometimes, however, it is not the engagement we need. Petitioning Washington at the last minute to try to wrest federal funds from New York City is the wrong move on every count. It makes the governor look petty and the state look disorganized.
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the lone Democrat in Albany's trio of leaders, spends much of his time offering comfort to groups of aggrieved citizens who want the governor's cuts restored. But Mr. Silver must know that many of those people are going to have to be disappointed. He has to establish priorities, with education funds at the top.
The speaker deserves credit for coming up with a reasonable plan for borrowing money because Mr. Pataki's idea of using proceeds from the tobacco company settlement to secure bonds is no longer very secure. But Mr. Silver apparently wants more company before he publicly adds taxes to the mix. The Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, a Republican like Mr. Pataki, is trying to be the deal maker for this trio. Like Mr. Silver, he recognizes that the leaders must make unpopular decisions this year, not next year when there are legislative elections.
As budget experts warn about the state's running dry of cash in May or perhaps even June, Mr. Pataki, Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver will have to work fast to come up with answers. Closing corporate tax loopholes would help, as would a commuter tax for the city. The most reasonable solution for balancing the budget would be a broad-based income tax increase that would be phased down over a few years, coupled with across-the-board cuts that would be phased in over much the same period. Borrowing, as bad as it is, will have to be done, but as minimally as possible and over the shortest term available.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg has been mild-mannered and mostly uncomplaining in public about the fact that Mr. Pataki, his fellow Republican, has been offering less than zero help to New York City, the state's economic engine. The mayor has been trying to use honey to placate the grizzlies in the Capitol, but it is time for something less subtle, like a two-by-four, to get the Albany crowd's attention.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: DISSENT; 
The Rural Opposition: Protesting Where Everybody Knows Your Name

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: HARMONY, Minn., April 3 

 BODY:
When Eva Barr called the county courthouse to ask about a permit for an antiwar protest, the clerk on the other end of the line went silent.
 "Well, I don't know that I've ever dealt with such a phone call before," Ms. Barr, 36, recalled the clerk saying after a while. "I don't even know who to ask." 
 That was in January, when Ms. Barr concluded that "it's not exclusively for urbanites to be opposed to the established order" and decided not to drive an hour to Rochester, or two to the Twin Cities, to wave a sign. 
Instead, she and a band of protesters calling themselves Rural Peacemakers have spent Saturday mornings since then tromping around this corner of southeastern Minnesota, where cattle outnumber people and yellow ribbons are far more visible than "Stop War" bumper stickers.
In what old-timers say are the first street marches in these parts -- other than on Memorial Day -- the protesters paraded past the marquee proclaiming "United We Stand" outside Harmony AgriServices and the "Support the Troops" signs in the pharmacist's window in this village of 1,081. They marched through the downtowns of Canton, population 343; Chatfield, 2,394; Mabel, 766; Rushford, 1,614; and Spring Valley, 2,518. Nine people stood in Preston, population 1,426 and the county seat, the weekend before the war began, and a crowd of 81 descended on Feb. 15 on the artsy hamlet of Lanesboro, 788, where a church potluck followed the march.
"We're just little fishes in little ponds -- all you can do is speak out, speak up," Peggy Hanson, 52, a Lanesboro City Council member, said at Chat & Chew. "A person's a person, no matter how small.'
"Ever read about Horton?" Ms. Hanson added, citing Dr. Seuss. "The Whos, they just made this noise, but somebody heard them. We're like Whos in Whoville."
It is one thing to speak up in a large crowd in a big city and quite another to do it amid the farm fields. The antiwar movement here has already learned that politics are intensely personal in communities where people do not pass each other without waving and the woman at Harmony's Village Square restaurant recognizes the voice of the caller ordering a pizza.
The anonymity of chanting among several hundred thousand in New York or San Francisco is unavailable on Lanesboro's Parkway Avenue, where Lydia O'Connor, whose son-in-law is in the 101st Airborne Division in Iraq, stood silently writing down names as the protesters passed. Some small-business people who say they oppose the war have not joined the marches, they say, for fear of alienating customers; others who have protested report receiving nasty looks and letters. 
In Ely, a town of 3,724 in northern Minnesota, the City Council passed an antiwar resolution and then rescinded it 10 days later after the mayor was deluged by 200 calls.
So while Rural Peacemakers has helped link like-minded individuals from across Fillmore County, it has also left an unspoken tension in the quilting circles and coffee-shop dice games where people stick to safe gossip, avoiding difficult issues.
"That's the difference between city and country -- there are always consequences, social, political and economic consequences, to what you do here," said Peter Denzer, 82, a potter who lives near Rushford. "When you protest in Washington, D.C., when it's over, it's over. Here it stays with you.We see our fellow protesters all the time. We live with them. And we live with the people who see us."
Which is why Ms. Hanson, who owns a bed and breakfast, took the "Say No to War With Iraq" sign off her lawn after the missiles started falling on Baghdad.
"I don't want Lydia to have to drive by my house and see that sign," she said of Mrs. O'Connor. "I don't want to make her daily life any more difficult than it already is."
But Mrs. O'Connor's husband, Joe, who retired after 26 years in the Army, said he could not help but feel insulted by the "War is Good Business -- Invest Your Son" sign that Frank Wright -- Ms. Hanson's companion, who makes wooden spoon sculptures -- has in his studio.
At big-city demonstrations, Mr. O'Connor said, you see placards; at small-town protests, you see faces.
"When you stand up for an issue in a small town -- was it Aristotle who said every action has a reaction?" Mr. O'Connor said over beers at the Lanesboro American Legion Post No. 40, which has 109 members. "Once hostilities start up, you're responsible as a citizen to think about more than just your views. You've got to think about your neighbors."
The Rural Peacemakers are echoed by pockets of protest in the nation's small towns, but they represent a small minority, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, which showed that the strongest support for the war was in rural areas, where large percentages of people have relatives deployed in the Persian Gulf region. In the poll, 82 percent of rural residents approved of the invasion, compared with 69 percent of city dwellers.
The small thread of dissent along the country roads here has roots in the upper Midwest's farmer-labor populism that has long questioned international entanglements. But it also reflects the growing rift between natives and newcomers -- anyone without grandparents in the cemetery -- as this area, like others, tries to revive the dying farm economy with tourism, drawing artists and telecommuting yuppies.
Consider Harmony, about 17 miles south of Lanesboro: "so small we don't even have a town drunk so we all have to take our turn," according to Myron Scheevel, 67, one of a dozen men who took part in a dollar dice game at Harmony House, the local cafe. As the story goes, the town got its name when residents were bickering over various options and an elder banged a gavel to quiet them, demanding, "Let's have harmony."
Joy and Bob Johnson, who have lived in Harmony since the early 1970's, used to distribute 10-page political pamphlets through the window of the A & W drive-through they owned, so no one was surprised to see them leading the local peace march.
Mrs. Johnson, 69, said that when she invited the women in her Monday kaffeeklatsch to join her on Saturdays, they always had something else to do. But that might just be the Harmony way of disagreeing.
"I think it's a joke," Ada Austin, a farm owner, said of the protests. "We've got our boys over there."
Referring to the Johnsons, John Ryan, a retired hog buyer, said, "When you've got a Republican regime, we've got some hard-core Democrats that protest anything."
Fillmore County, in which Harmony is located, voted 49 percent for Al Gore in 2000, 46 percent for George W. Bush and 4 percent for Ralph Nader. But the legislators who represent the area in St. Paul and Washington tend to be conservative.
Elton Redalen, a retired Republican legislator and state agriculture secretary, comes from a family that has farmed here for six generations. Every Memorial Day, Mr. Redalen, 77, takes his American flag and marches through Lanesboro. So when he heard about the Rural Peacemakers, he took his flag and planned a counterdemonstration.
"I needed to make sure that when the story was written that it wouldn't only be the anti-Bush, antiwar protesters," he explained.
"I don't hate them, I love them," he added of the peace demonstrators. "We live here. We have to get along with them."
In New York and San Francisco, rallies supporting and opposing the war compete for crowds and scream at each other across police cordons. Not in Lanesboro. Mr. Redalen, carrying his flag, and Mr Wright, with a "Wage Peace" sign, walked arm in arm at the head of the line, down Parkway Avenue and to the Lutheran church, where Mr. Redalen led those gathered for the potluck in a prayer.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Antiwar protest has a different character in rural areas. Eva Barr and her children formed a message from rocks on their farm near Wykoff, Minn., that passing motorists can read.; Joy Johnson, 69, led a peace march through Harmony, Minn., but few of the women who join her each Monday morning for coffee took part.

HEADLINE: Siebel Warns of Lower Software Sales 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Siebel Systems Inc., a software company, warned yesterday that its sales in the first quarter would be much lower than expected after major deals were postponed. 
 The news sent Siebel shares down to $7.37 in after-hours trade, after closing down about 5 percent, at $7.75, on Nasdaq. 
 The company, the largest maker of customer sales and service software, said that it expects to have revenue of $330 million to $335 million. Analysts expected $368.9 million.
The company said software license sales would be about $112 million, compared with previous expectations of $130 million to $150 million. 
The company, based in San Mateo, Calif., said it expected first-quarter net income of $3 million to $5 million. 
The chief executive, Thomas M. Siebel, blamed the changes on an environment of "continued global economic deterioration."

HEADLINE: In Their Hummers, Right Beside Uncle Sam 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, April 4 

 BODY:
While the Humvees are lined up in the desert, their cousins, the Hummers, continue to be Detroit's hottest seller. 
 Is it because of, or in spite of, the war? Sales of several other large sport utility vehicles, like the Chevrolet Suburban, are showing signs of weakness while overall sales remain strong for other S.U.V.'s. 
 But some Hummer drivers, inundated like the rest of America by war news, feel especially patriotic behind the wheel now.
"When I turn on the TV, I see wall-to-wall Humvees, and I'm proud," said Sam Bernstein, a 51-year-old antiquities dealer who lives in Marin County, Calif., and drives a Hummer H2, an S.U.V. sibling of the military Humvee. 
"They're not out there in Audi A4's," he said of the troops. "I'm proud of my country, and I'm proud to be driving a product that is making a significant contribution."
"If I could get an A1 Abrams, I would," he added with a smile, referring to the tank, "but I don't know if California would allow it."
Earlier this week, General Motors, which markets the Hummer brand, rolled out its most expansive wave of zero percent financing offers yet, extending such deals even to Corvettes.
But not to the Hummer, which continues to be the only Detroit brand that sells without incentives. At a clip of more than 3,000 a month, the Hummer H2 is now the best-selling large luxury S.U.V., beating out the Lincoln Navigator and the Lexus LX470. It sells almost as many units as the smaller BMW X5, even though H2 starts at about $50,000 -- $10,000 more than the BMW. 
Hummer gear is also selling at a heady clip, from the $16 "Like Nothing Else" T-shirt to the $449 remote-control miniature Hummer equipped with spy camera and monitor to the $795 Hummer Tactical Mountain Bike.
Rick Schmidt, founder of I.H.O.G., the International Hummer Owners Group, said: "In my humble opinion, the H2 is an American icon. Not the military version by any means, but it's a symbol of what we all hold so dearly above all else, the fact we have the freedom of choice, the freedom of happiness, the freedom of adventure and discovery, and the ultimate freedom of expression."
"Those who deface a Hummer in words or deed," he added, "deface the American flag and what it stands for."
Hummer executives said there had been no change in their marketing strategy during the war. H2, the brand's new signature vehicle, has been on sale about nine months, and advertising is in heavy rotation. The idiosyncratic TV spots range from Zen to mock-hostile, including one in which a beatific couple drives around Iceland and another in which a slender young woman confidently motors through urban streets.
And what about the war? 
"It definitely helps," said Clotaire Rapaille, a consumer research consultant for G.M. and other automakers. "I told them in Detroit, 'Put four stars on the shoulder of the Hummer and it will sell better.' The Hummer is a car in uniform. Right now we are in a time of uncertainty, and people like strong brands with basic emotions."
Kevin Fieweger, general sales manager of Bergstrom Hummer in Milwaukee, said the appeal of Hummer was "testosterone," but added, "I don't have people coming in here in camouflage and a beret." 
Travis Patterson, 35, an Air Force veteran who lives in Arlington, Tex., said: "To me, the Hummer, the H1, is the most American vehicle on the planet. It oozes patriotism. You put some flags on the Hummer and drive down the road and everyone ishonking and waving at you."
Not every veteran appreciates them. Erik Gustafson, 31, drove Humvees a few times as a specialist in the gulf war, where he served as an engineer. 
"It always bothers me whenever I see them," said Mr. Gustafson, who has founded a group that opposes the war. "At a time when oil prices are already sky high and given how oil politics play into these conflicts, it strikes me as irresponsible." 
The Sierra Club is planning a campaign against the Hummer because of its gas consumption. Both the H1, which starts at $100,000 and is quite similar to the military Humvee, and the more baby-boomer-friendly H2, are so heavy they are not regulated by the same fuel economy rules that govern most cars and S.U.V.'s. They are also large enough to qualify for huge deductions for small business under loopholes in the tax code. 
"At a time when our troops are at risk in part because of our oil dependence, it is the height of irresponsibility for General Motors to be pushing an 11-miles-per-gallon gas guzzler," said Daniel Becker, a global warming expert at the Sierra Club.
Mike DiGiovanni, G.M.'s general manager for the Hummer, argued that the nation's appetite for foreign oil had less to do with consumption levels than with foreign oil's being cheaper to produce than domestic oil. He said G.M. was focusing on improving fuel economy in high-volume vehicles with new technologies.
Mr. Patterson, the Air Force veteran, sees the Hummer as a vehicle that can be used for responsible off-road driving. He is the founder of an outdoor adventure company and has a Hummer club with 65 members. 
"It's a dichotomy to say you own a Hummer and you're an environmentalist, but we don't run over little trees and we take care of what we have," he said. "The fuel economy issue is touchy. Yes, they use more fuel than a lot of things, but not the Suburbans, the Tahoes."
Mr. Bernstein of Marin County also says he is an environmentalist and called his H2 "the safest vehicle for exploring the places the Sierra Club talks about."
G.M. executives are happy to have a brand that sells without interest-free loans. The company's profits are slim compared with those of foreign competitors like Toyota and Honda. A pickup version of the H2 is coming next year and a smaller Hummer is being considered.
G.M. owns the marketing rights to the Hummer, but the vehicles are manufactured by AM General, a privately held Indiana company that makes Humvees. The company is for sale. This year, G.M. and AM General are on track to a goal of selling 40,000 H2's.
On Friday, Rick Almandi, 54, was buying an H2 at Bergstrom Hummer in Milwaukee. He also owns a Dodge Viper and a Corvette. 
"Seeing them on TV, you kind of identify with them," said Mr. Almandi, a retired U.P.S. manager. "Whether other people don't like it, I really don't care. I really don't want to hear it. I like to personalize vehicles. They make me feel good. They reflect myself."

Prompting the latest dispute over whether government programs are meeting Lower Manhattan's needs since Sept. 11, 2001, New York State's economic development agency has sharply cut its estimate of how much it will spend on a major incentives program for small businesses to stay in the area or move there.
 As recently as November, the agency, the Empire State Development Corporation, said the program would probably cost $291 million, but a spokesman said this week that the figure had been "based on research we did as the program was getting started" a year ago. Now, he said, the agency believes that the cost will be closer to $155 million, based on how much it has so far committed to pay out: about $50 million to 820 applicants. That appears to meet the needs of eligible applicants, the spokesman, Alex Dudley, said. 
 But the cut in the spending projection drew a sharp reaction from critics. They said that $50 million was too small a sum, and that it was small because of overly strict rules that kept the program from providing all the help needed to retain small businesses in Lower Manhattan after the attack destroyed the World Trade Center and left the area economically reeling.
The program, called the SmallFirm Attraction and Retention Grant program, began receiving applications in March 2002. The number of small businesses that have applied to it is 1,261, Mr. Dudley said on Tuesday. He said that 238 had been found ineligible and that 203 were awaiting answers.
The program is based in part on the date on which a company signs or renews a lease in Lower Manhattan. The most common reason for the rejections, Mr. Dudley said, is that the businesses fail to meet requirements that their current leases expire no later than Dec. 31, 2004, and that they sign or have signed new or renewal leases after Sept. 11, 2001, and no later than Dec. 31, 2004.
Yet it is those requirements, the critics say, that unreasonably exclude many small businesses in need and that have led the state agency to reduce its projected spending.
It is not the only dispute related to government responsiveness to Lower Manhattan's needs as the area seeks to recover. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, for example, while praised for its prompt payment for the ground zero cleanup, has been criticized for the pace at which it compensated people who suffered economically from 9/11.
The Small Firm Attraction and Retention program is intended to help businesses with up to 200 employees stay in the area below Canal Street or move there.
Mr. Dudley maintained that the program was "on track." His agency says that in the last quarter of 2001 there were about 8,000 Lower Manhattan businesses with up to 200 employees and that an estimated 10 percent renewed their leases annually, roughly approximating the 820 businesses whose applications have been approved since the program began 13 months ago. But Mr. Dudley said he did not have figures on how many of the 820 had moved into Lower Manhattan from elsewhere.
A small-business group, From the Ground Up, which seeks to maximize aid to struggling small companies in the area, says a study it commissioned last year found nearly 13,000 businesses in the area with up to 50 employees each, meaning an even larger number with up to 200.
"I think it's left out a lot of people who are committed to staying downtown," said Nancy Ploeger, president of the Manhattan Chamber of Commerce.
Jeannine Chanes, a lawyer for From the Ground Up, said the rules "do not take into account the economic realities" of the small-business needs in Lower Manhattan.
Mr. Dudley replied, "You have to make rules, otherwise you're handing out money with no rhyme or reason." He said that the program was succeeding, and that if more than $155 million -- its current allocation -- was needed, his agency would try to get more money from the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, a subsidiary of Empire State that independently controls $1.3 billion in still uncommitted federal funds for 9/11 aid efforts. "We have every intention of paying the accepted applicants," he said.
The program provides $3,500 or $5,000 a worker to the qualifying business, whose new or renewed leases are required to run at least five years. The amount depends on a business's proximity to the trade center site and where it relocates.
One applicant who will not be paid is Dr. Grace Zaidman, owner of the Broadway Family Dental Center at 287 Broadway. "I received a letter stating I was rejected because my lease terminates on Aug. 1, 2005," after the Dec. 31, 2004, cutoff.
Acceptance of her application, which was based on 11 employees, would have meant close to $40,000 for her over 18 months, assuming the employee number did not change.
Dr. Zaidman said the practice, which has been on the site for 18 years, badly needed the aid. "Business is still 50 percent off," she said, adding that "481 of our patients died in the World Trade Center."
Program officials have said a cutoff date was adopted because incentives to keep business in Lower Manhattan or to add to business there were seen as especially important.
Another objection of critics, and even of some otherwise pleased grant recipients, is the rule that in most cases half the total commitment is to be paid when the new or renewal lease takes effect and half 18 months later. The second payment could be larger or smaller, depending on the number of employees at the time. The amount the program has paid out so far is $27 million.
Carlos Gandia, owner of Greenwich Jewelers, which moved to 64 Trinity Place in June 2002, after it could not return to its longtime Greenwich Street location near the trade center site, said the $10,000 that his four-employee shop had already received from the program in June had been helpful.
"But 18 months is a long time," he said of the wait for the second installment. "You can really use it when you first come into a place."
Mr. Dudley, the spokesman for the Empire State Development Corporation, said: "We want to encourage not just a short-term commitment. And if businesses grow their employees, they will be eligible for more money in the second payment."
Richard Cohn, an owner of Southwest New York, a restaurant in the World Financial Center across the street from the trade center site, said he had no quarrel with the program's split payments. The restaurant received about $200,000 as its first installment last summer, based on having about 80 employees.
The program, Mr. Cohn said, shows that "the government has gone above and beyond in supporting the revitalization of downtown businesses."

HEADLINE: Public University in Ohio To End Instate Tuition Break 

BYLINE:  By SAM DILLON 

 BODY:
Miami University in Ohio hopes to become the first public university in the nation to charge residents the same tuition that out-of-state students pay. 
 A sweeping proposal to reorganize the university's tuition and financial-aid system, which its president expects the Board of Trustees to approve this month, would roughly double the annual tuition for Ohio residents, who now pay $7,600, compared with $16,300 for nonresidents. 
Although the increase sounds draconian, the university plans to offer new scholarships that it says will allow most Ohio residents to pay little more for their education than they do now. The goal, Miami officials said, is to force students from high-income Ohio families to pay somewhat more so that those from poor and working-class families can pay less. 
The proposal is expected to spur debate on whether state universities should respond to sharply declining public support by increasing class sizes and introducing other cost-cutting measures, or by increasing tuition to maintain educational quality.
"We've seen a decades-long decline in government support of public education," James Garland, Miami's president, said yesterday in an interview. "This will allow our university to remain affordable to students whose parents are struggling to make mortgage payments, trying to get by in an economy of layoffs. We had to become more resourceful because we can't count on the public treasury to meet all of our needs."
The new plan, which would take effect in the fall of 2004, would not change the current tuition system for any currently enrolled students, or for those admitted this fall, Mr. Garland said.
Miami University, located on a tree-shaded campus in Oxford, Ohio, 30 miles north of Cincinnati, has 15,000 undergraduates and 1,300 graduate students, and places greater priority on offering a high-quality education to undergraduates than on maintaining extensive research or professional programs, he said. It has no law school or medical school.
Under the plan, as tuition for Ohio residents increases, the university would offer two new scholarships. One, Mr. Garland said, would be an Ohio Resident Scholarship of about $5,000 that would be given almost automatically to all Ohio students accepted at Miami. A second, the Ohio Leader Scholarship, would be given to some students based on financial need, scholastic ability, and to students who major in mathematics, engineering and other subjects considered vital to Ohio development.
In the program's first couple of years, the total scholarship awarded to Ohio residents would vary no more than about $1,000 from student to student, Mr. Garland said. But in later years, variations among scholarships would grow.
Mr. Garland said Ohio students from high-income families would not be daunted by the tuition increases. He said the new scholarships would completely offset the increases for lower-income students.
But Joni E. Finney, a vice president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, an independent research group in San Jose, Calif., said that because low- and moderate-income students tend to pay more attention to a university's sticker price than to the financial aid that is available, many poor students would be reluctant apply to Miami University if in-state tuition were raised as high as $16,300. 
Furthermore, Ms. Finney said, despite Miami's pledge to use the increased tuition revenues to finance scholarships for low- and moderate-income students, other universities that have raised tuition ostensibly to make higher education accessible to poor students have instead used the increased revenues to provide scholarships to talented students whose attendance will increase the university's prestige. 
"I can't find enough bad words for this," Ms. Finney said. "This plan will scare people away." 
In contrast, David Ward, president of the American Council of Education, a Washington lobbying group that represents college presidents, praised the plan, saying it would encourage public debate about how the nation finances public education. 
Since World War II, state governments have sharply decreased financial support for state universities.
"We've allowed it to happen incrementally, without public discussion," said Mr. Ward, who said the move at Miami would encourage debate on how to finance higher education."

HEADLINE: Oil Companies to Resume Work in Niger Delta 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA

DATELINE: LAGOS, NIGERIA, April 4 

 BODY:
Roughly two weeks after political violence closed the spigot on oil from the western Niger Delta, two of the three major multinational oil companies that operate in the restive riverine area said today that they would gradually resume production.
 The announcement came as somewhat of a surprise to industry observers here and a huge relief to the Nigerian government, which stands to lose millions in foreign exchange earnings from the shutdown. 
 Nigeria is the world's sixth largest oil producer and one of the top five exporters to the United States. Political violence between the ethnic groups the Ijaws and the Itsekiris had stopped production of roughly 800,000 barrels of crude a day, or about 40 percent of Nigeria's daily yield. 
Last month, as Ijaw militants threatened to wreak havoc on the oil installations, the three major oil companies -- ChevronTexaco, Shell and TotalFinaElf -- took the rare step of shutting down their facilities in the region and evacuating staff members.
The violence in the delta left villages razed, an unconfirmed number of people killed and waterways impassable. 
While the violence has subsided over the last two weeks, Ijaw militants have continued threatening to attack oil installations and disrupt elections that are scheduled to begin April 12. 
The return to production was also politically important to the Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo, who is running for re-election. He announced this week that he would oversee talks between leaders of the warring Niger Delta groups in the capital, Abuja, on Monday. 
ChevronTexaco announced that it would gradually start some of the 440,000 barrels a day that it usually produces from its Escravos export terminal. Shell said it had already resumed production of the 320,000 barrels that it had cut off. TotalFinaElf has not yet announced its plans to return to work.
"We have been encouraged by the recent calm in the Western Niger Delta and, after receiving a number of government assurances on security in the area, we now believe that current circumstances allow for the safe return of our workers to Escravos and for us to restart production," Jay Pryor, the managing director of ChevronTexaco Nigeria, said in a statement.
Oil companies in the Niger Delta are no strangers to protests by disgruntled villagers, who rarely see the spoils of the oil economy improving their daily lives. Delta communities remain among the most destitute in the country, even as Nigeria draws roughly $14 billion a year from oil revenues in the region. 
Indeed, the growing discontent of local communities here against the federal government is among the most explosive issues of the Nigerian elections, scheduled to start next week.
Oil companies took pains to note that the violence, while taking place at their doorstep, was not directed at them this time. Indeed, the troubles were sparked by disputes over control of the local government, with the Ijaw tribe trying to wrest control from the Itsekiris. 
Ijaw attacks have left Itsekiri villages in embers and forced the exodus of panicked villagers. The Nigerian Navy, in turn, has clashed with Ijaw militants and imposed a curfew on the waterways.
But the violence has not left the oil companies untouched. Oil facilities have been attacked, a contract worker has been killed in cross-fire, and helicopter was fired upon as it was evacuating employees. As recently as this week, Ijaw militants, who accuse the oil companies of collaborating with the government, threatened to stage fresh attacks on the oil installations in the delta; they have demanded that the oil companies promise more community development aid.

HEADLINE: Liberators and Enemies Can Look a Lot Alike 

BYLINE:  Felicia R. Lee

 BODY:
Some administration officials predicted that most Iraqis would immediately rise up against Saddam Hussein and welcome American troops into their country. At this point, the response has ranged from warmth to hostility. Arts & Ideas asked historians to consider their own areas of expertise and explain why citizens often don't embrace outsiders who say they come to liberate them from oppressive regimes. Felicia R. Lee compiled their responses.

JAPAN
 During World War II, the propaganda was that Americans were out to destroy the country. And clearly, it was hard to reconcile the war itself -- bombs being dropped on the cities -- with the idea of liberation. When a country is under attack, the first reaction is to view the attacker as your enemy, not your liberator. Just as U.S. forces have done in Iraq, American aircraft that flew over Japan dropped leaflets that said "we will not destroy your country, we are just going to bring the war to a speedy end, we're going to destroy your military." But to a country that was as brainwashed as Japan was, how do you get your message across? People were suffering, but they had no sense of an alternative between an oppressive regime and the constant bombing. For the majority of Japanese, it was difficult to believe that the best solution was to stop their fighting and to reform their country through American forces. 
 In the end, it is not propaganda but actions that make a difference. To the Japanese who had no direct knowledge of Americans beforehand, the soldiers were pictured as an alien force, out to annihilate their country. But once the war ended and American soldiers began occupying Japan, they impressed upon the Japanese the idea that they were there to help them.
There were so many reforms in the six months after war -- land reform, education reform, all kinds of reform to democratize the country. And when the American occupying forces came, they were different from the negative image. They were human: polite and well-behaved. It caused a basic psychological change. All those reforms turned the Americans into liberators.
Akira Iriye is chairman of the history department at Harvard University.

SOVIET UNION
Iraqi tactics in the current war -- forcing civilians into harm's way, executing innocents who seek refuge -- have confirmed the malevolence of their regime, and so Americans seem puzzled by any Iraqi resistance to their liberation. It may perhaps be typically American to expect others to greet our mighty righteousness with gratitude, but there is a larger contradiction at work: we see dictatorships as simultaneously all-powerful and yet completely brittle.
Above all, we tend to assume that if a regime uses mass terror, the population must be opposed to it -- why else is there a need to terrorize people? We find it difficult to appreciate the coexistence of brutal coercion with broad elements of allegiance -- as was the case, for example, in Stalin's Soviet Union. Nor do we understand the social and psychological depth attained by long-lasting dictatorships, how they shape the habits and identities even of their internal enemies.
Dictatorships create a shadowy world. An adept dictator, rather than wait for the C.I.A. to recruit malcontents within his regime, organizes a phony conspiracy against himself. And then he hangs anyone who dares to respond, in the ministerial corridors for others to see. Those contemplating revolt cannot distinguish between a solicitation to defect that is genuine and one that is a trap.
Outsiders are suspect. As one captured Soviet official told German interrogators during World War II: "We have badly mistreated our people; in fact so bad that it was almost impossible to treat them worse. You Germans have managed to do that. In the long term, the people will choose between the two tyrants the one who speaks their language. Therefore, we will win the war."
To me, the Iraqis living under dictatorship and now caught in its violent overthrow appear less puzzling than Americans who talk of building democracies in the Arab world while disparaging government institutions, taxes and public programs at home.
Steven Kotkin directs the Russian studies program at Princeton University.

GERMANY
By the spring of 1945, lots of Germans, ordinary Germans, were tired of war and relieved to see the fighting end. Although some people did resist the regime, the overwhelming majority of the population -- and the overwhelming majority in the military -- supported it. We forget how enthusiastic most people were about the Nazis and their deeply racist ideas. 
In Nazi Germany, all freedom of the press ended in 1933, all freedom of assembly ended in 1933, all freedom of speech ended in 1933. Those who may have been open to persuasion only heard the government line. If you disagreed, you were shipped off to a concentration camp and the camps were widely publicized. There is an aura of fear that can bind people as effectively as enthusiasm. There is a kind of negative social cohesion created. The leaders -- Hitler and Goebbels and others -- were conscious of this idea that "we have burned our bridges and everyone has a negative incentive to go on fighting." 
Also, many Germans were afraid about what would happen if they lost, in part because of what they had done to other people. If you've been involved in mass murder, you're not enthusiastic about falling into the hands of the friends, relatives and others you have murdered. There was a sad joke in late World War II Germany: "You better enjoy the war. The peace will be awful."
In the last months of war, German soldiers were much more inclined to surrender, but lots of them still fought. In the military, there is what one scholar called a "pseudo-judicial terror." The German military in World War II executedover 30,000 of their own officers and men, compared to under 200 in World War I. It means, since the death sentences were announced to the troops, that soldiers were motivated to some extent by this terror inside the military.
Finally, the Germans were strongly nationalistic and did not want Germany ruled by foreigners, despite the beliefs, hopes and philosophy of the outsiders.People prefer to be ruled by their own, even if their own people are not particularly nice. It has only been in retrospect that increasingly Germans realize that it is just as well they lost, that they were liberated, not conquered.
Gerhard Weinberg is professor of history emeritus at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

NORTH KOREA
Most people, if given a choice between a foreign liberator and a domestic dictator, would choose a domestic dictator. If we're serious about comparing Hussein to Hitler, we have to carry it to the logical conclusion -- the Germans defended their regime to the very end, with tremendous suffering, far more than the Iraqi people are going through now. There are few instances in history when a foreign liberation force inspired people to rise up against their leaders, one of the exceptions being Afghanistan last year.
Now consider North Korea, which is also ruled by a dictator. North Korea would be a much tougher customer than Iraq. There are no ethnic minorities, like the Kurds or Shiites, that could be used against the regime. You have a large ruling party there, you have an extensive police force and surveillance system to keep people in line, and you have a population insulated from outside information all their lives.
People in Korea have been deeply inculcated with anti-Americanism for two generations, since the Korean War. The psychological element underpinning resistance to any American attack would be very deep. In terms of the military forces, they are much better organized than the Iraqi forces. They are better equipped, they have a larger army than Iraq. This has been a regime prepared to fight the Americans for 50 years -- both literally and psychologically. Furthermore, they already had a war with the United States and they believe they won.
Charles K. Armstrong is director of the Center for Korea Research at Columbia University.

THE CIVIL-WAR SOUTH
Wouldn't you protect your home? There's a story of how some well-fed Northern soldiers closed in on this Southerner, malnourished and raggedy. They said, "What are you fighting for?" And he said, "I'm fighting because you're down here." To say it's human nature is putting it mildly. Southerners didn't look at it as all the same country -- they looked at it as the Confederate States of America. That someone is right or wrong has nothing to do with it.
They didn't all think they were fighting in defense of slavery, even though some had a vested economic interest in slavery. Southerners were fighting in defense of the right to do what they wanted to do. For the most part, the Northerners didn't give a damn about slavery, either. They were fighting to preserve the union.

HEADLINE: You'd Better Get Used to Me For 2 Terms, Bloomberg Says 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg told the municipal labor unions yesterday that they needed to get serious about finding ways to help the city balance its budget, and warned them they would have to deal with him for years because he had every intention of being re-elected.
 Ratcheting up his oratory to its highest pitch with the unions yet, the mayor used his weekly WABC-AM radio show to send the municipal unions a sterner version of his recent message predicting layoffs, which he has said could total as many as 15,000. 
 "We're not kidding," he said. "I think anybody who knows me knows we're not kidding. This is not the old game where the mayor cuts, the City Council restores, the unions scream and then they get paid later on. Those are not these days. We are going to cut $600 million in expenses, which is painful, will be painful throughout the city." 
For months, Mr. Bloomberg has stopped short of forecasting all-out fiscal doom, arguing that with $600 million in givebacks from the unions, the city may be able to solve of some of its problems. But the mayor, indicating his disappointment with a package of cuts delivered to him Thursday by the unions, said the unions had to stop stalling and come up with real reforms.
"It's going to be a long time before the economy ever improves enough for us to make up all of the deficit, restore some programs, which unfortunately we're probably going to have to cut, and then have something left to give our workers a raise," he said.
And the mayor warned the unions against waiting around for a new administration.
"I'm going to get re-elected; I don't know how to break that to anybody," he said. "We're doing a pretty good job. I think the public's pretty happy; I think the polls are coming back. And the economy's not coming back. And you're going to have to deal with the same mayor."
The unions responded by saying they were trying to be responsive.
"The municipal unions have put forward proposals that would save a real $600 million, proposals similar to those adopted in 1995, when the unions and Mayor Giuliani agreed to retirement incentives, reduced pension and health contributions and other economies," said Randi Weingarten, president of the teachers' union and chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee, a consortium of city unions. She added, "The question comes down to this: does the mayor really want help in solving these problems, or is he trying to show how tough he can be in dealing with the work force?"
On April 15, Mr. Bloomberg is to submit his list of proposed budget cuts along with a contingency plan to save New York City an additional $1 billion. The mayor and the Council have until the end of June to officially approve a budget. 
But Mr. Bloomberg signaled that the news for the city was only going to get worse. Already, he said, fiscal indicators are showing $300 million less in tax revenue for 2004. The city also stands to lose $200 to $300 million in funds that were slated to come to the city as part of a tobacco settlement. That money is now in jeopardy because the tobacco giant Philip Morris, which is now part of a company called Altria and which pays a large part of the settlement, has threatened bankruptcy in the face of a large judgment against it in Illinois. 
To date, New York City has received more than $900 million in tobacco settlement money. The mayor had intended to borrow against it to help bolster his capital budget.
Mr. Bloomberg acknowledged that the unions had submitted ideas to help. But he said the proposals fell short of creating "real" savings for a city that is required by law to have a balanced budget. The city is now facing a $3 billion to $4 billion budget gap that it has to close by July 1. 
One proposal includes the union consortium's offer to allow the city to borrow money from its pension fund at about 8 percent. 
"That's ridiculous," the mayor said. "That's just verbiage. No. 1, interest rates are down around 1percent, and No. 2, it doesn't help us. It solves a cash flow problem. We don't have a cash problem. It's that we don't have the income."
The mayor similarly criticized another plan, which called for the unions' help in lobbying Albany for a commuter tax, in return for a tax exemption for firefighters and police officers who live outside of the city.
"I need the help," he said, "but that's not going to save us."

HEADLINE: The World's Other Tyrants, Still at Work 

BYLINE:  By Aryeh Neier; Aryeh Neier, president of the Open Society Institute, is author of "Taking Liberties: Four Decades in the Struggle for Rights."

 BODY:
With international attention focused on Iraq, despots are seizing the opportunity to get rid of their opposition -- real or imagined. In Zimbabwe, Cuba and Belarus, independent journalists, opposition leaders and human rights advocates have been thrown in prison. Absent scrutiny, the leaders of these rogue regimes have been emboldened, aware that their actions are causing little more than a ripple of protest beyond their countries.
 The outside world has ignored Zimbabwe, which is holding critical parliamentary elections whose outcome could help determine whether President Robert Mugabe will be able to amend the Constitution and handpick his successor. Since the start of the war in Iraq, Mr. Mugabe has intensified a campaign of intimidation, arresting more than 500 democracy advocates and opposition leaders, including Gibson Sibanda, vice president of the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change. 
 The campaign of state-sponsored violence is not limited to the opposition leaders in Zimbabwe. A worker on the farm of an opposition parliamentary deputy died of injuries after being beaten by Mr. Mugabe's security agents for participating in a two-day general strike. Other farm workers have also been beaten by men in army uniforms who claimed that the farms were being used as staging grounds for opposition activities. Hundreds of people accused of taking part in the strike were treated for broken bones in private clinics, fearing more reprisals if they sought care at public hospitals. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe, once a breadbasket for southern Africa, falls ever further into poverty and famine.
In Cuba, the war is giving Fidel Castro cover for an unprecedented assault. Over the past two weeks his state security agents have arrested about 80 dissidents. Prosecutors are seeking life sentences for 12 of those detained and 10- to 30-year prison terms for the rest. They include the economist Marta Beatriz Roque, the poet and journalist Raul Rivero and the opposition labor activist Pedro Pablo Alvarez. 
The list of arrests reads like a Who's Who of Cuban civil society -- with the obvious exception of those who were already in jail when the roundup started. They are the unsung heroes of a movement to liberate the minds of Cuba. But the names do not mean much to a world public now concentrated on becoming more and more expert on the latest in military equipment and on the geography of Iraq. 
In Minsk, the capital of Belarus, the authorities last week detained 50 opposition protesters who had gathered for the 85th anniversary of the declaration of the short-lived Belarusian Democratic Republic. On Thursday, demonstrators supporting the Iraq war -- which President Aleksandr Lukashenko opposes -- were arrested. It seems clear that Mr. Lukashenko, Europe's sole remaining dictator, is intent on tightening his grip on Belarus. 
Sadly, Zimbabwe, Cuba and Belarus are not alone. Other countries have used the Iraq war to step up human rights abuses. Vietnam's most renowned dissident, Nguyen Dan Que, a 60-year-old writer who is a physician by training, was arrested late last month. Hardly anyone protested. In Egypt, hundreds of war protesters were detained, with dozens beaten and tortured. In Thailand, the government has justified what appear to be summary executions in the name of a war on drugs. At least 1,900 people have been killed, including innocent bystanders. These crackdowns, too, all passed with little notice or comment.
That dictators move in times of world crisis comes as no surprise. The Soviets crushed the Hungarian revolution in 1956 during the Suez crisis. In 1968, when the Johnson administration was preoccupied with Vietnam, and Germany and France as well as the United States were convulsed in antiwar demonstrations, the Soviets moved into Czechoslovakia. 
In January 1991, just as today, the international community was focused on a war in Iraq. As the Persian Gulf war was starting, the Soviet Army took advantage of the international community's inattention to crack down on an independence movement in Lithuania. More than 200 people were wounded and 15 killed as Moscow seized control of the television broadcast center in Vilnius. 
If we let tyrants escape the international condemnation that is often the only way to protect their critics against abuses, the brutal campaigns in Zimbabwe, the clean sweep of dissidents in Cuba, and the arrests of demonstrators in Belarus may have to be added to the list of unintended consequences of the war in Iraq.

HEADLINE: 108,000 Jobs Lost in March, U.S. Says 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The job market continued to deteriorate in March as the economy lost 108,000 jobs, the government reported yesterday, raising worries that the United States is closer to slipping into a recession than it has been for more than a year.
 The unemployment rate remained at 5.8 percent last month, largely because of a rise in the number of people who are not looking for work and are thus considered to be outside of the labor force. 
 "Job creation is the engine of the economy," said Richard Yamarone, an economist at Argus Research in New York, "and that engine is running out of steam."
Two years have now passed since the nation's payrolls peaked, and employment has fallen by almost 2.4 million jobs during that span, according to the Labor Department's recently revised numbers. The loss -- 1.8 percent of employment -- is much worse than it was during the so-called jobless recovery of the early 1990's, when employment never fell by more than 1.3 percent over a two-year period. 
The nation employs fewer people than it has at any point since late 1999, its longest stretch without job growth in 20 years. 
Last month's job losses cut across almost every sector of the economy. Manufacturers reduced employment for the 36th consecutive month. The vast service industry, usually a source of stability, has cut 121,000 jobs in the last six months, with department stores, restaurants, airlines and hotels all paring their payrolls in March. After adding jobs through last year, local and state governments have also begun to make cuts to close budget deficits.
But the economy still does not seem to have fallen into a recession. The average workweek increased last month, a sign that demand for new products has not dried up. 
In addition, the call-up of about 210,000 reservists to serve in the military contributed to the loss of 465,000 jobs in February and March, the Labor Department said. 
In Washington, Secretary of Commerce Donald L. Evans called the jobs report further evidence that Congress should pass President Bush's tax-cut proposal, which lacks the support to pass in its current form. House Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee attributed much of the slump in jobs to Mr. Bush's economic policies, saying that recoveries are usually in full swing two years after an economic peak.
The last recession began in March 2001. Economic growth resumed in late 2001, although it has not been strong enough to cause job growth.
The financial markets reacted modestly to the March employment report. Stocks were little changed, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrials edging up less than 1 percent.
The conflict with Iraq seems to have hurt the economy by helping cause a rise in oil prices early this year and also by heightening uncertainty. Many economists say the war has made executives wary of expanding their companies and kept consumers at home, near their televisions and away from public places. But the war's effect is difficult to measure.
"The economy has appeared to hit a soft spot," said Chris Varvares, president of Macroeconomic Advisers, a research firm in St. Louis. "The $64,000 question is how much of that is due to the war and how much is due to underlying weakness."
After a binge of spending on new equipment and new workers in the late 1990's, many businesses still have more production capacity than they can profitably use. They have also continued to become more efficient over the last two years, able to increase their sales while cutting workers.
Economists said yesterday that while the Federal Reserve remained unlikely to reduce the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks when it meets next month, the jobs report increased the chance of a cut.
The Fed has lowered rates 12 times since the start of 2001, to the lowest level since 1961. Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has said that he thinks the war is the biggest drag on growth.
Fed officials may also be resisting a rate cut -- which reduces the cost of borrowing, encouraging people to spend money -- because they are wary of reducing their benchmark rate to zero. Lehman Brothers economists said yesterday that the Fed would surely have lowered the rate in recent weeks if it had not already been so low.
Once it reaches zero, stimulating the economy becomes trickier, although Mr. Greenspan and others have emphasized that it is still possible.
In a sign of the economy's weakness, the number of people not in the labor force has jumped since January. Five million people who are not looking for work -- and thus not counted in the jobless rate -- would like a job, up from 4.7 million in January, according to the Labor Department's survey of households.
"It's a very negative report," John H. Makin, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a research group in Washington, said yesterday. "The economy is weakening faster than it was at the start of the recession in March 2001 -- perhaps faster."
At 5.8 percent, the jobless rate remains lower than it was after every other recession of the last 30 years. The exodus from the labor force has helped keep it relatively low, but so have the lingering effects of the strong growth of the 1990's, leaving the economy in better shape today than it was in the mid-1970's or early 1980's. 
The increase in the workweek -- to 34.3 hours, from 34.1 in February -- helped weekly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees to rise last month, strengthening household finances at a time when consumer spending has been weakening.
The Labor Department said it did not know the precise effect that the call-up of reservists had on the employment numbers. Since mid-March, when the government conducted its employment survey, the military has called up even more reservists, meaning that the war is continuing to affect employment levels directly. 
Dean Baker, an economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a research group in Washington, noted that the survey took place before fighting in Iraq began. As a result, he said, the March report did not include recent job losses at airlines and elsewhere.
Mortgage brokers and builders, benefiting from the resilient housing market, and hospitalsand other health care companies were some of the few industries to add workers. 
Temporary-help agencies, whose employment level is considered a signal of the economy's short-term direction, cut 48,000 jobs, or almost 1.7 percent of their work force. 
"Businesses simply aren't sufficiently profitable to fuel new hiring," Mr. Yamarone of Argus Research said. "Why would you when you have slipping demand, skyrocketing productivity and global overcapacity?"

HEADLINE: Pension Shift At Northwest Raises Fears 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 

 BODY:
Northwest Airlines is seeking permission to shore up its pension funds with the stock of a subsidiary airline, more stock than the law generally allows.
 There are just two precedents for Northwest's proposed tactic. General Motors was permitted to make a similar move in 1994, while Pan Am did it in 1989 and went out of existence soon after. Some Pan Am pilots are still litigating the pension benefits they lost. 
 Under the plan, Northwest pension funds would wind up with more than 10 percent of their assets in stock of Pinnacle Airlines, a successful regional carrier whose stock is not yet publicly traded. 
Given the precarious state of the airline industry, many Northwest employees fear that their company's current plan amounts to a pension grab. At a time when cash is tight, and airlines like Northwest are cutting flights because of war and epidemic-related fears, they worry that the company may be withholding cash that rightly belongs in their retirement trust in favor of stock that could prove worth far less.
"In the post-9/11 environment, airlines are struggling to find new cash resources, and turning to pension funds such as ours," said Paul Volker, an officer of the union that represents Northwest's mechanics, in a letter to the Labor Department opposing the move. 
According to government documents, Northwest still owes its pension plans $182 million for 2002 to comply with federal law. The airline says its total required contributions for 2003 and 2004 cannot yet be calculated. 
Already, the airline has contributed Pinnacle stock valued at $44 million to its pension trust, in a contribution that needed no government approval because it did not exceed the 10 percent limit. About 40,000 Northwest employees also participate in a company stock plan, but the workers' total exposure to company and related-party stock was unavailable.
Separately, the airline has applied to the Internal Revenue Service to extend the due dates for its pension contributions by several years. Such extensions are far more common than approvals for the use of large blocks of related-party stock.
Even as its employees fear for their retirement money, Northwest argues that its pension proposal is a prudent way to tide both the company and its pension funds through an extraordinarily difficult time. The entire air transportation sector was weakening even before the terrorist attacks of 2001, and since then it has been further harmed by the war in Iraq and the appearance of a mysterious respiratory illness in Asia.
United Airlines and US Airways have already been driven into bankruptcy, and American Airlines to the brink. The travails at US Airways, which has just emerged from bankruptcy reorganization, led to the demise of one of its pension plans -- the pilots' plan -- which had to be taken over by the federal government in March. Because the federal government insures pensions only up to certain limits, US Airways' pilots lost benefits in the process.
That harsh example underscores Northwest's position now: It is hard to keep a pension fund strong if the sponsoring company is weak. By conserving cash for essential business needs now, Northwest officials say, they can reduce any risk that Northwest might one day be unable to fund its pensions adequately, leading to another government takeover and more lost benefits.
It will be up to the Labor Department to decide which argument prevails. Already, the department -- one of three government bodies to regulate pensions -- has received about 1,700 letters about Northwest's proposal, most of them urging the department to reject it.
"I don't want stock in Pinnacle Airlines, for it has an undetermined value and may be worthless when I retire," wrote Kim Marie Jaffe, a 16-year employee in North Bellmore, N.Y. "The workers of Northwest Airlines will be out of luck, just like Pan Am employees."
Other letters reflected a deep anger, with employees recalling other concessions they had made in the past. Some demanded to be released from their pension plans so that they could set up their own individual retirement accounts. 
The Labor Department has scheduled hearings on the matter for early May and declined to make any public comment now. 
Should Northwest get the approval, its approach could serve as a model for other companies coping with pension deficits of their own. Already, some other companies are applying to the I.R.S. to stretch out their pension contributions, as Northwest has, and are reviewing their pension plans to see whether the benefits structure can be revised, a tactic recently used by Delta to reduce labor costs.
"I'm sure these are options that lots of companies are exploring," said Donald Myers, a former Labor Department regulatory counsel who is now a partner at the Washington law firm of Reed Smith.
The three Northwest pension plans at issue together cover about 73,000 employees, retirees and widows. Workers of many types are involved, both union and management. One plan covers pilots, another covers members of the other six unions at Northwest, and the third covers nonunion, salaried employees.
As of January 2001, the plans had combined assets worth about $4.4 billion -- about $1 billion short of what they needed to make good on Northwest's promises to all present and future retirees. The plans' health has badly deteriorated since then, because of the same negative market conditions that are eroding virtually all corporate and government pension funds. 
Northwest's proposal calls for using the stock of Pinnacle Airlines, a wholly owned subsidiary. Pinnacle is a regional airline with hubs in Detroit, Minneapolis and Memphis, doing business as Northwest Airlink. Incorporated in January 2002, it has grown briskly by flying passengers from smaller cities to the hubs, where they can connect to Northwest's flights. 
Part of Pinnacle's success lies in its low labor costs, achieved in part by shunning the very sort of traditional, highly regulated pension plans that are now causing Northwest and the other major airlines such cash-flow problems.
By law, companies that sponsor traditional defined-benefit pension plans must follow complicated rules to make sure enough money is in trust to pay promised benefits to workers. Companies may fund their pension plans with their own stock, or the stock of subsidiaries, but only up to 10 percent of a pension fund's assets. 
Contributions that go over that limit are deemed "prohibited transactions," and a violation of the company's fiduciary duty to its pension beneficiaries. 
Northwest's beneficiaries understand why, after a year in which a series of high-profile corporate bankruptcies gutted the retirement savings of employees who had heavy concentrations of company stock in their 401(k) accounts. 
"Pension funds are to be sustained by the infusion of cash," one Northwest employee, William Elmo Smith, wrote to the Labor Department. "Not by the vagaries of manipulation of the stock market by corporate management or economic variations. I do not want my pension fund to be of the Enron type."
To reduce such risks, Northwest has written a number of safeguards into its proposal, government documents show. If allowed to make the stock contribution, the airline has agreed also to grant the pension funds a put option, giving them the right to sell back the stock to Northwest at no less than the amount they were told it was worth at the time of the contribution. 
The airline has also designated an independent fiduciary, Aon Fiduciary Counselors, a unit of Aon Consulting Inc., to represent the pensioners' interests in the stock transaction. Aon is to have extensive ability to monitor Northwest's liquidity, and to advise the pension funds on whether to exercise the put option.
Pension experts said the G.M. case involved many similar safeguards, which made it cumbersome but ultimately successful. The company currently faces another large pension deficit, but not because of its 1994 exemption from the prohibited transactions rules. In fact, G.M. briefly enjoyed a pension surplus after making its $6 billion stock contribution to its pension funds. It has made other related-party stock contributions since then, but not enough to cross the 10 percent legal limit. 
But Northwest's employees question whether their company's proposed safeguards are enough. They doubt whether anyone can say accurately what Pinnacle's stock is worth, since the airline has not yet gone public and the market for new stocks is notably weak. Northwest intends to spin off Pinnacle either this year or next, with the pension funds getting a share of the proceeds.
An analysis of Pinnacle's value, by Eclat Consulting, shows that for now, at least, the subsidiary is much stronger than its parent. In addition to below-average labor costs, Pinnacle has virtually no long-term debt, enough cash to cover all short-term obligations, and a double-digit growth rate.
The Eclat study was commissioned by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the government agency that insures corporate pensions. The agency can make recommendations about Northwest's proposal, but the decision to accept or reject it is made by the Labor Department.
Eclat said Pinnacle's total market value was about $222 million, assuming the regional airline sustains a 14 percent growth rate for the next five years. Should growth slow down, the value would be less -- just $81 million at an 8 percent annual growth rate. The study was completed in November.
The hitch, however, is that Pinnacle's value is directly connected to Northwest's financial well-being. 
"The current and immediate value ofPinnacle Airlines is virtually removed if Northwest ceased to exist," states a Labor Department summary of the Northwest proposal. In such a case, Pinnacle's fortunes -- and its stock's value -- would depend on another major airline adding a hub in either Detroit, Memphis or Minneapolis. 
The Labor Department's summary said there were "limited options" for Pinnacle in such a case, because all of the other major airlines have already built strong ties with their own regional partners.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: THE REGION; 
In Jordan, It's Long Live Iraq, and Woe to the King

BYLINE:  By IAN FISHER and ALAN FEUER 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, April 4 

 BODY:
A short war may matter less these days to President Bush, but it is vital to the young king of Jordan: the longer the war, the more risky his gamble in helping the United States.
 Before the war, the calculation here was that the rapid fall of Saddam Hussein would paper over a very unpopular decision approved by King Abdullah II to allow thousands of American troops to be stationed in the empty eastern desert next to Iraq. He and his government maintain that the troops serve a purely defensive role, mostly operating Patriot antimissile batteries. 
 Now those troops are the target of rising criticism here, as the intelligentsia, Islamists and ordinary people all roll their eyes at the government's insistence that none of the troops are playing an active role inside Iraq.
A petition signed last week by 95 prominent Jordanians demands that the troops leave -- and that the king forcefully condemn a war that has outraged virtually every Jordanian and raised the suggestion, less gently than usual with Jordan's untouchable monarch, that King Abdullah is not reflecting the will of the people. 
"That was the Jordanian strategy: to be in cahoots with the Americans and publicly deny it on the basis that it would be a short war and that by the time the people realized it, it would be a fait accompli," said Labib Walid Kamhawi, who signed the petition and is one of Jordan's top political analysts. "That did not happen -- and it put the king in an embarrassing situation."
Embarrassment may be the least of it, as his balancing act between friendship to the United States and street anger grows ever more delicate. As long as there is a war next door, most experts expect more and louder demonstrations. That could pose problems in a nation that prizes stability, since perhaps half of its five million people are Palestinian refugees already hostile to American policies toward Israel. There already is talk that King Abdullah may replace the government, as a way of signaling that he received bad counsel on the war.
But perhaps most difficult for King Abdullah, 41, who took the throne after his father, King Hussein, died of cancer in 1999, is that the war has reinforced many softly stated doubts about these first years of his reign: that this monarch, educated in America and Britain, and whose English is better than his Arabic, is not entirely in touch with his people, at least not nearly as much as his father was.
"There is a huge gap between the official stand and the popular stand," said Hamzah Mansour, general secretary of the Islamic Action Front, an Islamist party, who did not mention the king specifically. "And this is dangerous for Jordan. The stability of Jordan is always accomplished by harmony between the official feeling and the popular feeling."
Officials and experts grumble that the decision to help the United States was taken by too small a circle of advisers, in what some here see as a further erosion of the more open rule initiated by King Hussein in the later days of his 46 years on the throne. 
King Abdullah himself seems sensitive to the criticism, especially given the risks to the country's long relationship with the United States. His agreement on the troops is one reason for the more than $1 billion in additional assistance President Bush has requested from Congress for Jordan. But at the moment, the king seems focused more on tamping down resentment at home.
Since the war began, he and his government have repeatedly called for a new push to end the war diplomatically, and on Thursday, Prime Minister Ali Abu al-Ragheb summoned the United States ambassador, Edward W. Gnehm, to register his concern about the loss of civilian lives in Iraq. 
On Wednesday, the king's office released a friendly interview conducted by the official news agency, Petra, in which he used his strongest language yet against the war, calling it an "invasion." He also denied a range of allegations, included charges that Jordan has allowed the use of its airspace for attacks on Iraq and has allowed Israeli special forces to mingle with the Americans. 
"Absolutely no, we can never allow such a thing," the king said, in answer to a question about whether Jordan could become an alternate staging ground for the push on Baghdad, since Turkey turned down the American requests. "We are in accord with ourselves and our people, who rejected and condemned the invasion. So, how would we allow ourselves to be partners in this war, God forbid?"
It is, of course, more complicated than that. As his advisers often point out, King Abdullah worked hard to persuade President Bush not to attack Iraq. But when war appeared inevitable, he sought pragmatically to cushion Jordan from any economic, diplomatic and political fallout -- and that calculation included allowing the troops here.
But as Jordanian officials made clear at the time, it was supremely important that the war be brief. Aside from risking public outrage, a war that dragged on could also erode anybenefits from helping the United States. Exports to Iraq from Jordan amount to $480 million a year; the economy would most likely not keep pace with last year's high 5 percent growth; thousands of jobs in tourism, transportation and trade have already withered and will not return until the war is over. 
And so now the government finds itself in an odd position: top officials condemn the war in ever-harsher words, which has the dual effect of sounding closer to the public mood yet reinforcing the popular criticism of the government.
"I see a perception on the Arab street that this is not a war against Saddam or his weapons of mass destruction," said Bassem I. Awadallah, the planning minister, who is close to the king. "I see the perception of a war being fought against Arab nationalism and Islam."
There are few suggestions that this war could endanger Jordan's monarchy, despite doomsday predictions of the kind of sweeping change in the region that last occurred when the Ottoman Empire fell after World War I. 
But, at a minimum, some experts predict a rise in willingness to criticize the government here -- and even the king himself, who is normally spared public attack. In some protests, public chants rebuked the king, and many say public pressure on the government will only rise as the war goes on. 
"Emotions will get hotter -- and we will be fighting the government to stop this war with the Iraqis," said Sultan, 23, a protester at a recent antiwar demonstration here in the capital.
Much may also depend on what happens after the war -- whether Jordan will be able to call in its favor to the Americans and prod Mr. Bush to support a new peace initiative between the Israelis and the Palestinians. 
Privately, some Jordanian officials fear that Mr. Bush will acquiesce to Israel's objections to the new "road map" calling for a Palestinian state within three years. One American official here, though, said the United States was committed to the plan -- which, if true, might ease the pressure on Jordan's leadership.
"This is a government that can make a difference when they advocate very strongly for something," said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "Their voice has great credibility with the U.S. government, and the voice of the king in particular."
But many intellectuals and officials say they wonder if this war signals a fundamental change in the Middle East, in which anger is beginning to coalesce behind a cause -- Arab and Muslim unity -- above loyalty to Jordan, or any other country, and the policies of its leaders. 
"I was watching TV the other day and the call to prayer was sounding in Baghdad at the same time it was sounding in Amman," said Alia A. Toukan, 29, a Palestinian-Jordanian who holds a master's degree from a London university. "I could hear it on the television set and through the window. It hit me just how close to home this really is."
"I'm Jordanian," she added, "but I'm also Palestinian and also Arab and also Muslim. All of us have that sort of layered identity. It only takes the right set of circumstances for the different parts to come out."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: POLITICAL STRATEGY; 
Pushing an Agenda, Far From Iraq

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY with RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: GRAND RAPIDS, Mich., April 4 

 BODY:
The White House portrays Karl Rove, President Bush's most influential political adviser, as playing no role in military decisions that are shaping the Bush presidency.
 But more than two weeks after the war began, Mr. Rove is busily working to shape perceptions of Mr. Bush as a wartime leader and to prepare for the re-election campaign that will start as soon as the war ends. 
 Tonight, Mr. Rove traveled here to tend to the Republican troops at the Texas Night fund-raising celebration of the Kent County Republican Committee.
"The president is leading the coalition of the willing, and is determined that Iraq will be disarmed of its weapons of mass destruction and that the cruel dictator's regime will be ended," Mr. Rove declared after taking the stage to chants of "U.S.A.!" in a cavernous hanger filled with the local party faithful wearing Texas-style cowboy boots, hats and bandanas.
Beyond courting Republicans at party events, Mr. Rove has in recent days been counseling Congressional Republicans and conservative groups on how to advance their domestic agenda even while attention is on Iraq.
This week, he held forth at a lunch with conservative commentators and journalists. Some participants had backed the administration on Iraq when it faced criticism that the war plan provided insufficient force and that it had been overly optimistic about Iraqi resistance.
With an eye to building public support for the president's agenda, Mr. Rove participated in a conference call about efforts to win resolutions from state legislatures backing the administration on nine issues, from tax cuts to judicial nominations. Mr. Rove briefed a group of conservative Catholics on the White House's plans for pushing legislation on abortion, cloning and other topics.
In his appearance here tonight, in a Midwestern state that will almost certainly be pivotal to Mr. Bush's re-election hopes next year, Mr. Rove spent far more time talking about domestic policy than about Iraq, promoting Mr. Bush's tax cut plan, for example, as the right remedy for the faltering economy. Indeed, Mr. Rove's remarks sounded as if he was road-testing themes for the president to use when the war is over and he embarks on the campaign trail.
Mr. Rove said in an e-mail message that he was so busy now that he did not have time to talk about what he was up to. "I am up to my eyeballs today and racing for the airport," he wrote before leaving Washington.
Arriving here tonight, he brushed past a visiting reporter and headed for the food line, saying with a smile, "You wasted your time, you wasted your time."
Mr. Rove has always mixed a deep interest in policy with hardball politics. Before flying to Michigan for the campaign-style appearance here, he attended a White House briefing with Mr. Bush on severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, the contagious illness that has spread to North America from Asia. 
Last year, in remarks that were assailed by Democrats as an effort to politicize the campaign against terrorism, he urged Republicans to "go to the country" on the issue of national security because voters "trust the Republican Party to do a better job of protecting and strengthening America's military might and thereby protecting America."
An adviser to the White House said of him these days: "He's not part of the war effort. He's the president's closest political adviser."
There is, certainly, a matter of calculation by this White House as it seeks to portray Mr. Rove as absent from the Iraq war room. He has always been wary of newspaper accounts that portrayed him as having a hand in foreign policy, his friends said.
Advisers to the administration say the White House is so skittish about the image of Mr. Rove being part of the war council that he is often deliberately excluded from nearly all foreign policy discussions involving groups of advisers. Even so, his friend say they assume he addresses those questions during his extensive private time with Mr. Bush.
"They go the other way and keep Karl out of the room, where, absent the critique, you'd want Karl in the room," said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative group that works closely with Mr. Rove.
To the degree that Mr. Rove's foreign policy views are known within the administration, they are hawkish, particularly on Iraq, administration officials said. But his influence with Mr. Bush is more a function of his political instincts, building coalitions on domestic issues and acting as Mr. Bush's ambassador to the Republican right -- particularly these days, as he prepares for the election ahead.
"He's not very involved in the policies that relate tothe war," said Representative Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, who is close to the White House and who said he had heard often from Mr. Rove over the last week. "He's focused on the war as it relates to the president's schedule and the president's time and the president's commitment. His policy focus is domestic: taxes and Medicare reform."
Yet if Mr. Rove is keeping away from the battlefield, he is certainly helping to manage perceptions of Mr. Bush during the war. On Thursday, Mr. Rove accompanied Mr. Bush on Air Force One to Camp Lejeune, N.C., where the president spoke to cheering men and women in uniform, and then met privately with families of marines who have died in the war. Mr. Rove recounted that meeting to a hushed crowd tonight.
His decision to meet for lunch on Wednesday with a group of conservative journalists at the Oval Room, across Lafayette Park from the White House, was in itself not unusual. White House officials routinely have private meetings to press the administration's case with what they hope will be a sympathetic audience.
But this meeting took place while the Pentagon was under attack for its competence in running the war, and Mr. Bush's advisers had been complaining about what they described as unfair media coverage of the effort. The lunch was arranged by Kate O'Beirne, Washington editor of The National Review, White House officials said, and was described by some participants as one in a regular series of such gatherings.
Mr. Rove tonight quoted favorable remarks about Mr. Bush's domestic agenda written by two of the journalists at the lunch, Andrew Sullivan and Michael Barone.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: THE CENTRAL CITY; 
AS U.S. MOVES IN, IRAQI TV PRESENTS A RELAXED HUSSEIN

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, April 4 

 BODY:
With American troops moving cautiously toward placing the city under siege, Iraqi television tonight showed a 12-minute film of a relaxed and cheerful man it said was Saddam Hussein strolling with apparent nonchalance around Baghdad and stopping to exchange greetings with ordinary Iraqis.
 The film, shown several times during the evening, appeared to be Iraq's riposte to conjecture among officials in Washington that the 65-year-old ruler might have been killed or incapacitated in the opening American missile strikes of the war, 16 days ago. The man shown looked like a champion returning to neighborhoods where he has been most loved. 
 The Pentagon had said that the war's opening salvos on March 20 were aimed at a meeting of top Iraqi leaders in a military compound in southern Baghdad that intelligence had indicated might have included Mr. Hussein and possibly his two sons, Uday and Qusay. 
Today, at what appeared to be a critical juncture of the war, with American troops occupying the airport just to the west of the city, Iraq produced what amounted to a coup de theatre, one that put Mr. Hussein back on the public stage in a way that sought to puncture the notion that he and his associates were on the ropes. 
Whatever the impression the film made in Washington, most people here believed it was Saddam Hussein, alive, well and garrulous. It was him, down to his loping walk, his thick, almost lisping Arabic with the accent of his native district of Tikrit, and the thick mustache now graying.
The message conveyed, people here said, was as powerful as any the Iraqi leader has contrived in a long time -- at least for those Iraqis who saw it, a dwindling number in Baghdad, where the power went out across the city just as a new wave of heavy American air attacks began on Thursday night. 
With Baghdad plunged into darkness, and American artillery audible in the city, the increased tension in the capital stood in marked contrast to the casual air affected by the Iraqi leader in the film, if it was indeed him.
A few hours before the broadcast, state television also showed images of Mr. Hussein with a new speech from what appeared to be the same low-ceilinged bunker he used before, sitting at the same lectern and beside the same Iraqi flag as he did on March 24. This time, he urged Iraqis to fight against the growing encirclement of Baghdad. 
"Strike them with the power of faith wherever they approach you, and resist them, O courageous citizens of Baghdad," Mr. Hussein said. "With the grace of God, you will be the victors, and they will be the vanquished. Our martyrs will go to paradise, and their dead will go to hell."
Leafing through a text roughly handwritten on a fold-over notepad, he made no mention of the capture of the airport.
But his remarks appeared to have been drafted in the light of the sudden change in the military map that had occurred in the past 48 hours, with the American Third Infantry Division and the Marines' First Division driving rapidly north from the southwest and southeast into the outer reaches of the city.
"The enemy has evaded the defenses of our armed forces around Baghdad and other cities and has progressed, as we expected, to some landings here and there," the Iraqi leader said. Belittling this, he said, "In most cases, these landings have been made on the highways and involve a small number of troops that you can confront and destroy with the arms that you have."
Few films, if any, seem certain to receive closer scrutiny than the one showing Mr. Hussein in the streets of Baghdad. But the provisional answers to the questions it posed that were given tonight by Iraqis friendly enough to Western reporters to speak candidly about Mr. Hussein -- and to whisper that they yearned for an Iraq without him -- offered little comfort to American war planners. 
The man was Mr. Hussein, they insisted. That was the Iraqi leader's slight paunch visible when the man in the film turned sideways to the camera as he accepted the cheers of the crowd. That was his gesture -- chopping the air with his right hand, palm clenched, thumb upward, just as Mr. Hussein is shown doing in a battalion of statues around Baghdad.
As for the dating of the film, it seemed unarguable that it was shot after the start of the war.
The black smoke that has plumed skyward over Baghdad since March 22, when trenches filled with a heavy oil were first lit in an attempt to blind American pilots and the guidance systems of bombs and missiles, was clearly visible on the horizon. 
The black car carrying Mr. Hussein, apparently a luxury Mercedes or one of its Japanese equivalents, was shown driving past streets of shuttered shops, some with their windows taped, a step almost no Iraqis took until the war began.
Other glimpses of street life resembled what Western reporters have seen during the war: men fanning open air spits at restaurants still offering kebabs, and traffic much diminished but still busy enough, with double-decker buses and battered white-and-orange taxis and crowded minivans.
At least one place where he stopped was easy to identify: across the street from an auction house in the Mansour district where many Iraqis have gone to sell their furniture and household appliances in recent years to stave off penury as the economy collapsed under the weight of Mr. Hussein's wars and international sanctions.
This placed the Iraqi leader -- if it was him -- at least halfway to the airport from the largest of his vast compounds in Baghdad, the now almost-obliterated Republican Palace grounds. The weather, too, was a clue -- overcast, just as it was in Baghdad today, and a sharp break from Thursday, when clear blue skies aided American attacks that were among the heaviest of the war.
All in all, Iraqis friendly to Americans concluded, this was almost certainly Mr. Hussein, and the day he was filmed most probably today. 
For years, Mr. Hussein has limited his public appearances to rare moments atop the reviewing stand at Army Day parades and other portentous events. When he has been seen moving among ordinary Iraqis, it has been on old film, endlessly recycled on television, showing him being enveloped by adoring, chanting crowds. The more these films have been shown, the more many ordinary Iraqis have seen them as the obverse of the essential truth, that Mr. Hussein is an isolated, secretive, cruel leader. Against this sense of the Iraqi president, today's film was astonishing.
A handful of security men could be seen around Mr. Hussein, but nothing like the layers of steely eyed men described by the few foreigners who have met him in his palaces. 
Principally, his security seemed to be left to two bulky men in sports shirts carrying Kalashnikov rifles, and their concern appeared to be to keep a way clear for Mr. Hussein as he moved forward to greet people, not to watch for potential assassins.
At one point, a small, curly haired boy of about 2 was thrust into his arms. Like any politician on the hustings, Mr. Hussein held the boy up, beaming.
Beside Mr. Hussein, throughout, were two senior-looking officials in the green uniforms that are the common dress among military men and officials of the ruling Baath Party. Aside from them, there was no obvious sign of the Baath Party officials who normally lurk among the crowds to orchestrate adulation for the leader. 
Film shot from what appeared to be the front passenger seat of the Iraqi leader's car gave glimpses of the heart-stopping moments other drivers must have had as his car drove by, assuming the drivers knew who he was.
At one point, as the car crossed a bridge over an expressway and pulled to the right to make an off-ramp, it pulled past a battered taxi that could have been a totem for the humiliations that have befallen ordinary people in Mr. Hussein's Iraq. 
But it was triumph rather than humiliation that the government sought to project today.
The information minister, Muhammad Saeed al-Sahhaf, positively chirped as he laid out the Iraqi version of events at the Palestine Hotel, quarters for all foreign reporters covering the war.
He said American advances in a broad crescent across Baghdad's southern approaches were all part of an Iraqi plan to lure the Americans into a catastrophic defeat at the gates of Baghdad.
The minister said Iraqi forces had battled the Americans at every point of their advance, inflicting "heavy injuries and killings" and destroying large numbers of tanks and other vehicles.
The airport, he said, will be "the Americans' graveyard now.".

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Earnings Warnings Cause Slump in Technology Shares

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue chips scraped out modest gains yesterday as United States-led forces closed in on Baghdad, but technology stocks slumped under the weight of earnings warnings from companies like the software maker PeopleSoft.
 United States troops seized Baghdad's international airport yesterday, but the Iraqi government threatened to strike back with "nonconventional" means. 
 "Nobody's going to make any bets on what's going to happen in Iraq," said John O'Donoghue, co-head of listed trading at Credit Suisse First Boston. "It's just not prudent." 
The war is hitting corporate profits and the economy. PeopleSoft sank almost 13 percent to a session low of $14.40 after warning the war was delaying corporate buying.
A government report yesterday indicated the economy suffered a worse-than-expected drop of 108,000 in nonfarm payrolls in March as the conflict took a toll on hiring. The nation's unemployment rate, however, held steady at 5.8 percent in March.
"Corporate spending got put on pause, business is still tough -- and I don't like the stats I have been seeing on the economy," said Donna Van Vlack, director of trading at Brandywine Asset Management, which oversees $8 billion.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 36.77 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 8,277.15, rising late in the day after wobbling near the unchanged mark much of the session. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 2.40 points, or 0.3 percent, to 878.85. The Nasdaq composite index fell 13.07 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,383.51.
Technology stocks took the most heat as corporate profit warnings hurt sentiment. PeopleSoft ranked among the most active shares on Nasdaq and skidded $1.48, to close at $15.02, down 9 percent. After regular trading ended Thursday, the company warned that its first-quarter earnings and revenue would fall short of estimates as the war in Iraq hit an already weakened economy.
PeopleSoft dragged other makers of business software lower. SAP of Germany slumped 61 cents, or almost 3 percent, to $19.95 in the United States. Siebel Systems fell 41 cents, or 5 percent, to $7.75.
Semiconductor stocks were under pressure after Europe's biggest chip maker, STMicroelectronics issued disappointing results as it took a hit from falling product prices and currency fluctuations. STM's shares traded in the United States fell 97 cents, or 4.9 percent, to $18.76.
The Philadelphia Stock Exchange's semiconductor index lost 2.45 percent. Texas Instruments, which competes with STMicroelectronics in several markets, sank 85 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $16.90. Intel fell 52 cents, or almost 3 percent, to $17.05.
"We have reality starting to come into play, because we are heading into earnings season," said Arnie Owen, managing director of equities at Roth Capital Partners.
Alcoa, rose 13 cents, to $20.04, ahead of its quarterly results, which were released after the bell. The company, the first Dow component of the season to report earnings, said first-quarter results fell because of higher energy costs. 
The Altria Group fell $1.40, or 4.7 percent, to $28.30. Fitch Ratings cut the ratings of Altria and its units late on Thursday, citing the increased risk of litigation and losses facing the industry as a result of an Illinois court judgment against Philip Morris USA, part of Altria.
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday. The 10-year Treasury note fell 11/32, to a price of 99 12/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.95 percent from 3.91 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond dropped 19/32, to 106 4/32. The bond's yield rose to 4.97 percent from 4.93 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: The Dia Generation 

BYLINE:  By Michael Kimmelman; Michael Kimmelman is the chief art critic of The New York Times.

 BODY:
Next month, a former factory in a small town an hour north of New York will become the first museum dedicated to the greatest generation of American artists. Not Pollock, Rothko and de Kooning. The next generation, the one that came of age during the 1960's and 70's, the one that includes Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Walter De Maria, Michael Heizer, Robert Smithson, Sol LeWitt, Andy Warhol, Robert Ryman, Agnes Martin, Bruce Nauman and Richard Serra. The history of American art is going to need a little rewriting. 
 They are men mostly, with big egos and big ideas. They were the first Americans to influence Europeans. The work these artists made changed, or at least questioned, the nature of art: what it looked like, its size, its materials, its attitude toward the places where it was shown, its relation to architecture, light and space and to the land. The artists even questioned whether art needed to be a tangible object. Minimalism, Post-Minimalism, Earth art, video art, Conceptualism -- suddenly art could be nothing more than an idea, a thought on a piece of paper that played in your head. It could be ephemeral or atmospheric, like the experience of a room illuminated by colored fluorescent tubes. 
 The work found itself at home, as the artists did, in the lofts of abandoned industrial buildings in Lower Manhattan, converted into studios and white-box galleries. But much of the art was too big for a gallery. Robert Smithson's "Spiral Jetty" was 6,650 tons of black basalt and earth in the shape of a gigantic coil, 1,500 feet long, projecting into the remote shallows of the Great Salt Lake in Utah. 
The artists demanded space in tune with their aesthetic. Now along comes Dia:Beacon, set to open on May 18. Housed in a factory in Beacon, N.Y., that was built in 1929 to print boxes for Nabisco crackers, it will be the biggest museum of contemporary art in the world. With nearly a quarter of a million square feet of exhibition space, it dwarfs Frank Gehry's Guggenheim in Bilbao, Spain: it is reused raw space adapted by artists to suit themselves, with no star architect but huge rooms, some as long as football fields, for paintings and sculptures that have never felt truly at home.
Before he died in 1994, Donald Judd complained that his sculptures were crammed in with other art in most museums and that the objects were denied what he considered their rightful independence and integrity. "So much money spent on architecture in the name of art, much more than goes to art, is wrong," he barked about new museums. "Even if the architecture were good, but it's bad." Dia:Beacon was built to let people see art the way Judd would have wanted.
Conceived by a charismatic German art dealer, Heiner Friedrich, and his wife, Philippa de Menil, in 1974, Dia was not meant to be a traditional museum. The opposite, in fact. For a while, Dia spent millions and millions of dollars financing projects like Walter De Maria's "Lightning Field," for which huge steel poles were planted in a remote stretch of New Mexico. It poured $4 million into "Dream House," by La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela: a building on Harrison Street in Lower Manhattan that housed Zazeela's light projections and where Young's electronic music played 24 hours a day. "Dream House" had its own guru in residence, Pandit Pran Nath, the Indian singer and teacher, and a staff that recorded every note of music and word of conversation and photographed and logged every meal eaten there. 
Dia bought Fort Russell, a former Army post on 340 acres of scrubland in Marfa, Tex., for Judd to create a private museum for his work and the work of the few chosen artists he admired. The project epitomized the crazy scale and wild ambition of the art of his generation. Marfa, an isolated clutch of adobe and wood-frame houses on streets that peter out into no man's land, languished several drowsy hours from civilization. Its fort was a cavalry post for patrolling the Mexican border and later a camp for German prisoners in World War II, before it was decommissioned. Judd converted abandoned barracks into exhibition spaces. 
At the center of the fort was Judd's crowning achievement and Minimalism's great shrine: 100 milled-aluminum boxes installed in two converted artillery sheds, twin cathedrals with giant Quonset hut roofs. Judd replaced the sheds' garage doors with big windows, letting sun play against the boxes, deflecting any preconceptions that the sculptures might be forbidding or monotonous. 
The work exemplified Minimalism's paradoxical nature: Puritanism offset by a sensual embrace of optical surprise and ravishing detail. Time, light, form: Judd forcibly focused viewers' attention on these basics of human experience via simple shapes presented exquisitely, for slow study in rarefied isolation. At a time when museums were becoming malls and art seemed cheapened by commerce and mass reproduction (so felt 60's artists like Judd, inflamed by the antibourgeois politics of the time), Marfa was conceived to restore innate dignity to art and to the experience of looking. "A shape, a volume, a color, a surface is something itself," Judd declared. "It shouldn't be concealed as part of a fairly different whole." While Judd rejected metaphors of bodies for his boxes and other abstract sculptures, the utopian -- which is to say, human -- implications of what he had in mind were obvious. 
To lump Judd with Nauman and Serra and Warhol as a "generation" is obviously to put together people of different ages and styles, not to mention temperaments, who nevertheless all first made their marks during the 60's and 70's, when wild experimentation tested the definition and limits of every kind of art. Art has not been the same since. 
Andy Warhola, as he was born, made Andy Warhol his masterpiece, forever blurring the line between art and life. Nauman made movies of himself neurotically pacing in circles and helped to open up a whole world of video and performance art. Dan Flavin used colored industrial fluorescent tubes to make Minimal sculptures whose ambience was as much the subject as the abstract arrangement of the lights, establishing the basics of installation art before anybody ever thought to call it that.
Partly inspired by Flavin, LeWitt decided to start "from Square 1," he said, with sculptures in the shapes of squares and cubes. Linguistic theorists at the time talked about words and mental concepts as signs and signifiers. LeWitt moved between his syntax of geometric sculptures and mental propositions for images: concepts he wrote on paper that could be realized by him or someone else or not at all. Physical things are perishable. Ideas need not be. LeWitt wasn't interested in precious one-of-a-kind baubles. "Art has been veritably invaded by life, if life means flux, change, chance, time, unpredictability," the sculptor Scott Burton observed around then. "Sometimes the difference between the two is sheer consciousness, the awareness that what seemed to be a stain on the wall is in fact a work of art." LeWitt's conceptual work pushed the point to an extreme: his art was the equivalent of the stain painted over, leaving only consciousness.
Meanwhile, painters like Martin, Ryman and Frank Stella were pushing at their own limits, making works that were just stripes or white on white. They were partly inspired by Pollock, but they rejected the 50's cult of expressionism that he exemplified. Pollock had revolutionized abstract art by pouring and dripping, but in the 60's his impact was as much on sculptors as it was on painters. Serra, tossing hot lead, echoed Pollock's physical performance and liquid vocabulary, moving sculpture off the pedestal and onto the floor. 
Out west, Heizer, De Maria and Smithson were simultaneously moving art into the great outdoors. Heizer drove his motorcycle across a dry lake bed in the Nevada desert, making immense drawings with his tire tracks; then he made "Double Negative," a 1,500-foot-long, 50-foot-deep, 30-foot-wide gash cut onto facing slopes of an obscure mesa in Nevada, a project that required blasting 240,000 tons of rock.
Visiting Chichen Itza, the Mayan city, he devised "City" next: a suite of giant, variously shaped abstract sculptures over an area that covered more than a mile end to end -- modern art turned into monumental abstract architecture, with ancient ruins as the model. Heizer imagined "complexes," immense mastabas, some a quarter of a mile long, with 70-foot slabs weighing thousands of pounds. He acquired several square miles of remote property, surrounded by public land, two hours into the Nevada desert from the nearest paved road, and he lived for years in a trailer, locked in for half the winter and once going for months seeing only a couple of sheep trailers and a passing pickup truck. Art didn't get much more extreme than that.
Heiner Friedrich, who was born in Germany in 1938, liked to describe how seeing the destruction during the Nazi years inspired him to want to create things that would last forever. One recent morning, at the Mercer Hotel in SoHo, he told me that "living in the countryside after the war in purest relation to nature, in great peace, made a huge impression on me -- seeing the manifestation of the divine." Bespectacled, dressed in a black suit and black shirt, a large, sturdy man with a lined face, Friedrich today looks more forbidding than he is. He is a dreamer, prone to verbal flights of near-spiritual reverie.
A son of the founder of Alzmetall, a manufacturer of industrial equipment, his life was changed by visiting Matisse's chapel in Vence, France, and on trips to Greece and Italy, "where I saw art and architecture, each in its own place." Giotto's Arena Chapel in Padua "became for me the true insight for the unfolding and development of Dia." The chapel was the work of a single artist: a singular site, complex, revolutionary, preserved in perpetuity, a pilgrimage destination both cultural and spiritual.
Friedrich started a gallery in Munich in 1963 and then opened a second one in Cologne, representing artists like Beuys, Sigmar Polke, Gerhard Richter, Judd, Heizer, Cy Twombly, De Maria and Warhol. But Friedrich grew depressed by the endless cycle of short exhibitions and sales. At the same time, he noted how artists like Judd, De Maria, Smithson and Heizer were gravitating toward a kind of art that museums and galleries simply couldn't accommodate. 
Fed up with struggling to raise public money for big art projects in Germany, Friedrich moved to SoHo in 1971. For a while, his gallery at 141 Wooster Street became a salon where artists like De Maria and Blinky Palermo would hang out. Young and Zazeela staged performances. Judd exhibited sculpture. The gallery commissioned art on a large scale. Soon Friedrich met and fell in love with Philippa de Menil, an heiress to the Schlumberger oil fortune and the child of Dominique and John de Menil, low-profile, high-class art collectors who had commissioned the Rothko Chapel in Houston and whose Menil Collection, a cypress-clapboard-and-glass masterpiece by the architect Renzo Piano, exemplified the family's taste for fabulous, expensive simplicity. 
Who knows how much of Dia can be attributed to Friedrich's vision or to the influence of the Menils or to the contribution of Dia's other founder, Helen Winkler, who worked for the Menils and became Dia's link with many artists. Winkler and her husband oversaw the construction of De Maria's "Lightning Field" in New Mexico. "She held things together," Friedrich says. "She was indispensable." Much of Dia clearly also came from the artists themselves, like Judd, who knew how and when to capitalize on a golden opportunity.
The general idea as it gradually emerged was pure and beautiful -- that is, if you accepted the premise that it was worth spending millions of dollars on difficult, brainy abstract art few people appreciated at the time. Then again, time itself was a relative concept for Dia. This was one of its distinguishing philosophies. Projects like "Lightning Field," for instance, were expected to last for eons. If you calculated attendance in decades or centuries rather than weeks or months, then a handful of devotees trekking to the New Mexican desert year after year added up to a blockbuster crowd.
Friedrich explained that dia was a Greek word meaning "through," as in conduit. A dozen or so artists, Friedrich's chosen ones, would be freed of all constraints and allowed to pursue work as they envisioned it. Naturally, this fueled deep suspicion and jealousy in the art world, but Friedrich compared what he was doing -- now with his wife's fortune -- to the Medicis. "Dia didn't tap something new; it tapped something old," he said at the time. "Our values are as powerful as those in the Renaissance." For emphasis, he added that Dan Flavin "is as important as Michelangelo." 
Dia's artists were certainly devising plans that made Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel look like a minor interior-decorating job. In 1977, Friedrich's SoHo gallery became a permanent locale for De Maria's "The New York Earth Room": 280,000 pounds of dirt trucked in and spread 22 inches deep across 3,600 square feet. The room had to be regularly hosed and raked and cleared of mushrooms. Employees were assigned to watch silently over it -- no reading was allowed on the job, lest their distraction disrupt the aura of aesthetic contemplation. De Maria's "Vertical Earth Kilometer" was completed that same year: a slender 18-ton rod sunk into a 1,000-meter hole drilled in Kassel, Germany, leaving only the tiny circle of one end visible in the ground. The cost: $419,000, and $2,500 a year to maintain. 
The first big outdoor project completed in America was De Maria's "Lightning Field": 400 stainless-steel poles, 2 inches thick and up to 20 feet tall, installed as a grid in a one-mile-long and one-kilometer-wide stretch of extremely remote New Mexico. Visitors were required to spend 24 hours in a rustic cabin beside the poles, contemplating the way light changed as day passed to night and back again. Dia bought the land near Quemado, N.M., in 1975, and local high-school students helped install the poles. Cost for the project: $1 million. 
What was incalculable, as at Marfa, was its artistic value. The work required a journey, a pilgrimage, the sacrifice and effort being part of the philosophy of immersion in the art. There was something manipulative, even prescriptive, about that idea, but also something deeply liberating about the experience. On extremely rare occasions, a bolt of lightning actually struck one of the poles. Otherwise, the art entailed psychic intangibles: taking in the silent, peaceable, solitary passage of time in the high desert and the vastness of space -- and noticing how subtly different the poles looked as the sun moved across the sky, shifting from shiny slivers at sunrise to ghosts at noon, when they're nearly obscured by the high sun and surrounding mountains, then burning like fireworks just before sunset. The work meditated on a man-made forest of industrial materials and perfect geometry playing off against the wilderness and the stars. It celebrated America and the Western landscape, incorporating it, which was something fresh that De Maria's generation brought to art.
By 1979, Dia's staff had expanded from half a dozen to 80, and its annual payroll topped $800,000. Heiner Friedrich and Philippa de Menil were now putting together a vast collection, but their resources were being stretched thinner. They had met Sheikh Muzaffar Ozak, a Sufi master of the Halveti-Jerrahi Order of dervishes, and Dia started pouring money into a Sufi mosque on Mercer Street as well as supporting various Islamic publishing projects. At the same time, Dia was buying real estate for one-man museums. In addition to La Monte Young and Marian Zazeela's "Dream House" and Judd's spread at Marfa, it bought a former bank in Winchendon, Mass., for Fred Sandback in 1981 and converted it into a kind of open studio/private museum. Sandback's sculptures entailed thin colored strings attached to walls outlining geometric shapes, like triangles and rectangles. Viewed from certain angles, they created the illusion of solid glass, but from other angles, they disappeared from sight. Dia supported the museum for years until, by more or less mutual consent, the building was sold.
"People would scratch their heads and ask, 'What's going on here?"' Sandback, now white-bearded and ruddy-faced, looking like a monk with a ponytail, told me one recent afternoon. "I think the skepticism hurt Heiner very much. It implied his motives were not correct. He may have gone overboard. But he wanted nothing more than to give LaMonte what he needed and Don what he needed to proceed unencumbered. Say what you will, I think the motivation was simple."
Unfortunately, as Dia's costs skyrocketed, Schlumberger plummeted from around $87 a share in 1980 to around $30 in early 1982. Philippa de Menil had to sell off more and more stock for Dia. Plans were initiated to turn over some of the artists' projects, like Turrell's "Roden Crater," to independent foundations, which would now need to find their own source of support. 
Artists Dia had supported were apoplectic, especially Judd, congenitally angry anyway. Dia had spent more than $5 million and lavished a monthly stipend of $17,500 on him. Now Judd fumed about Friedrich: "I distrusted him from the beginning. The only problem is that I didn't distrust him enough." 
Sandback says: "When someone is so very protective and generous, it becomes the norm, which it isn't. This was a new paradigm for patronage, and I myself am ungodly lucky to have had such support and freedom in my life. It's too bad that some artists became so upset when it stopped. I didn't regard it as my due to have my work purchased. But other artists had reason to scream bloody murder, I suppose, because they were left high and dry in terms of what they really wanted, and had expected, to do. Remember, Don's commitment to Marfa was just as strong and intense as Heiner's was to Dia. That made the conflict inevitable. It's what made both of them exceptional."
By 1983, Schlumberger stock had fallen further, and Dia had to take out a $3.87 million loan. Dominique de Menil, Philippa's mother and the family matriarch, now stepped in. Philippa's money was put in trust controlled by her brothers. Dozens of employees were fired. Much of the Manhattan real estate that had been acquired for one-man museums was put on the market. Young and Zazeela's "Dream House" on Harrison Street was sold.
Dia had spent $40 million amassing 1,000 works, creating or laying the groundwork for some of the most ambitious art in modern history. But now it had no income, and many of these projects were still far from completion.
Dia auctioned off 18 works at Sotheby's: a Twombly went for a record $418,000; a Warhol, for $165,000. The sale raised $1.3 million, but this was $700,000 less than Dia had hoped to raise. A low point for Friedrich was when Dia sold two of its three Barnett Newmans. "That was crushing," he told me. "I had talked about a Newman museum with Newman." Judd, threatening a lawsuit, won custody of his art (and another $2 million) in an out-of-court settlement.
"It was not run the way money people normally treat money" is how Friedrich responds to critics who say he was irresponsible with Dia. Dominique, his mother-in-law, was one. She forced him to resign. A blue-blood board replaced him. Ashton Hawkins, longtime counsel to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, became chairman. Lois de Menil, Philippa's sister-in-law, became vice chairman. Stephen Breyer, the future Supreme Court associate justice, joined the board. 
The foundation stopped collecting art. Dia's grand experiment seemed officially over -- like the era that produced it. 
Charles Wright, a lawyer from Seattle, son of an art collector, was hired as the new director. Wright admired artists like Judd and De Maria and became increasingly enamored of Friedrich's ideas, but the new board had its own plans. By the end of 1987, real estate and art sales had raised $17 million, and Dia was pointed in a new direction. Dia donated more than 150 Warhols to help establish the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh. It gave six Twomblys to Dominique de Menil's Cy Twombly Gallery. Friedrich had said Dia was a conduit. Now Dia's collection became the conduit for one-man museums that other people ran. 
Dia did keep a warehouse on West 22nd Street in Manhattan, with 38,000 square feet that was converted into spare, white exhibition space. In October 1987, it opened with a show of Joseph Beuys, Blinky Palermo and Imi Knoebel. Dia now would present changing exhibitions -- the opposite of what Friedrich had conceived Dia to do -- but at least the exhibitions would be kept on view forup to a year or more, unlike shows at other museums, which were stuck in the entertainment cycle of rapid change that Friedrich despised.
Meanwhile, the climate of the art world was changing. First the glamour of the 80's, with its marquee stars like Schnabel and Salle, made the asceticism of artists like Judd and De Maria seem fusty. After the art-market boom went bust by the early 90's, Dia's traditional stress on solitary geniuses, great men removed from everyday circulation and freed to pursue big dreams, seemed equally out of sync in a cultural atmosphere that prized egalitarianism and social engagement. Wright, now 48, keeping up with the times then and wanting to endorse the new spirit, explained that "people of my generation are looking for ways that the artist can come back down and plug directly into the social context . . . to make art more a part of a whole way of life and less of a removed, ivory-tower activity." He bemoaned the "cult of the individualism of the artist," and with Gary Garrels, then Lynne Cooke, Dia's curators, he programmed heavyweight symposiums and exhibitions by politically conscious artists like Jenny Holzer, Tim Rollins, Robert Gober and Group Material. Dia established itself as a serious and chic gallery, although attendance was dismal.
People looking back on Friedrich's days now talked about what had gone wrong. But plenty had gone right. Dia still had "Lightning Field," "Broken Kilometer," "Earth Room" and a collection in storage deep in certain artists -- dozens of sculptures by John Chamberlain, the 102 "Shadow" paintings by Warhol and many works by Flavin, Beuys, Palermo and Twombly. "The basic intent remained intact," Friedrich says. The original Dia had simply gone into hibernation.
What revived it -- and what led to the creation of Dia:Beacon -- was another bloody board shakeup. Having saved Dia from collapse, trustees seemed to have little energy left to raise more money, and Dia was still being kept afloat by selling property and art, which was self-cannibalism. After a decade as director, Wright resigned in June 1994, but stayed on the board to help pick Michael Govan as his successor and to support a new agenda. 
Govan, 39, is a dark, lanky, quietly ebullient man disposed to cowboy boots and black shirts. In keeping with Dia's artists and founder, he is a kind of megalomaniac, despite his aw-shucks manner. He came from the Guggenheim Museum, where he had been the smiling, calm, long-suffering front man who had to explain the museum's slippery finances and unconventional strategies. He first met Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim's notoriously audacious director, at Williams College, where Krens was director of the Williams College Museum of Art when Govan was an undergraduate. The two shared ambition and a passion for 60's and 70's art; after he graduated in 1985, Govan became acting head of exhibitions at Williams. Along with Krens and another Krens protege, Joseph Thompson, Govan helped to dream up the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, Mass MoCA, a gigantic museum in a complex of abandoned factory buildings in the depressed town of North Adams.
Then Krens left to take over the Guggenheim, and Govan took off to become a conceptual artist -- studying in California with 60's and 70's art icons like Allan Kaprow, David and Eleanor Antin and Helen and Newton Harrison. The experience was "formative," he says. Even so, when Krens called, Govan moved to New York. He was 25.
He seemed like a baby technocrat, only more easygoing and personable than his boss. He would look pained while defending the museum for cutting staff or closing the library, but he also spoke Krens's business-school jargon. 
Sometimes he, not Krens, seemed actually to be running the place. Besides helping to get Bilbao off the ground, Govan organized exhibitions, including a Dan Flavin show, and negotiated the purchase of Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo's collection of Minimal and Post-Minimal art (a collection Friedrich helped to put together years before). The Panza purchase, which caused a public firestorm because the Guggenheim sold valuable paintings to make it, was the sort of risky venture and large-scale commitment to the art of the 60's and 70's that, in retrospect, made Govan a logical choice to take over Dia. 
Despite the seeming symbiosis, in retrospect Govan had big differences with Krens that weren't apparent. Both were deal makers, but Govan's interests were more in art and artists than in fancy new architecture. He now speaks respectfully of his former mentor, who was hurt when he quit for Dia. "It was thrilling at the Guggenheim," Govan told me when I met with him recently at Beacon. Krens, he said, had lately arrived unannounced on his motorcycle, with the actor Jeremy Irons. Govan laughed. "On a day-to-day level," he added about his time at the Guggenheim, "nothing could possibly be as exciting as working for Tom." 
When he was appointed as Dia's director, Govan made pilgrimages to Marfa and to Arizona to see Turrell's crater. Lynne Cooke, Dia's curator, introduced him to Michael Heizer, and he visited "City." He reached out to Friedrich. He became the good son to several difficult fathers, like Heizer and De Maria, patiently giving them the sort of attention no one else did for years. Dia's board, lately expanded, now included Mimi Haas, heir to the Levi's jeans fortune; Ann Tenenbaum, whose husband is the venture capitalist Thomas Lee; Fred Henry, whose money came from publishing; and Anne Lannan. Her husband, Patrick, ran a $150 million foundation then supporting cutting-edge art.
Govan undertook a $12 million fund-raising campaign, which included a matching grant from the Mellon Foundation, $1 million if Dia could raise $5 million, a feat not even Mellon seemed to think Dia could pull off at the time. A rift opened on the board. To raise money, some trustees wanted to sell more property. They proposed unloading the building housing "Broken Kilometer." Govan threatened to quit. Wright, Haas, Henry and Tenenbaum supported him. They called for restructuring the board. Hawkins resigned. Others followed. 
The brouhaha dragged on for months as disgruntled former Dia trustees now lashed out in the media. They accused Govan's supporters of being social climbers, a curious accusation considering how marginal Dia remained in social spheres, notwithstanding that its annual gala had become fashionable. Meanwhile, Dominique de Menil, Friedrich's adversary in the first coup, joined the board. Wright became chairman. And, significantly, Leonard Riggio, chairman of Barnes & Noble, became a trustee.
Modern art's big patrons, if not arrivistes, are often newcomers, attracted by its argot and milieu. Dealers, artists and museum directors are happy to take advantage of their largess. Riggio, a rough-edged mass-market businessman, may seem the most unlikely devotee of cerebral and rarefied art -- until you recall that Judd, Serra, Turrell and Heizer are rough-edged in their own rights. In his office on lower Fifth Avenue, Riggio, now Dia's chairman, talked reverently one day about what he calls his "conversion": "When Jay Chiat asked me to join the board, I asked the question everybody asks: 'What is Dia?' He told me it had great parties. My epiphany came when I saw Serra's 'Torqued Ellipses.' I immediately got the idea of the single artist space, seeing art in its own environment. I just got the concept of Judd, Flavin and all the others without even seeing their work yet."
Riggio bought the Serras for Dia. "My real intellectual awakening had come in the 60's," he told me. "The big concept then was the integrity of the individual, the potential of every human being. When I built my business, I was thinking about bookstores for average citizens, for the whole of society. Then I went to Marfa and Roden Crater and visited Heizer in Nevada, and I thought these artists recognized the genius of the average American. Judd built his museum in a little Texas town. Turrell was hiring Native Americans from the area. Heizer was working with local people."
Meanwhile, Patrick Lannan, Dia's other big patron, spent millions to revive projects like "City," which until then seemed as if it might remain the most immense private folly ever conceived. Thanks to the injection of cash, after 30 years Heizer completed the first phase: huge dirt complexes rimming a vast, empty courtyard, in turn rimmed by massive mountains, whose silhouettes alert a visitor to the silhouettes of the massive structures Heizer erected. Then Heizer launched into the rest of "City."
Heizer's project, Riggio says, "represents humankind's highest aspirations, spending a lifetime on a single project, pouring every ounce of energy, his entire soul, whatever money he makes into it. One man building his own equivalent of the pyramids. It's incredibly beautiful. After all, what is art? That's the big question. 
"It exists at the intersection between the work and the viewer. Most museums are on an endless acquisitions binge. Their identity is defined by their architecture, and artists have to fit into the galleries. Dia has little institutional identity outside the projects we fund, and no objective except to sustain art on its terms."
That's the point of Beacon, he adds, which was, in fact, Govan's last alternative for a home for Dia's collection, still slumbering in storage. His first thought was to exhibit the art at Mass MoCA, the place he, Krens and Thompson concocted. Thompson ran it. But putting the collection there meant turning it over to another institution. Govan then looked into a building in Chelsea and also asked New York State about leasing a pier on the Hudson. The building fell through. Dia was told it might take a decade to get approval for the pier. 
At that point, Govan recalled piloting a small rented plane up the Hudson in 1998, accompanied by Lynne Cooke and the architect Richard Gluckman. They happened over the derelict Nabisco factory. "Michael, that's the building you want," Gluckman said. 
The factory sprawled beside railroad tracks that take passenger trains up from New York City. A long, low building on 31 acres with "Nabisco" in faded letters still visible from a passing train as a kind of pentimento just below the roofline, it turned out to require $1 million in environmental cleanup but had good bones. Riggio and Govan brokered a deal with International Paper, the owner, then got the state to contribute $2.7 million. (Beacon is Gov. George Pataki's neighborhood.) The acquisition and renovation took four years.
Now opportunistic developers, New York art dealers and a few public art projects, seeing how Dia became an anchor for cultural development in Chelsea, are already anticipating that people will make the hourlong pilgrimage upriver from the city, and they have been buying property, opening galleries and turning Beacon into an artistic boom town.
Govan gives me a tour of the factory in late winter, when the place is still mostly empty. He starts outside, pointing to where Robert Irwin, the artist, has planted rows of trees -- hawthorns, hornbeams and crab apples, still barren -- in front of the building to soften the mass of the facade. Irwin has also designed a formal garden on the side facing the river, mixing weeping hemlocks, cherry trees and Japanese barberries. Everything is simple and discreet. The focus is on the art.
An entrance to the building, also by Irwin, is a kind of Frank Lloyd Wright touch, akin to the entrance at the Guggenheim in Manhattan: a tight vestibule like a small compression chamber through which the galleries beyond look even more gigantic than they are. Inside, electricians and painters are puttering. Govan notices fluorescent lights overhead and fumbles with a light box before asking one of the workers to help turn them off. "They're just for emergencies," he says. "The natural light is plenty year round." With the overhead lights off, sun, pouring through row upon row of skylights, bathes the space and bounces off the maple floors. Most of the skylights are saw-toothed windows, some 25,000 square feet of them, facing north. Although austere, thanks to the light the building feels serene and comfortable. Riggio had told me: "When I saw what other people would describe as a wreck of a factory, I was blown away by the ribbons of north light. It's genius. The people who designed it may have wanted to cool the place in summer or light it for the printers, but I've dabbled in industrial psychology. This is a place that makes humans feel better for being there." 
Govan points to empty rooms. Here will go the Agnes Martins, he says, there the Warhols, there the Gerhard Richters, there the Darbovens and the Joseph Beuyses. (It is not just Americans at Beacon.) The choice of artists, as always at Dia, is idiosyncratic. Cooke, Govan's collaborator in installing Beacon, argued passionately for, among others, Louise Bourgeois, whose work will now occupy the attic, and for artists like Darboven, On Kawara and Robert Smithson. Several different-size galleries survey the paintings of Robert Ryman. The Warhol room alone is nearly as large as a floor of Dia's Chelsea gallery. The building is so big that its scale is deceptive. A passage between two huge galleries looks from a distance only slightly larger than a normal doorway, but up close it's clear you could drive a Hummer through it. 
Next Govan shows me the room for Kawara's identical gray canvases with a different date printed in block letters on each one. Kawara, like other artists, was invited to design his own space at Beacon, so he had the doorways at either end lowered and moved slightly off center and all the floorboards taken up so that a layer of ceramicized red-oak branches could be put underneath them. Govan tells me this is to ionize and purify the air in the room, "a traditional Japanese construction technique," he says. 
Serra's immense "Torqued Ellipses," cottage-size, walk-in steel sculptures weighing hundreds of tons already occupy what used to be the factory's train depot, which opens onto the formal garden. Wedged into a passageway nearby, if a space the size of a gynmasium counts as a passageway, Serra's "Union of the Torus and Sphere" resembles the warped steel hull of a beached ship, an ungainly, enigmatic container that cannot be entered, only circumnavigated. The placement in tight quarters stresses the work's mass.
And Heizer's "North, East, South, West" is embedded in a 150-foot-by-40-foot concrete floor on the opposite side of the building. The Heizer, a variation on a groundbreaking work he did in 1967 in the Sierra Nevada, consists of vertigo-inducing geometric holes cut into the concrete floor, made of Cor-Ten steel, in the shapes of a double square, a cone, a partial upside-down cone and a wedge. The holes are up to 20 feet deep. A glass rail will cordon off the work and limit visitors to a few at a time. But no barriers immediately surround the holes. To stare down into them requires walking right up to the unprotected edges and leaning over. It is thrilling and deeply alarming -- a little like standing on the edge of the Grand Canyon, I realize, which people also want to do for the view despite the danger, or maybe because of it. This kind of art, typical of Heizer's generation, aspires to a similar condition: call it extreme wonderment. To the inevitable question, How will he prevent people from falling in, Govan responds with a sheepish smile. Maybe bungee cords tethered to the walls, he says. He's not kidding.
Renovation costs for Dia ultimately exceeded $30 million, a hefty sum for a marginal nonprofit art foundation, which next will have to figure out how to pay for renovating its aging Chelsea site. Riggio and Lannan reached deep into their pockets, also coming up with millions for more art to put in Beacon. Counting the cost of Irwin's landscaping, Beacon came to under $100 a square foot. Bilbao topped four times that. Beacon is the anti-Bilbao: cheaper, a renovation to an old industrial building, not brand new; shaped by artists, not an architect; a harbinger, perhaps, of a straitened new century. Frank Gehry's spectacular building, the product of a booming economy, exemplified the go-go 1990's and inspired museums elsewhere desperate to mimic its novelty and civic attraction. Tom Krens's grand plan for the Guggenheim empire has been to open signature buildings around the globe, shuttling the same shows through them: Guggenheim branches functioning as spectacular shells, fancy containers sharing the same products. Another one, designed by Jean Nouvel, is slated for Brazil.
Dia:Beacon, although also grandiose, is the reverse: a permanent display of art in a space consonant with it. You could say the same thing about the affiliated projects around Dia, including "Roden Crater," Smithson's "Spiral Jetty," Heizer's "City" and De Maria's "Lightning Field." 
Touring Beacon with Govan, I notice De Maria in the twin main galleries, the first, cavernous rooms past Irwin's vestibule, each 100 yards long and about 13 yards wide. A virtual recluse for so many years that many people think he is dead, De Maria keeps to himself, as usual, declining to talk, instead arranging large circles and squares of cardboard on the floor, mock-ups of flat, polished stainless-steel sculptures. For weeks, De Maria has apparently been pondering minute changes in the placement of the sculptures in these vast rooms, shifting them an inch or less this way or that, his fixation with detail being the obsessive essence of Minimalism's paradoxically immense ambition. 
The only color in the building at this point comes from a couple of John Chamberlain's crushed-car sculptures. But a crew is now starting to unpack crates of Warhol's "Shadow" paintings: near-abstract variations on the same obscure image, many in Day-Glo hues. Govan, snowblind after staring at the same white walls for so many months, is elated. "I've been waiting for years for this," he says. 
I nod. Even so, the large empty rooms, the light and glass and peace and quiet, make the paintings seem almost like an intrusion. To get acclimated to Beacon is to become attuned to an aesthetic of plainspoken industrial spaces, simple forms and a kind of meditative silence that is the antithesis of the usual museum experience. It is a somewhat peculiar reaction to have to a museum. But then Dia has always been a most peculiar kind of museum.

Miami's Juicy New Lesson Plan

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
SOUTHERN Florida long ago surpassed Southern California as our leading landscape of cultural chiaroscuro, where depth is only an illusion. It's a place of "deep surface," to quote Terence Riley, the chief curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art. Like Los Angeles in the days of film noir, Miami is a state of mind divided between images of paradise and the abyss.
 Bernard Tschumi's new building for Florida International University here straddles this dichotomy with uncanny poise. The new Paul L. Cejas School of Architecture Building is a lesson itself. It shows that contemporary architecture becomes most vibrantly urban when it reveals a city's cultural tensions instead of trying to conceal them. 
 The campus is a few minutes from Miami International Airport, nine miles from downtown. It sprawls across the flat, green landscape typical of South Florida's privately developed residential communities. A thin layer of sod functions as a horizontal facade stretched over the land for the benefit of airplanes or visiting aliens.
The mind doesn't register this layer as nature. It is a lushly planted bed of weedkiller, perhaps, a genetically engineered facsimile of lawn. A thin veneer of design brings as much dignity as it can to the low shedlike structures spread over the grass, but a visitor remains dimly conscious that the land beneath the sod has a life of its own. Mud, sand -- what else could be down there? Chemicals, snakes, pre-Columbian burial grounds, the Fountain of Youth?
Running parallel to this disconnection of the ground plane from the earth beneath it, a sense of social disconnection haunts this sprawling cityscape. The Sunshine State image collides everywhere with Florida's actual identity as the nation's fourth-poorest state. There is no income tax. In consequence, there is no safety net. Amid bounty, insecurity yawns, the social equivalent of a sinkhole. This site of relentless extremes may be 21st-century America's authentic heartland, a place engaged in improvising the history of our time. What more could an architect wish for? A big budget, maybe.
Tschumi didn't get that. But he did get a fine location, a corner lot across from a car park. Evidently, the university wanted a showpiece but didn't want to pay for one. The financial restrictions paid off. Tschumi's scenographic effects are simpler. They are integrated more effectively, with one another and with the scale of the whole design. Economy of means has dictated an overall gain in glamour.
But maturity and experience also figure in the strength of this project. Tschumi has long identified himself as an architect of "events." As Tschumi has previously used the concept, it has carried unpleasant and contradictory meanings of social manipulation: like it or not, we must gather, pair off and disperse according to pseudospontaneous patterns regulated from above.
Here Tschumi appears to be following a more useful insight. The most important events in society take place in the inner world. They're not about moving bodies around in urban space (that was the Baroque ideal) but about moving minds in and out of changing human relationships. When to connect with others, when to disconnect from them? Building the contemporary city is an art of setting flexible boundaries.
Tschumi brings to the project his own considerable experience as dean of Columbia University's school of architecture, a post he will leave this spring after 15 years of distinguished service. On the basis of this building, I'd say he's ready for graduation.
It consists of four separate three-story structures that are organized in three parallel rows. Two long slabs define north and south perimeters of the site. Sandwiched between them are two boxy pavilions, separated by the void space of a shaded courtyard.
This arrangement adheres, in typical "deconstructionist" manner, to the building's programmatic structure. Faculty offices occupy one slab; the other houses classrooms. The courtyard and pavilions serve both academic and extracurricular purposes. A gallery is located in one box, a small auditorium in the second. The tripartite articulation of functions results in a plan of surprisingly classical symmetry.
Predictably, Tschumi chips away at this perfectly composed order with features that throw it off balance. Each elevation is different, for example. The facade facing the entry road is a wall of solid glass that frames the single, double-height drafting room where studios are located. It's a sleek, elegant surface of undiluted simplicity.
The facade facing inward toward the campus is almost a throwaway: a wall of precast concrete panels punctuated with regularly spaced punched windows. Stumpy lintels above the openings screen the blinding Florida light.
Bright splashes of red, orange and yellow, enameled onto metal plates, enliven the walls of the two pavilions, leading the eye inward toward shade. They alternate between solid areas of pigment and pixilated stretches that bring to mind the computer software with which the building was designed. Ground becomes figure.
Tschumi has often used red as a signature motif, a tiresome branding exercise. The same Commie color greets you along the frontage of the school. Seeing it, I winced. Time for a new logo! The orange and yellow don't come into view until you proceed through the courtyard. As with the denatured grass, you may sense that the orange is the artificial color of frozen condensed juice, an abstract version of the fresh roadside-stand variety once available here.
The other colors may evoke prepackaged condiments. Ketchup and mustard. Suddenly, you are standing on the same plane as McDonald's. Abstract food; abstract art; abstract digitized information: the denaturalization of life is at once a great American virtue and a constant source of terror as the ground of reality drops ever farther away.
The building's most outstanding feature is the porosity of the boundaries between indoor and outdoor spaces. Loggias, balconies and terraces ring the courtyard. A grandly scaled outdoor staircase ascends from it to a party space on the top level of the auditorium pavilion. Like the famous "stairway to nowhere," a device employed by Morris Lapidus in the lobbies of his Miami Beach hotels, Tschumi's stair serves more to aggrandize space than to ease circulation.
The drafting room is a temple to architecture, as noble a workspace as Crown Hall, designed by Mies van der Rohe for the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. Its boundaries, too, are made porous, by an overlooking mezzanine and by the expanse of glass. Bare concrete walls; exposed ducts: the luxury here is space.
A stand of palm trees makes a second outdoor room. Seminar rooms are naturally lighted by walls oftranslucent glass. The nice details go on. The strength of the design, however, rests on the skill with which Tschumi integrates them.
Tschumi has at last allowed intuition, instead of theory, to guide the design process. That's why graduation time is here. Theory can serve contemporary architecture only to a point. Beyond that lies orthodoxy. The Tribalistas, a musical group from Brazil, put it this way: "We're not here to be right. We're not here to be correct. We're here to be the basis of new construction."

Americans Are Looking For Faraway Havens

BYLINE:  By By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO 

 BODY:
ON the warm, white sands of Ipanema beach, the troubles of the world seem very far away.
 "I just didn't want to think about war or terrorism or anything else," said Christine Potter of Chicago, lolling on the fabled beaches of Brazil in late February after canceling a skiing trip to Europe, which was just too close to the world's major trouble spots for her taste. "On a map, I figured that Brazil was about as far away from Baghdad as I could go." 
 Many travel agencies around the country say there is a clear and probably unsurprising trend among Americans considering a trip overseas this year: they want a destination that is as far removed from war and terrorism as they can get. 
In an otherwise grim year for the global tourism industry because of the Iraq war and continuing terrorism threats, that means a glimmer of hope for foreign destinations that in the past might have been considered too remote for American travelers. Now remoteness -- even obscurity -- can add to a destination's appeal.
"A lot of people are talking about the South Pacific because it's so isolated from all the trouble," said David Shepherd, manager of Northside Travel in Berkeley, Calif. "Certainly, we're not doing any bookings to the Middle East."
The number of Americans going to Europe and the Middle East has been down sharply since the attacks on Sept. 11. The situation worsened in the weeks leading up to the war with Iraq, with the Air Transport Association, the airline industry trade group, reporting that trans-Atlantic bookings were off 40 percent in the week before the United States began its assault on Iraq, compared with the week before. 
But the drop has been far less severe for other historically less popular foreign routes. The trade group says that airline reservations between the United States and Latin America were down only 8 percent during the comparable period in March.
Argentina, where a currency collapse has turned the country into a huge bargain for visitors, reported that tourist arrivals were up 40 percent in the first two months of the year, compared with those months last year, with 11.8 million foreign visitors. (Tourism was way down in the comparable weeks of 2002 because of public protests linked to the economic strife.)
Tourism officials in neighboring Brazil say that despite their country's continuing problems with drug violence and street crime, it is benefiting from the realization among Americans that Brazil is far away -- geographically and culturally -- from the parts of the world associated with sand-choked battlefields and terrorist camps.
"There is enthusiasm about Brazil, and safety is definitely a factor," said Maria Helena Dunne, manager of the tourism office at the Brazilian Embassy in Washington. Ms. Dunne said she had received inquiries from two American travel agencies in recent weeks about shifting business to Brazil.
The Brazilian government still has not compiled its full travel statistics for last year, but the numbers are in for South Africa, and that country also appears to be profiting from the fears of American and other Western travelers. 
Overseas tourism to South Africa grew by 20 percent last year, with 6.4 million visitors. Arrivals from North America grew by about 10 percent, to about 590,000 last year.
Foreign visitors flocked to South Africa even though, by other standards, the country is not especially safe. Although the murder rate has dropped sharply in recent years, violent crime is still rife in large cities; the State Department's travel advisory for the countrywarns that crime is so common that "it is perceived to be a significant threat to the country's overall stability."
Ian Meltzer, executive director of Tourvest, a travel company in South Africa, said that for many travelers, the definition of safety changed after the Sept. 11 attacks, and that it is now something other than a measurement of the crime rate. "A safe destination has since been defined in terms of its propensity for terrorism," he told the South African newspaper Business Times.
Australia, which combines remoteness with safe streets, did not benefit so dramatically from its reputation as a haven from terrorism; there was a slight decrease in the number of overseas visitors to Australia last year. But tourism in neighboring New Zealand boomed, with foreign visitors up 7 percent in 2002 from the year before, topping two million for the first time.
While American tourism to Southeast Asia has been hit hard by terrorist threats, especially after the deadly bombing last October on Bali, other Asian nations had hoped to benefit this year from the arrival of American travelers putting distance between themselves and troubled lands. 
Both China and Vietnam, where central authoritarian governments have made sure that foreign terrorist groups do not take root, had appeared to be on track for large tourism gains this year. But that hope has faded in the last month with reports of the spread of a deadly respiratory illness that is being called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. 
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged Americans to postpone elective or nonessential travel to Hong Kong, the Guangdong province of China, and Hanoi. Airlines flying to China and Vietnam have reported a sharp drop in reservations since.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/the Setaukets; 
A Historic Area For Rising Buyers

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
SETAUKET and East Setauket fit almost seamlessly together, joined by a ZIP code, their common history and a place within the Three Village School District, generally regarded as one of Long Island's top public school systems. Surprisingly, though, for a place with a sure historical sense of itself, the boundary line between the two incorporated areas in Suffolk County's Brookhaven town is hazy to many. 
 Some say Route 25A is the dividing line and call everything north to Long Island Sound Setauket. Others reject this, and say the line is farther south. Still others say parts of East Setauket are north of 25A. In the end, the border seems impressionistic. "You can't win on this one, and you can't lose either," said Beverly Tyler, a local historian. 
 The historic center, more certain, is the remnant of a village green where the Battle of Setauket was fought in 1777. Patriot forces, using a boulder for cover, fired artillery at British solders and Tories holed up in the Setauket Presbyterian Church, which the British had converted into a fort. The attackers, part of a force of 500, fled when word reached them that British reinforcements were on the way. 
The original church is gone, but its replacement still stands by a preserved remainder of the once spacious green. The boulder, left by a retreating glacier, is partially hidden by woods on nearby private property. All are within the Old Setauket historic district, which also includes a nearby mill pond.
The three Village Historical Society will hold a walk-through history tour of the entire old Setauket historic district on May 31. Admission is $15 per person or $22 for a family. Local residents in period costumes will play the parts of historical characters. 
Both Setaukets are in the Three Villages, which historically encompassed the Setaukets with unincorporated Stony Brook and the village of Old Field. But now the name is also frequently applied to cover additional communities within the Three Village School District.
The Setaukets housing market is characterized by single family homes, a wide range of housing styles, many larger homes on large lots and moderate to high prices. 
Anthony P. Vitale, the owner of Coach Realtors in Setauket, said homes tend to be beyond the reach of most first-time buyers. "This is a second or third home area," he said. "People are not coming fresh out of college; they are coming with the value they got out of another home they sold." 
Mr. Vitale said prices had gone up about 10 to 20 percent from a year ago, with the highest increases near the water, but now appeared to stabilizing at the highest levels ever. With the economy slumping, he said: "We expected to see a little bit of a decline, but surprisingly they are holding their own. It's never been a seller's market for this long a period of time."
He said the market showed the changed mind-set among buyers of means stung by stock market losses. "Right now, people only feel comfortable putting their money one place, and that's a home," he said.
Maria Gac, a sales agent at Prudential Long Island Realty in Setauket, said the area attracted young families moving up from surrounding areas like Centereach and Port Jefferson Station and also from Nassau County and the city.
IN areas north of Route 25A, the most desirable and sought-after part of the Setaukets, colonials, ranches and a scattering of small to quite large cottages are almost uniformly valued above $650,000.
Less expensive ranches and colonials are generally in southern areas in East Setauket closer to the chronically congested Nesconset Highway, Route 347. The road divides the Setaukets from another area aspiring to the Setauket name, South Setauket.
While older houses and historic sites still anchor the northern reaches of the Setaukets, there have recently been incursions by new development crossing northward over Route 347 into East Setauket. The Lakes at Setauket, a 317-unit gated condominium whose lakes are artificial, is a prime example. Two-bedroom units sell in the $350,000 to $400,000 range.
Cynthia Barnes, a community activist who moved into a cottage in Setauket in 1969, said that the area, while "still a beautiful place," was threatened by overdevelopment. Ms. Barnes is a director of the Civic Association of the Setaukets and headed a citizen task force laying out proposed improvements for the Three Village area. "The town codes are full of loopholes, and seasoned developers and their lawyers have been able to weave their way through the system," she said. 
She said local control could improve when the town switches from at-large election of Town Board members to a councilmanic system approved by voters last year. The new system assures one council member comes from northwestern Brookhaven. 
The Setaukets are close to the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and a small number of houses used to be available for rental by students. In a the last several years, however, most of those houses have been sold into the rising market. Monthly rentals for the houses still available range from a hard-to-find lows of $1,800 up to about $4,000.
The university and the adjoining Stony Brook University Hospital are leading employers. The university alone, on a 1,200-acre campus abutting the Setaukets, has more than 1,600 faculty members for more than 20,000 graduate and undergraduate students. 
More than a few faculty and hospital employees, as well as scientists and employees of the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, reside in the Setaukets. The university's Staller Center for the Arts brims with exhibitions and performances open to all.
The Emma S. Clark Memorial Library, opened by the Setauket village in 1892 and expanded three times since the 1960's, is another cultural resource. It is Suffolk County's oldest public library operating continuously at its original location. Shelves hold more than 250,000 books, periodicals, audio-visual and software items.
The Three Village School District is a far-flung district that includes Setauket, East Setauket, Stony Brook, Old Field, Poquott and parts of South Setauket, Port Jefferson, Port Jefferson Station, Head of the Harbor and Lake Grove.
THE district has five elementary schools for kindergarten through Grade 6, two junior highs for Grades 7 through 9 and Ward Melville High School in East Setauket for Grades 10 through 12. There are no prekindergarten classes. 
District enrollment is 7,960 and rising, with growth greatest in secondary schools. Enrollment was about 7,600 a year ago and 6,870 10 years ago. It peaked at more than 10,000 students in the early 1970's. "Now we are on the way back up," said John Sonedecker, the district superintendent. A just-completed building project added to five elementary schools and the high school. Planning is already beginning for more additions, if needed.
Dr. Sonedecker attributed the rise to new residential construction, a turnover bringing more families with children into the district and the draw of the state university. The school district, of course, is the leading attraction for many families.
About 97 percent of the 475 graduates in the Class of 2002 went on to higher education, with 73 percent enrolled in four-year colleges or universities. About 73 percent of the graduates earned Regents diplomas. 
Ward Melville High School's reputation for strong academics shows in scores on the SAT reasoning test. Averages were 555 in verbal and 568 in math.National averages last year were 504 in verbal and 516 in math. The state averages were 494 in verbal and 506 in math.
Last May residents rejected a proposed $113 million school budget that would have raised the school tax rate by nearly 14 percent. The budget passed on a second vote with the increase just under 10 percent.
The district has a full array of advanced placement programs, computers galore, a reputation for a strong music program and top students' success in state and national academic competitions.
FOR high achievers, there is a science research program in the high school. Dr. Sonedecker said programs for children with special needs were recognized nationally for excellence. He said an early literacy program in elementary schools put heavy emphasis on reading and writing.
The Setaukets offer eye-pleasing vistas of Conscience Bay, Setauket Harbor and the mill pond, and have many woodsy stretches, but they seem somewhat shy on public open spaces and beaches. Residents must drive west to the hamlet of Stony Brook to reach a Brookhaven town beach on Smithtown Bay open to all town residents.
North of Route 25A, benches at the five-acre Frank Melville Memorial Park look out on the mill pond from under trees whose trunks are tattooed with carved initials. Nearby, there are walking trails on a 20-acre sanctuary leased to the Three Village Garden Club by the Frank Melville Memorial Foundation. The garden club also maintains a five-acre arboretum there.
To the south, where public spaces are few, St. George's Golf and Country Club in East Setauket, a country club established in 1917, has an 18-hole golf course that is for members only. Many members are from the Setauket area.
Shopping is plentiful but at a respectful distance. Except for commercial areas along Route 25 and Route 347, the nearest downtown concentration is in old Stony Brook village, where boutiques, shops, restaurants and businesses are clustered in and around the crescent-shaped village center. The Smith Haven Mall, which has nearly 1.4 million square feet of retail space and more than 160 stores, is about three miles west on Route 347.
Rail commuters to the city, a fairly rare breed some 60 miles east of Manhattan, use the Long Island Rail Road in Stony Brook or drive about 20 minutes to the Ronkonkoma station. 
The name Setauket is a corruption of Setalcott, the Indian tribe from which settlers from New England and Southold purchased some 30 square miles in 1655. Setauket was the first settlement in the town of Brookhaven and the first seat of town government. Shipbuilding along Setauket harbor east of the old village center gave rise to the name East Setauket and thrived in the early to mid-19th century.
Piano making and a rubber factory followed, and by the late 1800's, when the railroad arrived, the area became a summer resort. Slack times after World War I lasted past World War II. By the 1960's and 1970's, the area had exploded with new housing.

Abraham Woodhull, known by the code name Culper Senior and a direct descendant of an original Setauket settler, managed the ring, gathering information himself and from other spies, including Robert Townsend of Oyster Bay, whose code name was Culper Junior. What Woodhull deemed worthy of Washington's attention, he sent by whaleboat across Long Island Sound to the general's headquarters in Westchester. Caleb Brewster, a Setauket patriot officer stationed in Connecticut, was the courier. It is said that Woodhull learned when and where Brewster's whaleboat was waiting by the way Anna Smith Strong hung her laundry on Strong's Neck. A black petticoat meant Brewster was near. The number of handkerchiefs told in which one of several shoreline hiding places his whaleboat waited. As president, Washington visited Setauket in 1790, spending the night in an inn and tavern kept by Austin Roe, another Culper ring member. The inn, moved from its original location, survives on private land. Map of Setauket on Long Island.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Hotels; 
Bookings Are Down, but Properties Keep Opening

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
DESPITE a decline in bookings attributed to economic softness and the uncertainties of the war in Iraq, hotel operators have been showing confidence in the future of travel to New York by opening new projects and refurbishing older properties.
 "You have to take the long view," said Vijay Dandapani, the chief operating officer of Apple Core Hotels, a privately owned company that operates five hotels in Manhattan. "A downturn is a good time to do construction projects." 
 One such project is a $2.5 million refurbishing of the lobby of the building at 17 West 32nd Street, which was designated as a La Quinta Inn last December, after being operated for several years as a Best Western. It is the only outlet in Manhattan for La Quinta, a midprice chain based in Dallas. 
A few large hotels have opened since attacks of Sept. 11, including the Westin New York at Times Square, with 860 rooms, and the W Hotel Times Square with 509 rooms, but most have been smaller projects. These include the Hotel 41 at Times Square, 206 West 41st Street, which has 47 rooms, and City Club at 55 West 44th Street, which has 65 rooms.
"It is a tough environment right now, with bookings slowed to a crawl and cancellations up 20 to 30 percent" since the beginning of the war, said Sean Hennessey, director of the New York hospitality practice for PricewaterhouseCoopers, an accounting and consulting firm. "But New York will come back."
According to NYC & Company, the city's travel and promotion operation, some 2,100 hotel rooms have been added since the attack on the World Trade Center, either through renovation or new construction. Projects already under construction are continuing and those in the planning stage appear to be proceeding as well, said Christyne L. Nicholas, the group's president. "I have not heard of a single cancellation" of a project, she said. 
The reopening of the 561-room Millenium Hilton at 55 Church Street, now scheduled for May 1, will bring back into service the last of the hotels temporarily closed because the Sept. 11 attack, she said. The attack led to the closing of 1,528 rooms in all. 
She said most promotional efforts are aimed at attracting visitors from no more than 500 miles away -- a distance considered close enough for a family to drive.
INTERNATIONAL visitors are not considered good prospects while hostilities continue, although the city may benefit from American travelers who decide they do not want to visit Europe this year, she said.
One foreign market that is being subject to serious promotion, however, is Japan, in connection with sporting events, Ms. Nicholas said. The presence of the slugger Hideki Matsui, a former home run leader in Japan, on the Yankees is one lure. A planned preseason game between the Jets and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Tokyo on Aug. 1 may whet Japanese appetites for football. "It makes sense to try to lure the Japanese," she said.
The falloff in visitors to the city since the war began follows the pattern of the Gulf War in 1991, she added, although not so badly thus far. The occupancy rate is currently just below 70 percent, while in 1991 the rate fell below 60 percent, according to Ms. Nicholas.
Most executives say it makes sense to complete projects that are under way, despite the drop in occupancy and advance bookings. The Westin Times Square, which is part of the E-Walk development of Tishman Realty & Construction, opened last October with 400 of its 860 guest rooms ready for occupancy. The hotel will be fully open by the end of the month despite "a temporary but not insignificant drop in call volume," said William J. Sales, the president of the Tishman Realty Corporation, a management unit of the parent company. 
He said changes in the neighborhood of the hotel, which is at the corner of 43rd Street and Eighth Avenue, had altered the mix of visitors from what was expected when Tishman signed the lease for the site in 1996. "We have had a lot more corporate visitors than we originally planned," he said. 
Since the Durst Organization announced the plan to build what is known as 4 Times Square at the northeast corner of 42nd Street and Broadway, Times Square has become a magnet for large corporations. These include the publisher Conde Nast, the anchor tenant at 4 Times Square, along with Reuters, the news and financial information company, and Ernst & Young, the accounting firm.
"We have 5 million square feet of office space in the area now," Mr. Sales said. "It was part of what we hoped for the future, but it was not in place at the time."
ANOTHER project that is going forward is the Gansevoort, a 13-story 187-room hotel that is under construction at 13th Street and Ninth Avenue, in an area that was best known for its meatpacking operations. "We will be topped out by the end of April," said Michael Achenbaum, a principal of WSA Management Ltd., the developer of the project.
He said the area, which retains remnants of its industrial past,is "one of the most interesting in the city, like SoHo was in 1990." He said construction during a slack period was less costly than when business is booming and said the opening this fall might be timed to meet an upsurge in travel.
"We don't build at the height of the cycle, so we can expect an upside," he said. The hotel, whose distinctive feature will be a 45-foot outdoor pool on the roof, will be operated as a high-end boutique, with a basic room rate of about $300 a night. It will be managed by Henry Kallen, who developed such boutique properties as the Giraffe and Library hotels. 
Mr. Achenbaum said Mr. Kallen was chosen because of his emphasis on service for guests. "Service is very important in a high-end boutique hotel," he said, "We want people to come back."
The barriers that must be surmounted before building can proceed in New York are so formidable that anyone who has overcome them has an incentive to push a development to conclusion, said hotel industry consultants. "From the original concept to completion of a hotel is a least a two- to three-year process," said John A. Fox, a senior vice president of PKF Consulting, which specializes in hotels. "So we will see the opening of anything that is in the pipeline."
Mr. Dandapani of Apple Core Hotels said the purpose of the lobby remodeling at the La Quinta Inn is to give business travelers the same sort of feeling that they would have at the 350 or so other hotels in the chain. This is a more challenging task in a 1904 building with a landmarked exterior, however, than with a new building in the chain's home markets in the southwestern United States.
To add to the impression that everything is up to date, despite the Beaux-Arts facade with its columns and keystones, Apple Core is installing a wireless Internet access system that will be available free to guests, he said. "It is like the free continental breakfast we offer," Mr. Dandapani said. "It is for the business traveler who wants to do his work, have breakfast and get going."
The property was built as the Aberdeen Hotel, a residential hotel, at a time when the Herald Square area was the city's leading entertainment district. Over a century the bright lights faded and the neighborhood became best known as a home for crime-filled welfare hotels, including the notorious Martinique at the corner of 32nd and Broadway.
The Martinique is now a Holiday Inn, and the neighborhood is now home to a large concentration of Korean restaurants and stores. "What a difference 10 years makes," Mr. Dandapani said. "When we took control of the property in 1993, it was a single room occupancy place with a few transient guests. Now it is very safe with a lot of nighttime activity."
He said that despite the current downturn, Apple Core is building a La Quinta Inn near McArthur Airport on Long Island to take advantage of the chain's ties with Southwest Airlines, which uses the airport as an entryway to the New York market.
"People have written New York off time and again," he said. "But they always come back."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey; 
Refinancing Fever Also Strikes Commercial Owners

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN 

 BODY:
JUST as homeowners are being blitzed by e-mail offers to refinance their homes at "50 year" and "all time" low rates, commercial real estate property owners are also being pitched offers that once would have seemed too good to be true -- and seizing on them.
 "We closed on two refinancings this week," said Alexander von Summer III, managing principal of the Parsippany real estate firm Alexander Summer, which owns commercial property all over New Jersey. "We have another one just about to close. There are another two properties where we are looking at refinancing. 
 "The interest rates truly are at a historic low, and this is the time to harvest opportunities," he said. "Everybody in real estate that I talk to, if there is any opportunity to secure a mortgage, they're pursuing it." 
The Gale Company, based in Florham Park, closed last month on a huge refinancing, gaining it a reduction of two percentage points on the rate of interest on a mortgage covering 37 properties, mainly in New Jersey. The $418 million mortgage is for the Bellemead portfolio, purchased in 1997 from Chubb Insurance in partnership with UBS Paine Webber and Morgan Stanley. 
Negotiating over 18 months with the original lender on the purchase, the General Electric Capital Corporation, "we entirely recast the loan," said Gale's president, Mark Yaeger. The mortgage was extended for three years, at a floating rate tied to various economic indices, he said; he did not disclose the current rate.
Mr. Yaeger said Gale was considering an additional step to keep the interest rate down -- one that is not generally available to a homeowner with a floating rate mortgage. "We are contemplating acquiring a couple of interest rate caps," he said. "Those are insurance policies that protect from an unforeseen spike in interest rates."
Jon Mikula, a senior director with the commercial real estate finance company Holliday Fenoglio Fowler, an Edison-based firm that acts as an intermediary for commercial property owners in arranging financing, noted that rates have crept up a bit over the past couple of months. But, he added, "They are still ridiculously low."
Fixed-rate financing that locks in a low interest rate for an extended time continues to be the best option. So, why are many companies pursuing floating-rate loans? "Generally, because they have to," Mr. Mikula said. "They have a mortgage coming due, and they know interest rates are not expected to rise rapidly for at least a year, so they go with the lowest rate available now, realizing they may have to refinance again when rates go up significantly."
Mr. Mikula said he had refinanced his home three times in the last 20 months, starting with adjustable-rate loans, because "I don't expect to be there all that long, and the rates were better," and most recently obtaining a 4 percent fixed-rate, seven-year loan because "that's an amazingly good deal."
Mr. Mikula said there is a "bubble" of three-to-five-year floating-rate loans coming due now, loans that were taken on properties that had substantial vacancy rates at the time of purchase by buyers who believed they could turn that around. But many commercial property owners found that impossibleamid exceedingly sluggish market conditions in the past 18 months. Nationwide, Mr. Mikula said, approximately $12 billion in floating rate loans on commercial property is coming due in 2003.
"Some companies in New Jersey bought buildings that were 50 percent leased with a game plan of trying to stabilize the property in three years -- and now it's three years later, and unlike Gale's scenario, there has been no leasing," he said, "The property is still 50 percent vacant."
Mr. Mikula said those property owners would face "a challenging time" attempting to refinance their properties.
On the other hand, he said, companies that have made successful turnarounds of commercial properties are welcomed at mortgage bank "swap desks," where floating-rate mortgages can be converted to fixed-rate, and vice versa. Denholtz Associates of Rahway, a firm that focuses on purchasing properties it can improve and lease up, for example, was able to refinance five properties valued at $90.5 million in the last year.
IN Newark, the Heritage Management Company announced it had recently refinanced the mortgage on an office building at 550 Broad Street -- purchased only 18 months earlier -- after renovating the building and increasing its occupancy from 50 percent to 90 percent.
Heritage Management bought the 282,000-square-foot building for $20.5 million in June 2001, putting up $2 million in equity and taking a three-year acquisition loan at 6.86 percent interest for $18.5 million, said Heritage's president, Steven M. Greenberg. When an offer to purchase the refurbished leased-up building came in at $38 million last fall, Mr. Greenberg said, Heritage decided to hold onto 550 Broad instead of selling -- and to borrow at a better rate against the property's increased value. 
Heritage refinanced the mortgage for $27 million at a rate of 6.6 percent with the Bank of New York, Mr. Greenberg said, and took $2 million in cash away from the deal. "The refinancing allowed our company and investors to realize the full benefits of an effective turnaround at the property," he said.
Mr. Mikula said he continuously gets calls from property owners with older fixed-rate mortgages who would like to refinance, but who worry that prepayment penalties -- known as yield maintenance penalties by lenders -- make it a bad idea. "But if you do the math, and roll over the penalty and the balance, cash flow increases significantly," he said. "Refinance really becomes a no-brainer." He offered the following hypothetical case to illustrate:
"Let's say you have a property which had a $10 million debt on it, purchased eight years ago. For a 10-year loan with 25-year-amortization, a good rate at that time was 8.5 percent, which would give you annual debt service of $965,000 and a loan balance of $8.7 million.
"In order to refinance, you will have to pay the yield maintenance penalty to the original lender to provide him with the return he would have gotten if you stayed with him. You calculate this by looking at alternative investments he might make with the money -- Treasury notes, more often than not. The difference between the mortgage interest on $8.7 million, and $8.7 million invested in treasuries paying 1.8 percent, is $1.1 million," over the two years left on the original loan.
"You might say: '$1.1 million! That's 12.8 percent as a prepayment penalty!' 
"But if you take the $8.7 principal balance, plus the $1.1 million penalty, for a total balance of $9.8 million, and you get a new 10-year loan, with 30-year amortization, and a 6 percent interest rate, your new annual payment is -- holy cow! -- only $705,000." With an annual saving of $260,000, the prepayment penalty would be covered in less than five years.
Alternatively, Mr. Mikula added, if his hypothetical owner wanted to keep his annual debt service at $965,000, he would be eligible for a mortgage loan of $13.4 million at 6 percent -- and could legally take the $3.6 million extra that was borrowed tax free. The $1.1 million prepayment penalty might be tax deductible as well, he said, if claimed as interest payment. 
But maybe, Mr. Mikula said, that course of action does not work for a particular property owner. Perhaps, refinancing a year or two from now makes more sense. In that case, the lending specialist said, it is possible to "block in a forward permanent loan." In other words, a commercial owner can obtain a commitment from a lender for a loan at today's rates that will be activated a year or two down the line.
"Most lenders are comfortable with blocking in 12 to 18 months," he said, "and in some cases, 24 months."
Also, stepped-down prepayment penalties are available, Mr. Mikula said, so that if a borrower refinances within the first year of a loan he pays a certain percentage as penalty, a lower percentage the second year, and so on. "This is so darn smart for property owners," he said. "Once the payment drops, then you close on the new loan."
Mr. Mikula says he tells clients to pore over their portfolios, analyzing every prepayment opportunity and seeking any possibility of obtaining a locked-in low rate of interest on a new loan.
Mr. von Summer quoted his advisers as saying, "Take on all the debt you can right now." Alexander Summer is currently buying out a long-term ownership partner for a warehouse in Carteret. The partner, an individual investor who is engaged in estate planning, sought the buyout, according to Mr. von Summer. The company is happy to proceed, he said, since it was able to secure a nine-year loan at just a fraction over 5 percent. "With interest rates like these," he said, "it's definitely win-win."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 29, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about an industry and government group that is marketing commercial space in New Jersey for use as emergency backup offices misspelled the surname of the president of the Gale Company, which is part of the consortium. (The error also occurred on April 26 and on Jan. 23, 2000.) He is Mark Yeager, not Yaeger. 
The article and the picture caption also misidentified the town in which space has been leased for a backup facility. The building is at 125 Chubb Avenue in Lyndhurst, not Florham Park.

HEADLINE: Executive Life; 
Captains of Industry Still Yearn for Yachts

BYLINE:  By PHIL PATTON 

 BODY:
THE assets of L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive of Tyco International, have been frozen as he awaits his trial in September on charges of enterprise corruption and grand larceny. But exceptions have been made.
 Justice Martin Shulman of New York Supreme Court agreed that the crew of the Endeavour, Mr. Kozlowski's classic racing yacht, had to be paid. So he unfroze $200,000. 
 The judge ruled that Mr. Kozlowski cannot use the yacht himself without the court's permission, but you can: the Endeavour is available for charter at $22,000 a day, plus a $5,000 a day delivery charge, crew included. The Endeavour has been steadily booked, said Marcia J. Whitney, who supervises the yacht for its chartering company, J-Class Management in Newport, R.I. "She's in Antigua right now."
Its availability offers a rare opportunity for the merely wealthy to experience the ultimate plaything of business tycoons. The yacht turns captains of industry literally into captains and gives substance to their sometimes swashbuckling image. It also provides an escape from the pressures of the job, and from the news media.
The Endeavour, a 130-foot yacht that was launched in 1934, has become perhaps the most striking example of Mr. Kozlowski's wealth. It was to the Endeavour that he retreated after his legal problems became public, and where he held a wine-tasting party on the Fourth of July. Ever since he bought it in 2000, the yacht overshadowed other trappings of his privileged position in corporate America -- his Nantucket estate, Sea Rose farm, with its $5 million, 7,000-square-foot mansion set on 3.8 acres by the sea; his retreat in Boca Raton, Fla., which people close to the company said was paid for with a $19 million no-interest loan from Tyco that was later forgiven; his residences in New Hampshire and Manhattan; even the infamous $2 million birthday party he threw for his wife in Sardinia, featuring waiters in togas and an ice sculpture replicating Michelangelo's "David," from which Stolichnaya flowed into crystal glasses.
As status symbols, yachts have had their rivals for the affections of the barons of American business and banking. In the 1890's, they were eclipsed by a land equivalent, the private rail car. J. P. Morgan enjoyed his yacht, the Corsair, but said he was never so happy as when crossing the Continental Divide in the shower bath of his rail car.
More recently, the private jet topped the list. In 1998, Nathan P. Myhrvold, then the chief technology officer of Microsoft, waxed eloquent in the pages of Vanity Fair about the pleasures of a customized Gulfstream V private aircraft, for which he paid $38 million.
But, over time, nothing has matched the mystique of the yacht. In his 1999 book, "Luxury Fever: Why Money Fails to Satisfy in an Era of Excess," Robert H. Frank, a Cornell economics professor, placed the return of the yacht ahead of mega-mansions, private jets and luxury S.U.V.'s as a manifestation of 1990's conspicuous consumption. Total sales of yachts -- pleasure craft of more than 100 feet in length -- more than doubled from 1988 to 1998. Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, played to the free-spending image when he named his yacht Aquasitions.
Though their appeal is universal, yachts seem to have especially captivated Americans. According to Professor Frank, they own about half the 5,000 yachts on the planet. Yachts can have hot tubs and fireplaces, gyms and even basketball courts; they can desalinate seawater and pump the Internet through fiber-optic networks. Maintaining a yacht and paying its crew runs from about $750,000 to $2 million a year.
High-technology stars are among those who have bought yachts. In 1996, Lawrence J. Ellison, co-founder of the Oracle Corporation, treated himself to a $10 million, 192-foot, five-deck yacht, renamed it the Sakura and outfitted it with a teak deck, a chrome-and-white living room and an onboard gym.
And James H. Clark, the founder of Silicon Graphics and a co-founder of Netscape, built his computerized dream boat, the 155-foot sloop Hyperion, which has its own digital network, 22 touch-screen displays and 30,000 pages of blueprints in its memory to ease repairs at sea.
DUTCH shipping merchants of the 17th century are credited with creating the yacht as a pleasure ship. The first notable American yacht, according to the social historian J. C. Furnas, was built in 1816 for the merchant George Crowninshield Jr., who, evoking an ancient precedent for pleasure craft, named it Cleopatra's Barge.
Cornelius Vanderbilt, the 19th-century shipping and railroad magnate, built a sumptuous steam yacht, the North Star, in 1853. It was lined with rosewood, satin and silk and set off on a tour of Europe the same year.
The Endeavour's innovation was the quadrilateral genoa, a new type of sail, providing its speed. Its creator was Sir T.O.M. Sopwith, who built his fortune in World War I aviation. The Sopwith Camel fighter, built by his company, downed the Fokker of Baron Manfred von Richthofen -- the Red Baron -- and was the airplane flown by Snoopy in his "Peanuts" doghouse dreams.
After World War II, the Endeavour was nearly scrapped as the fortunes of its subsequent owners declined; it was bought at one point for $:10 by two carpenters. In 1984, Elizabeth E. Meyer, an American yacht restorer and broker, bought the hulk and had it rebuilt at the Royal Huisman Shipyard, the Dutch yacht yard where Mr. Clark's Hyperion was also built and where Peter the Great of Russia once worked incognito.
Ms. Meyer sold the refurbished boat, with a new cherry deck and working fireplace, for an estimated $25 million to Mr. Kozlowski in 2000. "You better charter now, because after the trial he'll take her back," she said.
Through his lawyer, Stephen E. Kaufman, Mr. Kozlowski declined to comment for this article. But at the time of the purchase, he was effusive. "No one truly owns Endeavour," he declared with unaccustomed modesty. "She's a part of yachting history. I'm delighted to be the current caretaker."

HEADLINE: Private Sector; 
An Antiwar Chief (and Proud of It)

BYLINE:  By AMY CORTESE

 BODY:
ALAN KLIGERMAN is the first to say he has had good fortune. He has prospered as an entrepreneur, he says, and appreciates the rights he enjoys as an American.
 "I am for this country," he said in an interview last week. "Nobody should misinterpret that." 
 In that assessment, he hardly stands out among the ranks of corporate executives. But he has distinguished himself in one particularly contentious way: he has been a vocal and unrelenting critic of President Bush and the war in Iraq.
Despite the prominent role that business executives have played in shaping debate on other matters of public policy, from deregulation to tax cuts and labor law, remarkably few have publicly expressed an opinion about the war, either for or against.
Fred Talbott, a professor of leadership communication at Vanderbilt University's M.B.A. program, says chief executives in particular often have perspectives that can be valuable in a national debate.
"Business and other leaders," he said, "seem to be reluctant to speak out at all." The reasons, Mr. Talbott and others say, include a fear of offending their company's shareholders and customers, and of being publicly labeled unpatriotic.
As the founder and chief executive of his company, AkPharma Inc. in Egg Harbor Township, N.J., Mr. Kligerman shrugs off such concerns. He built a small empire creating digestive aids like Lactaid, a brand of milk for people who cannot digest lactose, or milk sugar. He also developed Beano, an enzyme that breaks down the complex sugars that can make beans hard to digest.
He sold the rights to both of those products years ago, though AkPharma makes versions of Beano and Lactaid for pets, as well as several new antacid products, including Prelief, for people.
"The U.S. is a land of unbelievable, unparalleled upward economic mobility for the entrepreneur," Mr. Kligerman said. "That is something I truly appreciate."
Mr. Kligerman was born in Atlantic City and worked in his parents' dairy business near there, delivering milk to customers.
After studying dairy science at Cornell, he started an ice cream delivery service in the late 1950's and later founded a low-sugar ice cream company called SugarLo. From there, he moved into nondairy ice cream and then lactose-reduced dairy products; that business became Lactaid Inc. in 1974.
At the same time, Mr. Kligerman raised five children with his first wife. He is now married to Donna Battista, a pianist, and has seven grandchildren.
Through the Kligerman Foundation, of which he is chairman, he has contributed to nutritional research and other philanthropic causes.
But while praising the United States, Mr. Kligerman does not hesitate to speak out against the Bush administration. He contends that its policies, particularly involving the war in Iraq, are tarnishing the worldwide image of the United States as "a haven for the oppressed, a place of free speech, free thought and free yet governed economic growth."
Mr. Kligerman, who will turn 73 this month, protested the Vietnam War in the 1960's. He supports the Anti-Defamation League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
He supports Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, a nonpartisan group of business executives and former military officers who contend that the government's spending priorities, particularly involving the military, do not address the nation's most pressing needs.
Mr. Kligerman's name has appeared in antiwar advertisements that the group has run in newspapers and magazines to warn that war in Iraq will not only take a terrible toll in human life but will also hurt the economy and breed terrorism.
In addition, he has given speeches and written op-ed essays criticizing government positions on the war, energy policy and civil rights. Most of all, he has lamented what he calls the hubris that characterizes the Bush administration.
In debates about the war in Iraq and the country's domestic and foreign agendas, such views are not uncommon. What is unusual is for a business executive to express them as publicly -- and as often -- as Mr. Kligerman does.
He acknowledges that it is easier for him to speak his mind because his company is small and privately owned. Leaders of large, publicly traded companies, on the other hand, generally find it too risky to take a stand on the war -- for or against.
The few who have made their feelings known have been harshly rebuked. Richard Abdoo, the chairman and chief executive of the Wisconsin Energy Corporation in Milwaukee, for example, was pilloried as un-American by talk-radio hosts and criticized in an editorial in The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel after he made a private $250 donation last November to the Not in Our Name Project, a group opposed to the war. Mr. Abdoo's name appeared on the group's Web site, as did the name of his company.
A spokesman for Wisconsin Energy said Mr. Abdoo was trying to put the episode behind him and would not comment on it.
Unlike Hollywood celebrities or other public figures who have been openly critical of the government, corporate executives have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders that makes it difficult to separate personal actions from official duties. Not surprisingly, most of the executives who have taken a public stance on the war have been from small or private companies, or are retired.
One notable example is R. Warren Langley, one of dozens of antiwar protesters arrested in mid-March trying to disrupt the Pacific Stock Exchange. Mr. Langley, a former Air Force lieutenant colonel, was president of the exchange from 1996 to 1999.
Mr. Kligerman said he had received no negative reactions to his public comments -- and had no second thoughts about making them. "The Bush administration does not embody America," he said. "America to me is not a country that suddenly suspends constitutional rights, imprisons without charge, without access to legal counsel or family."

HEADLINE: HOME FRONT; 
What the Economic Indicators Miss

BYLINE:  By Anthony DePalma 

 BODY:
BACK in his day, former Mayor Edward I. Koch used to stroll the streets of New York City asking "How'm I doing?" It was one way of evaluating his administration, but it gave only a partial picture of what was really going on in his city. 
 It is the same with other measures. Analysts like to quote straightforward numbers like the gross domestic product or the Dow Jones industrial average when they talk about progress. But while such indicators say much about the overall health of the economy, they say little about daily life in a city like New York or about the people like Memon Ahmed who live here. 
 Mr. Ahmed, 36, came to New York from Bangladesh 19 years ago to lead a life that, on the surface at least, conforms to the American dream. He is a banquet waiter in a Manhattan restaurant and he and his wife, Shanjida, own their one-family house in Queens, where they live with their two young children. 
By the standard economic measures of our times, the Ahmeds are doing well. But those indicators miss the part of their story that matters most. 
New York's banquet business has been hit so hard by recession that Mr. Ahmed takes home only a third of the $1,000-a-week salary he was getting two years ago when he worked at Windows on the World, the restaurant atop the World Trade Center, destroyed in the Sept. 11 attack. High heating bills over the winter devastated his household budget, and he has fallen several months behind on his mortgage payment. His wife needs to see a gynecologist but cannot because Mr. Ahmed does not have medical insurance. 
"I used to make good money; I was a spender," Mr. Ahmed said. "But now it's very difficult."
So while some people may watch the Dow Jones average andother economic indicators, Marc Miringoff, director of the Fordham Institute for Innovation in Social Policy, takes a slightly different approach. The problem is not that the Dow and other indexes reveal nothing about the well-being of a society, he said, "It's just that they represent a narrow view of national progress." 
To bridge the gap, the Fordham Institute, in Tarrytown, N.Y., and part of Fordham University, has put out an annual report since 1987 that takes the pulse of the nation by looking at the well-being of its people.
The Fordham index examines an array of social indicators -- including infant mortality, child poverty and health insurance coverage -- and then calculates a single composite number, tracking it over time. The index goes back to 1970. 
Until 1976, social health kept pace with economic progress. Since then they have diverged, with gross domestic product continuing to rise as social health has declined. Mr. Miringoff says he thinks this reflects a change in job composition. Solid blue-collar jobs with stability, ample benefits and salaries sufficient to support a family have been replaced by jobs with relatively weaker salaries, fewer benefits and less stability. 
That transformation has contributed to some troubling situations, Mr. Miringoff said. For example, while the national unemployment rate hit its lowest point in 31 years in 2000, average weekly wages have also declined. That means more family members must work to pay household bills. Or, as in Mr. Ahmed's home, where his wife cannot work, bread and beans take the place of chicken and meat in family meals.
Others who study issues of poverty agree: the standard indexes do not reflect "a significant number of New Yorkers who were not earning enough to survive on their own," said David Campbell, vice president of the Community Service Society of New York, an advocacy group for the poor. The working class poor, he said, have become practically invisible. 
Other trends that Mr. Miringoff considers troubling include big increases in child poverty, teenage suicide and the percentage of workers without health insurance, all problems worsened by low incomes. Making matters worse, he has found that income inequality is growing in several states, including New York, which has a bigger gap between rich and poor than any other state. 
Mr. Miringoff said when prosperity in the United States is measured in traditional terms, the picture is less disturbing than if people like Mr. Ahmed are taken into account. When working-class people are included, he said, it becomes clear that "we have a lot of people who are playing by the rules and simply not making it."

HEADLINE: Into the Fray 

BYLINE:  By STACEY STOWE

 BODY:
THE new director of the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art wants the institution, the nation's oldest public art museum, to play a central role in the American art world.
 "The Wadsworth has to matter to Hartford, the region, the country," said Willard Holmes, who has been deputy director and chief operating officer of the Whitney Museum of American Art since 1994, and was named the Wadsworth's director on March 20. 
 Mr. Holmes, who will begin his new post on May 1, has as much experience in the financial and administrative side of running a museum as he does in the curatorial aspects of the job. These are skills that he will surely require. 
Last December, the museum was awash in turmoil. Its director, who had served just over two years, had announced her resignation, and its board chairman and four board members abruptly quit. At the same time, its multimillion expansion and renovation plan was facing criticism that it was too expensive and did not address many of the museum's most pressing problems.
"There's no doubt there is a lot of hard work and difficult decisions ahead in the short and long term," said Mr. Holmes, 54, during a recent visit to the museum to meet with staff members. 
In Hartford, the state's poorest city and one long on urban woes and short on substantial cultural offerings, the Wadsworth is nonpareil. In addition to its world-renowned Hudson River School paintings, the institution houses a collection of impressive depth and scope, ranging from Old Masters canvases to contemporary work. The museum is the unofficial headquarters for the area's financial elite; the machinations of its board and staff are a favorite topic of the chattering classes.
Patrick McCaughey, who was director of the Wadsworth from 1988 to 1996, and is now a senior research fellow at the Yale Center for British Art, said a major challenge for Mr. Holmes would be satisfying the expectations of its board and staff.
"I don't know of any other art museum of which there is such an enormous expectation of what the museum can be and what it can do, from its staff to its board members, while having such an extraordinarily slender base of resources to do it with," Mr. McCaughey said. By "resources," he said he meant finances.
With his bow tie, shaven head and round eyeglasses, Mr. Holmes, has the air of an Oxford don. A native of Canada, he has degrees from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, and specializes in 20th-century art. He was director of exhibitions and a curator at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, and chief curator and later director of the Vancouver Art Gallery. At the Whitney, his main responsibility was to direct a $50 million expansion project. 
The most visible aspect of Mr. Holmes's new job will be steering the Wadsworth's expansion and restoration plan, projected to cost $120 million, of which $62 million has been raised so far.
The plan, unveiled in June 2002, was proposed by the Dutch architect Ben van Berkel, a member of a team of finalists for the design of the new World Trade Center. Under the plan, access to the museum would be improved, and gallery space increased.
But the proposal has been called too expensive in this economy and too ambitious for Hartford. In addition, its critics say, the project does not address problems that have long plagued the museum, like the lack of a loading dock, and sufficient parking and storage space. Critics also complain that the increase in gallery space is not enough.
"I still feel I need to get a sense of the physical structure and listen to staff to determine program needs before I speak on specifics," Mr. Holmes said, when asked about these issues.
The museum is scheduled to close for two years during the renovation, which is supposed to begin in 2005. But Mr. Holmes said that during this time, it "will not disappear from view."
"I didn't come to Hartford to run a museum that is closed," Mr. Holmes said, suggesting that some of the collection may be loaned to other local spaces, but declining to elaborate.
The closing of the museum would coincide with the opening of Adriaen's Landing, a convention and entertainment center that is part of the $1 billion Hartford redevelopment project. The Wadsworth, which is across the street from the site, has been touted by Gov. John G. Rowland and others as the "gateway" to Adriaen's Landing.
One of Mr. Holmes's most daunting tasks will be to unify the museum's 33-member board. Christopher Larsen, who is acting as the museum's interim director until Mr. Holmes takes over, is also temporarily serving as board chairman.
Mr. Larsen replaced George David, the president of Hartford's United Technologies Corporation, who resigned in December when he did not receive unanimous support on a proposal to keep decisions on personnel issues within certain committees. Several board members wanted the full board to learn more about the departure of the then-director Kate M. Sellers, who announced her resignation last October, citing personal reasons.
Does Mr. Holmes think Mr. David, who gave millions to the museum, can be replaced and harmony restored?
"Any museum needs an approach that focuses on the constellation, not on the stars," Mr. Holmes said. 
Mr. Holmes has four children, ranging in age from 20 years to 20 months. He said his wife, Mary Haus, who has been the communications director at the Whitney, will concentrate on "homekeeping" when the family moves to the area. They plan to live in Farmington, and are negotiating to buy a Modernist home on the same street as Harry Gray, former chairman of United Technologies and a local philanthropist. Mr. Holmes would not disclose his new salary.
Mr. Holmes offers few specifics of where he will take the museum. But he emphasized that it must be "essential."
"This institution clearly has a place in the hearts and minds of so many," he said.

HEADLINE: At Tracks, Wagering on More Than Dogs 

BYLINE:  By GAIL BRACCIDIFERRO

 BODY:
WHEN he takes a client to lunch these days, David Fallon has to drive farther from his small manufacturing plant in Plainfield than he used to do. 
 "In the early days, when the dog track was booming, we had more restaurants here," Mr. Fallon said, referring to the commercial and industrial district just off Interstate 395 near Plainfield Greyhound Park. 
 When crowds jammed the park to gamble on the dogs, he said, business boomed for the nearby restaurants, gasoline stations and grocery stores.
Now, those looking to gamble are most likely heading south from Massachusetts through rural eastern Connecticut on their way to the Foxwoods or Mohegan Sun casinos, which are about a half-hour drive from Plainfield. 
"People don't realize there is a lot of trickle-down effect," Mr. Fallon said of the businesses that once thrived from dog track customers.
Mr. Fallon said that is one reason he joined a group of residents, local business owners and state and municipal officials who support proposed legislation that would allow the greyhound track to diversify. 
Under the proposal, dog tracks in Plainfield and Bridgeport would be able to offer high-stakes bingo and keno games. 
The General Assembly is weighing the merits of the proposal, which was made by State Representative Michael A. Caron, a Republican who represents Danielson, Killingly, Sterling and part of Plainfield.
"The point is to diversify what the tracks already offer because when they want to adapt their business, they must change the law," Mr. Caron said.
As part of the plan, some of the money from the bingo and keno proceeds would be funneled to economic development efforts in Windham and Tolland counties in northeastern Connecticut.
In a region where many towns have not regained the industrial bases they lost when textile mills along the Quinebaug River began closing decades ago, a plan aimed at luring customers back to the track appears to be attractive to many.
The proposal would not only assist new businesses trying to locate in a region where poverty is not uncommon, but it would also keep the 200 employees at the dog track working, Mr. Caron said. 
While Mr. Caron's proposal has received the most attention from fellow legislators recently, other proposals aimed at allowing the track to offer other types of gaming are also pending in the General Assembly. 
In January, a group of eastern Connecticut veterans sought legislative approval to operate high-stakes bingo at the track. 
William Colonna of Scotland, who heads the group, Let's Help a Vet, said his organization had moved bingo and food preparation and vending equipment to the track in anticipation of setting up business. 
But now, since the group does not expect to receive authorization to run bingo, that equipment was removed last month.
Mr. Colonna, however, has not given up. "I'll put that bill in every year until I drop dead," he said.
Another legislative proposal calls for a high-stakes bingo operation at the track with proceeds funneled to the Rocky Hill veterans' home and hospital. 
Senator Anthony Guglielmo, a Republican of Stafford Springs, who co-sponsored Mr. Caron's bill, said the legislative proposals would have two purposes.
"Thetracks are hurting," he said. "And, we're trying to do a little something for the veterans."
But the proposals are likely to face stiff opposition. 
State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal warned legislators in February that proposals like Mr. Caron's could violate the state's compact with the Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan Indian tribes, which annually add about $400 million to the state's coffers. 
According to the compact, as long as Connecticut bans commercial gambling, the tribes must pay 25 percent of their slot machine proceeds to the state.
Mr. Colonna said the veterans would challenge any entity that might receive state authorization to operate high-stakes bingo.
"I dare them to give a permit to anyone," he said. "It would discriminate against the veterans."
Many legislators, including Representative Jefferson Davis, a Democrat who represents Brooklyn, Eastford, Hampton, Pomfret and Woodstock, oppose the proposals to allow additional types of gaming at the tracks.
"This state, like all states, looked to easy money like gambling rather than take a closer look at how we raise and spend money," he said. "The greyhound park has had its run. It's just like any other industry. I'm not convinced we should keep it going."
In fact, attendance and wagering at the greyhound park began to decline almost as soon as it opened in January 1976. Statistics from the Connecticut Division of Special Revenue that oversees gaming in the state show that attendance and the amount wagered at the Plainfield Greyhound Park peaked in its first full fiscal year of operation.
From July 1, 1976 through June 30, 1977, the dog park had nearly 1.5 million customers who wagered $125.3 million, the division's statistics show. The park maintained an annual attendance of 800,000 to 900,000 from 1980 through 1986, the year the Mashantucket Pequots opened high-stakes bingo. 
Attendance and wagers continued to decline through the late 1980's and fell even more after Foxwoods Resort Casino opened in 1992. 
Between July 1, 2001 and June 30, 2002, the statistics show that the track had 117,171 customers who wagered $14.6 million.
Several calls were made to officials at the greyhound park, but there was no response.
First Selectman David C. Allard of Plainfield said he would like to see business at the track retained. The park is No.8 on the list of the town's top taxpayers and paid more than $124,000 in property taxes last year.
"The dog track has been an integral part of this community," Mr. Allard said. "They have been a good neighbor and assisted in charitable donations and local projects."
Although Mr. Allard said he and many others in Plainfield want to see the track thrive on its 82-acre parcel near Interstate 395, there are now signs that the town is also attracting other types of business development.
Ground is expected to be broken this spring for an $80 million Lowe's distribution center that will bring 400 to 500 new jobs to town, he said. Tax revenues from the center could top $1.5 million when incentives expire, he said.
"Plainfield has had a history of bad luck stories," Mr. Allard said. "But it seems to be turning around."
Stephen Dugas owns an industrial park building as well as a travel plaza that includes a gasoline station, convenience store and fast-food restaurant just off I-395 near the dog track. He developed the travel plaza after demolishing an old house at the site in 1998.
"Business has been growing here," Mr. Dugas said. "Now, we have an option on another property here."
If permits are secured, the 2.5-acre site will be the new home for a 65-unit Super 8 Motel, he said. The motel chain was interested in the location because of its easy highway access and location not far from the casinos, he said.
Mr. Dugas, however, did say he would still like to see more of the gambling stay in Plainfield.
"The best thing that could happen is to diversify at the dog track," he said. "A lot of people travel out of town to work now."

HEADLINE: L.I.@WORK; 
Nathan's Builds on Its Core Product, Hot Dogs

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
AS a boy growing up in Nyack, N.Y., Wayne Norbitz worked after school, on weekends and during the summer at the Wetson's chain of roadside snack bars owned by his family. In 1975, his family sold the chain, which by then numbered 70 outlets, to Nathan's Famous, and Mr. Norbitz went to work at Nathan's flagship Coney Island restaurant, founded in 1916
 Nathan's moved from Coney Island to Manhattan in 1970 and stayed for 19 years in offices on Broadway. In 1989 the company moved to Westbury, and that same year Mr. Norbitz became president. 
 With a convert's zeal, Mr. Norbitz, now 54, has helped maintain the restaurant's quirky charm, based as much on its Nu Yawk chutzpah as on its all-beef hot dogs and other prototypical fast-food treats. Company research shows that more than 95 percent of New Yorkers recognize the Nathan's name. 
Despite its heritage, Nathan's, whose shares trade on the Nasdaq exchange, has fallen on hard times of late. Over the last four quarters, it posted a net loss of $12.6 million. It also closed nine of its 16 company-owned restaurants and reduced the number of franchised restaurants from 377 to 351. And the company struggled to find ways to revive two struggling subsidiaries acquired in 1999, Kenny Rogers Roasters and Miami Subs. 
Referring to 2002, Mr. Norbitz said, "I know this year does not look like a good year."
So, is Nathan's in trouble?
"Absolutely not," Mr. Norbitz said. "The way we have repackaged, reprogrammed and reinvented ourselves is very successful." 
Although he acknowledged that the company's 2002 financial performance seemed to indicate the reverse, Mr. Norbitz insisted that the red ink reflected compliance with new corporate accounting rules instituted this year.
For example, he said, the company handled the proceeds of a $900,000 property sale to the State of Florida as operational revenues. This was the proper method according to standard accounting procedures, Mr. Norbitz said, but the one-time influx of cash made subsequent sales totals seem smaller by comparison. 
Nathan's acquired both Kenny Rogers Roasters and Miami Subs in a plan intended to expand its geographic reach and product mix by buying companies whose value had decreased in recent years. The plan has had mixed results.
The Kenny Rogers Roasters chain, which the company bought out of bankruptcy court, has been the more successful turnaround project, Mr. Norbitz said. Although Nathan's has closed all but a handful of the Rogers restaurants in the United States, the chain is flourishing in Asia, where a Malaysian company has opened about 90 restaurants there and in the Philippines. 
The Kenny Rogers signature roast chicken and several other menu items live on in the United States, thanks to what the restaurant industry calls co-branding, a strategy in which one retailer pays a licensing fee in order to sell brands other than its own. 
When Nathan's Famous added Kenny Rogers rotisserie chicken to its menu, customers chose Rogers over the house brand, Mr. Norbitz said. So now Nathan's is phasing out its chicken items in favor of Rogers versions. The company is pursuing a similar co-branding tack with seafood, replacing its own line with Arthur Treacher's products, brands owned by the Trufoods Corporation in Lake Success. 
"We thought that people placed high value of the quality of Kenny Rogers chicken and some of the side dishes," Mr. Norbitz said. "Now when you order chicken, the menu doesn't just say, 'chicken sandwich,' it says 'Kenny Rogers Roasters chicken sandwich.' When you order fish, you get Arthur Treacher's."
The Kenny Rogers products cost 5 to 10 percent more. "We thought that there was price elasticity, that customers would be willing to pay more for this brand," Mr. Norbitz said. "We were right."
Miami Subs has presented a tougher problem. Nathan's has closed 26 Miami Subs, leaving about 200, according to Global Foodservice Newsletter. The chain, which in strong in south Florida, as the name implies, sells cheese steaks, chicken wings, hamburgers, gyros and similar items. "You could say it's been a disappointment," Mr. Norbitz said. "We're looking carefully at Miami Subs in an attempt to improve sales and profits. But we have no specific plans."
Despite the closings, sales at the chain have been falling, a situation Mr. Norbitz said was associated with the economic problems caused by Sept. 11. "Tourism in South Florida is way down, and that's hurting us greatly," he said. 
Most of Nathan's business still involves hot dogs, and its real growth has been selling them in some 6,000 supermarkets and warehouse clubs. "That business is doing exceptionally well," Mr. Norbitz said, and it increased by more than a third from 2001 to 2002. 
Mr. Norbitz's challenge is to increase Nathan's business without losing its heritage or allowing it to turn into a nostalgic sand trap.
Customers from the New York metropolitan area tend to associate Nathan's hot dogs with their own growing-up. "In focus groups, people would express emotion when talking about Nathan's, especially about the hot dogs," said Don Raskin, the president of the Manhattan Marketing Ensemble who has worked on Nathan's advertising account since 1990.
"Nathan's has a cultish appeal to its customers," said Mr. Raskin, who lives in Jericho. "Nathan's isn't like McDonald's. In fact, it's completely unlike McDonald's, from start to finish. You don't get the feeling that you're in a fast-food chain. It's less predictable. It's more personable. It's friendlier."
Last year Chock Cafe, a division of the Sara Lee Corporation, signed a co-branding agreement with Nathan's that so far has been paying off, said Gerry Pelissier, the vice president for franchising at Chock Cafe, which traces its roots to the Chock Full o'Nuts luncheonettes founded in Manhattan in 1932. Now both companies sell their products at each other's locations.
"Their heritage is similar to our heritage, and they seem a good fit with our cafes," Mr. Pelissier said. "We get more of a breakfast crowd, and they get a lunch crowd, so the products play off each other well. They seem to be trying to reposition themselves as a premium hot dog. We think that's great, as we're positioning ourselves as a premium coffee."

HEADLINE: A Deal Too Good to Be True? Well, Yes 

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
WHEN local developers heard last month that the State of New York had put 370 acres of the former Kings Park Psychiatric Center on the auction block, many of them marveled, though warily, at the $2.5 million asking price.
 The figure, by anyone's estimation, is remarkably low for such a large property on Long Island's North Shore. But prospective buyers don't even have to get to the fine print in the state's offering documents to discover that although the property may be the largest piece of undeveloped real estate in the Town of Smithtown, it has a host of drawbacks. 
 Put aside the covenant to preserve open space that limits development to only about 90 acres of the property, the estimates for environmental cleanup that run upward of $34 million, and the well-known opposition to major development at the site from Patrick Vecchio, the town supervisor who essentially controls zoning for the property. As discouraging as those factors might be, the one thing that has stopped most developers in their tracks is that the state might not even own the property. 
A long-forgotten clause in the 1895 deed for the property, which was drawn up when the state officially received the property from what was then the "City of Brooklyn, County of Kings," essentially states that the land reverts to Kings County if and when the state stops using the property as a mental hospital. Kings County had originally bought the land and opened an asylum for its residents along the rural North Shore in 1885. The deed ceding the land to the state says the property must be used "forever solely for the use of a state hospital for the insane." Since Brooklyn is no longer a city and Kings County is now part of New York City, a letter to potential developers from the state reads, "The property is subject to a reversionary interest by the City of New York."
Vincent Polimeni, a Garden City developer who put together a preliminary bid for the property when it was first offered for sale in 1999 and was later taken off the market, said he wasn't interested in bidding this time. "If the state doesn't have clear title to it, then they're wasting their time," he said. "Because, in essence, they're selling nothing since they don't own it."
Ronald Parr, a Suffolk County developer who is considering making a bid for Kings Park, noted that bidders must submit $250,000 as a down payment on the property. "So if you're lucky or unlucky enough to be the successful bidder, you'd have $250,000 tied up not knowing whether you actually owned it and whether you should spend a dime on it," he said.
When asked about the property, officials from Mayor Bloomberg's office, from the city's Economic Development Corporation and from Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz's office, didn't know where Kings Park was, much less that the city might have a legal claim to the property. City officials were also unaware that the hospital and hamlet of Kings Park were so named because of the connection to Kings County. But given the city's looming budget deficit of more than $3 billion, they said that, at first blush, an unexpected windfall, no matter how small, might be a welcome surprise.
State officials, said, however, that they hoped to settle the problem of the reversion clause quickly. "We're working to resolve that with the city," said Alexander Dudley, a spokesman for the Empire State Development Corporation, the state agency handling the sale. He said the city could legally waive its claim to the property or state legislation might be needed to give the property to the state once and for all. "We're in the process of reaching out to the city, and we hope to have fruitful negotiations," he said.
Given all the problems that come with the site, developers said they thought it was unlikely that the city would actually want to take possession of the property. But they pointed out that the city is now in a position to bargain with the state, perhaps to claim part of the sale proceeds or for something that might have nothing to do with Kings Park.
"Considering the state of the city's financial affairs, I can't imagine that Mayor Bloomberg would be cheering the state on here," Mr. Parr said. "But even if the state has other things to negotiate with, it's certainly not a very good start for the sale of this property. Who knows when it will be resolved?"
The deed dilemma is but the latest obstacle to the redevelopment of Kings Park, the last of three major psychiatric centers on Long Island to be sold. Plans to sell the property have strained relations between the state and town officials. Town leaders accuse the state of reneging on promises and pushing to sell the entire parcel, even if such a sale might hurt the local community. State officials have urged town leaders to be more flexible, since strict limits on redevelopment make the property virtually unmarketable.
Since Kings Park was closed in 1996, several studies on its reuse have been done, and the state has put it up for sale several times but has ultimately canceled each auction. In 1999, it was because the state parks department wanted to examine the site as a possible state park, and more recently it was because of insufficient interest from bidders. In 1999, the state subdivided the parcel, which was originally 567 acres, and created the Nissequogue River State Park, a 153-acre state park on the waterfront piece of the property. The state plans to keep about 30 acres of the property to maintain a nursing home, two adult homes and a nine-acre cemetery.
The number of patients at each of the three psychiatric hospitals on Long Island started to dwindle in the 1970's when the state decided to move the mentally ill from psychiatric hospitals to community-based residences. But while Kings Park and the Central Islip Psychiatric Center were both officially closed in 1996, Central Islip has already been redeveloped with housing, commercial buildings and a golf course. Pilgrim State Psychiatric Center in Islip maintains a mental hospital for about 1,200 patients on a small piece of the original campus, but Gerald Wolkoff, a Brentwood developer, plans to build a $4 billion complex of offices, restaurants, shops and apartments on the remaining 460 acres. Mr. Wolkoff paid the state $20.1 million for the 460 acres. Central Islip was developed in pieces over the years, but the most recent sale of a 44-acre parcel brought the state $2.2 million. 
The comparisons leave Kings Park leaders asking why the sale of their 370-acre property keeps stalling and why the state is offering the property at a fire sale price. The town assesses the value of the property at about $33 million.
"Central Islip was almost a carbon copy of Kings Park, right down to the buildings and the layout," said Charles Gardner, president of the Kings Park Chamber of Commerce. "Demolition and contamination could be no better or worse here than at the other hospitals, so why is it such a flash point for Kings Park and why are there all these barriers to something happening here?"
Desmond M. Ryan, executive director of the Association for a Better Long Island a developers' group, said Kings Park is different because it is not as centrally located and accessible to freeways as Central Islip and Pilgrim State. He also said that site remediation is a bigger problem at Kings Park because the state started demolishing and burying unused buildings in the 1970's, leaving about a million square feet worth of building debris that is laced with asbestos and lead-based paint. So in addition to paying for the demolition of the 46 existing and abandoned buildings on the property, a developer would have to clean up the buried debris as well.
He said the asking price for Kings Park is also low because without the waterfront property, developers have lost the potential value of waterfront homes. Mr. Ryan also said that unlike Smithtown's supervisor, Pete McGowan, the town supervisor in Islip, welcomed new development in his town. "If Pete McGowan were supervisor of Smithtown, you would the development community lined up to find a workable solution," he said. "But in Smithtown, it's almost impossible to do business."
Mr. Vecchio, the Smithtown supervisor, said that the town in recent weeks has been "inundated with calls from developers asking what we would allow there." He would like to see the property turned into parkland with some limited development like a corporate center or housing for older adults. His main concerns, he said, are that traffic and the number of children added to the school district be kept to a minimum.
With at least $34 million in environmental cleanup costs and development limited to 90 acres, he said, "it's clear that no one can develop that without expecting lots of density to make up for the cost." And Mr. Vecchio made clear that zoning changes to increase density would not be forthcoming. "Anyone foolish enough to purchase that land is taking a huge risk because I don't think whatever town board is sitting is going to allow intense development," he said.
Mr. Polimeni said Mr. Vecchio's vocal and adamant opposition was the main reason he has decided against bidding for Kings Park. "I've fought enough battles on Long Island, and I know if Pat Vecchio doesn't want it, it's not going to happen," he said. "You've got to be brain dead to go after it."
Town leaders say that the state's plan to sell off all the property at once and to require a developer to handle the cleanup would solve the state's problems at the town's expense. Mr. Vecchio has said repeatedly that if the state cleaned up the contamination that it has caused over the years, a less intrusive development plan would be feasible for the property.
"The state wants to get rid of everything because it just doesn't want the problem anymore," said Frank DeRubeis, the town's planning director. "But why should we rezone this for a higher density use to basically help the state out with cleanup costs, especially when we're going to have to bear the burden with whatever the final use is?"
But Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, said when Kings Park was put up for sale, "by offering to sell this site to a developer who will be required to comply with local zoning laws and the stringent open space requirements demanded by Gov. Pataki, we ensure that job growth does not come at a cost to the local community or the environment."
Many town officials and residents would like to see development at Kings Park to mirror Central Islip, where the property was cleaned up and redeveloped one piece at a time over a period of more than 20 years.
That was why residents and business leaders embraced a plan offered earlier this year by Lynne C. Nowick, a Suffolk County legislator who proposed turning one of the larger buildings at Kings Park into a county office building that would house administrative offices for about 400 county workers. She said her plan would cost about $21 million and could be financed through the county's Judicial Facilities Authority. She said state officials visited the building to consider her plan but since the proposed sale includes the building, the state is clearly not committed to it.
"I have no intention of giving up on this though, because it makes sense," she said, adding that if Kings Park is sold, she would negotiate with the new owner to acquire the building for the county.
Greg Szurnicki, president of the Kings Park Civic Association, said most residents want to see some redevelopment at the site because the closing of the hospital devastated the hamlet's economy when it took away hundreds of workers who regularly shopped and ate in the downtown area. "I know some people want it to be a park, but we can't afford a park unless we have an income and a tax base," he said. "What good is a park if the town folds up?"
He also said that the state's desire to sell off all of the hospital property ignores the long interdependence between the state and town created by the hospital. The state, for example, has not addressed the $800,000 it now pays to the local school district each year as part of an agreement that goes back to the 1920's. The state started making contributions to the school system back then because many hospital workers lived at the hospital with their families and sent their children to local schools.
"If the property is sold for $2.5 million, the tax receipts from it would go down to $50,000 and that shortfall could mean $800 a year more in taxes per homeowner," Mr. Szurnicki said. "But the state doesn't care, it just wants to sell the property as is, where is, and how is."
John J. Flanagan, a state senator from East Northport, said he was confident a balance could be struck to satisfy the concerns of the town and of developers.
"But there's going to have to be strong cooperation from the town, because limiting development to the 50 or 80 homes that would be allowed under the current zoning isn't going to work," he said. 
He and Michael J. Fitzpatrick, an assemblyman from St. James, have said they would work to keep the state subsidy coming, at least until a new development was completed and could pay its share in local property taxes.
Many local officials say that the unanswered question of who actually owns the Kings Park property is emblematic of the state's haphazard approach to the site. Mr. DeRubeis said town officials learned about the reversionary clause about two years ago when some local residents decided to look at the original deed. "It was one of those questions you asked the state about and you never got any good answers," he said.
Leo Polaski, the official historian for the Kings Park Psychiatric Center, said there would be a certain irony if the property were to revert to Kings County. The county, after all, was essentially forced to give the property to the state after years of corruption and patronage scandals at the hospital.
"There were gallons of so-called medicinal whiskey for patients that instead went to workmen, and at one time all the doctors quit because Kings County fired all the attendants so they could put in patronage jobs," he said. "It wasn't unique to Kings Park, though, that kind of thing was happening everywhere in that time."
Kings County eventually lost all connection to the hospital as it became a full-fledged state facility. "It's been state property for more than 100 years," Mr. Polaski said. "But laws being what they are, and goofiness being what it is, maybe it really could revert to the city."

HEADLINE: A Nervous State Looks to Limit Licenses 

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO

 BODY:
PEGGY YARROW wants a driver's license desperately. A single mother, Ms. Yarrow, a Peruvian citizen who has been in the United State for about 10 years, needs it to get to supermarkets for groceries and diapers, to send her daughter, Shaynna Saenz, 2, to preschool, to visit the pediatrician and to find a job to supplement her $600 a month welfare income. But when Ms. Yarrow, who is a permanent resident of the United States, applied for a license late last year at the Stamford office of the Department of Motor Vehicles, she was told she wasn't eligible because she wasn't a citizen.
 "How else am I supposed to live?" she asked. "You cannot live your life here without driving." 
 At least a half-dozen day laborers from Honduras and El Salvador without green cards, but with employment authorization cards issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, also said they were turned away this year when they applied for licenses. They said they were told that only permanent residents or United States citizens could apply. 
Connecticut regulations say no such thing, but immigration lawyers said the state has suddenly made it tougher for noncitizens to get licenses, a response, the lawyers said, to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Sixteen of the 19 suicide attackers held valid driver's licenses or non-driver's identification cards from states including Virginia and Florida, and these cards enabled them to board planes, open bank accounts and rent apartments. Now many states, not just Connecticut, are wrestling with the question of whether and how to issue drivers' licenses to immigrants. Bill Seymour, a spokesman for the Connecticut D.M.V., said the department had not changed its policy towards immigrants, but said the rejections may be due to counter clerks just being more careful.
"The driver's license is a de facto identification document," Mr. Seymour said. "We have the primary responsibility to ensure that they are who they say they are. If there is some problem later on, it will be us, not the immigration lawyers, who will get into trouble."
Almost every state has taken measures large and small to toughen the rules, according to the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators. New Jersey makes the licenses of non-immigrants' expire with their visas. New York has started to ask applicants for original Social Security cards or letters from the Social Security Administration explaining the lack of a card. Before, any document bearing the Social Security number was good enough.
The debate has been especially intense in Connecticut, where the Department of Motor Vehicles and a number of state legislators have introduced bills to restrict any immigrant's access to a driver's license, the state attorney general questions the legality of such legislation and immigration lawyers oppose such measures.
Connecticut D.M.V. regulations state that acceptable forms of identification to obtain a license include a certified birth certificate, a green card, a United States or Canadian passport or an employment authorization card, when accompanied by what D.M.V. calls a "secondary document," such as a baptismal certificate or a certified school transcript.
The debate over licenses has come at a time when the United States, receiving roughly 1 million immigrants a year, both legal and illegal, is experiencing the largest wave of immigration in its history, said Professor Marcelo Suarez-Orozco, an immigration scholar at Harvard. Unlike previous waves of immigrants, who landed at large cities as way stations before they moved to the suburbs and farms, more and more new immigrants avoid urban centers altogether. They go where the jobs are, packing meat, picking tobacco, mowing lawns or building houses.
And Connecticut has received its share of the new immigrants. The immigration service estimated that 100,000 legal and 39,000 illegal immigrants settled in the state in the 1990's. The majority of these immigrants were Hispanic, which is the state's largest minority group.
The Connecticut D.M.V. has submitted a bill to the Legislature's Transportation Committee to make the driver's licenses of immigrants expire when their visas do and to grant the department commissioner broad powers to determine the validity of immigration documents that foreign applicants present. The D.M.V. instituted a new regulation last year that made licenses expire with visas, but the regulation was struck down as unconstitutional by Richard Blumenthal, state attorney general. He pointed out that immigrants with valid work authorization but expired visas still have legal status. 
Pablo Peralta, 27, has a valid work authorization card, but still can't get a license. Initially an illegal immigrant, Mr. Peralta, a native of El Salvador, has acquired temporary protected status, a status granted to illegal immigrants from countries ravaged by civil wars or natural disasters. For him, returning to his home country is not an option.
"In my country, no job, no food, no nothing," he said matter of factly. "Too many criminals."
Working for a Stamford-based maintenance company, he paints walls, makes windows, build houses, moves furniture and cleans offices. Making $13 an hour without benefits, he has constantly sent money home and kept his parents and siblings fed and clothed. He needs to get to different work locations and has tried to apply for a driver's license a number of times. He said counter clerks wouldn't accept an application once they discover his immigrant status.
According to D.M.V. regulations, Mr. Peralta, who has an employment authorization card, should have been able to receive a license. 
Facing the prospect of losing his job, Mr. Peralta has bought a blue Honda Civic and drives anyway. "But I am scared, you know, of getting into accidents or being stopped by the police," he said.
Luis Zelada of El Salvador, a good friend of Mr. Peralta's, also is driving without a license after his application was rejected by the D.M.V., despite his having an employment authorization card. Mr. Zelada, 26, does the same job as Mr. Peralta and sends money home every month to support his 4-year-old son. Mr. Zelada knows he is an essential part of the Connecticut economy.
"Without us, the beds won't be made; the houses won't be built; the trees won't be pruned and the kids won't be taken care of," he said.
Jaime Padilla would not have got a driver s license without the help of Locals 1199 and 32BJ, unions for janitors and health care workers. Mr. Padilla, a 28-year-old Honduran citizen, is also under temporary protected status and has an employment authorization card. After Mr. Padilla, a roofing worker, said he was repeatedly turned away by the D.M.V. last year, his union stepped in to help. After multiple attempts, Mr. Padilla received his license.
Olina Lorthe , 59, an immigrant from Haiti, said she was refused a state nondriver s I.D., even though she had a green card last December. She was told she needed to be a citizen to apply. Ms. Lorthe, discouraged, had not applied again. 
It might be even harder for people to obtain a driver's license if the D.M.V.-backed legislation passes. For now, the bill seems to have won the support of the chairmen of the Transportation Committee.
"We are in a war," said Biagio Ciotto, a Democrat representing Wethersfield and Middletown who is a cochairman of the committee. "We should put in some protection for the average guy who gets up to go to work, pays his taxes and does the right thing. I know my cochair feels the same say."
Many immigration lawyers said the D.M.V. selectively enforced its regulations, a practice they said is haphazard and sometimes racist.
"They tell those with work authorization that you need green cards," said Philip Berns, an immigration lawyer in Stamford who has filed appeals for immigrants who were denied licenses. "They tell green card holders you need to be a citizen. They tell citizens you look Hispanic and your documents look fake. But if you are blonde and blue-eyed, no problem. Here is a driver's license."
A blonde British woman, who asked that her name not be used, said she applied for her license in Stamford last year even though didn't have any of the documents immigrants commonly need to receive a license. She got it anyway.
Sometimes, even citizens have a hard time. Nora Garcia, 22, who was born in Texas of Mexican parents, was denied a nondriver's state identification card at a Wethersfield D.M.V. office last September. She said she was told her birth certificate, from a small town bordering Mexico, didn't look real. 
Mr. Seymour, the spokesman for the D.M.V., said he couldn't comment on specific cases; he said counter clerks of the department do make occasional mistakes, but the mistakes are not systematic. 
Elizabeth Leete, who heads the motor vehicle task force in Connecticut for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, questioned the wisdom of limiting access to driver's licenses for both legal and illegal immigrants. For one thing, she said, granting immigrants driver's licenses provides the government a record of who is in the country. Second, D.M.V. workers are unlikely to sort out immigration rules and recognize all the legitimate documents.
In addition, denying driver's licenses to immigrants hardly thwarts terrorism, she argued. Terrorists could use passports to board planes, and they usually have the money to obtain good forged documents.
"It's an emotional issue," she said. "It's not an issue with a solid, rational foundation. Denying immigrants licenses won't make our world safer."
While Connecticut might have become strict in issuing licenses, North Carolina and Tennessee are anything but. Proving legal status in the United States is not necessary, and immigrants, both legal or illegal, are able to get driver's licenses if they can prove residency in those states.
Despite criticism from other states, including Florida and South Carolina, of North Carolina's liberal rules, Wayne J. Hurder, its director of driver's license certification, is firm in his conviction that even illegal immigrants should be able to get licenses from the states where they live.
"The reality is that there are a lot of immigrants and half of them are undocumented," Mr. Hurder said. "If they are going to drive, I would argue it's better for them to buy insurance and follow the rules of the road.
"Historically, possessing a North Carolina license means you can drive safely on our roads, period," Mr. Hurder added. "Our mission is to improve highway safety."
Arguing that allowing illegal immigrants to get licenses and thus enabling them to buy car insurance keeps insurance costs down, Mr. Hurder proudly pointed out that North Carolina has one of the lowest rate uninsured motorists -- 6 percent -- in the United States.
Some legal scholars question the wisdom of using the driver's license as a national identification card at airports, banks and many other places, a practice that became common in this country about three decades ago.
"The problem with using driver's licenses as national I.D. cards is that there is no national standard," said David A. Harris, a law professor at University of Toledo and expert on traffic laws. "That's a very inconsistent way to run an I.D. system."
The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, which represents the state agencies that issue licenses, is urging Congress to issue uniform rules regarding granting licenses to illegal immigrants instead of leaving it to each state.
"Motor vehicle agencies are not in the immigration business," said Jason King, its spokesman. "The immigration issue is larger than the motor vehicle agencies."

HEADLINE: All Ideas Are Local. Spirited Debates May Soon Follow. 

BYLINE:  By ALAN BISBORT

 BODY:
THE day after the war with Iraq began, a group of Nobel Peace Prize winners gathered at the Bushnell Theater in Hartford to take part in a public dialogue. Call it perfect timing or simply a fortuitous encounter, the event -- presented by the Connecticut Forum -- turned out to be a welcome haven for all involved, including the man who helped plan it. 
 Opening the proceedings, Richard Sugarman, who, with his wife, Doris, founded the Connecticut Forum more than 10 years ago, said: "I can't think of a place I'd rather be than right here with you tonight. Although it's difficult to stand up here with the war having started, it could not be more important than for us to do what we do, which is to come together and consider ideas." 
The ideas considered as part of this particular event, called "A Nobel Evening," were, as they are at all forum events, intimate and unrehearsed, like a giant dinner party where the conversation is dominated by fascinating guests. The guests this night were Jody Williams, founder of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines and 1997 Nobel laureate; Elie Wiesel, Holocaust "witness," as he calls himself, author, and 1986 Nobel laureate; and Oscar Arias, former president of Costa Rica and 1987 Nobel laureate. Prodded by the moderator Juan Williams, the three expressed conflicting and conflicted feelings about the war that seemed to mirror the sentiments of the full house. There was sadness, anger and, even among these peace activists, one supporter of the war (Mr. Wiesel). There were raucous cheers, horrified gasps, laughter and a few tears. At the end, there were questions from the audience and answers that pleased some and riled others.
In short, it was a typical event for the Connecticut Forum, which has presented four such evenings a year since 1992. Among the forum's stated mission is to encourage the free and active exchange of ideas and to inform, challenge, entertain, inspire and build bridges between people and organizations in the community. Its goals extend beyond the Bushnell stage, through the Forum Community Institute, which is host to monthly Youth Forums and student exchanges involving 40 diverse high schools and distributes topical discussion guides to communities around the state.
But the Bushnell evenings are the forum's marquee event. Each, like "A Nobel Evening," is built around a theme, among which have been "Straight Talk and Honest Answers about AIDS," "Being Black," and "Cruelty, Violence and Morality." More than 230 panelists have participated, including Phil Donahue, Henry Kissinger, Gloria Steinem, Michael Moore, Spike Lee, Anita Hill, Al Franken, Walter Cronkite, Toni Morrison, Frank McCourt, Bill Cosby, Katherine Graham and Norman Schwarzkopf.
But provocation is not the only criterion. 
"A good season is one that balances tough, underreported topics with entertaining programs," said Mr. Sugarman, forum president. "These are not mutually exclusive."
The idea for the forum took shape soon after the Sugarmans moved to Hartford from Richmond, Va., where Mr. Sugarman had been involved in the community mental health field, and Mrs. Sugarman was an accountant. Mr. Sugarman's career change -- to the investment banking field -- brought the couple and their children to Hartford, where they sensed a need for connection among residents as great as their own. 
"There was a sense of disconnect," said Mrs. Sugarman, forum executive director. "Towns are spread out all over the area and the economy was pretty dire around here then. We were new, probably naive in a lot of ways, but people had this hunger, if only someone would initiate this idea."
"We were bothered by how we get information and news, so much of which is spin and is communicated at such a low level," said Mr. Sugarman. "We're talked down to and not respected. People deserve more. So, we sat down with a half-dozen people at dinner, then at the office, and asked everyone if they thought a forum was a good idea. 'Of course,' they said 'Yes.' They might have thought we were crazy, but they kept it to themselves."
Borrowing a cubicle at Mr. Sugarman's office, the Sugarmans began planning their first season of forum evenings with the help of volunteers. The first event, "The Changing Political Landscape," took place Oct. 16, 1992, featuring Ron Brown, Pat Buchanan and Lesley Stahl. 
The response was enthusiastic and the nonprofit forum, then run voluntarily by the Sugarmans, moved into an office above a food court and then into a larger space that is now a restaurant. 
"Only in Year 4, did we hire a staff," said Mr. Sugarman
The forum is now housed in a bank building a block from the Old State House, has a full-time staff of nine (including the Sugarmans, who both quit their other jobs), as well as many volunteers, who help choose and coordinate events.
"All the proposed ideas derive from a volunteer Program Selection Task Group," said Mr. Sugarman. "We also distribute 3,000 ballots to Bushnell audiences and ask them to check their top four ideas. Then we sift through the picks and even with the messages from the audience we are still guided by the overriding question, 'What would make a good forum season?"' 
In the past two years, audiences have sent a message of insecurity. 
"People are not being given an opportunity to talk about their fears, and if we've done a good job of listening and planning, frequently 12 months out, what we've picked is becoming news at the time," said Mr. Sugarman. "We, of course, had no way of knowing that 'A Nobel Evening' would be this timely."
Many other memorable evenings have resulted, said Mrs. Sugarman citing the forum on AIDS as having provided her most moving moment. 
"Arthur Ashe had originally agreed to be a panelist but was too sick to attend," she said. "He made a special tape and sent that ahead. He had died earlier that day and a lot of people at the Bushnell did not know this. We showed Arthur's tape on a big screen and announced that he'd died. There was a collective sigh. That was a special audience."
Mr. Sugarman cites the night Ralph Nader confronted Dan Quayle so aggressively that he thinks the latter ended his presidential run the next day as a result. Or the night Tom Whittaker, who had climbed Mount Everest despite his handicap, took off his prosthetic leg on stage, or the night Beverly Sills talked about the two deaf children no one knew she had, or the night Phish's Trey Anastasio, the Grateful Dead's Bob Weir and Wynton Marsalis closed a show with an improvisation. 
"When we say 'spontaneous,' we mean totally unscripted," Mr. Sugarman said. "Panelists get nothing in advance. For a handful of people we've approached that has been a problem and they've turned down the offer. Most we've contacted are intrigued. They get as tired of the scripted stuff as we do hearing it."
Kevin Phillips, political commentator and author of "Wealth and Democracy," took part in last October's forum, "Anatomy of Power," alongside Erin Brockovich, Gary Wendt and Julian Bond.
"Everyone on the panel liked the experience very much," said Mr. Phillips, who lives in Litchfield. "We were, in fact, more impressed than we expected to be. Over the years, they have come up with a polished product without giving of appearance of trying for polish. It's a unique event."
The Sugarmans are on guard against complacency.
"After 11 years, the temptation is to stop being adventurous, to go for the tried and true," said Mr. Sugarman. "We want to always be taking chances. We've never shied away from tough issues and never had a corporate sponsor influence or tell us not to take on something. You can imagine the pressure for that. Our mission drives everything we do, and that's the part that feels good to us. Even though we're not an institution, we are secure. We've created something that will last after us."
The final event in this season's Connecticut Forum is "The Forum Food Fest," on May 1. Tickets are $25, $40 or $50. Connecticut Forum season ticket pricings for next season are at three levels: $180 for the season (4 shows) in the orchestra; $140 in the mezzanine; and $80 for the balcony.

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS; 
Newark Museum Says State Is Backing Out of a Deal

BYLINE:  By Ronald Smothers; Ronald Smothers reports from Newark for The New York Times.

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
One of the more striking aspects of the state's budget crisis was Governor McGreevey's proposal to slash the state's assistance to the arts. Like one of the bunker-busting bombs hitting Baghdad, the move had the predictable effect, throwing dance companies off balance and shattering the silence in libraries, symphony halls and museums.
 A vocal bunch, the cultural institutions and their network of corporate and foundation supporters shrieked until administration officials admitted a miscalculation and said they would restore half of the $18 million that had been going to the Council on the Arts while hinting that further restorations were just around the corner. 
 But missing from the administration's attempts to quiet the criticism was a promise to restore several smaller but crucial contributions. One recipient is the Newark Museum, which since 1969 has received about $2 million a year from the state, or about a third of the budget for the 94-year old institution. 
Mary Sue Sweeney Price, executive director of the museum, explained that the annual contribution dated to 1967 -- just after riots battered Newark and the city was struggling. The museum, which had been spared from the flames and the looting that devastated much of the city that summer, was faced with the loss of the city's financial support as officials sought to funnel scarce funds to the pressing business of rebuilding the city and public safety imperatives.
There are those who suggest that the museum's patrician -- and largely white -- board was quietly debating whether to flee to the suburbs like so many others, though Ms. Price dismisses those accounts. "Those were just rumors," she said. "The city and the museum have been entertwined since its creation by John Cotton Dana."
Nevertheless, city officials -- getting wind of the talk -- cut the museum out of its budget. It took the intervention of Gov. Richard Hughes, and a promise from him that the state would assume of one-third of the museum's annual operating budget to get city officials to continue their support. 
"I was there when we went to see Dick Hughes less than a year after the riots," said Kevin Shanley, the museum's board chairman and vice president and chief operating officer of Atlantic Health Systems. "The governor recognized that the city couldn't afford to carry the museum as it had been and that the state should kick in."
For the next 35 years, the state contribution to the museum acquired the validation of history -- and perhaps more importantly -- political history. It became a fixture in the budget polices of the five governors who followed Governor Hughes. Ms. Price, who has been at the museum since 1975, could recall no similar or even serious threat to that contribution -- until now.
"The understanding has always been that since the museum drew students from all parts of the state to its shows, collections and attractions, then one-third of its annual operating budget should come from the state," she said. "It was recognized that we served others as well as Newark among the 340,000 students and seniors who come here every year."
Newark is not as hard-pressed fiscally now as it was in the late 1960's though it, too, is facing serious budget problems. Still, Mayor Sharpe James has insisted that the city will not decrease its financing of the Newark Museum, and he vowed in an interview to make sure the McGreevey administration also would not.
"The lights of the theater don't dim in a depression, and every army is led into war by a marching band and its musicians," the mayor said. "We think the governor should fully fund the arts, and we are really talking about peanuts in a multibillion-dollar budget."
Mayor James -- who is also a Democratic state senator and whose vote is likely to be crucial in the evenly split Senate -- said flatly that he would not support a state budget that did not restore the money for the museum's operating budget as well as the $18 million that the Council on the Arts received last year.
Other leading Democrats like Essex County Executive Joseph DiVincenzo have been equally vehement about restoration of the arts funds.
Yet Mr. Shanley, chairman of the museum board, insisted that in the end it would be common sense and not politics that would save the museum's operating money as well as the other money for the arts.
"We are there for the public, and we do the showing up," he said. "It is disingenuous to ask, as some editorials do, whether we should feed the children or feed the arts. We do feed the children, and I just don't understand what the governor is doing. It's like cutting off your nose to spite your face."

HEADLINE: CITIES; 
Hope for East Orange

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: EAST ORANGE 

 BODY:
STRUGGLING to revive itself after years of decline and misfortune, this tattered town in the shadow of Newark is placing a number of chips on a long shot.
 Last month, the East Orange City Council unanimously approved a developer's plan to build a 168-room Hampton Inn and Suites hard by Interstate 280 as it gouges its way through this once-elegant city of more than 69,000. The plan is to combine the inn, part of a national hotel-motel and conference-center chain, with a training school for entry-level jobs in the hospitality industry, making East Orange a testing ground for a combination of functions rarely found outside the university. 
 The residential training program would be run by the 15-year-old American Hospitality Academy, a for-profit organization based in Hilton Head, S.C. The plan for the inn and the training was put forward by the Evergreen Hotel Group, a partnership of P.J. O'Neill & Associates, a builder in Monroe Township, and the Unibuild Group, a Miami-based marketer. 
"This is a hybrid development that seeks to be a success both as a conference center and a campus for job training," said Maurice Hoo, president of Unibuild, which along with the O'Neill firm would build and operate the $18 million complex on Evergreen Place, about a half-hour from Newark Liberty International Airport.
Mr. Hoo's recent presentation at City Hall sidestepped direct mention of the challenge of building such a project here, especially as the travel and hospitality industry struggles and as business travelers become more interested in quality and dependability than in saving money. 
"I think it is a marvelous idea," said John Kasarda, a sociologist and director of the Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise at the University of North Carolina. "But there are many hurdles to such pioneering efforts. And they always say that the pioneers get the arrows while the settlers get the land."
Joseph McInerney, president and chief executive of the American Hotel and Lodging Association, a trade group, said that it was unusual to house a training center with classrooms at a functioning hotel. Chains do that sort of thing off the premises, he noted. He also said that few projects were getting financing now.
Still, Gary Carr, a spokesman for PKF Consulting, a hotel research and consulting firm, called the pairing of the hotel and training school "a creative way to finance a hotel" -- particularly when most financing is scarce.
He said that a recent study by his company found that although the supply of hotel rooms was at its lowest level in 20 years, demand was also low, a result of a flat economy and overbuilding in the late 1990's. In addition, he said the site's distance from the airport made it an unlikely choice for conferences by business people flying in.
"The hotels that are doing the best in the conference business are those located right at the airport," he said. "Plus, they have to overcome the image of the community because most business leaders tend to be risk averse and want really safe locations for their meetings."
All these hurdles have done little to diminish the enthusiasm of Mayor Robert Bowser of East Orange. To him, the interest of the developers is further proof of how far the city has come. 
Mr. Bowser attributed the interest of the Evergreen group not only to the city's proximity to the airport, but also to the fact that East Orange has increased its tax base to 94 percent of its residents from 76 percent five years ago, and last October convinced fiscal monitors from the state that after two years of supervision it was ready to oversee its own finances.
In addition, several successful land auctions recently returned seized properties to the tax rolls, and work is nearly complete on a new residential and commercial development called Dr. Martin Luther King Plaza on a downtown corner long scarred by desolation.
For the first time since 1985, , Moody's Investors Service recently gave a favorable investment-grade rating to the city's general obligation borrowings, whose repayment is pegged to local property tax collections. Though the city is still receiving supplemental state assistance under New Jersey's distressed-cities program, it is running its own operations day to day and expects to come out of the program soon.
"I know in my heart that this proposal will work," Mayor Bowser said.
He expects the lodging to attract conference business and church, social and civic groups to use the banquet and meeting rooms. "These groups are always complaining about having to go to airport hotels for their events or to Newark hotels," he said. "They want to stay here for their functions, and this will allow them to do that."
For now, Mr. Hoo conceded that heand his partners were only in the early stages of discussions with the Hilton Corporation, which owns the Hampton Inn chain and operates it as mid-price, low-service accommodations. Kendra Clark, a spokesman for Hilton, confirmed that it was "premature" to comment on the negotiations.
Cindy Reiman, president and chief executive of the American Hospitality Academy, said that she was excited about the prospect of its first resident teaching center. In the past, she said, the group has run training programs for about 60 chains off premises and has supervised management trainees who work as interns."To our knowledge, there is no other training operation like the one proposed for entry-level workers," she said. "What is critical and often overlooked at this level is the importance of building customer service skills, an attitude geared to customer service."
Perhaps the closest thing to what is being proposed for East Orange is the Opportunities Inn in Philadelphia, where the nonprofit Opportunities Industrial Corporation trains local residents in classrooms, mock hotel rooms, kitchens and banquet areas.
Gregory DeShields, a former director of that program who is associate director for industry relations at Temple University's school of tourism, said that the group had tried to create a resident program but that melding it successfully with a profit-making business had proved to be a problem.
Still, Mr. DeShields said that the proposed Hampton Inn and training center would provide a good setting for building a "team concept" among hotel staff workers.
"People might actually get better service in a training setting because there will be a safety net to prevent problems," he said. "Plus, there is a reason that trainees wear badges telling everyone that they are trainees. It sensitizes customers psychologically that it is a learning situation, and they tend to be more forgiving."
Mayor Bowser hopes residents will take advantage of the training to be offered. And he likes the idea of bringing new jobs to the city through a project that is not seeking a tax abatement.
"This sort of development couldn't have happened four years ago," the mayor said, referring to the city's faction-ridden politics of that time, its anti-development ethos and its finances and physical condition. "With this and other things that are happening, I think business will see us as stable and cooperative."

AS soon as Dr. Patricia Meyer examined the patient who walked into her office, she suspected he had cancer. The man had inflamed lymph nodes and Dr. Meyer wanted to order a number of tests, including a CAT scan of the man's lungs. But such diagnostic procedures are expensive and, like many of the patients who walk into the Open Door Family Health Center here, the man had no health insurance. Thus began the scramble that is all too familiar for medical professionals trying to care for those without insurance.
 "It's really rough, and you have to be fairly creative to advocate for your patients," said Dr. Meyer, a family practitioner and staff physician at 
 Open Door. "Here you suspect this cancer and they have no way to pay for the tests. They can apply for emergency Medicaid, but they have to wait for up to a month for approval. If you have cancer, imagine the anguish."
Dr. Meyer said the man was lucky -- she used the word with a sense of irony -- becausehe developed trouble breathing and was admitted to the hospital through the emergency room. Once hospitalized, his care was covered by Medicaid. 
Another patient, an elderly man with diabetes, could not afford his prescription medication. Dr. Meyer tried to enroll him in studies, passed along pharmaceutical samples and tried to get specialists to see him at a reduced fee. 
"Recently it got worse and he was going into renal failure, and I had to tell him there's nothing I can do for you until your kidneys fail, and then we'll get you into emergency Medicaid," she recounted.
Advocates for the uninsured have recently been trying to call attention to the increasing numbers of people without medical benefits. There is even a designated "Cover the Uninsured Week," which was marked locally by town meetings and forums in White Plains and Ossining. 
"As a society we really don't think it's acceptable for people to die on the street, but we just have to make sure they are really, really sick before we scoop them up and save them," said Georgeanne Chapin, president and chief executive officer of HealthSource/Hudson Health Plan, a nonprofit health services plan based in Tarrytown. "The true costs of not covering people are mammoth."
Nationally, 41.2 million Americans lack health insurance, according to a report released by the Census Bureau this year. In New York, the percentage of those without coverage is almost 16 percent, higher than the national average of 14.6 percent. Regional numbers are harder to come by. A rate of 15 percent would put the number of Westchester residents lacking coverage at about 150,000 people. But those who serve uninsured patients say that number is a conservative estimate.
"In light of the fact that we have undocumented people in our county, and we think there are big numbers in some communities, and certainly in light of the depressed economy, we think the numbers of the uninsured are something like 17 or 18 percent," said Lindsay Farrell, president and chief executive officer of Open Door, with offices in Ossining, Sleepy Hollow and Rye Brook. Ms. Farrell said that 45 percent of the patients who visit the center have no insurance.
The great majority of the uninsured -- 80 percent -- are members of working families, according to the census. Many lack coverage because they are in low-paying jobs that do not offer health benefits. Ms. Farrell said that her center treated a large Latino population, who work at jobs like mowing lawns, cleaning houses and babysitting, few of which offer health coverage. She also sees a number of self-employed people who can't afford to buy insurance, as well as people who are offered coverage from their employers but who can't afford the payroll deduction, so they opt out. With the economy faltering, a growing number of professionals are also without health insurance.
"The employer-based system is not adequate for the kind of society we live in, which more and more, has people not working, people who don't stay at the same jobs, companies that don't last that long, companies that themselves change insurers, and insurers that go out of business," Ms. Chapin said. "To continue to tie insurance to employment is really just not in keeping with the times we're living in."
Health insurance coverage has long been a patchwork system in this country. Most Americans do get their insurance through their employer, or through their spouse's or parent's employer. Individual coverage is available, though it is very expensive. The government also provides insurance coverage for the poor through Medicaid; for some moderate-income families through Child Health Plus and Family Health Plus, and for the elderly through Medicare.
Child Health Plus offers free coverage to children whose families have incomes above the Medicaid cutoff and do not have private insurance, as well as children who are undocumented residents. Family Health Plus covers adults who do not have health insurance through their employers, yet whose incomes fall slightly above the Medicaid cutoff. 
But the paperwork for applying for these programs can be daunting. Ms. Chapin said that more than 20,000 children in Westchester who were eligible for health insurance lacked it, in part because of the red tape involved in registering for the programs. She added that the bureaucracy requiring yearly recertification for those who do sign up is so complex that HealthSource/Hudson Health Plan lost between 4 and 5 percent of its enrollment in Medicaid, Child Health Plus and Family Health Plus each month.
Ms. Farrell said society was already paying to care for the uninsured. The cost of that care -- which is often expensive emergency care -- is passed along through high insurance premiums, high administrative costs and high doctor's fees.
"As a nation we long ago made the decision to subsidize health care for elderly people and for our poorest citizens," Ms. Chapin said. "It is time to do the same for all people who cannot afford to buy health insurance."

Have a Specialty? The Job Hunt May Be Short

BYLINE:  By MELINDA LIGOS 

 BODY:
THE weak economy and the uncertainty surrounding the war in Iraq are causing more companies to retrench, which means fewer job opportunities for many executives. It now takes an executive six months, on average, to find another position, compared with 4.5 months last year, according to Ira T. Kay, the director of the compensation practice at the consulting firm Watson Wyatt Worldwide.
 And last week, the government reported that companies eliminated 108,000 jobs in March following big cuts the month before, though the unemployment rate held steady at 5.8 percent. 
 Some occupations and industries, however, are faring well -- and still paying well. Chief financial officers and finance executives in general are in strong demand in several industries, career experts say, and many companies in the energy and health care sectors are hiring more people than they did last year. 
Todd E. Noah, a principal of RK Executive Search in Roseland, N.J., says he receives calls almost daily from hedge funds, in particular, looking for chief financial officers.
"The really good C.F.O.'s aren't looking for jobs right now," Mr. Noah said. "All they hear about is how poor the economy is, so they're wary about making a change."
But Charles G. Tharp, a professor of human resource management at Rutgers University, noted that companies of all sizes are under pressure these days to keep costs down and "are willing to pay top dollar for the right person" to help accomplish that. 
"The C.F.O. is quickly becoming the second-highest-paid person" in a company, behind the chief executive, Dr. Tharp said, with salaries of $500,000 or more not uncommon.
Last year, the median total cash compensation for chief financial officers across all industries was $347,200, up slightly from $345,600 in 2001, according to a 2003 compensation survey conducted by Mercer Human Resource Consulting. 
Demand for accounting and finance professionals is expected to be strongest in the manufacturing and health care sectors this year, according to Robert Half International, a company that specializes in supplying staff members for finance and technology companies.
Katherine E. Simmons, the president and chief operating officer of Netshare, an executive job search firm in Novato, Calif., says she has noticed an increase in job listings for high-level finance workers in hospitals. The hospitals "are scrambling to cut costs like never before," she said, adding that a skilled chief financial officer "can almost name his price."
Anthony E. Altig, 47, who was a chief financial officer at an Internet portal company in San Francisco, found that his skills were in demand when he moved to San Diego last August to be closer to his family. Mr. Altig said he had not even started his job search when he received a telephone call from a friend who had worked for Maxim Pharmaceuticals and encouraged him to apply for the vacant position of chief financial officer there. After two rounds of interviews, he said, he was hired in October, and at a salary that was commensurate with that of his previous job.
Was he surprised to have landed a new position so quickly? Not really. "Truthfully," he said, "I was more interested in finding the right job than finding a job." 
Many executives in the energy industry are also finding that jobs are plentiful, especially for those who have a background in petroleum engineering or geology. Because fewer college students are majoring in those areas these days, the industry is reaching "a crisis point for top talent," said David E. Preng, the president of Preng & Associates, an executive search firm in Houston that focuses on the energy industry.
Mr. Preng said that it was difficult to recruit managers from other industries. "It's not like we can pull someone out of Procter & Gamble to run Shell Oil," he said. "We pretty much have to rely on home-grown talent." 
Mr. Preng says executives with law degrees and international business experience are also considered ideal candidates. 
Over all, pay in the energy industry was expected to climb 4.1 percent this year, according to Mercer Human Resource Consulting.
The median salary for petroleum engineers is now $78,910, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but pay is substantially higher for those at management levels. In the past two years alone, Mr. Preng said that he has placed several people in senior-level positions at major oil companies, with annual salaries of $600,000 to $2 million.
There are also pockets of opportunity for executives in technology, career experts say. The biggest growth in salaries, and in demand for technology executives, can be found in military-related businesses, as well as in the medical, financial services and pharmaceutical sectors, according to Scot W. Melland, the chief executive of Dice Inc., an online job board.
The median total cash compensation for chief information officers across all industries was $274,700 in 2002, up from $264,000 in 2001. Chief information officers in health care earned median salaries and bonuses of $298,600 in 2002, up from $218,800 the previous year, according to Mercer.
Mary Finlay, deputy chief information officer at Partners HealthCare System, a group of hospitals in Boston with more than 30,000 employees, says her organization is still hiring health care information technology executives, although competition has softened of late. Two years ago, Ms. Finlay said, she was forced into bidding wars with financial services companies for qualified candidates. Now, she says, Partners HealthCare can be a little pickier, focusing more on candidates with solid project management experience, particularly in the areas of patient safety, disaster preparedness and system integration.
She said the company was no longer offering sign-on bonuses and other perks, although salaries have remained stable.
MANY health sciences companies are also hiring, especially those specializing in medical equipment and devices and, to a lesser degree, certain biotechnology companies, experts say. Executive pay in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology fields was expected to increase 4.1 percent this year, according to the Mercer study. 
Some experts are predicting even bigger increases in the future. John A. Challenger, the chief executive of Challenger Gray & Christmas, the outplacement firm based in Chicago, predicted that as the population ages, companies will continue to invest in product development. The health sciences, he said, will be the main engine of the next period of economic expansion.
"Lots of companies are going to put money into the game, and there's going to be a need for talented executives," he said.
Demand for personnel executives is also rising. Dr. Tharp, the Rutgers professor, said that was partly because companies are developing more sophisticated executive pay plans and have had to manage costs of pension plans more closely and focus on corporate governance issues. Many companies are also hiring so-called chief learning officers, or chief knowledge officers, to help with corporate training. 
Pay for the top personnel job at many companies, according to Dr. Tharp, can reach $300,000 to $400,000, not including stock options and other incentives. 
So how do executives latch onto these high-paying growth areas? Career experts advise professionals to pick a specialty and try to stick with it.
"Some young executives think they need to diversify themselves, so they've got all of these different jobs that don't relate to one another," said Raymond M. Desrochers, the president of Technology Business Advisors, a management consulting firm based in Westford, Mass. "Employers in these fields are being really specific -- looking for candidates that match the job description exactly."
Career experts also caution job seekers to be realistic. Mr. Noah, at RK Executive Search, said he sometimes had to remind candidates in the finance arena, for example, that job offers were no longer likely to be accompanied by sign-on bonuses or company cars. "It used to be that C.F.O.'s would get all of these fringes," he said. "The salaries are good, but some of the other things have gone away. In this economy, I tell people they should just be happy to receive a really nice paycheck."

Tech and Health Care Shares Become Silk Purses

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
THE relatively few stock funds that eked out small gains in a generally money-losing first quarter tended to own health care and technology stocks. Managers of some of the top-performing stock funds talked about the quarter and what they saw for the stock market this year.

Quality Trades
 TCW Galileo Select Equities, with $1.4 billion in assets, was up 4.5 percent in the quarter, taking seventh place among domestic diversified equity funds. 
 Glen E. Bickerstaff, 46, the manager, buys what he calls "long-term, very high-quality businesses with sustainable competitive advantages in their business models." These are the types of companies that investors have been seeking lately, he said.
"In the second half of 2002, selling stocks became, in our opinion, indiscriminate," he said. "Shareholders were selling stocks without regard to their fundamentals."
As a result, he said, valuations dropped to attractive levels. "When investors saw some signs of an economic recovery earlier this year," he said, "they gravitated to high-quality businesses because that's where their confidence was the strongest."
One of the fund's biggest winners was Amazon.com, the online retailer, whose stock rose 37.8 percent in the quarter. "We witnessed in the fourth-quarter holiday season revenues that exceeded investors' expectations," Mr. Bickerstaff said. "We interpret that as indicating that adoption of buying online reached critical mass, and investors are looking for strong results going forward."
Another winner was the Progressive Corporation, the property-casualty insurer. Its shares rose 19.5 percent because of rapid revenue growth and a reduced cost structure, he said. "The company has strong competitive offerings and has been focusing on cutting costs," he said, "particularly in adjusting claims."
Another winner was MedImmune, a biotechnology company in Gaithersburg, Md., whose stock rose 21.3 percent in the quarter, helped by the company's introduction this year of a product called FluMist. "Most flu shots are done through injections," Mr. Bickerstaff said. "An inhaled version is more pleasant."
He calls himself cautiously optimistic, given the economy's resilience. "After the declines of the last few years, stock valuations today reflect the growth potential of a stronger economy," he said.

Star Techies
Baron iOpportunity, a $67 million fund, rose 4.3 percent in the quarter, driven by technology stocks. The fund ranked ninth among diversified domestic stock funds.
The fund focuses on "companies whose future profitability is driven by changes created by the Internet and information technology," said Mitchell Rubin, 36, the fund's manager.
These include new Internet-based companies, older companies moving to an Internet-based business model and service providers to technology companies, he said.
Mr. Rubin generally avoids what he calls "hard-core software and hardware companies." They are typically more volatile because they tend to focus on just one technology, he said.
Technology companies performed strongly, Mr. Rubin said, because "investors looking for profitable businesses and who had ignored the tech-bubble stocks took a second look."
Expedia, the Internet travel agent based in Bellevue, Wash., was one of the fund's biggest winners, up 54.4 percent. The stock price was driven by strong fourth-quarter growth in revenue and profit, he said, and projections of continued growth in 2003. The company and its majority owner, USA Interactive, announced last month that USA would acquire the Expedia shares that it did not already own in a stock transaction valued at $3.3 billion. It is generally tax-free to Expedia shareholders. 
Mr. Rubin made money -- as did Mr. Bickerstaff and Mr. Hyan -- in eBay, the Internet reseller, up 25.8 percent. EBay is the "extraordinary company of our generation," Mr. Rubin said, "and all without significant asset investment, so its profit margins are superhigh, and it has no competition."
The difficult economic environment last year helped accelerate eBay's revenue, he said, projecting that revenue growth should exceed 60 percent this year.
Another winning holding was CheckFree, in Norcross, Ga. Shares of the company, which provides financial electronic commerce products and services, rose 40.5 percent in the quarter. It has benefited as people continue to shift from checkbooks to electronic bill payment, Mr. Rubin said.
Looking ahead, he said, "We think the market unfortunately is driven more by global events than company fundamentals." Because valuations are down, he added, the stock market is positioned for a big rebound when the economy stabilizes.

A Focus on Growth
Spectra, a $220.9 million fund, took 14th place among diversified domestic stock funds with a return of 3.6 percent. It credits its technology and health care stocks. 
The fund buys companies of any size that are experiencing positive changes from new product cycles, gains in market share or expanding markets, said David Hyan, the manager. He also manages two other funds in exactly the same style: the $106.8 million IDEX Alger Aggressive Growth fund, which rose 3.3 percent, and the $559.2 million Alger Capital Appreciation fund, up 3.4 percent.
Spectra's biggest stakes are in health care, at 36 percent of the fund's assets; technology, 25 percent; and retail and similar consumer stocks, 18 percent.
One winning health care stock was Amgen, the biotechnology company in Thousand Oaks, Calif., which rose 19.1 percent. Last year, Amgen introduced second-generation versions of two popular drugs, Epogen, used for treating chronic kidney failure, and Neupogen, for cancer. The new versions created accelerating sales growth rates for both drugs and helped Amgen expand into new markets, Mr. Hyan said.
Another winner was Forest Laboratories, in New York. Its shares rose 9.9 percent in the quarter, driven by a second generation of its antidepressant Celexa. The new drug, Lexapro, was introduced in 2002 and the two drugs combined account for 25 percent of the market for new antidepressant prescriptions, Mr. Hyan said.
Among specialty retailers, his biggest winner was Abercrombie & Fitch, up 46.8 percent. Its sales at stores open at least a year were down the last two years, Mr. Hyan said, partly because "three years ago, it was the hot brand to own, and there was oversaturation." But a rebound in popularity, good inventory control and a fast-growing new line called Hollister, for young teenagers, created positive sales growth in the quarter, he said.
Stocks seem to be in a short-term holding pattern, Mr. Hyan said. "The market is clearly focused on the war now, and business in general is on hold because of the war," he said, "so it's difficult to look ahead."

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Report; 
Are Rates Aligned in Mortgage Bonds' Favor?

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
THE last year has been a good time for consumers to refinance their mortgages, with interest rates hitting their lowest levels in decades. And it has also been a popular time to invest in mutual funds that buy bonds backed by home mortgages. 
 For people still wary of stocks, the $4 trillion mortgage bond market is attractive, said Jeffrey Gundlach, whose firm, the Trust Company of the West in Los Angeles, is one of the largest investors in mortgage debt. 
 "When interest rates are stable or rising, the mortgage market outperforms other parts of the bond market," he said, and many bond market strategists predict that will be the course of interest rates from here. That would mean lower or negative returns for investors in any variety of bonds, from corporate debt to Treasuries. 
Mr. Gundlach runs the $212 million TCW Galileo Total Return Bond fund and manages $32 billion in mortgage bonds for pension funds and other private investors.
Mortgage bond mutual funds had $83.6 billion in assets as of the end of February, according to Morningstar Inc. More than a third of that, almost $29 billion, was in the Vanguard GNMA fund.
Most mortgage debt is guaranteed by three enterprises that are owned or sponsored by the government: the Government National Mortgage Association, known as Ginnie Mae; Fannie Mae, formerly the Federal National Mortgage Association; and Freddie Mac, formerly the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
They bundle home mortgages they buy from banks and sell bonds backed by clusters of these mortgages to investors. That makes mortgage bonds more complicated than Treasury bonds.
"There is a lingering aura of mystery surrounding the mortgage market," Mr. Gundlach said. "Many investors think the market is incomprehensible."
Investors in these bonds need to calculate what mortgage specialists call prepayment risk, or the odds that a percentage of holders of the underlying mortgages will repay or refinance their debt before it is due.
IT is difficult for individual investors to estimate prepayments, but professionals like Mr. Gundlach construct statistical models for this purpose. Because of the uncertainty of prepayment risk, mortgage-backed securities, on average, yield one or two percentage points more than Treasuries.
When interest rates are falling, mortgage bond returns lag slightly behind Treasuries because so many consumers are paying off their home loans. Mortgage bonds returned 7.19 percent annualized over the last five years through March, slightly behind the 7.64 percent return on Treasury bonds, according to indexes kept by Lehman Brothers.
But when interest rates are stable or rising, fewer consumers pay off their mortgages early. Mr. Gundlach estimates that a record $500 billion in mortgages will be repaid or refinanced in the next three months. But after that, he said, refinancings will decline gradually, which is good for investors in mortgage debt.
"As investors, we want homeowners to pay the highest rates," Mr. Gundlach said.
Between March 10 and March 21, when investors thought the war would end quickly, stocks rallied and Treasury bonds dropped 2.6 percent. But mortgage bonds fell just 0.8 percent during the same period.
Mortgage bond investors fare poorly when rates rise rapidly, because they prefer a certain amount of cash coming in from refinancings.
But the current environment of stable to slowly rising interest rates is ideal, said Kenneth Hackel, chief United States bond strategist at Merrill Lynch. He recommends that Merrill clients put 36 percent of their bond portfolios in mortgage debt.
"Rates are unlikely to go up enough in the short term to hurt mortgage bond returns," he said.
The TCW fund largely avoids debt backed by the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages favored by most home buyers. The long period before this debt comes due makes it difficult to predict when the debt will be repaid.
Mr. Gundlach prefers bonds for which repayment is easier to anticipate. Close to one-third of his fund is invested in adjustable-rate mortgages, which have a fixed interest rate for 1 to 10 years and then switch to a variable rate.
Because these bonds have a shorter maturity, it is easier to calculate when they will be repaid, Mr. Gundlach said.
Forty percent of the fund is invested in collateralized mortgage obligations, or C.M.O.'s. These are pools of mortgages sold by investment banks to money managers and other private investors. 
The marketers of these pools sell off streams of interest and principal payments to investors. The TCW fund typically buys the portion of a C.M.O. that is the last to be repaid, typically not before 5 to 15 years, Mr. Gundlach said.
Most mortgage bond funds avoid C.M.O.'s because they trade infrequently. "The TCW fund does buy some esoteric securities," said Eric Jacobson, an analyst at Morningstar, adding that such securities tend to yield more because they are less understood.
The TCW fund has returned 1 percent this year through March, compared with 0.74 percent for the average mortgage bond fund, according to Morningstar.
It has had a five-year annualized return of 8 percent through March, compared with 6.29 percent for the average mortgage bond fund. 
Mr. Jacobson favors the TCW fund for another reason: on March 1, the fund cut its expense ratio to 0.44 percent from 0.69 percent and the minimum initial investment to $2,000 from $25,000.
"It's really unusual in an environment like this for a mutual fund to cut its fees," Mr. Jacobson said.

HEADLINE: His Mission: Finding Why People Fight 

BYLINE:  By LISA SUHAY 

DATELINE: WEST LONG BRANCH 

 BODY:
SALIBA SARSAR, who grew up a non-Arab Jordanian in Jerusalem with a personal history at least as complex as that of the Middle East, might easily have followed his childhood friends into a life of hatred and conflict. Instead, as he works academic turf here in suburban New Jersey, his thinking is drawing crowds.
 He was born of a Russian father and a Greek mother in 1955 in the Old City of Jerusalem, which was then a part of Jordan. After the Six Day War of 1967, he was separated briefly from his family and watched the reshaping of Israel. But in a major turning point in 1974, he was one of several Middle Eastern youths brought to New Jersey as part of an effort to foster peace and crosscultural understanding. 
 Now he says he is doing his early sponsors proud by advocating peaceful conflict resolution. 
On Thursday, he and a colleague, Dr. Joseph Patten, are to lead a discussion at a showing of the award-winning film "Kandahar" at the Monmouth University Global Understanding Convention. And last month, Dr. Sarsar presented his roadmap to peace at a three-man panel discussion at Brookdale Community College in Lincroft.
That discussion -- "Conflict Resolution in the Middle East: Is It Possible?" -- was open to the public and drew 350 people, ranging from high school students to the elderly. 
Dr. Sarsar, 48, represented Monmouth University, where he is an associate professor of political science and an associate vice president for academic program initiatives. At Monmouth he has taught comparative politics, Islam and politics, American foreign policy and international relations for 18 years.
His says there can be peace between Palestinians and Israelis if a demilitarized, neutral Palestinian state is created immediately, not in 2005 as President Bush advocates. Last month, Mr. Bush reiterated his support for adoption of a Palestinian state.
Paul Zigo, an organizer of the panel discussion, said of Dr. Sarsar's presentation: "He gave a very common-sensical explanation of the socio-economic impact of terrorism on the common people in the Middle East, not the warriors' or the politicians' views so commonly expressed."
The moderator, Prof. Sherri West of Brookdale, said his presentation prompted the most questions from the audience. "My students came to me in class the next day and said he was the speaker they found the most engaging," she said. 
A fellow panelist found him and his approach unorthodox.
"He was remarkably pleasant," said Richard Immerman, chairman of the Department of History at Temple University in Pennsylvania. "It was somewhat out of step with what I am used to seeing in scholarly behavior. We in academia are cordial, respectful with one another, but that is all. He didn't fit the mold." 
On Dr. Sarsar's political views, Dr. Immerman said: "He is more optimistic on this topic, which is not a quality of most scholars. We tend to be cynics. I tend to study conflict, not its avoidance. It made me want to read more of his work."
Prof. Michael Doran of Princeton University was the third panelist.
Dr. Sarsar does have his detractors.
"He doesn't see the danger the Palestinians represent to the Jewish people," said a former colleague, Marvin Maurer, who retired in 2000 after 30 years as a professor of political science at Monmouth University. 
"He thinks there should be a Palestinian state," Professor Maurer said by telephone from his home in Toronto. "I strongly disagree. There could be some kind of home rule, but definitely not a separate state. I know people in the Jewish community around the university who strongly disagree with Sarsar on this."
Asked about such detractors, Dr. Sarsar said: "I wish I could speak with them. We must continue to try and find common ground in these issues. If we are to succeed we must have dialogue between peoples." 
Dr. Sarsar, a slightly built, balding man who is exceptionally soft-spoken, says he has had complete freedom, without intervention from the university, to teach his theories at Monmouth, here in West Long Branch. But he tells a chilling tale about calls from United States government agents at the time of the first Gulf War, in 1991.
A number of times, he said, he expressed his theories of why Saddam Hussein had taken certain military actions and told his classes what moves he expected Iraq to make.
"No sooner than I returned to my office I received a telephone call from a government agent insisting on knowing how I had known these things," Dr. Sarsar said. "Apparently there were students in my classes who were actually working with or for the government or knew someone in this branch of intelligence and they were reporting my teachings regularly."
Dr. Sarsar said these incidents did influence him to curb his tongue for the duration of that semester. He said he had never again experienced anything like that and has not held back this semester.
Dr. Sarsar lives with his wife, Hiyam, and daughters, NoorEvelyn, 6, and Hania, 4, in Tinton Falls, in a blue and white ranch home decorated with abstract art.
He seemed to hold back little as he sat for an interview at the All Seasons Diner in Eatontown on a recent Sunday afternoon after attending services at St. George Greek Orthodox Church in Asbury Park. 
Dr. Sarsar said his father was born in Russia as Ivan Danilov and was taken as an infant to Jerusalem because his mother feared that her husband's blood connection to the czars endangered their lives in Russia. After a short time, she died of an illness in Jerusalem when her son, Ivan, was only 3. He was then adopted by a Palestinian.
"The woman I call my grandmother was a Christian Palestinian who attended the same church as my Danilov grandmother," Dr. Sarsar said. "She adopted my father and renamed him George Sarsar. My father, the Russian Ivan Danilov, became the Palestinian George Sarsar by adoption."
"People like things to be simple, but in the Middle East, especially Jerusalem, nothing is simple," he said. "I was born in a Protestant hospital on the Mount of Olives. I am Greek Orthodox. I go to church. I was raised in the Old City in an Arab culture, speak Arabic but have no Arab blood."
He added, with a smile, "I live between two worlds."
Though he was only a child at the time, he recalls the aftermath of the 1967 war, when, he says, Israel was in effect "created around us in six days like a hurricane."
Many of the people who were his childhood friends in Jerusalem ended in prison or dead. "I think education made the difference for me," he said.
His father, George Sarsar, was a printer who ran a hand-driven press. His mother was a homemaker. Electricity did not come to their quarter until the early 1960's. A tiny garden, behind a row of attached dwellings, plus large olive and pomegranate trees, supplied most of the family's nourishment.
"The flowers of the Bible grew there: jasmine, rosemary. It was like heaven," he said.
Such recollections have inspired two books of poetry. He has just completed his second, "Seven Gates." The first, "Cross Winds" (Edwin Mellen Press, 1999), derives its name from his own. (In Arabic, "saliba" means "cross." A sarsar is a powerful desert wind.)
He spends his spare time writing poetry, playing with his children and listening to classical music. "I've always had a soft spot for Beethoven and Mozart," he said, adding that he once visited the home of Beethoven in Bonn "to touch where genius walked" and bought a bust of the master that he keeps on his desk at home. 
Dr. Sarsar was the sixth of eight children -- three girls and five boys. One sister still lives as a nun in the Old City of Jerusalem. Another sister moved to Honduras, shortly before the Six-Day War. The other siblings are in the United States. His father, now 90, and mother, 79, still live in the family home in Abu-Tor, a 10-minute walk from the Jaffa Gate in the Old City. 
After the Six-Day War he and his older brother were separated from the rest of the family by military officials and sent to a refugee camp in Jericho. His parents, grandparents and other siblings were sent to a camp in the south of Jerusalem.
"I was 11 then, and for two weeks my brother and I were in the refugee camp and didn't know if we would ever see the others again," he explained. "A boy I played with three houses down was killed. Many of my neighbors also died."
Instead of taking up arms, he made education his life. "I wanted to learn why people aggress against each other," he said. "I needed to understand. I needed to stop it."
After coming to New Jersey he began attending Brookdale and then moved on to study at Monmouth on scholarship, earning a bachelor's degree in political science. He completed a doctorate at Rutgers and began his teaching career there when one of his professors was awarded a Fulbright and needed someone to take over his courses.
"That experience really launched me," he said. "I never had to look for a job. The next year a teaching position came up at Monmouth and I have remained there for 18 years."
His current students sometimes agree with him, sometimes not. 
Lindsay Currie, 19, of Long Branch, says Dr. Sarsar has made her strong dissent from his views on Saddam Hussein and the war with Iraq a part of lessons in the class on Islam and politics.
"We both agree Saddam needs to be gone, but he wants it to happen in a more humanitarian way and I want it quicker," she said. "We spend most of each three-hour class discussing our views on the day's news and there is plenty of room for argument. That's something I like."
Greg Muszynski, 22, added: "He lets everyone get their say and then gives his opinion. Compared to other classes I really learn a lot in his discussions. I don't know why exactly. I just seem to absorb better when he talks. Maybe it's all the discussion and open debate? Maybe he's just a really good teacher."
The professor's skills in the face of conflict are appreciated on the domestic front, too. "Saliba is a true peace maker," said his wife, 40. "Even in daily life, if people we know have personal conflict they often come to him to be the mediator. He just has a very calming way about him, and with this he often helps others to be peaceful."
Dr. Sarsar, who became an American citizen in 2000, says that through teaching he is slowly accomplishing his goal of uniting his worlds in peace and mutual respect. He gives much credit to the Rev. John S. Grauel, a Methodist minister who was responsible for bringing him to the United States and was an activist for the Jewish people and Israel for decades before his death in 1986.
Dr. Sarsar says others helped him, too, including about 30 families in Monmouth County.
"In my work at Monmouth I want to bring about this richness of ethnic diversity that colored my life," Dr. Sarsar said. "I want to show my students those colors. Ultimately it is their decision to partake."

In God's Name
In God's Name
The sun appears 
from behind the rainbow, to dry 
the blood from hearts wasted on
stones wrapped in colorful flags,
moss growing in cracks and veins
on arms and hands that maim,
killing in the name of God, 
of prophets long gone, 
of profits to be made past
prayers of the day, 
the smiling face 
of the moon.

HEADLINE: Fighting Off the Chains 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN WARNER 

DATELINE: MOUNT LAUREL 

 BODY:
NELSON PAGE made his theatrical debut in 1979 when he maxed out his credit cards, borrowed from banks and his partners and sank an inheritance into a lease on the Cedar Lane Theater in Teaneck. Over the next five years, he built a chain of 10 independent theaters throughout the state.
 But there would be no happy ending. Just as Mr. Page was trying to revive the old downtown theaters, gleaming new chain-owned multiplexes began opening all over the state, driving him into bankruptcy in 1985. 
 "The chains beat me," Mr. Page said. "I had neither the money nor the patience nor the stamina to fight the big guys." 
Such huge chains as Circuit City, Sports Authority, Barnes & Noble, Home Depot and Target came into the state with what is known "big box" stores housing vast product lines. Of course, buying from manufacturers in such quantity translated into lower prices for consumers, driving out thousands of small, independent businessmen. Mr. Page was one of them. 
"It was a win-win for the consumer," said Carol Kaufman-Scarborough, a marketing professor at Rutgers University in Camden.
After taking a few years off, Mr. Page returned with a sequel. In 1987 he assumed the lease on a theater in the lower level of the Galaxy condominium complex in Guttenberg that had been closed for 10 years. Mr. Page had learned he could not match the multiplexes screen for screen, so he offered discounts and tracked down a 1920's-era theater organ in Portland, Ore., that he installed in the Galaxy, where he screens first-run films along with classics and silent movies. He applied a similar formula to nine other forgotten theaters - eight of them in New Jersey -- as president of the Galaxy Theater Corporation.
"We've made a success by providing something that the big boys don't give -- showmanship," said Mr. Page, who eventually bought back the Cedar Lane too.
Mr. Page's tale is not that unusual. In the early 1990's, when the economy was slumping, independent businesses found themselves under assault from the chains springing up in shopping centers, siphoning customers from downtown shopping districts and suburban malls alike. But these days, with the economy once again on shaky ground, it is the chain stores that are facing stiffer competition -- from one another as well as from a new generation of independent retailers who have found ways to survive and prosper.
Not that it will not be a struggle. According to Chain Store Age, a trade magazine, of the $2.5 trillion in retail sales in the United States last year -- excluding automobiles but including restaurants -- sales at stores with more than five outlets accounted for about $1.7 trillion. 
"Independents have now been able to identify gaps the chains weren't filling," Ms. Kaufman-Scarborough said. "Many of them have been able to find a well-defined niche market and build their overall strategy around that niche."
For consumers who spend much of their time fielding phone calls from telemarketers, returning merchandise to catalog companies and circling malls endlessly in search of parking spots, Ms. Kaufman-Scarborough said that an alluring niche could take several forms: first-class service, a one-of-a-kind product line or merchandise that meets a particular local demand.
"There's lots and lots of room out there for everyone," said Jerry Shields, a spokesman for Home Depot, who noted that his company and a competitor, Lowe's, accounted for only 20 percent of the nation's spending on home improvements. "The small stores need to find a niche, but they still have a majority of the market."
In addition, Ms. Kaufman-Scarborough said, many of the large chains expanded -- and in many cases overexpanded -- too quickly and experienced a shakeout. She pointed to the discount retailer Caldor, which went out of business in 1999, closing all of its 145 stores on the East Coast, and Kmart, which filed for bankruptcy court protection last year with plans to close seven stores in New Jersey. In addition, Ames closed all of its 327 stores in the region. 
"Even before the downturn in the economy," she said, "many tried to build market strength by volume and did not necessarily have the support."
With that in mind, she said, small retailers have jumped back in.

'A New Confidence'
"It feels almost as if there is a new confidence in the small retailers after seeing a number of the chains misstep," she said. "The cookie-cutter approach to retailing doesn't always work."
Mr. Page still has his battles with the chains -- like the multiplexes in Edgewater and Jersey City. Often, when a hot film is released on a limited basis, his name is not on the short-list. When "Chicago" came out last year, he said, he could not get his hands on a print for a month.
Still, the number of films and prints available has soared in the last 25 years -- a key to his economic survival. In the 1980's, a wide release would include about 400 screens, he said, while today that number is up to 6,000 to 7,000. 
"They built so many screens; they have to fill them," he said. "In the 80's if you had 150 films released domestically, that was a lot. Last year there were more than 500."
Even with more supply, Mr. Page knows his limits. He avoids whole swaths of the state where upscale development is taking place. Rather, his market is abandoned theaters, where he can negotiate cheap rent. For now, Mr. Page said his company had probably peaked, addingthat he might even get out of Hoboken, where he owns the Hudson Street Cinemas, when his lease is up in less than two years because he expects the rent to go up substantially. 
Still, in the past few years, Mr. Page said he had watched many of his multiplex competitors go through bankruptcy. United Artists, the Regal Entertainment Group, Loew's and General Cinema all operated under bankruptcy protection for some period from 2000 to 2002, though all have since emerged after paring back. Another theater chain, Clearview Cinemas, which operates 59 movie theaters in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, is up for sale by its owner, Cablevision Systems.
"They all thought they were going to corner the market by building a multiplex every five miles," he said. "There is still only a finite number of people who go to the movies. If you saturate the market with screens, you're only going to hurt yourselves."
Gary Reiss, the owner of Suit World, a 60-year-old men's clothing store with three locations in Trenton, concurs, saying that finding a niche is what survival is all about when going up against megastores.
"We give something the big chains don't give, and that's service," Mr. Reiss said. "If somebody comes in and wants a suit with covered buttons, it doesn't take me long to go out and get them a couple suits with covered buttons."
In fact, he insisted that competition from the large chain stores had helped his business. "It made me sharper," he said. "I can move on a dime, where it takes a big chain a while before they can get themselves into gear."
Yet in one sense, Mr. Reiss said, he and the chains are all too similar.
"Nobody can say they're doing extremely well now with this recession," he said. "We need to get our economy working again so people can go back to work and spend on clothes."
Perhaps there is no greater symbol of the retail consolidation in New Jersey than the giant all-night drug stores that sell everything from prescriptions to makeup to lawn furniture in prime corner locations with drive-through windows. 
Terry Malanda started out working as a pharmacist for CVS for five years -- first as a floater and then for branches in Union and Rahway. 
"I hated it," Ms. Malanda, 40, said. "I was looking to go to law school - anything but pharmacy. There was absolutely no satisfaction."
But on her days off she worked part-time at several independent pharmacies in Union County and saw a new world beyond her counter. "It was much more personal," she said. "Patients would actually send you a thank-you note."
So in 1989, after borrowing money from relatives and friends and pooling it with what she had saved while working part time, she and her husband, Edward, mortgaged their house to buy Mandell's Pharmacy in New Brunswick. The store, founded in 1927, came with competition from a chain, Rite-Aid, already in place a block away.
Several years later, Ms. Malanda -- who was was having difficulty becoming pregnant -- began to develop a specialty in fertility drugs at her pharmacy, attracting new customers from a wider area. 
"It just kind of fell into my lap," she said. "If you don't have a specialty or something to distinguish yourself, it's really tough."
(She also had personal success. With the help of fertility drugs, Ms. Malanda gave birth to a son, Eddie, six years ago, and four years ago she had a daughter, Christina, with no pharmacological intervention.)
Ms. Malanda's specialty requires her to carry more costly inventory and involves more headaches with reimbursement from insurance companies, but she says that is the price she pays for her independence.
"It's definitely worth it," she said. "Every time one of my girls get pregnant, I get so happy because I went through it myself."
To be sure, the numbers do not favor Ms. Malanda. Stephen Brandt, executive director of the Garden State Pharmacy Owners, a trade association for independent pharmacies, said there were 1,350 individually owned drugstores in the state in 1993 as against about 650 today. Moreover, Mr. Brandt said the number of chain-owned drugstores had risen to 1,100 from 300 in 1993.
On the other hand, he said, he was surprised to learn that five new independent pharmacies had opened in the state within a month.
Ms. Malanda said she had also noticed a trickle of independent pharmacies opening -- in her view a positive development after many druggists retired in the early 1990's because of the difficulties of dealing with H.M.O.'s.
"I think people just got tired of it," she said, noting that chains were offering cash to pharmacies to close and hand over their patient lists.
These days, however, Ms. Malanda says a new generation of pharmacists have trained in the H.M.O. environment and are used to it. And, she said, more and more pharmacists, like her, have worked for chains and discovered it was not for them.
"I like to have that direct contact," she said. "Otherwise it's just counting pills."

'Our Own Boss'
Exit 4 of the New Jersey Turnpike in Mount Laurel is an oasis of motel chains: Radisson, Days Inn, Red Roof Inn, Econo Lodge and Howard Johnson are among the 25 hotels and motels nestled around the exit, which is a doorstep to Philadelphia.
Less then a mile away sits the Track and Turf Motel, a 40-year-old independent business with 30 rooms that was built to accommodate overflow travelers visiting the Garden State Park racetrack in Cherry Hill. 
"The other hotels are not a problem to us," said Vijay Shroff, who bought the motel with a partner two years ago.
Mr. Shroff charges less than $40 a night for a room that he contends differs very little from those up the road that can cost up to $140 a night.
"Not everybody can buy a Mercedes," he said. "Maybe they buy the Camry. Not everybody wants to pay $140 a night."
Mr. Shroff, who came to the United States from India 10 years ago, is part of a network of Indian entrepreneurs throughout the country who own independent motels. In fact, he borrowed money from the other motel owners as well as his family to go into business.
"We like to be our own boss," he said. "We don't like to work for anybody."
Mr. Shroff said most of the hotels near him -- the ones with the well-known American-sounding names -- were actually operated by Indian-born franchisees who got their start with small independent motels like his.
"We help each other," he said.

Taking On Home Depot
Warren Coupland knew he was heading directly into the Home Depot buzz saw when he bought Quality Paneling in Rio Grande five years ago. The giant orange-colored home improvement retailer had announced plans to build its first store in Mr. Coupland's area of Cape May County, just two miles north on Route 9.
"The prior owner was scared to death," Mr. Coupland, a retired insurance executive, said. "I knew they were coming, but I had confidence in what we could do."
Mr. Coupland, who had been a contractor years ago and had an engineering degree, came to Quality Paneling with a plan.
First, he changed the name to Quality Home Center and Paneling. Then he scrapped much of the basic lumber and hardware business to focus on more sophisticated - and profitable - products like kitchen and bathroom cabinets and fireplace systems. 
When Home Depot opened two years after Mr. Coupland bought his business, revenue at Quality fell 25 percent in the first six months. But by the end of the year it had climbed nearly back to the previous level, Mr. Coupland said. More important, the store was already doing twice the business it had before Mr. Coupland introduced his new strategy.
"Smaller hardware stores in the area were scared," he said. "They stopped making investments. They pulled in their horns, and that ensured they were not going to make it. It only took a couple years, and most of them were gone."
When it comes to marketing, Mr. Coupland cannot compete with the weekly circular that Home Depot puts out. Instead, he has rented a sign on Route 9 -- just before the turn for Home Depot -- boasting about Quality's expert service and free estimates.
"The idea was to really be in Home Depot's face," he said.
Last summer, he adopted his own signature color and painted the outside of his store bright rose.
Mr. Coupland can now look out from his rose-colored store at a tract of land directly across the street. That is where Lowe's, another giant home-improvement retailer, plans to build a store.
"That's not a problem for us," he said confidently. "That's going to be more of a problem for the Home Depot."

HEADLINE: Executive Pay: A Special Report; 
Shrinking Salaries Hit Home in Argentina

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

 BODY:
WHILE numbers in the United States show that hard times have not been hard of late on the pay of the nation's chief executives, that is not the case in crisis-ridden Argentina.
 Executives there have been feeling the pinch. Four years of bitter recession, a severe devaluation of the peso and surging inflation have effectively wiped out nearly two-thirds of the value of executives' paychecks and put many managers out of work. 
 Last year alone, the economy that was once Latin America's richest shrank 11 percent. Unemployment rose to record levels of more than 20 percent, double the figure when the crisis started in 1999. Multinational corporations have been retrenching, or even leaving the country, while local companies that have managed to survive a huge wave of bankruptcies have been doing much more firing than hiring. 
Now, however, the economy is showing the first, feeble signs of recovery. It is expected to grow this year instead of shrink, and some companies are starting to fill positions again. As a result, the executive job market is slowly coming to life, and Argentina's business analysts are taking stock of what has happened to executive salary packages.
In some successful export industries, which record their revenue in dollars but their costs in devalued pesos, wages are keeping pace with the 40 percent inflation rate. But in most others, mainly sectors in crisis, like banking, telecommunications and utilities, bosses are glad just to keep their jobs, according to executive search companies and management consultants in Buenos Aires.
"Downward pressure on salaries has been enormous," said Jorge Forteza at the Argentine offices of Booz Allen Hamilton, the consulting firm. "In dollar terms, salaries have been destroyed, and even in peso terms virtually nobody has kept up with inflation."
Esteban Calvente, who runs Pratt Pinet, an executive search firm in Buenos Aires, said the average salary of a top executive had fallen from the equivalent of $130,000 in 2001 to just a little more than $50,000 today.
Even chief executives who earned, say, $325,000 a year plus bonuses before the crisis, now might receive only about $130,000 in fixed salary, Mr. Calvente said.
The banking system's collapse has cut executives' access to credit, and much of their savings has been stuck in a 15-month-old banking freeze. As a result, many executives are looking for work abroad or downsizing the way they live.
As the crisis deepened, "for sale" or "to let" signs began to appear outside some of the most opulent houses in the top residential areas of Buenos Aires, according to the J. R. Reynolds real estate agency.
The top-tier job market in Argentina "has become very restricted," said Hernan Repetto, who left his job as chief operating officer of the cable television company Multivision, in Buenos Aires, in 1999, at the beginning of the crisis, to become president of TV Cidade, a cable channel based in Sao Paulo, Brazil. "There are a lot of top-quality executives with nowhere to go." 
"Since then, the situation for executives has gotten worse, much worse, than I expected," he said. "Having to accept pay cuts of 30 percent and more is hard to swallow."
Still, improvement may be at hand. Mr. Calvente said Pratt Pinet was being asked to place 14 executives a month in middle and top management positions, compared with just three a month early last year.
But because the devaluation has helped some sectors while hurting others, pay patterns are distorted.
"A soy oil export manager will cost you a small fortune," said Alejandro Etchart of Spencer Stuart Argentina, the executive recruiting firm, "but if you want to hire someone away from a bank, you can get a bargain."
Argentine companies are not required to disclose chief executives' salaries, and leading businesses are generally reluctant to discuss their pay policies. But "the big groups have tried to protect their quality people," said Mr. Forteza of Booz Allen Hamilton.
Job sweeteners include offers to pay 15 percent to 25 percent of an executive's salary in dollars or, in the case of multinationals, an offer of a stint abroad.

HEADLINE: LOVE & MONEY; 
The Case Against Joint Checking

BYLINE:  By ELLYN SPRAGINS; Ellyn Spragins is a freelance writer in Pennington, N.J. Her column about money's influence on relationships appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: loveandmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IF my children ever turn to me for marriage advice, I won't tell them that humor matters more than passion, or that true love conquers unemployment and infidelity. I will tell them to ban joint checking accounts from their married lives.
 What? Put asunder what our marriage vows and the American banking industry have brought together? 
 Yes, because I have concluded that joint accounts lead to a common, but often undetected problem in marriages: the secret money stash. Think cookie jars and underwear drawers, not Swiss bank accounts and lockboxes filled with gold bullion. Think of women, and men, quietly diverting grocery money, a health insurance reimbursement check or part of a bonus to a private stockpile that their mates know nothing about. 
Such stealth wouldn't be necessary with separate accounts, because men and women would not feel that every nickel they spent was subject to scrutiny and criticism.
Like public companies, good spouses are supposed to keep their finances open. "In marriages, money often becomes an instrument to work through the emotional piece of what's wrong in a relationship," said Lili A. Vasileff, a divorce financial planner in Connecticut, with offices in Woodbridge and Greenwich. 
Ellyn Bader, a therapist in Menlo Park, Calif., who studied spousal deception in her book "Tell Me No Lies: How to Face the Truth and Build a Loving Marriage" (St. Martin's Press, 2000), said secret stashes are common among couples headed for divorce. "The more hostility there is in a marriage, the more entitled a person feels about coming out of the marriage with cash -- and the more likely they'll start hiding money," she said.
Clearly, revenge-driven cash stashers flunk the good-marriage test. But what about minor offenders? How bad is your marriage if you pocket, say, a $140 insurance company check or keep a roll of $20's entombed in a Baggie and stuffed into the corner of the freezer? Are these marriages also doomed to fail?
Apparently not. Many men and women occasionally or even habitually divert marital cash to a private cookie jar. Of those I spoke to, most have been married 20 years or more. It wasn't a surprise when I came across a 73-year-old woman who lives near Boston and collects income from a separate investment account that her husband of nearly 50 years doesn't know about. She was raised in a time when women rarely earned their own income. "I believe a smart woman doesn't give away all her secrets," she said.
It was surprising, though, how common secret caches still seem to be. One 53-year-old woman who lives in Northern California and has been married for 25 years has been keeping a stash of money in her underwear drawer since she stopped working 20 years ago to become a homemaker. By skimming a little bit at a time from household funds, she sometimes has as much as $5,000 nestled in her lingerie.
"You sort of lose that financial independence when you don't have a paycheck," she said. "I wasn't used to having my spending scrutinized." She said her husband would think that the jewelry she loves to buy with her stash is a waste of money. Sometimes, she pays for part of a necklace out of their joint checking account and the rest from her underwear drawer.
Under the strictest interpretation of the what's-yours-is-mine-and-what's-mine-is-yours doctrine that seems to govern most couples' finances, this is an absolute violation. Secrets, this theory holds, are like hungry worms hollowing out your relationship until only a fragile husk remains. 
They also put a spotlight on your glaring deficiencies or most unshakable fears. The California woman says she also thinks of her stash as emergency money in case her husband decides to dump her and take up with a younger woman. Four of her friends, she said, have had that happen in their marriages in recent years. 
In our bare-all culture, the routine prescription is to confess everything. Be honest and be healed. But that approach only perpetuates a fiction that no couple can live up to: we agree on everything. Who does? And who really wants to? It's too bad that carving a few dollars out of the grocery money for a personal indulgence, or to soothe a fear, should make you feel like a sneak. 
"Not every dollar that comes into the house has to be stamped 'ours' and put into the system," said Steven Carter, author of "This Is How Love Works: Nine Essential Secrets You Need to Know" (M. Evans, 2001). "It's nice to have some relief from the we-ness."
Secret stashes may be a way to carve out your autonomy -- until you're found out. An acquaintance who lives in a New York City suburb has discovered her husband's small private stashes several times during nearly 30 years of marriage. As the family bill payer who sometimes had to postpone sending in a utility bill until their separate paychecks refilled their joint account, she felt duped. "Here I am, feeling short funded and he not only has money we need, he never experiences any anxiety," she said. Each breach also sets off wider suspicions. "It makes you wonder if there are other things you can't trust," she said.
I BLAME the tyranny of the joint checking account. It assumes that you'll both be perfectly consistent to financial policies to which you agreed as a couple. Wouldn't it be better to assume that you're both going to be inconsistent, except for the most important household expenses and goals? In other words, shouldn't you have separate checking accounts with, perhaps, one joint account for mutual expenses? 
Yes, that suggests that you are (gasp!) two different people with divergent desires. But that realization may do far more for your relationship than overseeing each other's spending.

HEADLINE: Executive Pay: A Special Report; 
A Remix in the Grants of Options and Stock

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
BEING an American chief executive means seldom having to make a financial sacrifice.
 As stock prices remained submerged, many experts expected companies to compensate their top officers with more stock but fewer stock options. Last year, companies came through on the first part. They handed out more stock over all in the form of restricted shares, helping their executives lock in some value. 
 But almost all of them also continued to give out options, according to a survey of 200 companies by Pearl Meyer & Partners, a pay consulting firm in New York. Although the average value of the grants fell along with the tumbling market, more than 40 percent of the companies giving grants raised the number of options they awarded, which could mean lucrative returns for their holders in a big market turnaround. 
"We're not seeing much of a cutback at all" in equity compensation, said Ann Yerger, deputy director of the Council of Institutional Investors in Washington. Though some executives are earning less incentive pay based on performance, she said, companies are making up for almost all, if not all, of that decline "with restricted stock awards and continued options grants." 
At the Clorox Company, G. Craig Sullivan received $3.75 million in restricted shares. He did not receive any in 2001. But he also received three times as many options in fiscal 2002, a year in which the company's profit was little changed. Mr. Sullivan received 1.1 million options with an estimated value of $14.4 million, up from 325,000 options, worth $4.9 million, in fiscal 2001, according to Pearl Meyer. 
Delta Air Lines gave Leo F. Mullin $2 million in restricted shares; he, too, did not receive any in 2001. He also received 963,000 options with an estimated value of $9 million, compared with 200,000 options in 2001, estimated to have been worth $3.8 million. 
At Abbott Laboratories, Miles D. White received $11.5 million in restricted stock and 635,000 options worth $11.2 million. All told, the company's proxy statement shows, the five highest-paid executives at Abbott received restricted shares worth a total of $31 million, up from $2.6 million in 2001. Together, they also received options on 1.7 million shares, up from 1.2 million in 2001. Abbott's shareholders, meanwhile, suffered a loss of 27 percent last year.
OF the 200 large corporations surveyed by Pearl Meyer, more than half, 104, gave their chief executives restricted shares last year. Slightly fewer than half, 97, did so in 2001. 
All told, the restricted shares and other long-term incentives handed out last year were worth $185 million, up from the $177 million in 2001. The average value received by each chief executive was $1.7 million, down from $1.8 million in 2001, but the share of total pay it represented rose to 16.3 percent, from 14 percent.
Shareholders have long criticized restricted stock as "free shares," given with no link to company performance. A decade ago, such stock was even less popular with shareholders than options are now, consultants said. The shares, which usually vest gradually over several years, drew scorn because they rewarded executives even if the stock price fell and did not recover.
Restricted stock is making a comeback because some executives, feeling burned by an overreliance on stock options, want a less risky form of pay. At many companies, restricted shares also offer a steady dividend stream. Holders of restricted shares earn dividends on them even before they can claim ownership of the shares.
And some reformers also came to see virtues in restricted stock, because the executives lose when the shares fall, just as shareholders do. That better aligns the interests of shareholders and executives, supporters have asserted.
Some companies did make a big shift away from options last year. Bank of America gave its chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, 164,624 restricted shares worth $11.3 million. He received none in 2001. Each of those shares currently pays a quarterly dividend of 64 cents, making the grant worth an additional $421,437 in annual dividends to Mr. Lewis. His options grant was reduced to 200,000 from 750,000 in 2001, a drop in estimated value of more than $10 million, according to Pearl Meyer.
Bank of America wanted "to really create transparency around executive compensation and how it's tied very specifically to performance and shareholder return," said Eloise Hale, a company spokeswoman.
Still, 176 of the 200 companies gave their chief executives stock options last year, compared with the 104 that gave restricted stock. That was about the same ratio as in 2001.
With the stock market down, the average estimated value of those grants declined to $6.3 million, from $9.1 million in 2001, and the average number of shares granted slipped about 4 percent, to 516,030. But 76 of the 176 companies that granted options gave more than the year before.
For the most part, options values are theoretical at the time the grants are made. Options give their holders the right to buy shares at a set price, usually the price of the underlying stock when the options were granted, during some future period. If the stock price never rises above the exercise price, the options should expire worthless.
Many of the options granted in recent years cannot now be exercised at a profit, a condition known as being underwater. A backlash from executives and employees holding these soggy pieces of paper has added to shareholders' growing opposition to options as a form of compensation.
"Options have been used excessively in an economic sense," said Ira T. Kay, national director of compensation consulting at Watson Wyatt & Company. In many cases, he said, large numbers of outstanding options have created the specter of significant dilution of companies' existing shares. "The shareholders are reacting to the high levels of dilution in a very negative way," he said.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has made executive compensation, and the use of stock options in particular, a centerpiece of its shareholder activism this year, said Richard L. Trumka, secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Labor unions have called for votes at several annual meetings this spring asking shareholders to ban the use of stock options altogether, Mr. Trumka said. At more than 100 others, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. is asking companies to limit options to those that have value only if the company outperforms a group of its peers, he said.
Doing so, Mr. Trumka said, would prevent executives from being automatically enriched "if the market would float up again and drag everybody upward."
Those sentiments help to explain the reduced frequency of exceptionally large grants of stock options to chief executives, pay consultants said. Of the 200 companies surveyed by Pearl Meyer, none gave its chief executive options worth more than $50 million in 2002. In 2001, four did.
THE days of exceptionally large grants should be over, said Joseph R. Rich, a compensation specialist at Clark/Bardes Consulting in Barrington, Ill., although he said the retreat from using options as pay may be gradual. Generally, he said, his clients, which are mostly technology companies, have shifted the mix of stock-based pay for chief executives to 35 percent restricted shares and 65 percent options, from a 20-80 blend in 2001.
"If you see a decline in the average grant this year, I think it will be because of a substantial decrease in megagrants of options," Mr. Rich said. "The governance world has created some concerns about the megagrant."
But it has not disappeared. The directors of Cisco Systems gave John T. Chambers six million options for the second consecutive year. But Mr. Chambers forfeited two million of them, leaving him with four million new options worth $43.9 million. The six million options he got in 2001 were worth an estimated $141 million, according to Pearl Meyer. Scott G. McNealy, chief executive of Sun Microsystems, got 3.5 million options worth $25.9 million, compared with 1.5 million options worth $15.3 million in 2001.

HEADLINE: Truly, Madly Driven: City Car Owners 

BYLINE:  By NANCY HASS 

 BODY:
FOR 90 minutes each weekday morning Steven Haft, a film producer, casts himself in the role of Modern American Dad. At precisely 7:15 a.m., he pulls his Mitsubishi Montero out of the garage and loads up his three children, ages 6 to 14, for school. "I feel very Ward Cleaver about it," he said.
 One small difference though: The Beaver lived in the suburbs, where ferrying the brood around in an S.U.V. has become an avocation for many parents. Mr. Haft, 50, on the other hand, lives in an apartment on East End Avenue in Manhattan, a city famous for potholes, tedious traffic, roulette-style street parking and $25-an-hour garages. 
 His morning excursion, which involves drop-offs on both sides of Manhattan as well as Riverdale before arriving at his Midtown office, would give the average highway-only driver heart failure and inspire derision from New Yorkers who consider a Metrocard a badge of honor. But Mr. Haft is unbowed. He will do anything for the pleasure of driving. In fact, one of the things that convinced Mr. Haft to move three years ago with his wife, the humorist Lisa Birnbach, from an apartment closer to the Lexington Avenue subway line was "having a really great excuse to have to take the car everywhere." 
It turns out that Mr. Haft is not alone in his determination to drive in a city that seems to taunt those who long for the open road. As most Manhattanites compete for taxis and subway seats, a small but quietly defiant group of Manhattanites drive their cars daily, going to great lengths -- and often great expense -- to construct a life that mirrors suburbia in its veneration of the automobile.
Bruce McCall, the writer and illustrator who chronicles the purgatory of Manhattan driving and parking with a Blakian intensity, cut his teeth in Detroit as a copywriter for car companies. "I am wedded to the automotive solution," he said. 
Every weekday Mr. McCall drives his wife 15 blocks to work, and usually drives himself to lunch. He has not been on the subway in 15 years, and as for cabs, he said: "Every time I take one, it's an admission of defeat. I don't know what the principle is but I seem to be defending it fiercely." 
Traffic experts suspect that an increasing number of Manhattanites are using their cars as a primary means of transportation. Although tracking studies are not up to date, Sam Schwartz, a private traffic consultant, said he believes that the number of drivers has risen significantly over the last decade as the result of the liberalization of parking regulation in the Giuliani era, an influx of affluent people and fear of terrorism after Sept. 11, 2001.
Mr. Schwartz said that as of the mid-1990's, at least 12 percent of the cars that venture each day into the city's central business district -- defined as Manhattan below 60th street -- were owned by people who live in the borough, often less than a mile or two away. "It could be above 12 percent now, but even that is not insignificant," he said. "If there was a 12 percent reduction in traffic, you would really be able to feel it."
Drivers, however, are entrenched. "I consider using my car unnecessarily as one of the great joys of my life," said Peter Boyle, the actor, who, like Mr. Haft, lives on East End Avenue. Mr. Boyle starts most days with a stroll to the bank for a roll of quarters (he considers it unsportsmanlike to use a garage when he is out and about). He takes his Mercedes station wagon everywhere, even to Elaine's, which is only a block or two away from his home. "Being dedicated to your car here is a test of your patience and cunning," he said. "And there's better radio reception than in the house."
Whatever their reasons, Manhattan drivers do seem to have one thing in common -- most grew up in places where cars meant freedom.
Judy Hart, who is married to a screenwriter, decided to "live like a suburban housewife with a Ford Explorer," even though her home is in the East 70's. To that end, she drove her two children to and from private school for 12 years. A legend in the elite school set, Ms. Hart developed a ferry service for others as well. Her children's schoolmates would wait at designated corners for the "Hartmobile." "It was much nicer than the bus," she said, "I brought juice and water for them all."
Many Manhattan car enthusiasts acknowledge that theirs is not the most civic-minded of urban pursuits. Ms. Birnbach, conceded that she feels "politically terrible" about how much she and her husband drive in town. "Being a good New Yorker is merging with people," she said, "being a bad New Yorker is being isolated in your car." But driving her children around -- she takes over for Mr. Haft when he's not around -- gives her time with them that is often hard to find. "When you're in someone's cab, your kid may not say what she's really thinking -- there's the radio and the guy is on the cellphone," she said. "But when you're alone with her in your car after school and they're sort of exhausted, they vent."
John Kaehny, executive director of Transportations Alternatives, a nonprofit traffic watchdog group based in Manhattan, is not sympathetic. "It's outrageous, snobbish behavior and a huge imposition on society as a whole," he said of those who insist on driving. "Economists estimate that each vehicle in Manhattan does $1.50 a mile of damage in noise and congestion, not to mention how it weakens the infrastructure. This is not what Manhattan is about. It degrades everyone's quality of life." 
A spokesman for the city department of transportation, Tom Cocola, said that Manhattanites wed to their cars add to a congestion problem that in the long run hampers the city economy. "We can understand instances where people opt for cars, such as parents dropping their children off to school," he said, "but nonetheless we encourage Manhattan residents to follow Mayor Bloomberg's lead and take mass transit. Other options include bicycling and good old-fashioned walking."
According to anecdotal reports from mechanics and garage attendants, Manhattanites who rely on their automobiles fall roughly into three groups: those who can afford the more than $300 monthly fees for a garage, entrepreneurs who use their cars for work as well as play (their flexible hours help them avoid rush hour) and budget-minded drivers who park on the street, their vehicles often held together with baling wire and duct tape. 
The upscale drivers seem to live largely on the Upper East Side, with a high percentage in areas like Sutton Place and East End Avenue, far from public transportation and near garages. The plucky street parkers tend to cluster in neighborhoods like the East Village or far west Chelsea and Clinton. These neighborhoods, also far from the subway, have fewer meters and fewer parking regulations than more crowded areas.
"If you're crazy enough to really use your car in Manhattan, you're either a rich car lover or the mellow type who looks like they miss the 60's, driving around in a heap all day that you should have gotten rid of years ago," said Michael Bagwin, an owner of Bagwin Brothers, a Queens repair shop popular with Manhattanites. "Basically there's no one in between, no regular Joes."
It's not hard to figure out what category Andrew San Marco fits into. A 38-year-old commodities trader who lives on Fifth Avenue and 68th Street, Mr. San Marco keeps three of his five Mercedes in the city and drives to his office near Wall Street each morning. He leaves his uptown garage at precisely 6:45 a.m. and pulls into his downtown garage "exactly 14 minutes later," he said. "I catch the same lights every day. It's down to a science."
While many New Yorkers wince at the idea of subjecting a new car to potholes and the manhandling of garage attendants, Mr. San Marco has bought 25 Mercedes in the last four years for his personal fleet, he said, trading them in every eight months or so. "I know I'm a nut, but the fact is that even if I have to go just a block," he said, "I still take my car. I feel naked without it."
Caleb MacArthur, a 27-year-old writer who lives in a studio on Avenue C near Seventh Street, belongs to the other end of the spectrum. When he agreed to move with his girlfriend to Manhattan from Portland, Ore., last year, keeping his 1983 Subaru hatchback was a nonnegotiable demand. So instead of bartending to pay the bills, which he had done in Portland, he took a job using his car to deliver for a wholesale florist on West 26th Street. "I've had that car since I was 16 and I just don't feel whole without it," he said. "For me, it's like having a pet. You don't just dump it when you move to an inconvenient place."
Generally, he said, he is able to find an overnight parking spot within seven or eight blocks of his apartment. Every morning by 5:30 he pulls up in front of the shop and puts on the hazard lights. Within minutes he is back with five or six plants to be delivered. "I virtually never park, at least not in a legal space," he said. "But I'm very fast. I drop off the stuff and I fly." In the last year he has received only nine tickets, he said, with obvious pride. He calls them the "the price of doing business." One day he plans to pay them.

HEADLINE: Hummer H2: An Army Of One 

BYLINE:  By JAMES G. COBB 

 BODY:
LIKE an Art Deco skyscraper or a top 40 dance hit, a car is a time capsule for the age that produced it. Is there a better symbol of the naive optimism of the Eisenhower years than the 1959 Cadillac Eldorado, its exuberant, erotic tailfins puncturing the homogenity of the 50's, pointing toward a new era of space exploration, sexual liberation and technological revolution?
 When future generations look back, they may well see the Hummer H2 as the four-wheel icon of our time. With troops at war and gasoline prices gyrating, with civilians stockpiling gas masks and duct tape to ward off unseen perils, with capitalists and environmentalists squaring off over the attractions and evils of S.U.V.'s, these hulking quasi-military utility vehicles are hardly irrelevant to the national discourse. 
 For a world full of danger, the H2 girds you in armor -- in appearance, if not in fact -- for highways where road rage may get you if terrorists do not, where the gridlock of aggressive utility vehicles make it every woman (or man) for herself (or himself). Driving a Hummer makes a unilateral personal statement in sync with a unilateral foreign policy. 
"Drive defensively" signs in some states say, but Hummers are proactive and pre-emptive. The H2 reminds me of a Barron's cartoon I keep on my desk: a genteel couple are checking out a towering S.U.V. in a showroom. "Drive this baby," the salesman assures them, "and most of the rules of the road won't apply to you."
Certainly, some rules do not apply, like fuel economy regulations. The Chevrolet Tahoe, with which the H2 shares many parts, must display its mileage rating, but the Hummer goes unrated because its loaded weight exceeds the 8,500-pound threshold.
Hummers are so mighty that they scare away the tax man! One New Jersey dealership has been heavily promoting a first-year tax deduction of $36,524 that small-business owners may claim if they buy an H2 or another equally heavy S.U.V.
For General Motors, which bought the rights to Hummer in late 1999 (though American General builds the vehicles in Mishawaka, Ind.), the H2 is a bright spot in a dim market. Hummer dealers say the war in Iraq has increased showroom traffic, lifting sales of both trucks and trinkets. It is no coincidence that Hummers were the sole exclusions to the lavish buyer incentives G.M. announced last week, including five years of interest-free financing.
"Nothing screams 'American' like driving a Hummer," Tom Bowlin, product manager of a dealership in Cerritos, Calif., told Automotive News. In the Persian Gulf, it is the H2's stepbrother, the military Humvee, that screams American, in a war that has, at the least, a tangential connection to world oil supplies and American gasoline prices.
With more Hummers on the road, ample supplies will be needed. With mileage estimated at 10 to 13 m.p.g. on average -- though I barely exceeded 11 m.p.g. while driving two H2's a total of 2,000 miles -- Hummers are among the least fuel-efficient passenger vehicles sold in the United States.
No one buys a Hummer for its mileage, of course, and to many of the new customers the vehicle's considerable off-road capabilities are incidental, too. Often, the H2's mission is to attract attention, an assignment it handles with ease.
I first drove an H2 last summer, when they were quite rare, then used one to make a New York-Detroit round trip in January in near-blizzard conditions. They received all the attention they deserved, including shouts of "Yo, Schwarzenegger!" as I rolled through Harlem. (An understandable case of mistaken identity.) What I hadn't expected was to find women, usually in their 30's with children in tow, admiring the Hummer nearly every time I parked it in upstate New York. Several times they stood waiting, questions ready, for the driver to appear.
Indeed, more than a quarter of H2 buyers are women, and many others play a role in the purchase decisions of men. This has not been lost on Hummer's marketing department, which introduced heavy artillery into the war of the sexes with an ad that suggested, "Threaten men in a whole new way."
Intimidation is part of the package, and this is not necessarily a bad thing. Manic cabbies don't mess with Hummers, which are also persuasive against left-lane road hogs on the Interstate. Drivers who dawdle in the passing lane, refusing to move right no matter what, eventually take the hint when a taxi-yellow H2 fills their mirrors.
The H2 is plenty big, though it looks larger than it is -- partly because all the components were set on or above the frame, partly because the windows are shallow and the sides are vertical. The truck is actually shorter and not much taller than a Tahoe, and the lack of overhangs beyond the tires is a boon to off-roading; you can roll right up and over a 30-inch wall. The H2 can ford 20 inches of water and climb over 16-inch rocks.
The H2 has little in common with the original Hummer, the H1, beyond their look. Both wear a seven-bar grille (one that DaimlerChrysler unsuccessfully tried to stop G.M. from using, asserting that it infringed on a Jeep trademark). The H1, a somewhat civilized version of the military Humvee, costs more than $100,000 and has a diesel engine with awesome pulling power; the $50,000 H2 borrows its 6-liter gasoline V-8 from various G.M. trucks. The H2 also has a sophisticated electronic four-wheel-drive system that offers five driving modes, including a low gear range with a locking rear differential.
While H1 is cramped and noisy, H2 is comfortable and reasonably quiet. But first you must get in, and the first step up is a 25-inch doozy. Unless you play professional basketball or don't mind ripping your inseams, the optional running boards are essential.
Once the driver has clambered onto the overstuffed captain's chair -- with individual armrest and multiple power adjustments -- he or she can practically look long-haul truckers in the eye. In keeping with the big-rig theme, the H2 has clearance lights around the roof.
Although spacious and plush, the cabin is no more subtle than the exterior. The focal points are huge round vents that protrude from the dashboard, including a pair in the middle reminiscent of the cone-shaped bras that Madonna used to wear. The shift lever for the four-speed automatic, the only transmission offered, is a wide, thick bar of the sort that Buck Rogers might have used to engage warp drive.
The controls work well enough -- save for the antiquated multifunction turn-signal stalk that G.M. won't let go -- though there are lots of bits and pieces to the interior, in the company's usual fashion. And the quality of the dash materials, especially plastic panels with an unconvincing metallic look, are unlikely to age well.
Like other big G.M. utilities, the H2 drives well enough for its size, and it seems to shrink as you roll up the miles. The steering has quite a bit of free play, like a Jeep's, but that is a boon if you crawl over boulders. An electronic air suspension can raise the rear of the vehicle two inches over the normal ride height, also useful for off-roading.
Writing for these pages last year, Cheryl Jensen described how well the H2 handled a 1,000-mile trip, entirely off road, down the Baja peninsula. That is certainly more of a workout than I gave my H2 test trucks, and more of an adventure than most owners will seek out.
Towing capacity is an impressive 7,000 pounds, which is a good thing, because there is not a lot of room for cargo inside the cabin. The gargantuan spare tire takes up nearly a third of the space behind the second seat, and the optional third-row jump seat is wedged in beside it. Fortunately, Hummer has begun to offer an outside mount for the spare.
And the company promises a more comprehensive solution to the shortage of cargo space: a pickup version of the H2, to be called the H2 S.U.T., is due to arrive in a year. A line of smaller, less expensive vehicles, the H3, seems likely, too -- Hummers for hoi polloi.
H1's are selling slowly now, as their prices have risen and their novelty has worn off. Too, the H2 may be stealing some of its older brother's thunder. The H2 factory is working hard to keep up with demand, and since that plant can turn out 40,000 H2's annually, you can expect to see a lot more of them -- on urban streets, in hip-hop videos, in the stadium lots where professional athletes park their trophy cars. The crime scene investigators on "CSI: Miami" have one, helping them cope with the challenging driving conditions of sunny South Florida.
Some customers will surely take their H2's over the hills and into the woods, but for many the image is everything. The H2 is larger-than-life proof that motor vehicles continue to evolve into fashion accessories. You can wear Armani or camouflage, a Mini car or a maxi truck.
Already, some Hummers are being personalized with flashy megawheels and ultra-low-profile tires, rendering these off-road brutes barely capable of coping with a pothole.
Decadance takes many forms, and a low-rider Hummer is surely one of them. If today's scary world doesn't quite make sense, perhaps it follows that what we drive may not make a lot of sense, either.

INSIDE TRACK: A big fat moving target in the S.U.V. war of words.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
If Chiefs Are Fed Up, Why Do They Stay?

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
SO much for the idea of the reluctant chief executive.
 After the business scandals last year, executives -- along with the headhunters and pay consultants they hire -- predicted that top corporate jobs would lose some of their appeal. Rather than face new scrutiny, some executives would simply retire, while some up-and-comers would shun the corner office, the theory held. 
 "The chance to run a public company used to be most executives' dream," The Wall Street Journal wrote in June. "Now the thrill is gone." 
David F. D'Alessandro, chief executive of John Hancock Financial Services, told The New York Times last year that the leader of another company talked to him about feeling sullied by the scandals, even though his company was healthy. "My God, what a terrible time to be a C.E.O," the chief executive said, according to Mr. D'Alessandro. "I'm thinking of actually getting out, retiring. I didn't sign up for this."
But the theory was never very convincing. Think about it: if you had nothing to hide and only had to answer some tough questions, would you quit a job that allowed you to shape the future of communities and make millions of dollars?
It turns out that the nation's chief executives wouldn't, either. Of the nation's 200 largest companies, only 11 have made a change at the top since July, according to Pearl Meyer & Partners, a pay consulting firm. Seven of the departing executives were ousted by the board or resigned under pressure, according to news reports. An eighth, Richard Jay Kogan of the drug maker Schering-Plough, quit after announcing a sharp fall in profits.
Another chief executive completed a long-planned succession, and John W. Snow left CSX to become the Treasury secretary.
Only Dean O'Hare, of Chubb, the insurance company, comes close to fitting the image of the fed-up executive, but he is hardly a perfect example. After 14 years on the job, Mr. O'Hare left in the midst of a personal controversy in which his neighbors in New Jersey had complained to newspapers about his habit of using loud machinery to do yard work late at night. They even tried to pass a new noise ordinance. Mr. O'Hare has said his resignation was not related to the dispute.
So the theory of the reluctant executive has little factual support. But there are reasons for its continued popularity.
During the roaring economy of the late 90's, chief executives said their enormous pay increases were fair rewards for their stewardship. After three years of weak profits and falling stocks, however, the pay-for-performance explanation is less credible.
In its place has come the notion that only a rare few can manage a company under current conditions. Lose a leader, and a company might just buckle, some argue.
Cooper Industries, the manufacturer, and Union Pacific, the railroad company, were apparently so afraid of losing their chief executives that each awarded multimillion-dollar retention grants last year. H. John Riley Jr. has been in charge of Cooper since 1995 and Richard K. Davidson has led Union Pacific since 1996. In each case, the company's share price is lower now than on the day the executive took over.
MANY other boards have given big stock grants to executives whose fortunes had already been closely tied to those of their companies. Pay for the median chief executive rose 6 percent last year, according to Pearl Meyer. 
The law of supply and demand does not explain this. By any measure, boards should have gained leverage in the last few years and reclaimed some of the outsized pay packages on behalf of shareholders.
But unlike the rest of the economy, where wages have stagnated, the market for chief executives bears little resemblance to a free market. Instead, many boards -- made up largely of other executives -- allow executives to help decide how they will be paid. It is a welfare system of sorts, where pay increases regardless of supply and demand.
In better times, executive pay could be dismissed as a sideshow. That is not as true now, with corporate America trying to convince investors of its credibility.
Investors "continue to doubt the quality of internal governance and external oversight, as well as the reliability of the information corporations provide," William J. McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said recently. Those doubts are restraining growth, he said.
They will not disappear until executives come up with a more convincing explanation for their paychecks -- or take the radical step of allowing those paychecks to be set by the rules of capitalism.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds Report; 
Bonds Eclipse Stocks in Emerging Markets

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
IVESTING in emerging stock markets has always been risky for mutual fund managers, but finding rising markets has become even more challenging lately.
 Eleven of 28 emerging markets rose in the first quarter, but some markets were so small that many fund managers missed them entirely. Only 7 of 133 emerging-markets mutual funds tracked by Morningstar rose in the quarter, and 41 percent fell more than the Morgan Stanley Capital International index for this sector, a widely used benchmark. 
 The war in Iraq and a weak global economy are likely to make it more difficult to choose winning stock markets, and buying emerging-markets bonds, which have performed better, may require greater skill.
"I do believe you need to be fairly selective," said Geoffrey Dennis, an emerging-markets equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. He likes Brazil and Mexico because they would benefit from a revival of the American economy. The prospect of lower oil prices makes him less interested in Russia. South Africa, a good defensive play, is a bet only if the world's developed markets continue to stumble, he said. 
Philip Ehrmann, head of Pacific and emerging markets at Gartmore Investment Management in London, agreed. "It will not be a case of a rising tide lifting all boats," he said. "That is why I am not saying that the whole asset class will go up in one fell swoop."
Mr. Ehrmann is also avoiding Russia and is wondering how much tourism in markets like Thailand will be hurt by the respiratory illness known as SARS, that was discovered in Asia. He said the Czech Republic, although a good performer, is too small and only a "one- or two-stock journey" for him.
Emerging-markets bonds, on the other hand, have been reasonably easy pickings, in part because of a big rush of new money this year into emerging-markets bond mutual funds, which have performed well the last several years. According to AMG Data Services, $581 million has flowed into those funds through last week, or 108 percent of the total inflows for all of 2002.
Mohamed El-Erian, head of emerging-markets portfolio management at Pimco, which had the best-performing emerging-markets bond fund last quarter, said he expected the good performance to continue because yields were attractive and many investors were hungry for them. But he said that choosing among these markets would test money managers. 
"You have to differentiate because some countries have gotten to unattractive valuation levels," he said, citing Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. He also said that some markets, including Turkey, Venezuela and Argentina, were just too risky to bet on.
In the first quarter, five of the seven emerging-markets equity mutual funds with positive returns focused on China, Morningstar said. Twelve of the top 25 performers, with an average return of 0.7 percent, concentrated on Asia and the Pacific. Nine others focused on Latin America, with an average decline of 1.2 percent. The average return for emerging-markets mutual funds over all was a decline of 6 percent.
The Gartmore Emerging Markets fund, of which Mr. Ehrmann is co-manager, had 13 percent of its money in Taiwan at the end of January and 9 percent in Brazil. Both were up for the quarter. But its biggest bet was 20.3 percent in South Korea, where the MSCI emerging-markets index in dollar terms plunged 19.1 percent. Over all, the fund had a 5.3 percent decline in the quarter, less than the 6.8 percent decline for the MSCI index.
MANY of the better-performing markets are so small that they rarely pop up on managers' radar screens. The best performer, Argentina, up 19.1 percent in dollar terms for the quarter, is such a tiny part of the MSCI index -- 0.57 percent -- that it would not play a big role in many broad emerging-markets portfolios.
Israel had been in the red until March. But as war in Iraq became a certainty, the market rebounded, just as Wall Street did. Israel's market was also helped by the Bush administration's sudden focus on reaching an Israeli-Palestinian settlement. The MSCI index for Israel rose 7 percent for the quarter, but many managers missed this late surge.
That left three bigger emerging markets -- Brazil, Taiwan and China, the new powerhouse -- to carry the ball for many money managers. Brazil's market was down in local currency, but rose 3.7 percent in dollar terms because of the weakening of the dollar against the real. Taiwan, the third-largest market in MSCI's emerging-markets universe, stumbled on the quarter's last day, turning a 1.1 percent gain to a 2.8 percent loss.
China also plunged on March 31, producing a quarterly loss of 1.5 percent. China is still a difficult country for many managers because many of its stocks are not available for sale to foreigners, though that is expected to change soon. Mr. Ehrmann now buys stocks of Chinese companies that trade in Hong Kong. When Chinese companies do become available to foreign investors, he said, many are likely to be too expensive to be immediately attractive.
For the quarter, emerging markets, on average, still fared better than developed stock markets outside the United States.
Over all, the MSCI emerging-markets index fell 6.8 percent last quarter, versus a 8.8 percent decline for a widely used benchmark for developed markets, the MSCI Europe, Australasia and Far East index, or EAFE.The last quarter was the sixth in the last eight in which emerging markets outperformed developed foreign markets.
Investors may have expected the weak dollar to improve the returns of their overseas investments, by reducing their losses or increasing their gains when translated back into dollars. If so, many people were disappointed. Although the foreign currency news focused on the dollar's 2.8 percent decline against the euro in the first quarter, it was stronger against 11 of 28 emerging-markets currencies and essentially unchanged against four others.
The dollar helped investors the most by falling 11.3 percent against the Argentine peso, turning a 5.6 percent gain into the 19.1 percent surge. But the dollar's rise against the South Korean won increased a 14.4 percent loss to 19.1 percent decline. The dollar's climb against the Mexican peso doubled that stock market's loss to 6.4 percent.
On the other hand, emerging-markets bonds brought overall returns of 6.6 percent, according to J. P. Morgan's index, with Ivory Coast, 34.8 percent, and Ecuador, 31.2 percent, leading a long list of positive total returns.
Of the 31 countries in that J. P. Morgan index, only four had negative quarterly returns: Turkey, Venezuela, Uruguay and South Korea.
Turkey's bond market had a loss of 9.9 percent, in part because Turkey shares a border with Iraq and refused to let the United States use it as a base for military operations in northern Iraq. Venezuela, where the return on bonds was a negative 6 percent, is still reeling from the strike that shut its oil industry.
The emerging-markets bond funds followed by Morningstar had an average return of 8.2 percent in the first quarter. They were led by Pimco's Emerging Markets Bond fund, up 10.5 percent.
"That is the difference between buying the index and being selective," said Mr. El-Erian of Pimco's performance.

HEADLINE: Domestic Security: The Line Starts Here 

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
ONLY three months in town, and Charles E. McQueary has found himself just about the most popular man in wartime Washington. Powerful lobbyists and corporate executives track down his new telephone number and call him unannounced; strangers buttonhole him in the halls of Congress, hoping for a few precious minutes of his time.
 Dr. McQueary, a former executive of General Dynamics and Bell Laboratories, is the newly confirmed undersecretary for science and technology in the Department of Homeland Security. In that job, he will influence how the giant new agency and the rest of the federal government spend tens of billions of dollars on technology to defend American soil from terrorist attacks. 
 A genial, Texas-born engineering Ph.D., Dr. McQueary is now the government's chief contact with the scientists, technicians and entrepreneurs who are searching for ways to help their companies profit from the public's understandable fixation with keeping their families and communities safe from terrorism -- a threat that probably has grown as a result of the war with Iraq. 
Dr. McQueary got a taste of his newfound celebrity when, seconds after he finished testifying at his Senate confirmation hearing last month, he was approached in the hearing room by an entrepreneur who wanted to promote data-mining software that might help in the government's hunt for terrorists.
"I gave him an e-mail address," said Dr. McQueary, who has established a special e-mail account for dealing with the sudden crush of lobbyists, corporate executives and hand-to-mouth entrepreneurs who want to pitch their domestic-security wares. (science.technology@dhs.gov).
"Through my whole professional career, I always answered my own telephone, but it's rapidly getting to the point where that's not feasible anymore," said Dr. McQueary, who says he is more excited than beleaguered by his assignment. "I don't know if inundated is the right word, but we certainly are hearing from a number of people with ideas. And some of them are very good ideas."
The domestic-security industry may be new, a legacy of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the widespread fear among intelligence agencies that Americans will be a central terrorist target for years to come.
But most components of the industry are well established; the largest players include major military contractors, giant electronics makers and private security companies looking for new markets for their expertise.
HOWEVER defined, the domestic-security market is huge -- and growing. There are as many different sales forecasts for the industry as there are research groups doing the estimating. But all of the industry's multibillion-dollar forecasts are bullish.
An industry-supported institute called the Homeland Security Research Corporation, in San Jose, Calif., predicts that overall public and private spending on domestic security will jump to $120 billion to $180 billion in 2008 from $65 billion this year.
Another trade group, the Government Electronics and Information Technology Association of Arlington, Va., says its tabulation shows that federal spending on domestic-security technology will reach $13 billion in the current fiscal year and rise to $14.6 billion in the 2008 fiscal year, a figure that does not include inflation.
Critics have said the Bush administration is devoting too little money to the Department of Homeland Security, the new superdepartment that is consolidating the work of 22 federal agencies. The White House is seeking an overall budget forthe department of about $38 billion next year, a 7 percent increase.
Lawmakers from both parties seem determined to spend billions more on domestic security, especially given the renewed worries about terrorism threats, and the administration seems likely to bow to their pressure.
Beyond Washington, state and local governments face similar huge demands to increase security spending, as does private industry, which is confronted with billions of dollars a year in new security costs, especially for companies considered likely terrorist targets, like airlines, chemical manufacturers and nuclear power generators.
"The money is just beginning to flow," said Bruce Aitken, a Washington lawyer and lobbyist who is president of the Homeland Security Industries Association, a trade group that has signed up more than 100 companies as members since it was incorporated in July. They include the giant government contractors Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Bechtel and Fluor.
"We think that the United States is extremely vulnerable to terrorist attack," said Mr. Aitken, who is about to announce the establishment of a political action committee to promote the industry's interests on the campaign trail. "We've got a lot of weak links, and it's going to take a lot of money to get that changed."
No military contractor is as closely associated with the war in Iraq as Raytheon, which makes the Tomahawk and Patriot missile systems; the war began last month when dozens of Tomahawks slammed into targets in Baghdad. But the company, based in Lexington, Mass., is eager to be seen these days as the government contractor of choice when it comes to dealing with enemies who might strike closer to home.
WITHIN days of the terror attacks in September 2001, Raytheon announced Project Yankee, a companywide effort to determine how its military expertise and products might be converted to use in domestic counterterrorism. In June, the company took the next step, formally creating a new division based in Falls Church, Va., outside Washington, to oversee its domestic-security business.
Its first major product is now arriving on the market, a $250,000 command-and-control vehicle called the First Responder, which is a Chevy Suburban sport utility vehicle packed with communications equipment and antennas allowing emergency-response agencies to communicate with one another even if they use different radio frequencies.
Raytheon officials say that in a major terrorist attack, the vehicle would overcome some of the logistical problems that hampered the disaster scenes in Lower Manhattan and the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, when emergency workers using different, incompatible communications equipment poured in to help from cities and towns hundreds of miles away.
"The First Responder is just coming off the assembly line," said Dale Craig, a retired Army communications specialist who joined Raytheon after 30 years in the military; he is now directing the First Responder program. "This is a product whose time is here."
The first of the vehicles is bound for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, and Raytheon said it was in negotiations with almost 300 potential buyers, including many police and fire departments around the country.
Another military contractor, Northrop Grumman, is working with a small high-technology company in Bedford, N.H., Imaging Automation, to promote security systems that would allow the federal government to quickly authenticate passports, visas and other documents presented at security checkpoints.
The Imaging Automation system, which usesa small glass-top metal box on which a document can be scanned in seconds for signs of forgery, has already been sold to the governments of Hungary and Australia, to the British airports authority and to Logan Airport in Boston, where it is used to verify documents presented by potential employees.
Imaging Automation, which has 60 employees, is a private company and does not release its financial results. But Bill Thalheimer, the chief executive, said he expected sales to double this year over last, and to triple next year from this year. "And that's all exclusive of what the federal government might want to do," he said.
In an age of terrorist threats and fears, the opportunities of the market reach beyond high technology, and companies that make basic home security and alarm systems are also poised to benefit.
Anyone who visited a supermarket or hardware store in early February, when the White House raised the color-coded terrorism alert and urged the public to stock up on basic survival supplies, understands that American families are willing to spend freely on their own protection.
After a year of corporate scandal and criminal charges against executives, the employees of Tyco International were probably entitled to a little good news, and they got it as a result of the February alert. Tyco is one of the world's largest makers of duct tape, and demand was so strong for its Nashua-brand tape that it switched the production line at its Kentucky plant to making residential duct tape instead of the commercial variety.
WHILE much of the early business of the Department of Homeland Security seems likely to go to large government contractors that have the track record and lobbying muscle to make themselves quickly known to the new agency, the department says it wants to serve as an incubator to innovative small and midsize companies.
"We're going to find there are some real good ideas from small companies," said Dr. McQueary, who is expected to spend much of his first several months at the department deciding on technology to help secure border checkpoints to block the entry of terrorists and their weapons.
He said he was trying to set aside time each week to meet with small, creative inventors who had domestic-security ideas that big contractors might have overlooked. "I had an individual come by to see me the other day with an idea for a secure manhole cover," Dr. McQueary said. "I was happy to give him 15 minutes. It's a manhole cover that couldn't be easily lifted out of its recess, and so terrorists couldn't easily get in and hide. Not a bad idea."

HEADLINE: ON THE CONTRARY; 
It's Time to Land This Reward System

BYLINE:  By DANIEL AKST; Daniel Akst's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IMAGINE a world where columnists are treated like chief executives. Instead of relying on my sense of professional responsibility -- and my need for continued employment -- the publications I write for would ensure my first-rate performance by showering me with an annual compensation package that would make Croesus blush.
 Then imagine the heights of punditry I could reach if only somebody gave me thousands of stock options every year, not to mention a huge salary, a personal assistant or two and lavish perks. Thus incentivized, my output of profound insights and shimmering prose would make H. L. Mencken seem a minor leaguer. 
 But in the real world, unfortunately, a writer's pay is somewhat more modest, and so we carelessly fling around jargon like "incentivized." Is it any wonder? 
If the notion that columnists need millions of dollars of motivation is ridiculous, so is the corporate practice of granting boatloads of stock options to chief executives and other top managers. In fact, the whole system of performance-based compensation for senior management is a mockery and ought to be abandoned. If these people can't do a decent job for a few hundred thousand dollars a year in cash, they ought to be fired, just like the rest of us.
The latest evidence that the system has derailed comes to us on the wings of the airlines. (This is just the kind of mixed metaphor you get when a columnist isn't properly incentivized). The main qualification for running an airline, it seems, is a willingness to demand federal aid. The airlines enjoyed a $15 billion federal bailout after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and now they're back in Congress demanding more.
Although it may seem logical to compensate the chief executives with a percentage of whatever they can get out of Washington, the industry clings to the old-fashioned system, which means high pay and stock options. When times are good, airline chief executives, like their counterparts in other industries, are paid a fortune. When times are bad, they still become rich. 
Consider Delta Air Lines, which lost $1.27 billion last year. It recently disclosed that Leo F. Mullin, its chief executive, received a pay package in 2002 worth about $13.8 million. Mr. Mullin magnanimously reduced his salary, which is only a small part of his total compensation, by 10 percent effective March 1, to demonstrate what the company has called "his commitment to share the burden of Delta's cost reduction goals." On Thursday, Mr. Mullin went further, cutting his pay by $9.1 million. One can only imagine the belt-tightening that will be required to live on the remaining few million. 
Continental Airlines, which lost $451 million last year, awarded its chief executive, Gordon Bethune, a pay package worth $7.6 million excluding options. Mr. Bethune apparently is not easily motivated, because the company felt it was necessary to add options that can be valued at $7.1 million.
How can airline executives be paid so much when the industry is losing money, shedding workers and appealing for government aid? Pearl Meyer, a veteran executive-compensation consultant, tells astory about a single day in which she visited two companies.
First, there was a fast-growing high-technology company that wanted a chief executive in keeping with its aggressive image of itself. How much did it want to pay? "In the 75th percentile," came the answer. Then Mrs. Meyer visited an industrial company struggling with decline. Executives there sometimes had the unpleasant task of closing plants and letting workers go. They also needed a chief executive -- and they were convinced that the job was so tough that they had to pay in the 75th percentile.
All this high pay notwithstanding, the chief executive is probably less important than corporate directors seem to think. 
Rakesh Khurana, a professor at the Harvard Business School whose book "Searching for a Corporate Savior" (Princeton University Press, 2002) is subtitled, "The Irrational Quest for Charismatic C.E.O.'s," says 30 to 50 percent of a company's performance depends on the industry it is in, while another 20 percent depends on the economy. Both factors amount to luck. That seems to be one thing that America's chief executives have in spades.

HEADLINE: Executive Pay: A Special Report; 
The Hunt for Clarity In Proxy Statements

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
MORE than a decade ago, the Securities and Exchange Commission began requiring companies to report salaries, bonuses and some other forms of executive pay in easy-to-read tables. Hoping to give investors a clear view of a growing cost, the commission told companies that they could no longer describe this pay in undecipherable paragraphs.
 Since then, however, the ways that executives become multimillionaires have expanded, again leaving investors, regulators and the rest of the public in the dark about much of corporate compensation. 
 Long after executives have retired, they receive generous benefits that are rarely spelled out. Boards of directors pay executives based on performance standards that can be impossible to understand. Directors themselves are being paid more handsomely for their services. Most significant, top executives and other managers have received enough pay in the form of stock that they own large, but difficult to calculate, portions of their companies. 
"The S.E.C. reporting requirements were created for an environment that's changed," said Joseph R. Blasi, a management professor at Rutgers University. 
"Our corporate system gives a lot of equity to executives and employees," Mr. Blasi said. "Shareholders have a right to know about it."
Tightening disclosure rules would create work for companies and add costs, which makes many wary of changes. But many pay experts argue that companies have already compiled most of the important data and that the benefits of releasing it to shareholders outweigh the costs.
"These are the kind of issues that are destroying confidence in the market," said Judith Fischer, managing director of Executive Compensation Advisory Services, a research company in Alexandria, Va. 
Following are the main suggestions from shareholder-rights advocates and management professors:
* Unmask veiled compensation. Executives often receive the equivalent of millions of dollars from special retirement plans, company-paid insurance policies, investment accounts with guaranteed interest rates and lifetime perks. Disclosure advocates say the S.E.C. can help investors by requiring tables -- for both current and retired executives -- similar to the one that now exists for salary and bonus.
* Increase accountability. Many companies spend millions of dollars on pay consultants who work with top executives to design their compensation. If companies named their consulting company in the proxy, investors could object to one that became known for outsized packages, said Carol M. Bowie, director of corporate governance at the Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington. She added that in the section of the proxy covering performance goals, companies should be required to compare themselves with peers based on a couple of simple measures, like net income and stock return. If the board still wanted to give bonuses to executives even when a company lagged behind, she said, investors would at least know what was happening. 
* Include the board. Recent scandals have increased scrutiny of directors, but information about them remains scant in proxies. In one place, Ms. Bowie said, companies should report the pay of each director, the percentage of meetings each attended the previous year and any financial relationship each has with the company or its top executives.
* Explain the division of the pie. Companies report many details about the stock and stock options they give their executives, but they do not compile them in one place. Investors would know much more about their standing, Mr. Blasi said, if all companies presented a few broad facts like these: the percentage of a company that the management and staff own, including options set aside for future grants; the portion of employee options that go to the top five executives as a group; and the portion that go to a wider group of managers, like the top 100.
"The public is forced to try to figure out what the numbers are when somebody knows what the real number is," Mr. Blasi said.

Stop-and-Go Traffic on a Global Scale

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
AT airports across Asia and Canada, travelers are lining up at counters and gates for the inevitable questions. Do you have a dry cough, fever or nausea? Have you had contact with anyone with these symptoms? Where are you coming from?
 The scenes are reminiscent of those in the 150 immigration stations on American borders a century ago. At places like Ellis Island, health officials checked arrivals for contagious diseases. Some were held, forced to undergo a medical exam and shipped back if judged a health hazard. 
 In the post-9/11 era, airports have begun taking on a role similar to those immigration stations, slowly transforming into the choke points of a globalized world -- particularly between developing countries and North America or Western Europe. 
That process was accelerated last week by fears over severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, the potentially deadly illness that is believed to have originated in southern China. In the last few weeks, it popped up almost simultaneously in at least 15 more countries, inadvertently carried there by infected passengers on commercial flights.
The rapid spread brought to mind the grim ending of the movie "Twelve Monkeys," in which a madman intends to start a global plague simply by flying with the germs to cities around the world. Deregulation and falling fares have democratized air travel in recent decades, but the role of the airline network in shrinking the world makes it vulnerable to clampdowns when it helps bring unwanted elements across borders. Those "invaders" could include terrorists and disease. 
"It certainly raises the question of these vast networks that we have, in which people can easily travel from one place to another," said James D. Ott, co-author of "Airline Odyssey: The Airline Industry's Turbulent Flight into the Future" (Republica, 1998), speaking of the new disease. "It could rise to a global problem within a couple of flights. I think the network is certainly going to be an issue."
Anxiety among travelers over SARS and the fighting in Iraq -- as well as the transformation of airports into paramilitary zones and disease control centers -- herald an apocalyptic time for the airline industry. The four horsemen are arriving one by one. First came death on Sept. 11, 2001, now war and pestilence. What's next?
When the World Health Organization recommended last week that travelers cancel trips to Hong Kong and the adjoining Chinese province of Guangdong, both critical economic hubs in Asia, corporations took that advice to heart, steering managers and salespeople -- its laptop-lugging road warriors -- away from runways and toward telephones or video-conference screens.
"The major shock was 9/11," said Kevin P. Mitchell, president of the Business Travel Coalition, an advocacy group. "Yet, 18 months later, we're still in a major downturn, still facing a bad economy, a second gulf war, Al Qaeda around the corner and now this SARS. The business traveler is looking for ways not to travel."
But if corporations are barring people from going to Asia, governments and health officials are using airport checkpoints to keep potential disease carriers from traveling in the other direction. Airline workers in Asian airports have been told to question passengers closely on their health and recent contacts. If their answers indicate they could be infected, they have to get a medical certificate clearing them of health risk before flying.
Continental Airlines and other carriers have asked workers to watch for any passengers with signs of SARS. The problem, though, is that symptoms -- like dry coughing -- are virtually indistinguishable from most respiratory diseases, including the common cold. Making hasty guesses raises questions of discrimination over a medical condition, or based on country of origin, as was evident last week when the Swiss government barred all visitors from China, Hong Kong, Vietnam and Singapore from a watch and jewelry convention.
Similar quick judgments took place at Ellis Island in the late 1800's and early 1900's. There, immigrants filed down the gangplank from steerage holds and up into a vast registration hall. Two federal health officials stood at the top of the staircase, scrutinizing the arrivals for coughing, limping, head-scratching, runny noses, runny eyes, stooped backs -- anything indicating ill health.
This was called the "six-second medical." Health officials made a chalk mark on the lapels of anyone exhibiting symptoms: X for mental disorder, S for scalp condition, H for heart condition, TB for tuberculosis and so on. Those immigrants, mostly from southern and eastern Europe, would be herded into detention pens and forced to undergo a medical exam, said Jeffrey S. Dosik, a librarian at Ellis Island.
About 2 percent of arrivals were sent back for legal or medical reasons.
"They looked in particular for tuberculosis, contagious scalp disease or contagious trachoma," Mr. Dosik said. "Those three disorders back then were medically untreatable. They were like the AIDS of their time."
So far, no treatment has been found for SARS. Scientists also have not come up with a test for the disease, so the best airport screening method now -- if a highly inefficient one -- is for workers to question travelers. If a test were devised, then health workers might be able to better examine passengers, but that would likely pose significant logistical problems.
"There are turnaround times of an hour at least," said Dr. Roger E. Wetherbee, an infectious-disease specialist at New York University Medical Center. "It would certainly be very cumbersome. The travelers would object to it certainly. And if they were trying to make connections, it would screw that up."
Some might argue that airports should be turned into quarantine stations for potential SARS carriers. Travelers coming from regions of epidemic yellow fever without proof of immunization have been kept for days at ports of entry until the incubation period passed. The problem with this new disease is that its incubation period may be as long as 10 days, there are huge numbers of travelers from countries with the illness, and detaining so many people for so long runs counter to the way the global travel network operates.
If governments devise far-reaching ways of screening or detaining travelers, then that will undoubtedly heighten concerns over civil liberties. Even now, many people are calling the Swiss government's actions last week heavy-handed and possibly racist, though government officials said they were acting to ensure public safety. The same debate has been raging here since the 9/11 terrorist attacks over detention of Muslims.
Casino-style surveillance and facial-recognition technology could soon be installed at airports to allow less disruptive ways of monitoring threats, but critics still raise ethical concerns over these.
THE Transportation Security Administration is working on an invisible step that would tighten the flow at airports: a computer database called CAPPS II that has background information -- and a risk score -- on anyone flying. The agency has declined to give details on the system. Privacy groups decry it as a step toward Big Brother.
Agency officials say they just want to ensure that travelers are, as they put it, rooted in the community. But in a world made smaller by planes and other technologies, where mobility and commerce go hand in hand, where Toronto virtually exists next to Hong Kong and Detroit to Baghdad, what community is that?

In the Army, Wallets Are Thin

 BODY:
Few people join the armed forces with the thought of becoming rich. But military personnel earn far less than most people in the private sector, a recent military salary survey shows. 
 The annual base pay of an Army private with one year of service stands at $15,480, or $1,290 a month, according to the survey, by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the outplacement firm. That amount is just slightly more than the $14,144 average pay for child care workers and movie ushers and the $15,080 earned by crossing guards in 2002, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (Of course, the private does not have to pay for housing or food.) 
 As for commissioned officers, the entry-level base salary for a second lieutenant in the Army is $26,200 a year, or $2,184 a month. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, that is on a par with the average pay for sales clerks and receptionists.
And the base pay of Gen. Tommy R. Franks, the overall commander in the Middle East -- $153,948 a year -- pales in comparison with that of a chief executive in corporate America.

Investors Ignore News of Weak Economy

BYLINE:  By JEFF SOMMER 

 BODY:
Heartened by apparent American progess in the war in Iraq, traders shrugged off evidence that the economy is in the doldrums and drove up the three main stock market indexes for the week.
 Share prices rose as forces advanced to the edge of Baghdad, but some stocks faltered on Friday as Iraqi television showed a man purported to be Saddam Hussein amid speculation about whether he was alive. 
 Also on Friday, the Labor Department reported that more people lost their jobs in March than had been expected, raising concerns that the economy may be slowing. But reaction in the stock market was modest.
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 131.38 points, closing at 8,277.15, a gain of 1.6 percent. The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index climbed 15.35 points, closing at 878.85, a gain of 1.8 percent. The Nasdaq composite index gained 13.91 points, closing at 1,383.51, a gain of 1 percent. Shares of AES, an electricity producer, rose almost 30 percent, the biggest weekly gain in the S.& P. 500. The company said that it would sell $1 billion in notes to pay off debt.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.95 percent, from 3.90 percent the prior week.

Should Christian Missionaries Heed the Call in Iraq?

BYLINE:  By DEBORAH CALDWELL; Deborah Caldwell, a senior producer for the online magazine Beliefnet, is an editor of "Taking Back Islam" (Rodale Press, 2002).

 BODY:
AS American troops began invading Iraq last month, Christian relief workers from all over the United States geared up to follow. Loaded with food, medicine, diapers and toothbrushes, volunteers began planning their aid to Iraqis, 97 percent of whom are Muslim.
 The Southern Baptist Convention, the largest American Protestant denomination, announced that its International Mission Board would send volunteers to distribute food and shelter, and to help Iraqis "have true freedom in Jesus Christ." 
 At the same time, the Rev. Franklin Graham, son of the Rev. Billy Graham, said that his relief operation, Samaritan's Purse, was ready to move into Iraq as soon as the war was over. Another Christian group, World Concern, said that it will care for anyone, regardless of religion, but that "we do seek appropriate ways to communicate the love of Christ in both word and deed." 
Franklin Graham emphasized his group's objective is to help people who have lost their homes or are sick and hungry. "We're in an Arab country and we just can't go out and preach," he said in an interview. But, he added: "God will always give us opportunities to tell others about his son. We are there to reach out to love them and to save them."
Muslims have said they are not happy about the evangelicals' plans. "The Iraq war is being interpreted in religious terms by Muslims around the world as a war against Islam, and this is dangerous," said Abdulaziz Sachedina, a University of Virginia expert in Islam and democracy. Mr. Sachedina suggested that, at the least, Christian groups wait a while before heading into Iraq. 
In many Muslim countries, the American military and its dominant religion appear inseparable, said John C. Green, the director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron. True or not, he said, "you have the image of a deeply religious president essentially giving Christians a green light to come into Iraq."
The Arab press has noted that Franklin Graham, who has called Islam a "very evil and wicked religion," delivered the invocation at Mr. Bush's inauguration. 
The Arab news media have also publicized the views of the Rev. Jerry Vines, a past president of the 16 million-member Southern Baptist Convention. 
Last summer, Reverend Vines described the prophet Muhammad as a "demon-possessed pedophile." 
The White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, denounced that view, saying that it was "something that the president definitely disagrees with." 
And last week,after news of the evangelical groups' plans for Iraq were publicized, Mr. Fleischer again distanced Mr. Bush from the Christian leaders' past remarks, calling Islam "a religion of peace." Both Mr. Fleischer and a spokeswoman for the United States Agency for International Development, which coordinates humanitarian aid, said that the government could not control the work of private charitable organizations because it did not finance them.
Franklin Graham and the Southern Baptist Convention are only the most well-known voices in a growing effort by American Christians to convert Muslims. Since 1990, the number of missionaries in Islamic countries has quadrupled, according to researchers for the evangelical missions. 
Five years ago, the Southern Baptists reorganized their International Missions Board to focus on the part of the world where Muslims live. Two years ago, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Texas created a master's degree program for missionaries ministering to Muslims.
The linchpin in most of these efforts is the "Jesus Film," which was made by the founder of Campus Crusade for Christ in 1979 and has been translated into 811 languages. Stories of the film abound in missionary circles: it has been carried up mountains and into remote villages around the world. In November 2001, after two Christian relief workers, Dayna Curry and Heather Mercer, were rescued from Afghanistan, it was disclosed that the Taliban arrested them for showing the film.
Last week, a missionary writing from Iraq on the International Bible Society's Web site described the scene this way: "I can hear jets flying over the town, and I hear explosions from the distance. There are still a few of us in town. We go out to visit and distribute tracts and the Jesus video. We are busy duplicating the video. We ran out of tracts and we need to print 10,000 more." The Bible society has published a Scripture booklet especially for Iraqi refugees. Christians in the United States are urged to spend 40 cents per booklet to print and ship them to Iraq.
Conservative Christians are puzzled by criticism of their efforts. After all, they point out, Christians believe they were commanded by Jesus to spread the faith and do so in a selfless, often courageous way. "It's a strange perception that someone who would take a risk and use their financial resources to provide humanitarian aid would be trying to destroy someone or harm them," said Wendy Norvelle, associate vice president for Southern Baptist relations. 
But some Christian leaders said they worried that the evangelicals' actions would be viewed as a crusade. 
"They identify the American cause with this war as the cause of Christ," said Robert Pyne, a theologian at the conservative Dallas Theological Seminary. He read from a prayer making the rounds among evangelicals: "Let us be sending in 'prayer missiles,' 'cruise and scud prayers' to target enemy plans. We are praying that the enemy leaders become confused, that their entire system of attack fall apart and that these enemies would become aware of the war Jesus has already fought for them."
Mr. Pyne, himself an evangelical, said it was the wrong time and place for such "a visible Christian presence." Instead, he said, American Christians might consider ceding control of their aid.
"We're the ones who think we have to do it, and want to do everything ourselves -- those are images of the ugly American," Mr. Pyne said. "We may need to get over that to truly distance ourselves, as Christians, from what is perceived around the world as a national agenda."

SARS Is New and It Kills, but How Dangerous Is It?

BYLINE:  By DENISE GRADY

 BODY:
BY now, who hasn't heard of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome?
 The disease is thought to have originated in southern China in November, but to have been covered up for months by the Chinese government. 
 As of Friday, according to the World Health Organization, 2,353 people in 16 countries were reported to have the disease, and at least 84 had died -- 3.5 percent -- mostly from pneumonia. Fears of the disease have led American health officials to discourage travel to Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore and mainland China -- causing havoc among tourists and seriously affecting the global economy. 
In the United States, there were at least 115 suspected cases, 109 in people who had traveled to affected parts of Asia, and the rest in people who were exposed to those travelers. As of Friday, no one had died. deaths. Health workers are now meeting airplanes arriving in the United States from affected countries, and handing out cards that urge passengers to be on the lookout for SARS symptoms like cough and fever. Also on Friday, President Bush signed an executive order allowing the Health and Human Services secretary to order the forced quarantine of infected individuals.
SARS is the latest in a series of "emerging infectious diseases," a list of previously unknown illnesses that runs from Lyme disease, to Legionnaire's disease, hantaviral lung disease, West Nile virus and AIDS. 
It is too soon to say how far SARS will spread, but experts say it is an urgent public health threat. One reason is that unlike the other emerging diseases, SARS is spread through the air, by coughing and sneezing. In addition, though some people who died of SARS were elderly or suffering from underlying illnesses that made them more vulnerable, others were relatively young and perfectly healthy, and doctors do not understand why they succumbed.
"A 3.5 percent death rate in the current era, that's notable," said Dr. William Schaffner, director of the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. "This is a new respiratory illness, undefined, and it has, under certain circumstances, a propensity to spread rapidly, and it had an immediate international component in terms of spread. In that sense it has overtones of new influenza outbreaks that have similar kinds of characteristics, and there it's pretty high up on the urgency list."
One thing that is not clear is whether the death rate really is 3.5 percent. The real rate is uncertain because no one knows how many people are infected; some may have minor symptoms or none at all. If so, the death rate may actually be much lower. 
Dr. Scott Hammer, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan, said it was worrisome that the disease could spread quickly through the air via coughing and sneezing. 
"Whenever you have an illness that does that it naturally creates anxiety in the public and public health authorities, particularly if there is a 3 to 4 percent fatality rate," he said.
BUT so far, experts say, most Americans do not have to worry about catching the disease. "If you haven't traveled to an affected area or been exposed to an ill patient, there's no evidence you're at risk at all," said Dr. James Hughes, director of the National Center for Infectious Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At the same time, Dr. Hughes said, the possibility of a worldwide epidemic cannot be ruled out. The speed and volume of international travel mean people can unknowingly carry diseases all over the world even before the incubation period is up.
As to where the virus came from -- assuming it is, as suspected, a new type of coronavirus (a virus that is one of the chief causes of the common cold) -- experts say there are several possibilities. One is that an earlier coronavirus that did not cause severe illness in people underwent a genetic shift that made it more virulent. Another is that a coronavirus changed for the worse by trading genetic material with another virus. 
It is also possible that an animal virus "jumped" into humans. Such jumps are known to occur, occasionally with dire results. A virus and its usual host may have adapted to each other to coexist. But with a new host, no truce has been made. 
"You haven't had co-evolution of the virus and the host over time," said Dr. Joshua Lederberg, a microbiologist and a Nobel laureate in medicine. 
But a virus that kills its host too quickly may wind up with no place else to go. "Virulence is kind of a side effect of the aggression a virus needs to get over the host's defenses and make a foothold," Dr. Lederberg said. "The virus must earn a living, but it does better to domesticate the host than to kill it."
A fourth possibility, which scientists consider unlikely, is bioterrorism: a new virus might have been genetically engineered in a laboratory, and might then have escaped or been released on purpose.
"There is no evidence for this, but we have to think about it in this day and age," Dr. Schaffner said. 
It is far too early to tell how important SARS will be in the future, experts said. Dr. Hammer noted that many respiratory illnesses, like the flu, tend to come and go seasonally, and scientists do not know why. 
"Is this here to stay?" he asked. "Will it be a continuous threat, a seasonal threat? How will it come into the broad spectrum of respiratory illnesses and infections for the future? Even if it ebbs, we won't know about this until next year."

 BODY:
TO some, the Olympia movie theater was a dark, smelly cavern with sticky gum spots on the floor and soda spills on the seats, a place where one's powers of concentration were tested by the propensity of the audience to chatter away just at the final clinch.
 To others, the flaws of the 90-year-old theater on Broadway near West 107th Street were part of its charm and almost indistinguishable from its virtues. Its days, though, were numbered; an investor bought the property in December and promptly shut down the theater. Never a blue-chip house, the Olympia has gone through many incarnations over the years, making its death throes as corny as the last moments of a B-movie hero caught in an endless fusillade of bullets. 
 In the past few months, three of the city's sturdiest survivors -- the Olympia, the Metro at West 99th Street and the Nova at West 147th Street -- have shut their doors, a development that left a 10-mile swath of Broadway from 84th Street to Yonkers without a first-run movie theater for the first time in decades. While on March 28, as abruptly as it had closed, the Metro reopened, its landlord said the reprieve might be only temporary. 
 Once, the city was dotted with neighborhood movie theaters -- many of them celluloid-age reincarnations of old vaudeville theaters -- that were as much a neighborhood fixture as the coffee shop and the playground. But over the years their numbers have sharply dwindled, killed off not so much by those usual suspects -- home video, a universe of hundreds of cable channels and video on demand -- as by a quintessentially New York force, developers and landlords eager to exploit galloping real estate values. 
 As a result, the chances of seeing movies among like-minded neighbors are increasingly slim. The nabes, as they were affectionately called by generations of New Yorkers, the place where parents could escape the kids, teenagers could find love in the dark, and the elderly could enjoy a cheap night out close to home -- these are becoming part of the city's past.
 Though beloved, the neighborhood movie theater hadusually seen better days.
 "The smell is generations of bodies and spilled popcorn," said Melvin Jules Bukiet, an Upper West Side novelist and professor of writing at Sarah Lawrence College, who was a devotee of the Olympia. "That actually enhances the visceral nature of the experience."
 Mr. Bukiet began frequenting the Olympia two decades ago as a Columbia graduate student. Until the theater's sudden death, his daughter, Louisa, a junior at Stuyvesant High School, carried on the tradition by seeing cheap movies -- any cheap movies -- every Friday with her friends.
 Mr. Bukiet's favorite visceral moviegoing moment at the Olympia occurred while watching the male-nude denouement of the 1997 film "The Full Monty" in the company of his Upper West Side neighbors. 
 "Finally it happens, and the hundreds of women in the movie watching these sort of dowdy, dumpy men take off their clothes break into screaming applause," he recalled. "The people in the theater, including myself, were also screaming and clapping, and our clapping was mixing with the clapping on the screen, and you couldn't tell the difference. It was magical."

Broadway Goes Dark
 The closing of the Olympia stunned many neighborhood residents who expected the theater to stumble along forever, although more observant residents pointed out that the adjoining storefront, while on a bustling commercial strip, had been kept oddly vacant, raising suspicions that it was being warehoused for eventual sale.
 The Metro went dark just over a month later, on Jan. 26. With its distinctive mauve and black Art Deco facade adorned with figures depicting comedy and tragedy, the theater was built during the Depression years of 1932-33, the end of a 40-year boom in theater building. The year after its completion, there were 18 movie theaters along Broadway between 59th and 110th Streets.
 The Metro is now in a dispute between Clearview Cinemas, which holds a long-term lease, and Albert Bialek, the owner of the building. Cablevision, Clearview's parent company, has been selling off its movie theaters, a group of properties that also includes the Olympia, to reduce debt. Mr. Bialek said last week that he had been trying to buy back the lease, although he was not sure what he would do with it. 
 "We have thoughts for redevelopment, and they're not firm," he said. "It might remain a theater. The situation is fluid."
 The developments surrounding the Metro and the Olympia caused a flurry of dismay on the activist Upper West Side. Less noticed, perhaps because it happened in Harlem, was the closing in September of the Nova, a first-run movie theater that had been operated for nearly a quarter of a century by Ramon Nova, a former cabdriver, and his son. The Nova began life in 1913 as the Bunny Theater, named, legend has it, after John Bunny, a 300-pound Brooklyn-born vaudevillian and silent screen comic, who is still memorialized in a pair of bas relief bunny heads on the facade.
 Greenwich Village, like the Upper West Side one of the city's cultural capitals, has also seen its share of neighborhood theaters die, though it remains a haven for art and revival movies. A notable loss was the cozy Art Greenwich at Greenwich Avenue and West 12th Street, which closed in February 2001, despite neighborhood protests, to make way for a modern brick and glass building housing an Equinox Fitness Club. 
 Inevitably, some former protesters patronize the gym. As Arthur W. Strickler, district manager of Community Board 2, put it: "The world changes. People have to adjust."
 The shuttering of a movie house leaves an ugly gash in the streetscape. Walking under the vacant marquee of the Olympia, one can hear passers-by pause in mid-conversation to wonder how a movie theater could fail in a thriving, intellectually stimulating place like the Upper West Side. The shock seems to remind them how essential a movie theater is to a neighborhood's texture and sense of identity.

All About Romance
 Running a neighborhood movie house is all about business, and it is all about romance and soppy sentimentality. Operators of these theaters often claim a deep attachment to the movies, and display an encyclopedic knowledge of movie lore.
 "Everybody wants to be in either the restaurant or the movie business," said Bernard E. Goldberg, a professional theater operator who once owned the Olympia and currently runs the Atrium, a nineplex in Eltingville on Staten Island.
 Dan Talbot, who over the years has run several theaters on the Upper West Side, began his career as a film critic for The Progressive magazine. "I was broke, I had two kids, I started as a manager and then eventually bought the lease," he said of the New Yorker, which he took over in 1962 and turned into a repertory house.
 The theater, on Broadway near 89th Street, was called the Yorktown; Mr. Talbot changed the name to the New Yorker in part so he could preserve one syllable of the old name and save money on neon tubing. It was a family operation: his mother ran the candy counter; his wife worked as a matron, and his father-in-law was the janitor.
 Although the New Yorker was not strictly a neighborhood theater in that it specialized in foreign films and revivals, it held a cherished place in the hearts of two generations of New Yorkers. In "Annie Hall," Woody Allen dragged Diane Keaton there to see "The Sorrow and the Pity."
 Like many successful theater operators of the day, Mr. Talbot programmed by instinct. "I prided myself on not repeating a program, no matter how successful it was, because I always wanted to get some fresh stuff in there," he said. The night he booked "Triumph of the Will," Leni Riefenstahl's 1934 film about Hitler, the lines were so long, he had to keep showing it till 3 a.m. to accommodate all the people.
 In the early 70's, Mr. Talbot sold the New Yorker to the Walter Reade Organization; a high-rise apartment building now stands on the site. A decade later, he acquired the lease to the Metro, a onetime porn theater known as the Midtown.
 "It was a filthy mess," he said. "A lot of whisky bottles, torn seats, totally rundown. But I got some lights and got my architect in there, and it turns out this theater was an architectural gem." The Metro, too, became a repertory theater, showing old movies, until Mr. Talbot sold it in the mid-90's. He now runs the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas and a film distribution company, New Yorker Films.
 The Nova also began as a family business when Ramon Nova, who has since died, gave up his cab to buy the lease 23 years ago. "My dad didn't want to drive anymore," said his son Jesus. "He wanted to open a neighborhood business." 
 The new owners were so naive, they booked movies by looking up names of distributors in the Yellow Pages. "We were enough away from the other theaters that they didn't really cause much competition," Mr. Nova said. "When a commercial action film came out, we all played it together."
 But when the landlord, Stanley Vickers, decided to raise the monthly rent from $8,000 to $14,000, Mr. Nova concluded that he could not afford to run the theater any longer; the landlord subsequently signed a lease with a 99-cent store, which will pay $18,000. 
 Still, Mr. Nova is aiming to buck the trend. With partners, he hopes to lease and renovate the Coliseum, a shuttered four-screen theater at 181st Street and Broadway, which closed last June. 

The Gentrification Paradox
 Paradoxically, movie houses, like dry cleaners and shoe-repair shops, tend to meet their demise as the neighborhood around them becomes more fashionable and affluent. Local movie theaters have never been very profitable, and rising real estate values make them less so.
 Just as small coffee shops and independent bookstores have been supplanted by Starbucks and Barnes & Noble, with their bigger selection, slicker service and ability to pay higher rents, so, too, local movie houses have been supplanted by multiplexes where audiences willingly pay more money to have a wider choice of films and to see them in a cleaner, more tranquil setting.
 You could buy a ticket to see a first-run movie at a matinee at the Metro for $7.50, while tickets at the 13-screen Loews Cineplex Lincoln Square on Broadway and 68th Street cost $12 apiece. Candy, soda and popcorn are also cheaper at local theaters.
 For landlords, movie theaters represent a highly inefficient use of space. Owners complain about the section of the city building code that requires theaters to reserve a certain amount of lobby standing room for every seat in the theater. But a bigger problem is empty seats. Here, megaplexes have an economic advantage because they are not betting the house on one movie that could turn out to be a dud. They can run higher-grossing films in bigger rooms and less popular films in smaller spaces.
 At the same time, the real estate occupied by the theaters has become increasingly attractive to developers. Mr. Talbot said he seethes every time he passes chains like Victoria's Secret that are paying top dollar for space along a stretch of Broadway where nearly a score of theaters once stood.
 These dynamics determined the recent history of the Olympia. Mr. Goldberg, who owned the theater from the mid-70's to the mid-80's, transformed it from a low-priced art house into a fourplex. "But it was a funky theater," he said, "and we never really had the money, the wherewithal, to make it into what it should have been."
 He sold the place during the real estate boom of the mid-80's, and the buyer immediately flipped it for an even higher price. Property values continued to escalate, and this year, Broadway Holdings, a real estate company, bought it for $16.6 million from Cablevision. Broadway Holdings would not reveal its plans for the former Olympia, but local brokers said it was likely to become an apartment building of at least 10 stories.

Survivors Find a Formula
 Given the harsh economic underpinnings of the movie theater business, it is hardly surprising that most surviving neighborhood movie theaters are outside Manhattan, where real estate prices have not yet gone through the roof. Their owners are the Greek diner operators of the theater business, the men and women who have figured out a way to survive despite competition from McDonald's -- or the local multiplex.
 Among the city's successful independent operators are Joe and Manny Diaz, who run three theaters in Queens, including the Plaza in Corona, which shows English-language movies with Spanish subtitles. The group also includes Norman Adie, who runs the Pavilion in Park Slope, the Brooklyn Heights Pavilion and the Flatbush Pavilion, and Harvey Elgart, a mild-mannered former projectionist.
 "I grew up in Brooklyn, in Sheepshead Bay," said Mr. Elgart, who is 52. "I went to an old Century theater when I was a kid. I used to sneak into the balcony."He got a job as a projectionist in 1972 and in 1977 took over the Surfside in Rockaway Beach, Queens, which he ran for 19 years. He bought the Cobble Hill in 1981, when it was a vacant single-screen theater. 
 The neighborhood, once heavily working-class Hispanic and Italian, was becoming home to more affluent professionals who were buying and renovating brownstones. Mr. Elgart saw the change coming and got in before prices appreciated so much that he would be priced out of a deal.
 Four years ago, he spotted another opportunity in Kew Gardens, Queens, an upscale area of Tudor homes and high-rise apartment houses. He bought the shuttered Austin on Lefferts Boulevard near Queens Boulevard, banking on its central location to make it profitable. Renamed the Kew Gardens Cinemas, it shows mainly independent and foreign films, like "The Quiet American" and "Talk to Her."
 Still another neighborhood theater has been brought back to life, at least for a while, through an accident of timing. When the Museum of Modern Art moved temporarily to Long Island City, Queens, to accommodate the renovation of its home on East 53rd Street, the museum's acclaimed film program took up residence at the Gramercy Theater on East 23rd Street. The single-screen movie house, which dates back to the 30's, had most recently been used by the Roundabout Theater Company.
 One attraction was the capacious, raked interior, with good sightlines, which recalls the traditional neighborhood theater.
 "You feel like you're in a cathedral, not a shoebox," said Laurence Kardish, senior curator of the MOMA film and media department and a longtime New York moviegoer. But Mr. Kardish knows that the days of such places are numbered. "The neighborhood movie house, sadly, is a thing of the past," he said. "I think the economics will finally swallow up those very few that still exist."

A Place Called Hell's Kitchen: The Boyhood Myth That Helped Make Moynihan

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS E. SCHOEN; Douglas E. Schoen is a partner in the political consulting firm of Penn, Schoen & Berland and the author of "Pat: A Biography of Daniel Patrick Moynihan" (Harper & Row, 1979).

 BODY:
DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN liked to describe himself as a boy from Hell's Kitchen; until his death on March 26 at the age of 76, it was one of his defining characteristics.
 In fact, Moynihan and his family lived in the neighborhood for only a few years, and for most of that time he was away at college. But for subtle and complicated reasons, Hell's Kitchen became a powerful and enduring metaphor for his life and his politics. 
 The quintessential working-class Irish-American neighborhood sandwiched between Times Square and the bustling docks served as a reference point for Moynihan's young life. His youth was essentially that of a middle-class kid cast into downward mobility. 
 His experience was much more complex than the simple Horatio Alger tale of a poor boy making good. But the Hell's Kitchen story was easier to tell, and less painful, than the truth. So he created a myth -- one that he himself came to believe -- that sustained him and made his transition to politics fit within a familiar framework.
 It was in 1928 that Moynihan began his journey to Hell's Kitchen, a neighborhood that came to embody, for him and thousands of others, the working-class life of the 1930's and 40's. 
 His father, Jack, took a job as an advertising copywriter in Manhattan, and moved his young wife and infant son from Tulsa, Okla., to New York. They spent a few months in Greenwich Village and some years enjoying relative affluence in various communities in the suburbs.
 But Jack was discontent with the lifestyle of what passed for a young post-Depression professional, and in 1937 he abandoned his family. What followed for Margaret Moynihan and her three children was close to outright poverty and in any case created an abiding insecurity. 
 They lived in a cold-water flat on East 88th Street and in several apartments on the Upper West Side. Along with his brother, Pat famously shined shoes in Times Square. 
 In 1947 his mother opened a bar at 558 West 42nd Street, near 11th Avenue, that Moynihan would talk about for the rest of his life. Moynihan's Bar was dimly lit and smelled of stale whiskey; the family lived in a railroad flat upstairs.
 As the oldest male in the household, Moynihan, who had returned from a stint as a naval officer, felt duty-bound to keep both the bar and his family running smoothly, which he did. He found that life in Hell's Kitchen remained profoundly less ordered, and less safe, than the one he had begun to know as a naval officer. His famous statement that as a politician he relearned "what I had known as a child, which is that the world is a dangerous place," indicates how vulnerable he felt at the time.
 Moynihan tended bar for the summer and then took advantage of the G.I. Bill to finish college at Tufts University, near Boston. But the situation at home was highly volatile, both in terms of his family's instability and the difficulty of making ends meet. Frequently Moynihan had to trek down in person, textbooks in hand and sleep-deprived, to put things right.
In fact, although he graduated with a bachelor's degree the next spring, he missed graduation week because he had to rush home to resolve a dispute that had erupted at the bar.
 In 1949, he summed up his Hell's Kitchen experiences by saying: "I've lived much of my life in a jungle of broken families, watching them tear out each other's minds, watching them feasting on each other's hearts."
 The near daily contact with what he described in a letter as the "sprawling, plodding, stupid, sluggish, ugly beautiful working people" had begun providing Moynihan with a profound sense of personal identity. He never missed an opportunity to underscore what New York, and especially Hell's Kitchen, had given him. 
 "I owe something to the City of New York," he said in 1965, while contemplating a run for mayor. "I was raised here during the Depression. We were poor. Yet there was never a day of my life that I would have wished to be any other person. There was then, as now, a sense of building an even greater city" And, he added, "there is none like us."
 Hell's Kitchen was also the working-class milieu in which Moynihan developed his first political instincts, became aware of the power of organized labor and formed the bulk of his Democratic Party principles. 
 BUT that is not necessarily why he clung so strongly to the myth that he was truly a child of the neighborhood. In many ways, it must have been simpler and easier to be a poor boy who made good and grew out of the proletariat than to tell the whole painful story of his young life. 
 Certainly it was easier to cite Hell's Kitchen as the place of his youth than to list the reality, an endless series of apartments, houses and neighborhoods.
 The proletarian nature of Hell's Kitchen also took on great significance for Moynihan because of his notion that poor people were generally morally superior to others. In 1945 he wrote to a friend that while he liked the privileged young men he was meeting at Middlebury College, where he received his naval training, he could not stomach their attitude toward life. 
 "Nothing fazes them," he said. "They sit there and wallow in every kind of economic and social advantage our society has to offer and remain completely spiritually and mentally mediocre, while people who really could learn go stewing away at C.C.N.Y."
 Moynihan's relatively brief, late-teen experience in Hell's Kitchen undeniably had real bearing on his politics and ideas -- his abiding interest in family policy and structure and his interest in welfare reform. But it became the mythic heart of his political narrative because it suited the persona he wished to project and, most important, the values he wished to embody.

A Plan to Shut a Research Center Confronts Protests, and Local Pride

BYLINE:  By JIM O'GRADY 

 BODY:
Don't make eye contact.
 Anita Inz said that is the priceless insight that an employee at the Institute for Basic Research gave her about her 17-year-old son, David, who suffers from a mental disability called fragile X syndrome. It has helped him learn to cook and to perform other independent tasks, she said, and will probably enable him to avoid becoming a ward of the state for his adult life. 
 And that is the reason she and others oppose Gov. George E. Pataki's proposal to close the organization in order to cut $20 million a year from the state budget. "It is so cost-effective in my mind," Ms. Inz said. 
 The institute, which opened in Staten Island in 1967 and employs 350 people, is also held in high local regard. "There is nothing like it in the state," said Assemblyman Matthew Mirones, the ranking Republican on the Assembly Mental Health Committee, whose district includes the institute. "The people of Staten Island are quite proud of it." 
 The institute researches the causes of mental disability and neurological diseases, and devises therapies based on its findings. It was one of three laboratories to identify a protein crucial in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and its first director, George Jervis, developed the phenylketonuria test, a standard blood test performed on newborns to detect potential brain damage. The institute also collected early data on fetal alcohol syndrome, and has programs on autism and Down syndrome.
 Nevertheless, the state budget must be cut, said Deborah Sturm Rausch, a spokeswoman for the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, the state agency that oversees the institute. 
 "With New York facing tremendous fiscal challenges brought on by the tragic events of September 11 and the national recession," she said, "we've had to make some tough choices." If the institute closes, she added, its patients will be shifted to other programs on Staten Island. 
 But Georgia Schuller-Levis, an immunologist at the institute, said: "The governor is being shortsighted if he thinks research isn't directly focused on the patient. That's what gives the families hope." 
 Ms. Inz would agree. She recalled that when her son was a child, the common wisdom among health professionals was that mentally disabled people should be engaged with direct eye contact. But an experiment at the institute that David took part in as a child found that those with fragile X syndrome -- a defect on the X chromosome that is the most common inherited mental disability -- experience such contact as a kind of sensory overload. They are filled with so much anxiety that they temporarily cannot listen or learn. 
 "If you allow him to wear sunglasses or look away slightly when you talk to him," Ms. Inz said, "he'll do so much better." JIM O'GRADY

Augusta Charity Finds Itself in the Rough

BYLINE:  COMPILED BY MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
The brouhaha over the Augusta National Golf Club's policy of not accepting women as members is inflicting some unexpected pain on a local museum.
 The National Science Center in Augusta, Ga., had lined up a number of tickets to the Masters tournament and was offering them to companies that offered to sponsor the museum's annual fund-raising party, the Masters Gala, which will be held on Thursday. 
 While big companies usually use a trip to the Masters as a perk for executives and clients, the controversy over Augusta National's policy toward women has led many of them to avoid the tournament this year. The weak economy is also causing companies to cut back.
Philip S. Sloan, who is helping the museum promote the benefit, which will feature the comedian Jim Belushi, said that as a result of the controversy the museum might raise only about $100,000, half of its total last year.
"We are still soliciting corporate sponsorship support for this year's Masters Gala," he said, hopefully.

Is This Really An All-Volunteer Army?

BYLINE:  By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
DOES the United States military have to be representative of American society? The question has hung heavy since war with Iraq first seemed inevitable, and with it the possibility of heavy casualties. Now, with that war at a climax, a small band of critics continues to maintain that the all-volunteer force -- which is 30 years old this year -- is all-volunteer in name only.
 They argue that relative economic disadvantage has replaced local draft boards in determining who enters the military, especially the enlisted ranks, and that it is un-American to have an affluent nation being defended by working-class young people, heavily layered with minorities. 
 "It's not fair that the people that we ask to fight the war are people who join the military because of economic conditions," says Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat, who advocates a new draft. 
When compared with other groups of the same age, the American military, particularly in its enlisted ranks, in fact has fewer rich people. But it also has fewer poor ones. It has more Southerners and fewer Northeasterners. It has a higher percentage of black people, especially black women, compared with the larger population, but a smaller proportion of Hispanics. 
Defenders of the all-volunteer force, particularly in the Pentagon, quickly rebutted Mr. Rangel's arguments. They asserted that the military does reflect the country's population, especially when the number of officers -- about one-seventh of the military, virtually all of them college graduates -- is considered. They also note that while the median income for households that produce white recruits is lower than for other white homes, the median income of the families of black recruits is actually higher than it is for blacks as a whole.
Moreover, supporters of the volunteer force say, the military is, they say, more professional, better motivated and more stable when soldiers, sailors, pilots and others stay in for longer stints. They point to its performance in the Persian Gulf war, the Afghanistan campaign and now Iraq. And they shudder at returning to the often-troubled conscripted military of the Vietnam era, just to make a point about equity that not everyone feels could even be remedied.
"I served in a draft force," a senior Defense Department official said earlier this year. "I remember when enlisted folks fragged -- as we liked to say -- threw grenades into the officers' quarters in Vietnam. Not a pretty picture."
Comparisons with Vietnam gloss over the experience of World War II, when an American military force, heavy with conscripts, defeated the German military machine, considered at the time the world's best. Put side by side, the comparisons suggest that when it comes to efficiency and motivation, the issue may not be volunteers versus draftees, but a popular war verses an unpopular one.
But the central question about the volunteer force remains Mr. Rangel's: How much choice is there? In some sense the fact that blacks, especially black women, not only enlist, but re-enlist in a higher proportion than whites is seen as an example of the equal opportunity the armed services provide. But it could also be viewed as indicating the lack of opportunity -- real or perceived -- for African-Americans in civilian society.
Demographic trends don't promise to make the choices easier. With incomes having stagnated except for those people with college degrees, the percentage of youths choosing to continue their education after high school has exploded. In 1970, about 55 percent of men and about 48 percent of women enrolled in college right out of high school. By 1999, 63 percent of men and 64 percent of women were doing so. The sharp increases, which show no sign of leveling off, have put enormous pressure on military recruiters to fill their quotas.
The Defense Department has responded by trying to reduce the need to make a choice between military service and a college education. In recent years it has expanded programs to help members of the military pay for college after active duty. It has permitted more of them to attend college while in the service. So the issue of who serves and who doesn't becomes more and more a matter of who can afford college without help.
Recruiters' task is further complicated by some more specific educational trends as well. Studies have shown that one of the biggest influences on teenagers' career decisions is the educational attainment of their mothers -- more so than of their fathers. 
With the spectacular growth in the number of women going to college (they now outnumber men), the Pentagon faces a daunting prospect: some day, those legions of educated mothers will, at the same time, be setting a standard at home that will steer their children more surely toward college, even as their added income will help insure that the family has the money to pay for college without turning to military service.
"Parents are certainly major influences, mothers in particular," saidPaul R. Sackett, a professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota who studied the challenges that face military recruiters. 
Among one group, Hispanics, increases in college attendance have not kept pace with those among blacks and non-Hispanic whites. This could mean that the percentage of the military made up of Hispanics will grow, and the chances that will happen received a boost from President Bush last July, when he signed an executive order providing that any legal immigrant who has been on active duty since Sept. 11, 2001, may immediately apply for citizenship, bypassing the normal three-year waiting period for military personnel and the five-year period for civilians.
But do all of these changes guarantee that the military will become any more or less reflective of American society? Consider this: Even though a shrinking proportion of teenagers has been seeking to enlist, the number of American teenagers is expected to grow in the coming decade, giving recruiters a bigger pool to appeal to. And even if the armed services sign up more Hispanics, demographers say the percentage of the population that is Hispanic is likely to rise relatively quickly too. So the military may wind up merely reflecting the country's demographic change.
Such calculations -- and debates about whether the burden of military service will be fairly distributed -- are the price of trying to keep an all-volunteer force in balance with a population that is, itself, constantly changing.

HEADLINE: Beyond Iraq; 
Paramilitaries on the March

BYLINE:  By SANIL DASGUPTA; Sunil Dasgupta, a research associate at the Brookings Institution, has just completed a study of global paramilitary forces.

 BODY:
PARAMILITARY forces are linked to some of the deadliest crimes of recent history. The ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Kosovo was largely carried out by Serb paramilitary forces, not the regular military. Hutu militias, known as the Interahamwe, were responsible for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. In Indonesia, West Timorese paramilitaries and government-organized youth squads ledthe "dirty wars" against the separatists of East Timor.
 In the first two weeks of the war in Iraq, Iraqi paramilitary fighters, not Republican Guards or other formal military units, were responsible for most of the coalition casualties in combat. 
 These groups, the Saddam Fedayeen and Baath Party militias, like paramilitary forces everywhere, operate outside the regular military structures and serve to provide internal security for the regime that allowed their formation.
While Pentagon officials dismiss paramilitaries as a nuisance and a perversion of the rules of war, paramilitary forces are increasing the world over and will continue to pose challenges to American interests.
In 2002, from one-third to one-half of the total military manpower in China, Russia and India -- the largest non-Western military powers in the world -- was in paramilitary organizations. A report on the internal use of force by the East West Center, a research organization, found that, from 1975 to 1996, the ratio of government troops to the population rose 29 percent in Thailand, 42 percent in Burma, 63 percent in China, 64 percent in Pakistan and 71 percent in India.
Though paramilitaries are smaller than regular armies, their rapid growth and rising status make them more important than the sum of their numbers. The countries with the largest paramilitaries -- including China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Indonesia, North Korea and Algeria -- have doubled and tripled their relative importance (as a percentage of total military strength) in the last 30 years. 
Paramilitaries, which grew out of the security and economic conditions in the developing world, were in many cases intended to be parallel military forces outside the military or police command to protect regimes from internal threats like separatist rebellions. They include constabulary forces, like the People's Armed Police of China, a large, uniformed group developed as the first line of defense against civil unrest like that in Tiananmen Square in 1989. In some cases, paramilitaries are fighting the government, as in Colombia, where the United Self-Defense Forces emerged as local militias to guard farmers against leftist guerrillas but now control much of the drug trade. 
Unlike regular militaries, which are built by training diverse recruits to work together, paramilitaries are drawn from politically reliable groups, creating ethnically or tribally based units. For example, the Saddam Fedayeen drew primarily on Sunnis from central Iraq. 
The most dangerous type of paramilitary organization is the security intelligence agency, in which power is concentrated in few hands. Death squads, for example, are usually located within a country's security intelligence agencies. In Egypt, the General Intelligence Agency conducted a brutal campaign against Islamists in that country, eventually forcing many of them to move to Sudan and Afghanistan.
Since their primary function is internal security, paramilitaries are adaptable. The fedayeen in Iraq, for example, have discarded uniforms, hidden among the civilian population, attacked the rear or ambushed coalition troops, sometimes luring them with white flags of surrender. As dispersed forces, the fedayeen could survive long after the lines of Iraqi military command have been disrupted. 
Though many paramilitary forces resemble guerrilla warriors, they are more potent than guerrillas because of their access to the state's resources. This also links their fate directly to the regime's. The independence of East Timor, for example, was most forcefully resisted by paramilitaries in the former Indonesian province. 
Under dictatorships, paramilitaries are often so identified with the government's oppressive actions that the chances of clemency under a new government are likely limited. This can often undermine plans of a peaceful change. 
In Brazil, for example, attempts to democratize in 1981 were undermined by the actions of the security intelligence agency, which had controlled many members of death squads in the 1970's. By contrast, South Africa, under the leadership of the African National Congress, agreed not to prosecute members of the apartheid regime's "dirty warriors" to ensure a peaceful transfer of power.
The ruthless effectiveness, tactical agility and continued survival of paramilitaries contrast with the weak militaries in many developing nations. 
The effectiveness of paramilitaries also comes from the changed world in which wars are waged. New constraints on some shaky regimes -- like human rights requirements -- have driven the use of force underground.
In Iraq, the fedayeen and other paramilitary troops will eventually be defeated, but not without cost. If they inflict enough casualties and cause enough trouble, the Americans in charge of occupying Iraq might be lured into establishing truces with defecting elements of the regime. In Afghanistan, the effort to reduce fighting through local truces with warlords is one obstacle to stabilizing the country.
Clearly, disarming paramilitary forces is as much a political task as a military one.

HEADLINE: A Corporate Shadow At Augusta National 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Low Profiles and No-Shows at Golf's Showcase," (March 30), which described how corporate sponsors were shying away from the Masters tournament amid criticism of the Augusta National Golf Club for not admitting women as members: 
 The story of the Masters has always been about corporate power, not about golf, so I was glad to see it covered in the business pages. 
No longer a simple, private club in a small Southern city, Augusta National has put itself on public view for many years as host to a decidedly public event that has always had corporate sponsors. The club can hardly expect to ignore 21st-century political values and economic pressures.
The National Council of Women's Organizations, representing millions of women, has won this round, and surely Augusta National will never be the same.

Opinions on the Iraq War From Newspapers Around the World

 BODY:
The war in Iraq continued to dominate the attention of newspaper editorialists around the world, as the following excerpts of commentary from the past week demonstrates. And opinion is as divided as ever. 
 The foreign-language editorials were translated by The New York Times or the BBC World Monitoring Service.

Izvestia
Russia, April 3

Bush Is No Hitler, And Russia Is Not An Enemy of the U.S.
Russian television channels are more and more insistently drawing parallels between Bush and Hitler, the Holocaust and "massive extermination of Iraqi civilians" by allied troops. These parallels are as incorrect, and even blasphemous, as they are dangerous. 
Russia, as well as all of humanity, is facing a very difficult moral and political choice. There are many reasons why Russia could not support the United States war on Iraq. While we had no contacts with the Taliban regime and it did not have the international community's legitimate acknowledgment, the Iraqi regime, which was quite legitimate, had been a friend of Moscow since Soviet times. Russia has substantial business interests in Iraq -- primarily in the oil sector and in the arms trade area. Finally, Iraq owes us $8 billion. 
However, it is one matter to simply refrain from supporting the war against Iraq -- and quite another matter to become a sworn enemy of America. Our current differences are a dispute over the means, not the ends. 
Being at odds with America is stupid, but not because America is stronger than Russia. There is a more weighty reason: we have a common enemy and common ideals. Russia can and should call on the U.S. to end the bloodshed in Iraq as soon as possible. But that call should be directed to a companion-in-arms in a common cause who is making a mistake, not to an enemy. We should object to attempts to establish democracy in such a way, but not to democracy itself. Europe, including Russia as its constituent part, is too weak to protect itself from the challenges of international terrorism. America is strong, but it is not smart enough to protect the achievements of Western civilization by the right methods. Only by joining intellect and force can the world protect democracy as the most reasonable form of social organization. And in this fight we are definitely on the same side as America.

Western Media Dishonest
How many Iraqis have the Allied forces killed or captured since they invaded nearly two weeks ago? How many cities taken? How many prisoners of war? 
Media consumers are apt to think that they know. For it is with great assurance that U.S. and British TV and radio stations report news of "major breakthroughs." Yet confirmation never arrives. These "victory" reports seem fed to the media to conform to the Bush-Blair pledge that Iraq would be crushed. 
As contradictory facts emerge, the same media report these in a manner so unconnected with the original story that the consumer thinks theAllies are still moving full-steam ahead. 
Has Basra been captured? Is Baghdad about to fall? Why has a full-fledged invasion of the capital been "imminent" for a whole week 100 kilometres away?
Why is it that only "friendly fire" is bringing helicopters down, never Iraqi fire? Is it true that Iraq is treating its POWs inhumanely, whereas allied forces are giving V.I.P. treatment to theirs? 
After the war, these media will argue -- as they did after Falklands or Kosovo -- that they have been victims of deception by the generals. 
Yet, as we know from Phillip Knightley's book "The First Casualty," in war, military disinformation is the practice. What's more, the media make this mitigative plea after every war. So the question of deception does not arise. This plea, then, is what is dishonest, self-serving and dangerous. 
If, then, they happily dish out disinformation and lies, it is because they are willing accomplices. For, being corporate, they naturally support U.S. gold in its perennial struggle with Third World oil in dollar terms. 
What is dreadful is that, during "peace," these same media bombard the world with holier-than-thou sermons about objectivity, truth and fairness, whereas in war, they are the first to trample these principles underfoot.

U.S. Military Move Is the Product of Aggressive Strategy
There is no guarantee that war fire will not kindle on the Korean Peninsula, where the United States imperialists' military commotion aimed at us is being reinforced. The United States imperialists are trying to achieve their criminal purpose with a blatant military action because their political and diplomatic pressure and economic stifling maneuvers against us are wearing out.
The United States imperialists' provocation of a war in Iraq shows that they, who are the world's worst rogues who are blindly beating a legal sovereign state while ignoring both the United Nations and international law, can wage a greater war of aggression against our country at any time.
However, the United States imperialists are mistaken. Our army and people are raising vigilance against the United States imperialist belligerent forces' rash war maneuvers as well as being fully prepared. Our army and people's political and ideological resolution is extraordinarily high and our strength is invincible.
The United States imperialists must give up their delusion that their war policy will see the same results in Korea as it did in Afghanistan and in Iraq. If the United States, despite our warning, persistently lights the fire of a new war in Korea, it will meet with an irrecoverable, bitter, miserable defeat.

There Is Still Time To Talk of Peace
It is high time the world community joined together to persuade the warring parties to end their military action in Iraq. The conflict has already resulted in heavy loss of life.
As more people are killed, anger will rise among the protagonists, leading to vengeance and violent action against their opponents. That is why it is necessary for all peace-loving people in the world to appeal to or pressure the warring parties to end the violence. It is not too late for both sides to come to the negotiating table and talk peace.
By pledging to fight until they gain victory, Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair have stoked the fires of anger, and this will turn more and more people into war animals. Innocent civilians have already suffered tremendously since the war began. If the fighting goes on, Iraq will become a living hell for many more people.

In the Firing Line
In the propaganda war against Iraq, the Western allied forces are losing the battle. Despite having "embedded" several hundred media reporters with the troops, the message is not getting across to the general public "back home" that the combined forces of America and Britain are vanquishing the Iraqi opposition. Far from it. Perhaps the message is not getting through because the embedded reporters are finding it difficult to accept the information sparingly and carefully doled out to them.
Although very few people are in possession of the full facts and the propaganda war from either side does little to clarify the situation, the American media seem convinced that the war is not going "their way," and it is due to one person: United States Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Probably, if events start changing and the allied forces demonstrate greater success, then all will be forgiven. If not, then his hawkish, unilateralist and domineering position may be his downfall, despite the full support he enjoys from the American president.

War and Terrorism
This unilateral war against Iraq is becoming more and more complicated. To ease their conscience, the invaders predicted a swift, less bloody operation. They were mistaken: the invincible American army has run into a poor and tough city, filled with people who will defend their country, their children and their oil wealth tooth and nail, man by man, woman by woman and bullet by bullet. There will be many more dead, much more horror, on both sides. 
The Iraqis at least know the reason they are dying. Not so the American soldiers. The Iraqis defend their mother country, not the tyrant Saddam Hussein. The American soldiers, many unwittingly, defend the economic interests of the most powerful corporations, directed by the leaders of their government and Army, all representatives and beneficiaries of the American military-industrial complex. In the "humanitarian" postwar period, there will be profits for the companies associated with Vice President Dick Cheney, with the superadvisor Richard Perle, or Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, with the motive "to reconstruct" everything destroyed by their smart bombs . . . and by an army destroying everything in its path, slaughtering civilians, old men, women and children.

Die Welt
Germany, April 4

New Tone, Few Lessons
The return to reason often begins with a new tone of voice. If this is the case, the German government may have yesterday begun its journey back to what it had so thoroughly botched with its election-campaign polemics: a realistic German foreign policy that realizes that neither the European Union, NATO nor the United Nations can counterbalance America. A little hesitantly, but nonetheless, Schroder for the first time subscribed to the American goal of the Iraq war: toppling Saddam Hussein. He also sought to reconcile Britain, because even though the European Union fundamentally needs the German-French alliance, it cannot survive on it alone: without the Britons there is no European army worthy of the name. All of this in Schroder's speech provides grounds for hope.
However, we should expect more from a government declaration than atmospherics and a few vague insights. The chancellor did not fall short of the mark in terms of aims but of strategies: it is well and good to desire the strengthening of the European Union, NATO and the United Nations. But how? To give Europe new impetus, a core ofdetermined member states will have to make a start. Yesterday the chancellor missed the opportunity to adopt this old truth and set his foreign policy on a peaceful course.
It will not be enough to become nostalgic for the old multilateral world, since it will not be enough for America. It is in Germany's interest to regain the necessary and justified influence in Washington. But that has a price: strengthening European Union foreign policy, including military deployment in United Nations missions such as in postwar Iraq. That must become our government's goal -- much faster and much clearer than the chancellor was yesterday.

HEADLINE: Canadian Court Hears Two Cases on Rights 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: ST. LAURENT, Manitoba, April 1 

 BODY:
Ernest Blais went goose hunting with some friends the other day in the lake country northwest of Winnipeg, a rugged land rich in wild turkey and grazing buffalo, just as their Metis ancestors have for centuries. 
 But a sudden spring cold spell refroze the lakes where the geese normally take their drink, driving the birds into the shelter of high prairie grass, safely hidden while awaiting another thaw. 
 By the end of the day, the four men had bagged nothing. But for all their frustration, at least they were not arrested this time for hunting out of season. 
The hunting expedition had been an act of civil disobedience, in which the four Metis struck what they called another blow for giving the 300,000 mixed-blood ancestors of French trappers and Indians the same rights as Canada's 700,000 Natives to hunt whenever they like and without a license.
Since 1994, when Mr. Blais was arrested and his hunting rifle confiscated, his fight for equal hunting rights for the Metis had wound its way through the Manitoba courts before reaching the Supreme Court in March. 
His is one of two Metis hunting cases now being considered by the nation's highest court, the latest examples of a resurgence of Metis nationalism that is growing from Labrador all the way west to the Northwest Territories. Much more than hunting is at stake in what will amount to a constitutional decision on who has the full legal rights of Native Canadians. 
A decision by the Supreme Court in favor of the Metis would almost certainly open the door to more lawsuits seeking other entitlements now held only by Native Canadians. Potentially, those entitlements could include sweeping tax breaks, free pharmaceuticals and eyewear, free higher education, broader rights to make logging and mining claims, and expanded rights of self-government over child welfare and other services. 
Many provincial governments fear the price tag for the new entitlements could rise to billions of dollars a year, and a mainstream hunting group has warned that expanded Metis hunting rights would bring disaster to Canada's wildlife population. 
The Metis have long been at the center of Canadian history, but they have never been entirely accepted by either the Native or non-Native population. They developed their own distinct language, Michif, which flavored much of the banter between Mr. Blais and his hunting partners. Their traditional woven sashes, embroidered gun sheaths and deer hide caps are still prized possessions of some Metis hunters today.
At first blush, Mr. Blais's battle seems an odd one. 
Mr. Blais, a 53-year-old labor consultant, who earlier in his career fought to root out corruption in local Metis organizations, wants the same rights for his people as those who now occupy the lowest rung on Canada's social and economic ladder. They no longer want to have to pay for hunting licenses or wait for government-sanctioned hunting seasons to hunt like other non-Indians. 
Mr. Blais said it was a matter of principle and dignity for people whose culture has been based on hunting, fishing and trapping since the 16th century.
"When you see our Indian brothers go out to hunt anytime they want, and we are forced to watch on the sidelines, it doesn't feel good," said Mr. Blais. "We're like the bastard child." 
Like many hunters, Mr. Blais has a salty sense of humor and is quick with a slap on the back. He wears a Fu Manchu mustache and has shoulder-length gray hair. But like many Metis, he does not have strong Indian features. 
Still, he said his case put him squarely in the tradition of Louis Riel, the 19th century Metis leader who was hanged for treason after rebelling for Metis land rights.
"It's something I thrust myself into," he said. "If the game wardens want me they can have me. I'm going hunting." 
At the core of Mr. Blais's case that he was unjustly arrested for hunting deer out of season is the claim that Metis have the same rights as other Native Canadians under a 1930 federal law that transferred land to three western provinces and explicitly gave Indians hunting rights. He said that a 1982 constitutional amendment definesthe aboriginal peoples of Canada as "the Indian, Inuit and Metis peoples." 
Steve Powley, a 54-year-old former trucker, and his son, Roddy, are making similar arguments before the Supreme Court to uphold what they call their constitutional right to hunt moose without a license.
Since the Powleys were arrested while hunting in southern Ontario in 1993, they have argued that Metis should have liberal hunting rights on lands surrounding traditional Metis communities like their home town of Sault Ste. Marie. 
Their argument is a somewhat narrower claim than that of Mr. Blais, who thinks the Metis should be able to hunt on any unused government property. 
The Powleys have won their case in three Ontario courts, while Mr. Blais has lost three times so far in the Manitoba courts.
Complicating the matter is the fact there is no current government criteria defining who is a Metis. However, Metis groups around the country consider that anyone who has a Metis ancestor, no matter how little Indian blood is in their family, is Metis as long as they consider themselves Metis and are accepted as such by organized Metis communities. 
The question of who is an Indian in Canada is another vexing question, one that is not decided on the basis of blood and treaties as it is in the United States. The definition of who is an Indian takes up dozens of pages of federal law, but generally Indians are defined as descendants of males who were registered as Indians with the Canadian federal government in the 1870's, no matter what their blood mix is. 
Lawyers for the federal government and seven provinces have argued that if either case is upheld in the Supreme Court it would open a Pandora's box of benefits.
"No other country in the entire world provides for constitutional rights for persons of mixed ancestry," Lori Sterling, Ontario's lawyer, argued before the Supreme Court last month. 
Timothy Danson, a lawyer for the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters, argued before the court that expanded hunting rights for thousands of Metis would "have a very negative impact on sustaining wildlife populations." He warned that billions of dollars' worth of tourism and other economic activities, as well as social harmony among the races, would be put in jeopardy. 
Mr. Blais dismissed the argument that wildlife populations would be endangered, arguing that Metis are careful guardians of nature. But he did acknowledge that an expansion of hunting and other rights would probably swell the numbers of people claiming to be Metis. 
"That will have to be decided in another case," he said.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: IN THE FIELD V CORPS; 
Therapy on the Fly for Soldiers Who Face Anxiety in the Battlefield

BYLINE:  By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: WITH V CORPS HEADQUARTERS, near the Kuwait border, April 5 

 BODY:
The other day, the buddy of a frightened soldier took him to see Maj. Graham Hoffman, a psychiatrist from Pueblo, Colo., and a reservist who has been called up to serve in the war against Iraq.
 "He was frightened of going to Iraq and afraid of chemical attacks, couldn't get it out of his mind," Major Hoffman said. "It seemed like a pretty normal amount of fear." 
 Major Hoffman, who serves with the 883rd Combat Stress Control Detachment, a unit run by psychiatrists, said he tried to "reframe" the fears of the soldier in order to calm him. The doctor told the soldier that it was perfectly natural to be scared, and that, even though a chemical attack would be dreadful, it would probably not prove fatal to many soldiers because of their training and the masks and outfits they wear to protect against such an assault.
"We talked about ways to relax," said Major Hoffman, a quiet-spoken, 46-year-old doctor who joined the Army reserves after the Sept. 11 attacks. "This was a guy who was really keyed up. We taught him simple things -- holding your breath, letting it out after five seconds, feeling the tension leave your body. Semi-hypnotic stuff. Self-massage. He seemed much more reassured when he left."
There are two combat stress units in V Corps, the Army force in the Iraq war, teams of doctors who treat soldiers struggling with fears and anxieties. (In addition, each division has a psychiatrist, psychologist and social worker assigned to it.)
Many medical personnel in the Army are reservists. Civilian psychiatrists like Major Hoffman serve a minimum of three months in a theater of war, like Iraq, but may serve much longer at the government's request.
In contrast to their work in civilian life, psychiatrists in the Army are less engaged in resolving the personal problems of soldiers than getting them back into the field as quickly as possible.
Antidepressants and antianxiety medications, commonplace in civilian life, are not prescribed for soldiers, for example, at least in the early stages of their treatment.
"Our job is not to get into prescriptions because we don't see battle stress as an abnormal response situation," said Maj. Timothy Patterson, a psychiatrist and reservist from Mansfield, Ohio, who runs a combat stress unit.
"To start using medicines gives soldiers the impression that they're patients, and they're not," Major Patterson said. "We see them as soldiers having a normal amount of stress in an abnormal situation."
Combat stress symptoms include "feelings of anxiety, upset stomachs, somatic complaints -- anxieties that are converted to body illness -- twitching, as well as emotional and maybe even spiritual problems."
Major Patterson said that initially, several days of rest, fluids, hot food and sleep left most soldiers ready to return to their combat units. Often sleep deprivation -- and commanders' not realizing that soldiers need plenty of sleep -- leaves troops unable to function properly.
Major Patterson said that about 80 percent of soldiers treated by the combat stress unit returned to their units after several days of rest and relaxation.
Major Hoffman said that combat stress units in the Army go back to World War I, when recuperation areas were created to help anxious soldiers. In recent years, he said, the Army had studied the Israeli Defense Force's methods of dealing with combat stress. The Israeli military was more or less in a permanent state of war, he said, with a defense force comprised of reservists and others.
The Army had created several channels to deal with combat stress, Major Hoffman said.
If a soldier, he said, "is not able to normalize the emotions they're experiencing, not able to maintain cognitive control," the Army often places them in a headquarters unit for 7 to 10 days. The soldiers are assigned low-pressure jobs like kitchen duty and given further rest.
Unlike Vietnam, the officers said, when troubled soldiers were often flown out of the country to hospitals or stateside units, the Army makes deliberate efforts to keep soldiers near their units.
"Keep them close to their tribe," Major Patterson said. "It sometimes hurts the individual in the long term to send them away. They carry a sense of failure, take it home with them. It's a horrible scar to bear."
The combat stress units here have started relatively late, in part because their Humvee vehicles and communication equipment were delayed. In the past, Army commanders have sometimes given lip service to psychiatrists, viewing soldiers who visit them as slackers.
But a certain urgency in V Corps has given psychiatrists some importance after the recent arrest of a soldier in the 101st Airborne Division who is accused of throwing a hand grenade into a tent, killing two officers and wounding 13.
Major Patterson, who is 48, and whose practice in Ohio includes steel mill and factory workers who have been laid off or are unemployed, said the soldiers he meets in the mess hall sometimes question the reason they are in the Iraq war.
"That's why its important for officers to remind them why they're here," Major Patterson said. "We lose sight of our goals. Soldiers want assurance. They have to be kept focused on their mission."
Sitting outdoors in the pulsing desert heat in midafternoon, Major Patterson and Major Hoffman said it was normal for soldiers facing combat to also face fear and stress.
"Out here, we lose all the normal structures as to who we are," Major Patterson said. "You're in a foreign situation. Look around. You're in the biggest sandbox in the world. With no toys, except guns. People get frightened. They have no control over their daily life. And they have to be reminded of the token skills that allowed them to succeed so far."

HEADLINE: Abuse Cases Pose Threat To Worship, Experts Say 

BYLINE:  By ADAM LIPTAK 

DATELINE: BOSTON, April 4 

 BODY:
The sexual abuse scandals that have engulfed the Archdiocese of Boston and the Roman Catholic Church have become a powerful threat to religious liberty, said several legal scholars who spoke today at a conference at a Catholic law school.
 "These cases will profoundly alter the nature of organized religion," said one professor, Patrick J. Schiltz, of the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis. "This litigation has the potential to do to churches what many a tyrannical government could not." 
 The conference, at the Boston College Law School, in Newton, Mass., included many of the leading legal scholars of church-state relations, canon lawyers and the general counsel of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. They acknowledged that the scandals arose from widespread and terrible abuses.
But they also expressed surprise at how quickly and vigorously the law governing the activities of churches had reacted to the scandal. Several suggested that the legal system had overreacted and perhaps acted capriciously.
"Criminal liability for a diocese is now on the table, something that would have been unimaginable not long ago," said Angela Carmella, a professor at Seton Hall Law School.
John Baker, a professor at Louisiana State University Law Center, said an agreement in December between the Diocese of New Hampshire and the state's attorney general was "outrageous interference" by the government in religious matters. That diocese agreed to state oversight in exchange for a promise that it would not be indicted.
Professor Laycock said several states had "utterly absurd amendments of statutes of limitations" that let people who said they had been sexually abused sue long after the alleged abuse. He said the amendments were unnecessary and unwise.
"The victim knew it happened when it happened to him," he said. "He was there." He added that looser legal standards could encourage frivolous suits.
Mark E. Chopko, the general counsel of the bishops' conference, said that the economics of litigation after a $120 million jury award in Dallas in 1997 compelled dioceses to take aggressive legal positions.
"I've not seen a claim since then that has come in under seven or eight figures," Mr. Chopko said.
Professor Schiltz, who has represented churches of many denominations against hundreds of sexual abuse claims, also said churches were so wary of crippling financial liability that they had become too conservative in choosing pastors.
"Even the least risk-averse bishops will now take a lot more priests out of the ministry than the John Geoghans and Paul Shanleys," he said, referring to two former priests who are accused of abusing scores of people here. 
Douglas Laycock, a law professor at the University of Texas, agreed that lawsuits against churches could alter the composition of the ministry.
"The pursuit of zero incidents is a mistake and an illusion," Professor Laycock said. "You won't have a priesthood left if you do that. You should not let these cases not only blacken the name of the church and scandalize the faithful but also fundamentally change how churches operate."
Several of the speakers sought to compare churches to news and political organizations, which receive heightened protection from libel and similar suits under the speech and press clauses of the First Amendment. These speakers questioned why religious organizations were not entitled to increased protection under the religious liberty clauses of the same amendment.
"Freedom of religion is every bit as important as freedom of speech," the dean of Boston College Law School, John H. Garvey, said.
On Tuesday, a Massachusetts judge here declined to allow the Archdiocese of Boston an immediate appeal of a trial judge's order rejecting its First Amendment defense in hundreds of sexual abuse cases.
The sexual abuse cases, Professor Schiltz said, "are transferring hundreds of millions of dollars from churches to plaintiffs, plaintiff's attorneys, defense attorneys, expert witnesses and others." Most payments, he said, are not covered by insurance and are made at the expense of churches' charities.
Many of the claims, he continued, involved seemingly consensual relationships between adults, though perhaps ones distorted by the disparity of power between a pastor and a congregant. Some of those claims, he said, were based on little more than a kiss, a lingering hug or a gift of flowers.
But these cases, he said, allow unpredictable juries to engage in antireligious animus.
"It is giving hundreds of juries around the country free shots at churches," Professor Schiltz said. "Juries have unbounded authority to act out of religious spite."

HEADLINE: Public Confronts New Virus on Laymen's Terms 

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
Mothers are buying vitamins to strengthen their children's immune systems, Americans with no plans to travel to Asia are snapping up respiratory masks, and a Wall Street economist has predicted a global recession, all linked to fears about the new respiratory disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.
 In the absence of conclusive scientific information about the disease, the public is grappling with it on its own, unapologetically laymen's, terms. Rumors and angst about SARS, fueled by the Internet and a public primed for biological apocalypse, appear to be accelerating faster than in previous disease outbreaks and spreading more widely than the disease itself. 
 "I think that SARS could be a potential pandemic," said Monty Tabor of Halifax, Nova Scotia, who started an e-mail discussion group with the admittedly alarmist title "SARS: the new plague." 
The illness tops the "buzz index" on Yahoo, the popular Internet search engine, and rose to second place last week -- after Al Jazeera -- from No. 8 on the search engine Google's "zeitgeist" list. Countless Web sites are posting news stories, personal accounts and speculation about the disease. 
The variety of responses may reflect an abiding fear of infectious diseases rooted in a time before inoculation vanquished arch-villains like polio and smallpox, medical historians said. 
The responses may also simply represent any given individual's best effort to deal with a new unknown -- even one that has not resulted in any deaths in the United States.
"Whenever there is ambiguity, people will search for more certainty," said Kathleen Tierney, director of the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware. "When people go to the Web they often get conflicting information, which generates more searching and just intensifies the process."
Public anxiety over a novel disease is a familiar pattern tracing from the Black Plague through the West Nile a novel disease is a familiar pattern tracing from the Black Plague through the West Nile virus, public health officials said. Experts said much of the response, including people canceling trips to Asia, is perfectly reasonable given how little is known about the syndrome.
Other responses are less rational. The Web site Spiritoftruth.org.nz calculates that the entire United States population will be infected in about 23 weeks if new cases continue to double every week (defying the nature of how infectious diseases spread). An Internet site devoted to collecting urban legends and rumors, Snopes.com, has been fielding a barrage of e-mail messages about the illness, many of them anti-Chinese (that the disease originated with people in Hong Kong eating dogs that had it, that workers at Chinese restaurants have the disease, and so on). 
A favorite Internet rumor, that the disease is the result of a genetic engineering experiment run amok, fits the template of similar rumors that circulated about AIDS and hantavirus. Perhaps easily dismissed as a standard conspiracy theory, it may speak to a desire to predict and manipulate the world that biological reality does not always provide.
"For a lot of people, it's more comfortable to believe that the C.I.A. cooked something up in a secret lab somewhere and it got out than to realize that new diseases come into being all the time," said Barbara Mikkelson, who runs Snopes.com. "You can just fire the C.I.A., or get a better government. What are you going to do about nature?"
As anxiety -- or at least fixation -- on the illness intensifies, public health officials are seeking to calm fears and avoid the kind of panic behavior that occurred in October 2001, when several letters containing anthrax were sent through the mail. Some people ended up microwaving their mail and sought to corner the supplies of the antibiotic Cipro at their local pharmacies. 
"You don't want people to hurt themselves in some other way in an effort to avoid an infection like this," said Vicky Freimuth, associate director for communications at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "It's critical that a credible source out there is giving information about what we know so people don't turn to other sources that might be more alarmist."
The C.D.C.'s efforts include significantly stepped-up communication with news organizations, which it hopes in turn will convey accurate information to the public. As of April 1, the agency had held 1,300 interviews and eight news conferences, set up for television outlets, which had complained during the anthrax scare when the telephone conference calls were the chosen communications mechanism.
Worldwide, health officials have reported more than 2,000 cases and more than 80 deaths. But of the 100 suspected cases in the United States, no one has died, and C.D.C. officials emphasize that most Americans do not have to worry about catching the disease. 
Such increased public outreach does not appear to have quelled the furor: the agency's hot line is now fielding more than 1,000 calls a day, double the number of just a few days ago and more than at any time during the anthrax attacks.
Kimberly Wood, 40, of Hazleton, Pa., says that she has been absorbing all the information she can about SARS, but that nothing has addressed her concerns. She has been feeding her children extra vitamin C and has stocked up on powdered milk and canned vegetables in case the disease comes to the East Coast.
"I almost laughed at the people who were so worried about West Nile," Ms. Wood said. "I don't worry about anything like this, but for some reason SARS really got me. So I'm preparing, just in case."
Personal precautions vary by profession, geographical location and risk profile.
A dental hygienist at an office on the Upper West Side of Manhattan is asking her patients if they have traveled recently to Asia. If so, she asks them to put off their appointments for a month. 
The American Association for Cancer Research canceled its annual meeting in Toronto, where several of the cases have been diagnosed. The flight attendants union has demanded that airlines supply protective gloves and masks to employees on flights to Asia. The island country of Mauritius, in the Indian Ocean, has suspended its two weekly flights to Hong Kong for a month.
Jack Androski, a sales analyst in Manhattan, settled for trucking in antioxidants after returning from a vacation last week to find his roommate, a personal trainer, had come down with a cough. "We had a long conversation about it over the breakfast table," said Mr. Androski, 30. "We were like, 'Is this SARS?' But so far I haven't gotten it."
What drives some of the less-than-rational fears over the illness, medical experts say, are both a lack of understanding among the public of how infectious diseases are spread, and an enduring human suspicion, no matter how much we may understand intellectually, of things we cannot see. 
"There's something about germs and bugs being transmitted invisibly that is a very powerful scary image for people," said Baron Lerner, a historian of medicine and internist at Columbia University. "These diseases that pose less of a threat to people than many things they do in their daily lives, like riding a car, nevertheless cause anxiety above and beyond what is warranted." 
Most people may know that the number of deaths due to infectious illness has dropped sharply, from over 90 percent before World War II to about 5 percent today. But for reasons that are themselves also largely irrational, risks that are new and exotic also tend to draw more fevered concern than those that are more dangerous.
"When a new strain of influenza, which kills on average 30,000 people a year in the United States, appears, we don't see this kind of attention paid to it," said Henry Miller, a fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. "It's the psychology of risk perception. People have far less concern about risks that they think they understand."
Ronald Arakelian, a doctor of internal medicine in Turlock, Calif., thinks his risk perception is just fine -- and he has been calling every health official in the state to voice his concern about SARS. 
"I'm sitting out here in California, which is the epicenter of where this could break out," Dr. Arakelian said. "The thing I'm trying to understand is, is the government for whatever reasons, political or economic, going to allow this deadly virus, and that's not an exaggeration, to spread throughout this country? I'm not on the lunatic fringe, but am I panicky? I'm probably the most panicky person here."

HEADLINE: Faith and Terrorism in the Muslim World 

BYLINE:  By Kenneth M. Pollack; Kenneth M. Pollack is the director of research at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution and the author of "The Threatening Storm: The Case for Invading Iraq."

 BODY:
 THE CRISIS OF ISLAM
Holy War and Unholy Terror.
By Bernard Lewis.
184 pp. New York:
The Modern Library. $19.95.
 EVEN now, with American troops in Iraq, the wound of 9/11 has begun to heal, salved by the balm of victory over the Taliban, the destruction of Al Qaeda's Afghan sanctuary and the seeming success (perhaps illusory) of our new defensive measures for homeland security. With this distance must also come greater reflection and deeper inquiry.
In the wake of our collective tragedy, Americans repeatedly asked, "What caused them to do this to us?" But in truth, it was not so much a question as a rhetorical challenge -- nothing, no ideology or theology, no past injustice or extant grievance could possibly justify an act of such inhumanity. We wanted an explanation that would justify our anger, our outrage and our basic human demand for revenge. Into that angry void stepped Bernard Lewis with his best seller, "What Went Wrong?," which provided an answer to that agonized question: the sources of rage among Muslims stemmed from their frustration with the decay of their own civilization.
Now it is time to ask a different question: "Why did it go wrong?" And perhaps a more important one still: "What, if anything, can we do about it?" Once again, Bernard Lewis has come forward with a book, "The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror."
There is much wisdom in everything that Lewis writes. His new book is no exception. Here, with updated passages from previously published pieces along with new material, he fleshes out a skeleton that he constructed in a widely acclaimed article called "The Revolt of Islam," which appeared last year in The New Yorker. Unfortunately, at some point before it became a book, that piece seems to have lost its way. 
"The Crisis of Islam" is rich with the eloquence and erudition for which Lewis has become known and admired, even by his critics. Where this book is at its best is in showcasing his knowledge of the history, historiography, jurisprudence and customs of Islamic society in the Middle East. For this reason, his chapter "The House of War," describing the theological basis for jihad and martyrdom, as well as their distortion by some fundamentalists to justify terrorism, is a gem. So too is "Double Standards," which deals with America's own sordid relationship with Middle East tyrants.
Many of Lewis's arguments are powerful and persuasive. He describes the commonalities behind the Islamic fundamentalism of Al Qaeda's terrorism and the Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamic republic. He explains that aspects of current Middle Eastern terrorism -- the call for jihad and the desire to fight both infidels and apostates -- do in fact stem from aspects of Islamic doctrine, while demonstrating that other key elements, like the attacks on innocents, particularly women and children, and the resort to suicide attack, have no basis in Islamic Scripture and run counter to centuries of tradition. 
Lewis also does a great service in baring some of the hypocrisies confounding the Islamic Middle East. He points out that the Organization of the Islamic Conference, an international conclave of 57 countries with large or majority Muslim populations, frequently complains about the mistreatment of Muslims at the hands of non-Muslims (particularly Israelis and Westerners), but has been noticeably silent when Muslims have mistreated their own. He compares the "powerful and widespread condemnation of Israel" following the Sabra and Shatila massacres in Lebanon in 1982, which left 700 to 800 Palestinians dead at the hands of Maronite Christians acting with permission from the Israeli Army, to the silence in the West and elsewhere that accompanied Syria's massacre of 10,000 to 25,000 at Hama that same year (let alone the 50,000 to 70,000 that Saddam Hussein massacred after the 1991 intifada in Iraq). 
There is also a powerful chapter titled "A Failure of Modernity," which examines the widely acknowledged fact that the Middle East has fallen behind not just the West but many other parts of the world in economic and political development. However, this chapter also betrays what is most lacking in "The Crisis of Islam." Lewis argues that the failure to modernize is what has turned so many Middle Eastern radicals to Islamic fundamentalism; if modernization and reform can't work, their alternative is to return to traditional Islamic ways. But he fails to go beyond this "what" to address the "why," and it is the "why" that we most need to understand now.
In part, the problem is that the book simply is not long enough. Many of Lewis's contentions are (not surprisingly) very controversial, yet he often fails to provide the reader with the evidence to support these arguments. When Bernard Lewis makes an assertion, it should never be taken lightly. But even his authority cannot on its own sustain many of his most provocative points. 
For instance, Lewis suggests that for some Arabs the very experience with the West convinced them that imitation was not the answer, and so they turned to confrontation and a return to "purified" Islam. He argues that Arab efforts to adopt Western economic practices often produced poverty, and efforts to adopt Western political methods produced autocracy. But he provides littleevidence that this is actually what the Islamists believe.
Likewise, Lewis claims that United States policy toward the Middle East has been quite successful over the years, because "there is, after all, no Vietnam in the Middle East, no Cuba or Nicaragua or El Salvador, not even an Angola." This would appear to overlook Lebanon, Somalia, the Iranian revolution, hostage takings, terror attacks, constant Arab-Israeli strife and our 12-year agony with Iraq. Why is Cuba a failure but Iraq not? Why is Nicaragua a failure but Lebanon not? Indeed, one might argue that Nicaragua and El Salvador turned out to be relative success stories -- and precisely the kind of success stories we lack in the Middle East. 
Another concern is that the book meanders. Lewis's prose is so elegant and effortless that the reader glides smoothly from place to place. However, it is only afterward that one realizes that while many of the stops Lewis makes are pleasant and even fascinating in their own way, they did not contribute enough to the journey. 
But the greatest flaw in "The Crisis of Islam" is that its journey stops short of the destination that Lewis's readers will want to reach. In "What Went Wrong?," Lewis, by describing the decline of Islamic civilization, in effect explained how the Islamic Middle East reached its current state of political, economic and social stagnation. But he failed to explain not only why Islamic civilization declined but why the intensive efforts to reform -- and even copy the West -- proved fruitless, while similar reforms by other societies succeeded. 
By the same token, Lewis describes how anger and frustration with the inability to modernize has caused some Muslims to turn to Islamic fundamentalism, and some fundamentalists to turn to un-Islamic terrorism. And he does mention at least some of the causes of that anger and frustration. In particular, he explores the issues of American support for Israel and for Arab autocracies. But he does so too briefly and with little more depth than in the original New Yorker piece. 
Thus this new book leaves the reader unsatisfied. Lewis still has not grappled with the deeper questions for his readers. He still has not offered his explanation for why the Islamic Middle East stagnated, why its efforts at reform failed, why it is notably failing to become integrated into the global economy in a meaningful way and why these failures have produced not a renewed determination to succeed (as in East Asia over the past 50 years, and arguably in India, Latin America and even parts of sub-Saharan Africa today) but an anger and frustration with the West so pervasive and vitriolic that it has bred murderous, suicidal terrorism despite all of the Islamic prohibitions against such action.
Given Bernard Lewis's great erudition, we need him to take on these questions. When he finally does so, his views will undoubtedly arouse controversy, as his work always has. But until we have scholars of Lewis's wisdom and learning offering their explanations for the current agonies of the Middle East, we are unlikely to attain the kind of understanding of the problems of the region that might provide us with the purchase to discover a path beyond them.

HEADLINE: Sports of The Times; 
It's Coaches, Not Players, Who Benefit

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, April 5 

 BODY:
Roy Williams is halfway there, but Roy Williams has been halfway there before. 
 Tonight, Williams earned his second trip to the national championship game by crushing Marquette, 94-61. That victory will only intensify speculation that Williams will accept the challenge of stabilizing North Carolina's program. 
 We have been waiting for a sign, one way or the other. Instead, all Williams has done is issue cryptic, one-toe-in-one-toe-out statements. "Before you make every decision in your life, you ought to think about it," he said. He said he wasn't going to take one second to think about anything that would distract him from thinking about Nick Collison and Kirk Hinrich, his senior stars. 
I think Williams should go. The Tar Heels desperately need a stabilizing vision, deep and wide, that Williams can provide. After 15 seasons at Kansas, Williams is at an intriguing point in his career: too old to start over, too young to think of winding down and young enough to think about an enduring legacy.
The million-dollar question is what happens to his players. This is a problem and a question that is increasingly ignored as coaches escalate their pursuit of better jobs. 
What about the players you leave?
Of all the myriad contradictions of intercollegiate athletics, this is the most troubling.
Major intercollegiate sports function like a plantation. The athletes perform in an economic atmosphere where everyone except them makes money off their labor. 
In the revenue-producing sports of football and basketball, athletes are the gold, the oil, the natural resource that makes the N.C.A.A. engine run and its cash register ring. 
Coaches climb the ladder on the shoulders of players. Too often the only thing players receive are sore shoulders. 
Asked about how he would feel if Williams left Kansas, Moulaye Niang, the Jayhawks' 6-foot-10 freshman, was guarded. 
"I won't know how I'll feel until he leaves, if he leaves," Niang said. 
Jeff Hawkins, a freshman guard, was more forthcoming. 
"Honestly, if Coach Williams left, I would probably want to leave, too," he said. "That's how big of an impact he has."
Last week Ben Howland left Pittsburgh to take the head coaching job at U.C.L.A. 
Good for Howland. But what about the athletes he recruited? The ones he looked in the eye and told he would be there for them. Now "there" is not Pittsburgh, but Los Angeles.
In the rules governing the annual ebb and flow of coaching changes, the coach is free to move about, in and out of contracts. The student-athlete is shackled to an N.C.A.A. regulation that restricts movement. 
If one of Pittsburgh's players decided to leave for another Division I team -- as Howland did -- the player, under N.C.A.A. rules, would have to sit out for an entire season, losing a year of eligibility. The rules are designed to keep this valuable labor pool in its place. In the Big 12, student-athletes who transfer within the conference must sit out two seasons. 
Despite tonight's drubbing, Marquette's Tom Crean is the latest hot up-and-coming coach. He will eventually leave for a larger program and double his salary. 
Rick Barnes of Texas is on his fourth job.
As Myles Brand, the N.C.A.A. president, begins his quest to "turn down the volume" of intercollegiate athletics, he should begin by eliminating the obvious contradictions. 
Begin with the transfer constraints. If a player commits to a college and the coach leaves, the player should be released from the commitment and be permitted to transfer without having to sit out a year. 
Howland is not sitting out. Barnes never sat out.
Purists say that athletes play for the school. In fact, Barnes made that point. Barnes has been a head coach at George Mason, Providence, Clemson and now Texas. Barnes has left a lot of players behind. "There's been some times I would have loved to take every guy that I left with me," Barnes said.
Then he added: "I think players have to know this: that when a coach is recruiting for that university, that's who he's recruiting for. That university is the one that's paying for that coach to be there to do that job."
I don't buy that; I don't think Barnes really buys it, at a practical level. Dave Gavitt, who formed the Big East Conference and was its first commissioner, said he thought Barnes was being naive. 
"You can argue that 'Hey, the kid picks a school,' " Gavitt said. "But they don't pick a school. They pick the coach and the school. Every one of those kids that's wearing a Texas uniform, Barnes had a lot to do with them going to Texas."
The coach has the ability to move freely. Students can do the same. Any student who feels Marquette, Kansas, Texas or Syracuse is not right for them can leave and quickly be in a new college. The only individuals on campus unable to move without restriction are the student-athletes. Howland has a new job; Roy Williams may soon have his dream job and Tom Crean will have his pick of jobs. The players they signed should have the same flexibility. 
Coaches look recruits in the eye and promise, "I'll be there for you." 
But in an era of rapid movement, exactly where is "there"? 
For the time being "there" is a plantation in the university's backyard.

HEADLINE: The Irresistible Appeal of Refinancing 

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
APPLICATIONS for mortgage refinancings have continued at record levels in recent weeks, buoyed by the attraction of low interest rates that have brought homeowners back to the table to arrange lower-cost loans. The surge continued a pattern in which refinancing applications have outpaced initial applications in most months over the last two years. 
 Two years ago, the Richland Equity Resources Corporation, a mortgage brokerage in Manhattan, sent a mailing to 600 clients and prospects saying that with interest rates near a 34-year low, it was an ideal time to refinance. The result was a 10 percent response and many refinances, according to Richard J. Russell, Richland's president. 
 Rates continued to fall last year and in the first quarter of 2003, but Mr. Russell decided that another mailing was not worth the expense -- so many people had already refinanced and so much attention had been given to low rates that it hardly seemed necessary. 
Frank Nothaft, chief economist of Freddie Mac, the mortgage company, estimated that last year mortgage refinancing applications totaled 15 million loans, a record. That followed 10 million refinancing requests in 2001.
In some cases, homeowners have been refinancing for a second or third time. Amy Crews Cutts, the deputy chief economist for Freddie Mac, cited friends who refinanced last December. When rates fell again in mid-March, Dr. Cutts said, "they were already phoning their mortgage broker." 
Some economists acknowledge that they have been surprised by the persistence of the decline in rates. "A few months ago," said Phil Colling, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association, "we were expecting that interest rates would rise, but instead they kept falling." 
According to Freddie Mac's weekly surveys, the average rate for 30-year fixed rate mortgages decreased to 5.79 percent for the week that ended on Friday from 5.91 percent the week ended March 28. For the week ended March 21, the rate was 5.79 percent.
As to the future direction of rates, Mr. Nothaft said, "Uncertainties about the length of the conflict and its impact on the economy will influence mortgage rates in the weeks to come." In other words, one can only wait and see.
Loan applications for refinancings have been consistently strong in reports compiled by the mortgage bankers' group ever since the middle of last year, Mr. Colling said. Although the proportion of refinancing applications as a percentage of all applications for the week ended March 28, 73.3 percent, was down from 76.5 percent the week of March 21 and the record high of 80.5 percent the week ended March 14, Mr. Colling said the figure for the week ended March 28 was still the seventh highest level on record. "There are still a large number of mortgage applications flowing into the pipeline," he said. 
David Berson, the chief economist at Fannie Mae, said that the extraordinarily high proportion of refinancing applications reflects considerable sophistication on the part of home owners. "It shows that people know what's happening with interest rates," he said. 
Sarah and Bryan McNitt would seem to be such people. Last October they moved out of their apartment in Manhattan and into a two-story colonial house on 1.7 acres that they bought for $450,000 in Valley Cottage, in Rockland County. The couple -- she is 32, her husband 37 -- took out a $364,000 30-year fixed-rate loan at 6.625 percent. 
But they are already refinancing. When they close on the new loan, which is expected next week, the rate for their $369,000 30-year fixed loan will be a most-attractive 5.5 percent. The larger mortgage covers closing costs of $5,000, including about $1,000 in prepaid interest for the time between the loan's closing and the first full payment. Beginning June 1, when their first payment is due, their monthly mortgage payments will drop to $2,095.14 from $2,330.73, a saving of $235.59 a month. 
"We bought our house because it's beautiful," Mrs. McNitt said, "and because the drive to Manhattan, where we work, is only about 25 minutes." They also bought the house because they plan on having a family, and because, she added, "brick and mortar is the safest investment there is now." The McNitts are not alone in that assumption, with savings accounts offering anemic rates of interest and the stock market in decline. Some 5.6 million existing homes were sold last year as well as a record 976,000 new homes, according to the National Association of Home Builders. New home sales declined 8.1 percent in February, however, but the association attributes that drop to a combination of bad winter weather and uncertainty about the economy and about the war in Iraq. David Seiders, the association's chief economist, said the industry remains on track to reach 972,000 new single-family sales this year, just short of last year's record.
Katherine August-deWilde, the executive vice president and chief operating officer of First Republic Bank in San Francisco, said home purchases overall have actually been stronger than expected in part because of the low mortgage rates and also because people are worried about the volatility of the stock market. Therefore, she added, many people are looking to buy more expensive houses or second homes. 
Unless hostilities result in the disruption of the oil supplies or something equally pervasive, Dr. Cutts at Freddie Mac said, "housing prices are expected to grow an average of 5 percent, and there will still be high demand for houses." 
HOUSING demand throughout the New York metropolitan area shows little sign of abating. On Long Island, said Dr. Robert Campbell, a professor of real estate and finance at Hofstra University, houses in the midprice range, between $250,000 and $350,000, are holding firm, while the prices of more expensive homes are not going up and may even be going down. But outside many major urban areas, Dr. Cutts said, low interest rates have made it more advantageous for many people to purchase a house than to rent. 
In recent days economists specializing in housing issues have been preoccupied with the interplay of the economy, the war and interest rates. Douglas Duncan, the chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, said that if there is a "swift and stable" ending to the war, there could be a modest rise in interest rates and some decline in refinancing. But the combination of an end to war,a stimulus package passed by Congress retroactive to the first of the year and interest rates upward toward 7 percent would signal that the economy is set to take off. "And a rapidly growing economy," he added, "will create a strong housing market by creating jobs, although it will be at the expense of refinancing, which will drop off as interest rates rise in the stronger economy." 
Mr. Nothaft, the chief economist at Freddie Mac, said he expected economic growth to accelerate in the second half of this year, assuming the war is not prolonged. "But if it turns out to be an extended conflict," he added, "it would be bad for the economy and bad for interest rates, so that we'll see continued gyrations in the capital markets and the stock market." But if the war ends within a few months, "markets should calm down a little," Mr. Nothaft added, "and that should set the stage for economic growth in the second half of the year."
Mr. Berson, the chief economist at Fannie Mae, said that even if interest rates rise, "the increase will likely be modest because inflation should remain very low and because the Federal Reserve's view of the noninflationary growth potential of the economy is much changed from a decade ago -- suggesting that any Fed tightening will also be modest." 
Orawin Velz, senior economist at Fannie Mae, said that while the economy is not likely to pick up before the third quarter, the rate on 30-year fixed mortgages is likely to stay below 6 percent for the year.
Rising interest rates would, of course, have an effect on refinancing. Keith T. Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH Associates, a financial publisher in Butler, N.J., said that in the next month or so, for each week that rates are above 6 percent, refinancing activity would dwindle. If rates were to rise to 6.25 percent or higher, he added, there might be an initial jump in refinancing activity, because people might see it as a last chance to refinance. "But if rates go to 6 1/2 percent," he said, "the majority of refinances would be over with." 
During the surge of refinancings, the interest rate has not the only factor than homeowners studied. Some saw it as an occasion to shorten the term of their mortgage. While the 30-year fixed mortgage remains the loan of choice, some lenders say many homeowners who refinance are opting for 15-year fixed-term mortgages, thereby halving their loan term to 180 months. Interest rates are typically lower on 15-year loans, but monthly payments, of course, are higher. 
For example, assuming no prepayment of principal or interest, a $150,000 fixed-rate loan for 30 years at 6 percent would cost the borrower $899.33 a month, while a 15-year $150,000 fixed loan at 5.125 percent would cost $1,195.98 a month. The difference in monthly payments would be $296.65. But the borrower who could manage the higher monthly payment would save $108,480.77 over the life of the loan.
Despite the long-term savings, Michael Moskowitz, the president of Equity Now, a Manhattan mortgage lender, said that lenders who routinely advise refinancing from 30-year to 15-year mortgages may be doing a disservice to many homeowners. "Though the interest savings is meaningful, say 0.25 to 0.5 percent, the monthly payment is about $200 higher on a 15-year loan for every $100,000 borrowed," he said. "So despite their best intentions, many homeowners have trouble making the higher payments, especially on loans of $200,000 to $400,000 and higher. 
W HILE some homeowners are financially strong enough to handle the 15-year payments," he said, "I recommend that most refinance at the 30-year term. They can always make additional or higher payments if and when they have extra money, while not feeling obligated to do so." 
Dr. Oded Marcovici, a Manhattan veterinarian, is an example of a borrower who prefers a 30-year fixed mortgage. He took out such a mortgage when he bought his co-op brownstone on the Upper West Side in 1999, and he did it again this February when he refinanced. The first time, he chose a $202,000 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 7.375 percent, and when he refinanced he took another 30-year fixed loan, but this time for $201,500 at 6 percent interest, for a difference in interest rates of 1.375 percent. His new loan included $1,500 for closing costs, which will take eight months to recoup. But his monthly payments dropped from $1,395.16 to 1,208.90 -- a saving of $186.26 a month.
"The first time I talked about refinancing, people told me, 'Don't do it if the rate is less than two percentage points, because it isn't worth it,' " Dr. Marcovici said. "But why isn't it worth it? It's like found money." 
A Freddie Mac survey indicated that the average refinanced mortgage in 2002 had an interest rate about one and one-eighth percentage points lower than the original mortgage. While that is considerably below the two percentage point threshold that used to be the conventional wisdom, there are some limits beyond which refinancing does not make sense. 
Just over two weeks ago, for example, a man walked into the Brooklyn Federal Savings Bank on Court Street and told Daniel Bennett, an assistant vice president and mortgage officer, that he had a 5.75 mortgage but wanted to refinance over 10 years because the rate had recently dropped to 5.125 percent.
"I did some quick math," Mr. Bennett said, "and told him that it would cost about $3,000 in closing costs so he'd end up saving only about $2,500," over the course of the whole loan. "At that point he got up and left."
While a large majority of refinancings in recent years have been for fixed-rate loans, adjustable rate mortgages, widely known as ARM's, remain in favor with about 10 to 15 percent of borrowers. The reason borrowers choose adjustables is that their rates start out lower than those for fixed-rate mortgages; their downside is that after the fixed term, their rate can change yearly for the remainder of the loan. That is why homeowners who expect to remain in their house for many years are advised to take a long-term loan, while ARM's are considered a better choice for many who plan to stay only seven years or less.
Adjustable-rate loans could receive a boost late in the summer when a proposal by the Department of Housing and Urban Development to expand the number of adjustable-rate loans that qualify for F.H.A.-insured mortgages is expected to go into effect.
The only F.H.A.-insured adjustable-rate loan currently available has a one-year initial period with caps on the interest-rate increase of one percentage point a year, with a maximum increase of five percentage points over the life of the loan. The additional types of adjustable-rate F.H.A. mortgages being proposed would have initial terms of three, five, seven or 10 years, after which rates could adjust yearly, up or down, over the remaining life of the 30-year loans. 
The interest rate for the proposed three-year and five-year ARM's would not increase by more than one percentage point a year after the fixed-payment period ended, with a maximum of five percentage points for the life of the loan. For seven-year and 10-year ARM's, the maximums would be two percentage points annually and six percentage points for the life of the loan. 
THE maximum loan for a single-family house is $280,749 while the maximum for a four-family house is $539,835. The housing department estimated that as many as 40,000 families would choose the new adjustable-rate mortgages to finance their homes. 
If the variety of mortgages has not changed much in recent years, there have been changes in borrowers' approach to them. 
"In the old school, parents told their children they should take a fixed-term mortgage at the lowest rate they can find," said Mr. Bennett of Brooklyn Federal Savings Bank. "Now their sons and daughters tell their parents to refinance to lower their rates." Another difference, he said, is that, "While the children are fixated on asking about the rate, rate, rate, few of them bother to shop around for closing costs."
While closing costs rarely appear in advertisements or commercials, in which the emphasis is most often on interest rates, lenders say it is a mistake not to compare them. Closing costs can vary widely, depending on where one goes for a loan, Mr. Bennett said, as well as the size of the loan, lawyers' fees, title charges, the mortgage recording tax, fees for preparing the documents necessary to close the loan and the number of points charged, if any, since each point represents 1 percent of the total loan amount. 
Since closing costs can amount to thousands of dollars, Mr. Bennett added, anyone who does not take the time to shop around for them risks throwing money away.

HEADLINE: The Arab TV Wars 

BYLINE:  By Daoud Kuttab; Daoud Kuttab is the director of the Institute of Modern Media at Al Quds University in Ramallah. He lives in East Jerusalem and Amman, Jordan.

 BODY:
Day 1, Amman, Jordan
Although President Bush's ultimatum to President Hussein ended after midnight last night, I was sure that the war would not start for a few days. My wife's parents are staying with us this week because they are worried about the war, and when I got up this morning, they told me that missiles had already hit Baghdad. I turned on the TV and watched CNN for a bit, then flipped over to Al Jazeera. The Iraqi information minister, Muhammad Said al-Sahaf, was on, and he was in the middle of introducing Saddam Hussein.
 The next image was a live feed from Iraqi television, with the Iraqi emblem in the top left corner and a seated Saddam Hussein with large glasses on in the center of the frame. Seconds later the TV screen went blank. I immediately thought that the Americans were trying to jam the broadcast. But after a few seconds it was on again, this time bearing the logo of Iraqi Youth TV (which is run by Saddam's oldest son, Uday). A pale-faced Saddam, clearly exhausted, spoke defiantly from a prepared text. My father-in-law, who takes the Arabic language very seriously, said that the speech was full of attempts at poetic flourishes, but that Saddam was reading some of them wrong, stressing the wrong syllables. He must not have had time to practice. 

Day 2, Amman
The human element of this war became much clearer this morning when we woke up to video on Al Jazeera of Iraqis injured in the attack on Baghdad. Al Jazeera is the most-watched Arab satellite station, partly because its journalism is highly professional and partly because viewers like the fact that its reporters and anchors give the news a pro-Arab spin. The station was established in 1996 with money from the emir of Qatar and now has a highly skilled staff of Arab journalists, many of whom made their careers working for the BBC and other respected European broadcasters. Almost every Arab government gets upset with Al Jazeera, because it doesn't toe the party line the way the various national networks do. Al Jazeera will juxtapose government spokesmen with antigovernment opponents. The fact that the Americans got so furious at Al Jazeera for showing the bin Laden tapes only increased the network's popularity and credibility among Arabs.
As I ate my breakfast, I switched back and forth between the West and the East. CNN, Sky and the BBC were saying that the Fao peninsula and Umm Qasr had fallen to the U.S. coalition troops. But the Arab satellite stations were running reports, quoting Iraqi officials, denying those coalition claims. In a live press conference, the Iraqi minister of information and the Iraqi minister of the interior questioned the authenticity of the video images of Iraqi soldiers surrendering. The Iraqi officials seemed to be losing their composure, calling the Americans "infidel colonialists" and "uncouth bloodsuckers" and saying that since the invaders were not respecting international law, then the Iraqis would not be bound by international treaties in dealing with prisoners of war.
In the evening, King Abdullah went on Jordan TV, which is a state-run broadcast channel. He was trying to express his understanding of the public anger regarding the war, while not alienating his friends in the U.S. government. "I know the pain and anger you are feeling because of the suffering and ordeal that the Iraqi people are facing," he intoned. "I am one of you. I share the feelings of every one of you, and my confidence in you and your awareness has no limits." But he asked his subjects to be restrained in their protests. "As for the demonstration of our feelings toward the brotherly Iraqi people, it has to be expressed in a civilized manner that will help to ease the anguish of our brothers."

Day 3, Amman
My father-in-law turned on Al Jazeera early this morning, and the first thing I saw was a roundup of the world media, which included a report from The New York Times about the surrender of an entire Iraqi division. The next item was from the gulf daily newspaper Al Bayan, which reported that an interim government was going to be set up in Basra by the Americans and British and that one of the first decisions of this interim government was going to be the recognition of Israel. The Iraqi interior minister gave another briefing, in which he insisted that the invaders had suffered major losses. He said that resisting forces, made up of Baath activists and local Bedouins, had destroyed five U.S. tanks in the south Iraqi desert.
I got the newspapers when I arrived at work. The independent Jordanian daily Al Arab Al Yawm led with the big headline "Barbaric Shelling Lights Up Baghdad's Night."
In the evening, when I got back home, I heard that Al Jazeera had been running stark images all day of some of the Iraqi civilian casualties from Basra. I switched to the brand-new Saudi-owned 24-hour news channel Al Arabiya, whose correspondents talked about an Egyptian family of 11 (including 4 children) that was killed at the outskirts of Basra. The television station used the term "shaheed," which means "martyr," to describe anyone killed by the American-led forces. I was surprised that Al Arabiya would use that language; I didn't think its Saudi backers were great fans of Saddam. The station was started just a couple of months ago by the Middle East Broadcasting Center, which has had a lot of success with an Arabic version of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."

Day 4, Amman
The first thing I noticed when I turned on the television this morning was a reference to Americans using "Israeli tactics." This was on the Lebanese station Al Manar, which is very popular with Palestinians and other Arabs for broadcasting news from Palestine and the speeches of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah. While generally opposed to the war, this station has had interesting alternative opinions that hint at the need for change in Iraq -- not by means of a foreign invasion but rather by a collective Arab resolve, based on closer relations between Arab leaders and their people.
I flipped over to Al Jazeera, where an item on the crawl at the bottom of the screen said that the shell of an Israeli-made missile had been recovered in the latest attack on Baghdad.
On my way to work, I stopped by a local money-changer, and as I was leaving, my cellphone gave a special jingle. I subscribe to a news messaging service connected to the news service Agence France-Presse. The brief message on my phone read, "Four Jordanian students were killed when their car was hit by a U.S. coalition missile near Mosul in northern Iraq." I expected that today would be a difficult one in Amman. Bader Al Agha, the university student who reads the news at AmmanNet, the Internet radio station I run, told me yesterday that student demonstrations were expected today. This news will no doubt add to their anger.
When I got home, the TV broadcasts were shocking. Footage of a large number of Iraqi civilians searching for an American pilot who was said to have parachuted after his plane ran into trouble. Then on to a press briefing by Taha Yassin Ramadan, the Iraqi vice president, who the Americans had said was killed in the first night's attack. He was defiant, blasting away at Kofi Annan for pulling the U.N. inspectors out. He denied that even a single Iraqi town had fallen and also said that American soldiers had been captured. Video of them would soon be provided to the media, he promised.
Sure enough, a few minutes later Al Jazeera began showing footage taken by an Iraqi TV crew. The scenes were so bloody we had to quickly take our 3 1/2-year-old daughter, Dina, away. After the scenes of the killed marines, we were then shown the P. O.W.'s. The first one looked literally scared to death. Even Salam, my wife, who has been so angry with the Americans for starting this war, said she felt sorry for them.
By 8 p.m., we couldn't take it any longer. Salam insisted that we turn the television off and said that we could turn it back on only if we could find a nice film, preferably a comedy.

Day 5, Amman
I was supposed to go to the West Bank town Ramallah this morning, but under intense pressure from my wife, who was worried that traveling would be too dangerous, I decided to stay in Amman for another day. Iraqi state television announced this morning that "an important and historic speech" by Saddam Hussein would soon be broadcast. Patriotic songs played. Under the title "The Decisive Battle," an Iraqi official in a military uniform appeared on the screen between songs to announce that the speech was about to begin. Saddam, when he finally appeared, seemed much more composed than he did on the first day of the war.
An Egyptian military expert on Al Jazeera said that the speech proved that the "barrier of fear" had been broken and that we as Arabs had learned that we can say no to the Americans. In an interview, the Iraqi foreign minister, Naji Sabri, said that an unexploded Israeli missile had been discovered near Baghdad, which he said proved without a doubt the involvement of the Israelis. The text ticker reported that fighting was continuing in Umm Qasr, and it kept repeating that the American director Michael Moore had expressed opposition to the war at the Academy Awards. I had no idea who Michael Moore was, but now I knew that he was against the war.
I flipped over to Al Manar, the Lebanese station, where they were reporting on Umm Qasr. A retired Lebanese army general said proudly that no one expected a small port in southern Iraq to resist the Americans for five days. 
When I got to work, everyone at the station was poring over the newspapers. All the Jordanian papers carried photos of the American P.O.W.'s on their front pages. "A Field Day of Losses for the American and British Troops," read a huge headline across the entire front page of Al Arab Al Yawm. "Fierce Battle and Tough Resistance Throughout Iraq," read an eight-column headline in the largest daily, Al Rai. 
Since I was leaving for Palestine the following morning, I decided to take my wife out to dinner. In the car, we turned on Radio Sawa, which is financed by the American government. Sawa is a newly packaged version of the Voice of America that has been winning over young Arabs in the last year or so with an entertaining mix of Arab and Western pop music, broken up with extremely brief nuggets of headline news. Since the start of the war, though, Sawa has been running a lot more detailed news -- focusing on the American point of view -- including live coverage of all the major U.S. military briefings, with simultaneous translation into Arabic. As we drove, we listened to Gen. Tommy R. Franks, who was boasting that the campaign's progress was "rapid, and in some cases dramatic." 

Day 6, Amman to East Jerusalem
When I woke up, I turned on Abu Dhabi TV, and the first images I saw were pictures from a hospital, children with casts and bandages on their heads. Abu Dhabi TV is another attempt to emulate the success of Al Jazeera -- and to steal its audience. Most of the new channels are backed by one sheik or another as an antidote, or at least an alternative, to Al Jazeera's populism. The rulers of the United Arab Emirate of Abu Dhabi have a vast amount of oil money, and they've been spending some of it on Abu Dhabi TV, which uses state-of-the-art technology to produce broadcasts that at least seem independent.
I set out for Ramallah. The only way to get there from Amman is by public transportation -- service taxi, which means a shared taxi. The taxi drivers tend to listen to one of two radio stations -- the Saudi-owned Middle East Broadcasting Center (MBC), broadcasting from London over an FM repeater station in Amman, or the Arabic service of the BBC. My driver was listening to the MBC announcer, who was talking about the meeting of Arab League foreign ministers in Cairo. The meeting had just ended with a statement resolving to go to the U.N. Security Council to put a stop to the U.S. invasion. A commentator on MBC ridiculed the resolution, saying that before going to the Security Council the Arabs should put their own house in order, considering that five member countries were giving logistical support to the coalition forces.
When we got to Ramallah, I picked up a few Palestinian newspapers. They were full of boasts about the holdouts in Umm Qasr and Nasiriya. They seemed to be trying to create a mythology around what they considered to be heroic Iraqi resistance. There was a four-column photo in Al Quds, the most popular Palestinian newspaper, showing a downed American helicopter and the farmer who, according to the caption, had shot it down. 
In the evening, we were delayed at a checkpoint outside Bethlehem. I tuned in to the Arabic service of the BBC, which was reporting that a popular uprising against Saddam had begun in Basra. When I finally got through the checkpoint and made it to a friend's house, we switched on Fox News, where a reporter was repeating the same story about the uprising. 
When I arrived at last in East Jerusalem, I tuned in to Al Jazeera, which broadcast a phone interview with the Iraqi minister of information, who was vehemently denying the story about the Basra uprising. "I officially deny the lies that the Americans and British are trying to propagate using CNN and other stations," he said. Al Jazeera turned next to its reporter in Basra, who also refuted the claim, saying that he had not seen or heard anything unusual except for a large explosion at about 5 p.m. 

Day 7, East Jerusalem
My first images this morning came from CNN, which has been running and rerunning a positive story (from the coalition's point of view) showing British troops mingling freely with Iraqis in Umm Qasr. Over on Al Jazeera, they were playing a message from Saddam, read by the minister of information, encouraging his people to fight on, promising them that if they continue fighting, the invaders will withdraw. To its credit, Al Jazeera followed this with a clip from President Bush saying: "We cannot know the duration of the war. Yet we know its outcome; we will prevail. . . . Our world will be more secure and peaceful."
When I watch CNN and ABC and MSNBC (I have to pay extra to get American stations), I notice that a lot of their reports are from "embedded" reporters. Al Jazeera also has a correspondent embedded with the coalition troops, but just one: Amr Kahki, who was reporting today from Umm Qasr. He interviewed British military leaders who said that they are working on "building relations" with the Iraqi population in the village. And he interviewed local leaders who said that they were "confused," and weren't sure exactly what their legal status was. Amr Kahki is good, but he's not the real media star of the war -- that's Majed Abdel Hadi, a Palestinian reporter for Al Jazeera who is in Baghdad, seen daily (and nightly) reporting on the shelling. He was famous even before the war because of his dispatches from Tora Bora during the war in Afghanistan. 
Al Jazeera seemed like an all-American network today. First President Bush was shown giving a speech, and then Colin Powell came on to give an exclusive interview to the anchor, Adnan Sharif, a stocky man who used to work for Jordanian TV. Powell told the Arab television audience that the U.S. wanted this war to end as soon as possible and that American forces have been doing their best to minimize Iraqi civilian casualties. Despite the fact that Al Jazeera's economic correspondent was just kicked off the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, officials in Washington have been lining up to get on the network. 

Day 8, East Jerusalem
Fadi Abu Saada, the young and charismatic anchor at Radio Bethlehem, said that at the U.N. Security Council, several speakers mentioned the connections between Palestine and Iraq. One ambassador, he said, referred to "the occupation of Iraq and Palestine." The sandstorm in Baghdad and yesterday's hard-fought battles were also on the news, with Iraqis describing them as "heavenly intervention."
A question of terminology has been a subjectof heated debate around the AmmanNet office in recent days -- whether to refer to the situation in Iraq as an invasion or a war. Arab television stations tend to use the term "invasion" as part of their regular war logo. Al Jazeera uses the logo "War on Iraq" (and not war in Iraq). The Lebanese Hezbollah station Al Manar uses the phrase "Invasion of Iraq"; the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation uses "Iraq in the Middle of the Storm." And the Saudi station Al Arabiya uses a more neutral phrase: "The Third Gulf War." (The Iraqi war against Iran was the first; the war following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was the second.)

Day 9, East Jerusalem
Fridays are usually protest days in the Arab and Muslim world. This morning, Abu Dhabi TV ran a report about public anger in Egypt, focusing on the fact that the Egyptian government has banned all street demonstrations. Then came a long report from New York showing many images of the antiwar demonstrations outside Rockefeller Center and near New York University. A report from Tehran said that many Iranians are coming to the Iraqi Embassy there, volunteering to join the Iraqi resistance.
Another interesting question of terminology today. Al Arabiya TV reported on the 116 Iraqis killed in Basra without using the term "shaheed" (or "martyr"), which they used in the first days of the war.
The human cost of war was evident all over television today. On ABC, Diane Sawyer was taping a "video postcard" of family and friends wishing speedy recovery to an injured soldier, while on Abu Dhabi TV, a reporter was interviewing Iraqis fleeing from the battle near Nasiriya. A well-dressed man with a red kaffiyeh was walking quickly and telling the reporter, "Water, water, that is what we need." A woman dressed in black was criticizing the American and British forces and calling on Arabs to help. A woman carrying a baby said, "We just want peace."

HEADLINE: The Iraqi Time Bomb 

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick is a contributing economic columnist to The New York Times, editor of Challenge Magazine and the author of "Why Economies Grow."

 BODY:
The denial of economic reality that permeated Wall Street a few years ago has now migrated to Washington. On Wall Street, when companies did not generate the promised profits to justify the bubble in stock prices, many analysts told investors that profits did not matter. A new economy would be gauged by other measures, they insisted. Today, in similar fashion, as the federal budget has plunged into the red over the past two years, President Bush's economic team is telling the nation that deficits no longer matter.
 At first, perhaps, the claim seemed plausible. Damage to the economy was not yet evident. And I, for one, am not a deficit hawk. At times, deficits are necessary to stimulate economic growth, and their dampening impact on private investment is occasionally exaggerated. But because of the Bush administration's policies and a weak economy, deficits are now approaching unmanageable levels, as they did in the 1980's. In fact, the federal government's fiscal health has deteriorated at a pace so stunning that few have yet caught up with the facts. 
 Here are some of those facts. Even without a war, the budget deficit would have exceeded $300 billion this year -- just three years after the budget experienced a surplus of nearly $240 billion. (This was in the midst of a four-year run of substantial surpluses.) But with war costs escalating and revenues falling as a result of the flat economy, this year's deficit could rise to $400 billion. In fiscal year 2004, it is likely to be higher. 
The president has asked Congress for $75 billion to finance war-related costs, but many think a more realistic estimate of the combined costs of war and reconstruction will be closer to $200 billion. More alarming is the decline of government revenues over the long run. Instead of generating $5 trillion to $6 trillion in surpluses over 10 years from rising tax revenues on growing incomes, the government will now probably come up nearly $2 trillion short through 2013. That recession and slower growth have shrunk tax revenues is predictable enough. But the sinking stock market has taken more of a toll than expected: there are no more outsize capital gains to tax. These yielded fat revenues in the late 1990's, when stocks were soaring, exaggerating the fiscal health of the nation. Now the train is running in reverse.
Finally, the Bush tax cuts have made long-term financial prospects significantly worse. Occasionally, tax cuts make sense. But the $1.4 trillion tax-cut package passed in 2001 would have been more productive if it had been temporary and applicable to more taxpayers. Instead, it was skewed to the rich (who are prone to save rather than spend) and will be permanent -- far from disappearing should the economy improve, the tax cut will grow larger. The administration proposed a second major tax cut in early January, estimated to cost $726 billion over 10 years, and it appears to be even less effective as a near-term stimulus: more than half of the total results from the elimination of taxes on dividends, an idea raised at Bush's economic summit in Waco, Tex., last August by a stockbroker, Charles Schwab. In addition, the Bush administration followed up this tax plan with a new budget that would extend the 2001 cuts three years past their expiration, costing another $600 billion.
The Senate has since voted to reduce the $726 billion budget request by half, but last week it was still far from clear that this change would prevail, given that the House passed a budget resolution that assumed the president's tax cuts.
The consequence of all these steps? Budget deficits as far as the eye can see. When Bush took office, his budget team estimated there would be a cumulative surplus of some $5.6 trillion over the next 10 years. Now, in light of the 2003 tax cuts and the new Bush budget, the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan economic research arm of Congress, calculates that a long-term surplus will turn into a $1.8 trillion deficit between 2004 and 2013.
Unfortunately, economists outside the government estimate that the deficit will be even larger. William Gale and Peter Orszag of the Brookings Institution figure the deficit is likely to approach $2.5 trillion. The Wall Street economists William Dudley and Edward McKelvey of Goldman Sachs say that the deficit will exceed $4 trillion by 2013.
The timing of this looming deficit could not be worse. The retirement of baby boomers is about to begin en masse. In 10 years, the costs of Social Security and Medicare will start rising rapidly. By the 2020's, these costs will begin to reach roughly 12 to 15 percent of gross domestic product, compared with about 6.8 percent today. To put this in perspective, consider that all current federal expenditures now come to only 20 percent of G.D.P.
The concern about large deficits is that they reduce long-term economic growth and produce even less revenue for social programs. When large enough, government deficits require so much federal borrowing that they can displace private investment and push up interest rates on mortgages, consumer credit and business borrowing to levels that thwart home buying, consumer purchases and capital investment. (If interest rates should stop falling, home refinancing, which has recently been a principal source of more money for consumers, will be less attractive.) Big deficits also make the U.S. economy especially vulnerable to the loss of capital investment from overseas. Because Americans save so little, and because the nation imports much more than it exports, the United States must attract close to $500 billion of foreign capital annually to finance its growth. High budget deficits could easily reduce the confidence of foreign investors, who already own 36 percent of U.S. government debt. If they sell some of those securities, they will drive down the value of the dollar and U.S. investments will become even less attractive. Over the last year, the dollar has already fallen by 20 percent against some major currencies.
The slower growth that results from large deficits affects everybody. It leads to lost jobs, lower wages and fewer business opportunities. A return to the sluggish economy of the 1980's and early 1990's is not only possible but likely.
Straitened conditions are being felt already. States, starved for revenues because they cannot borrow to make up for the deficits caused by the economic downturn, are now cutting education, health and poverty programs aggressively. State and local governments are also complaining that money promised by Washington for homeland security has not arrived. And the president recently told the states that there's no extra money for them.
Given the pinch, how can we explain the administration's fiscal choices? Some economists in the Bush camp claim that lower tax rates and the elimination of taxes on dividends will both motivate people to work harder and investors to invest more. The economy will grow faster than traditional economic models anticipate, producing tax revenues that will reduce projected budget deficits. But most economists say there is a large measure of ideological wishful thinking here, reminiscent of the supply-side economists who advised President Reagan. Bush's economic advisers argue, for example, that the dividend tax cuts may generate more growth than any conventional economic model can predict by making investment in stocks more attractive; rising stock prices will in turn encourage investment. Few economists agree, however, that eliminating dividend taxes will have more than a modest impact on stock prices. And even a 20 percent boost in stock prices from current levels does not restore them to their recent highs.
Narrow politics, of course, can partly account for the Bush administration's tax proposals. The tax cuts disproportionately benefit the wealthy, which, after all, is Bush's natural political constituency. But Bush's policies may, in fact, best be explained by another, more radical agenda. Extensive tax cuts will require Congress to limit the growth of social programs and public investment and undermine other programs altogether. If that is your vision of the best direction America can take, the strategy makes some sense. So, we were wrong about how dividend tax cuts stimulate growth, you can almost hear the Bush advisers thinking. No problem. Rising deficits will inevitably force Congress to starve those "wasteful" social programs. The prospective high deficits may even make it imperative to privatize Social Security and Medicare eventually. Social spending is the problem, goes the argument, not tax cuts. 
The Bush administration has been inconsistent about its economic rationales since its earliest days in office. First, President Bush justified his $1.4 trillion tax cut in 2001 by claiming the government should return surpluses to taxpayers when the economy is strong. He found a convincing ally in Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, whose influence was critical to the tax cut's passage. Then, as the economy appeared to be weakening, Bush argued that a tax cut was needed for an entirely different reason. It would stimulate the weak economy inherited from Bill Clinton. This made sense, but as noted, the tax package was not a short-term stimulus package.
When, by early 2003, there was no escaping the fact that the federal budget would remain in long-term deficit, the Bush administration's budget office did not issue the customary 10-year forecast. Instead, it only forecast a five-year budget. Beyond that, the Bush team said, economic events were too uncertain.
The Congressional Budget Office, however, does not enjoy such flexibility. It produced its standard 10-year outlook, which spelled out the obvious. But to give the Bush administration its due, a more recent C.B.O. analysis also tried to take into account the possible growth incentives of the tax cuts. Based on at least seven different approaches to how government policies may affect future finances, none of the Congressional Budget Office's economic projections eliminated the future deficit. To the contrary, they all clustered around the original $1.8 trillion deficit figure that the office had calculated earlier. (The number of possible approaches to these forecasts alone suggests how little is truly known about the impact of such changes.) There would be a significant budget deficit every year through at least 2013, and, by implication, for many years after. 
Can we live with these new deficits? If they remain as low as the budget office predicts, they will come to less than 1 percent of gross domestic product in the last few years of the forecast. Even so, this will probably impede economic growth. And by 2014, when baby boomer liabilities begin to rise rapidly, there will be no easy way to finance them. As Lee Price, the chief economist of the Senate Budget Committee Democrats, points out, by 2010 or even earlier, the nation will have to start gearing up to pay for the baby boom retirement. This will require either a very large tax increase or substantially reduced benefits. The financial markets will force the government to become more responsible about spending, or interest rates will be driven to damagingly high levels.
And that's based on a moderately optimistic forecast, one that assumes the economy grows at a healthy rate. Specifically, it assumes that productivity -- the output per hour of work that is the primary source of growth -- will rise by 2 percent year. That is a rate slower than that of the booming late 1990's, but it is considerably faster than the average pace between 1973 and 1995.
The C.B.O.'s projection incorporates only changes proposed in the Bush budget. But other costly adjustments will be necessary. Most important, tax cuts will subject as many as 40 million taxpayers to the higher alternative minimum tax. (The A.M.T. forces taxpayers, whose payments would be very low on account of large deductions, to pay at least a minimum rate.) The government will almost certainly change that, further reducing tax revenues. Also, some expiring tax provisions will surely be extended. Gale and Orszag of the Brookings Institution find that these factors add another $700 billion to the 10-year deficit. This does not include war expenditures.
Dudley and McKelvey of Goldman Sachs reach their estimated $4.2 trillion 10-year deficit by adding war and reconstruction estimates. They also expect that Congress will pass a substantially higher provision for reimbursement of prescription drug costs under Medicare than Bush has proposed, and that economic growth will be slower than anticipated. 
These and several other realistic assumptions result in a federal deficit that is unquestionably a terrible burden. The deficits will require so much borrowing that the Goldman economists figure that the size of the federal debt will rise from 33 percent of gross domestic product to 49 percent. This, even more than annual deficits, alarms economists. The federal revenue needed just to pay the interest will be enormous.
Even this estimate does not take into account a realistic view of the costs of war and a new foreign-policy doctrine that could mean military involvement elsewhere. The $75 billion in appropriations that the Bush administration recently asked for covers only the first six months in Iraq. As for the costs of peace, it is hard to make any sensible assessment. Some military experts claim that the presence of only 50,000 troops will be required. Gen. Eric Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, estimates that as many as 200,000 troops will be needed. That could well cost $50 billion a year. There are wide-eyed hopes that Iraq's oil revenues will defray most of the cost of reconstruction, but it will take several years to bring production to its full potential, as well as billions of dollars -- and that's assuming there is complete peace. Some put the estimates of maintaining peace and building democracy in the hundreds of billions of dollars.
And implementing the new world vision Bush has discussed recently will require still more money. An ongoing presence in the Middle East beyond Iraq will soak up additional billions; potential crises in Korea and elsewhere will demand expensive attention. As I understand it, since even before the war started, the Defense Department has been spending money so fast it can't keep track of it. In sum, the new defense commitment looks open-ended.
The budget resolution the House passed last month makes clear the dollar amount of cuts in domestic programs that would have to be made in order to retain something close to fiscal balance in Washington in 10 years. They will involve deep cuts in programs from Medicaid to school lunches to college loans to, perhaps most cynically in the current environment, veterans' benefits. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities calculates that reductions in mandatory programs for the elderly, veterans and the poor would come to $265 billion over 10 years. Another $210 billion would be lopped off of discretionary programs. The total of $475 billion is about equal to the tax reduction the president is requesting for the top 1 percent of earners in America.
To make this politically palatable, the reductions would be phased in. Average reductions would be only 1 percent in the first year, but they would rise rapidly and would average 4 percent over 10 years. In the worst years, the budget for Medicaid would be cut by 7 percent. 
But the House bill is based on the C.B.O. projections. If other economists are right, and the deficits are considerably larger, still greater cuts will be required to balance the budget over time -- in fact, perhaps double the amount. The Bush administration insists that it can live with the budget deficits and still maintain many of these programs. Denial has become almost a ritual. But it cannot have anticipated how quickly America's finances have turned to red, and it is not very likely that it is prepared to face the reality that the financial markets, if not Congress, will eventually impose on it. If there is no growth miracle on the horizon that would raise government revenues, the Bush administration's options will be limited not only domestically, which may be part of its design, but also militarily. The administration may well be compromisingits own dearest goals.
The longer we wait, the harder it will be to correct the nation's finances. Most of us will be hit from both ends. Incomes will not rise the way they did in the late 1990's, and it will be difficult to save for retirement. The rising costs of education and health care will be harder for the typical family to meet. Meanwhile, government will not have the money to help. Programs may be cut across the board. And consider what was not accomplished in the 1990's, despite the nation's prosperity. More than 40 million Americans still have no health insurance. The United States has the highest proportion of children born into poverty in the developed world. The quality of education remains grossly unequal. Even two-worker families cannot afford quality day care. Much remains to be done. 
There is time for a course correction. But the longer the nation waits, the harder the problems will be to fix. Forecasting the economic future, as everyone knows by now, is no sure thing. But the federal government simply cannot indefinitely spend so much more than it takes in. At some point, the nation will either raise taxes significantly or make painful cuts in cherished federal programs.
But as long as the full consequences of Bush's extravagance are not immediate, and war limits serious public criticism, the president may for now get away with promising guns and a little butter. And we will all pay for it.

Some Travel Bargains by Air, but Even More by Sea

BYLINE:  By JANE L. LEVERE 

 BODY:
TRAVEL companies have been cutting prices for months, but more bargains are surfacing this spring, especially for cruises.
 Many people had been reluctant to travel because of the economy and lingering fears of terrorism. But the war in Iraq and concerns about severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, have increased their travel jitters. 
 "The cruise business was already softening leading up to the war," said Scott Barry, who tracks the industry for Credit Suisse First Boston. Mr. Barry said that while many cruises have already been discounted, cruise operators have been under pressure to cut rates further. "Regardless of the environment, cruise lines always sail full," he said, explaining that as much as one-fifth of their revenue comes from passengers' on-board spending. 
Many cruise deals can be found on the Internet, at sites like Cruise411.com and Icruise.com. Some discounts are available only through late spring, though many, like those from Windstar, Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity, will be around through fall.
Among the discounts available last week for Caribbean cruises was an 11-night trip, leaving April 23 from New York, in an inside cabin on the Queen Elizabeth 2; it was offered on Icruise at $872 a person, double occupancy, reduced from $1,820.80. Icruise also had eight-night Caribbean cruises, leaving April 11 and April 19 from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in an inside cabin on Carnival's Legend, for $351 a person, double occupancy, from $760. Cruise411 was selling a seven-night Alaska cruise leaving May 23 from Vancouver, British Columbia, in a cabin with balcony on the Celebrity Summit, at $1,145.75, a person, double occupancy, reduced from $1,425. All these rates do not include port charges, taxes or air fare. 
Royal Caribbean has cut the rate for an inside cabin on its 12-night Mediterranean cruises on its Brilliance of the Seas ship, leaving from Barcelona from May through October (www.royalcaribbean.com). The cruises are now available at $999, down from $1,599; the price does not include taxes or air fare. 
Windstar (www.windstarcruises.com), cut rates on March 1 on most of its cruises through 2003. But it reduced many rates even more last week. A seven-night Mediterranean cruise leaving June 1 from Venice, was reduced by an additional 33 percent, to $1,595 a person, double occupancy, in an outside cabin on the Wind Surf; the price does not include air fare, though it does include port charges and taxes.
The rate for the same type of cabin on the Wind Star ship on seven-night Tahiti cruises in June fell an additional 18 percent, to $2,795; that rate includes air fare, taxes and port charges.
TRAVELERS who may not be interested in cruises can also find airline and car rental deals for their next vacation, but they may have to look a little harder. 
Robert Harrell, who runs an air travel consulting business in New York, said most airlines had not been cutting fares but instead were reducing capacity by eliminating many flights. "My sense is that as of mid-April, U.S. carriers' systemwide capacity will be down 10 percent from their original mid-April schedules," Mr. Harrell said.
Still, some airline deals are available, especially through discount sites like Hotwire.com and consolidators like Destination Europe Resources (www.der.com). Gregg Brockway, the chief product officer at Hotwire, said its airline ticket prices and car rental rates have fallen 10 percent since the start of the war in Iraq. Hotwire's cruise rates, he said, have fallen about 9 percent, on top of a 17 percent industrywide decline from a year ago. Hotwire does not disclose the name of a travel company to customers until after they make a purchase.
Among the deals it offered last week on major United States airlines for April and May was a $356 round-trip coach fare between Los Angeles and Honolulu. The fare, which requires a 21-day advance purchase, was reduced from $427. Hotwire also had a round-trip, 21-day advance purchase coach fare between New York and London at $342, down from $457.
For car rentals, Hotwire offered deals like a daily rate of $14.63, not including taxes, for a midsize car in Reno, Nev.; that rate was reduced from $27.95. The rate for a similar car in San Jose, Calif., was also $14.63, down from $23.95. Hotwire offers rentals from companies like Avis, Budget and Hertz.
Destination Europe Resources has cut prices on trans-Atlantic air travel on many North American airlines through the end of the summer; its rates are available through travel agents or by calling (800) 782-2424. For example, a round-trip New York-to-Paris fare, available from June 16 to Aug. 31, fell to $479 from $804, while a round-trip fare from New York to Rome in the same period dropped to $869 from $1,012. These rates, which do not include taxes, require a Saturday-night stay and weekday travel, and must be bought by Thursday.
In recent weeks, many tour operators have cut rates on vacation packages with spring and summer departures. Collette Vacations (www.collettevacations.com) cut prices on some tours to Alaska, Canada and Hawaii by 5 to 10 percent. Tauck World Discovery (www.tauck.com) reduced the air fare on some European itineraries and took $250 off the price, per person, double occupancy, for certain cruises in the Mediterranean, New England and Canada.
The Far & Wide Travel Corporation (www.farandwide.com) is offering discounts of $150 a person on some tours in Central and South America and the South Pacific through Nov. 30; the purchase must be made by May 31. It also offers savings of more than $450 a person on many late-spring tours in Europe; these require purchase by May 15.
Globus and Cosmos cut the price on certain summer tours in Italy by $125 a person (www.globusandcosmos.com); purchases must be made by the end of April.
Travelers can expect more discounting, analysts say, if the war drags on. Mr. Harrell contends that the airlines may also cut fares. "They want to see what the demand will be on reduced capacity," he said, "and they won't know this until mid-April."

HEADLINE: The Growth Mirage 

 BODY:
President Bush's "economic growth and job creation program" now dances before Congress like an Orwellian mirage. The administration is trying to justify its outsized tax cut plan by resorting to the Reagan era's discredited pipe dream of supply-side economics. 
Like an alchemist, Mr. Bush contends his pending $726 billion "growth" proposal will considerably compensate for lost tax revenues by spurring economic development, somewhere over the rainbow.
 Republicans in Congress love talking about their "growth package," and it certainly does sound better than a tax-breaks-for-the-wealthy package. But if they cared to listen, an excellent and objective analysis of its real effects can be found right in the Capitol. Far from the economic growth and deficit reductions predicted by the White House, the tax cuts would mean more than $1 trillion in deficits in the next five years alone, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The C.B.O. is the lawmakers' nonpartisan in-house source for estimating the actual bottom-line numbers of blue-sky proposals. 
 The conclusion is particularly relevant because the estimates were done by the "dynamic scoring" method long demanded by supply-side conservatives who find traditional static techniques less liberal, to use a word, in assuming that bounty follows tax cuts. The conclusion is interesting, too, because the new C.B.O. director, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, is a respected economist who until recently was a White House adviser favored for his supply-side leanings. In a particularly graceful, unpugnacious turn of phrase, the budget office concluded after weeks of testing various models that the larger economic claims for the president's proposals were "not obvious."

Out of Ammunition, The Economy Faces a New Foe

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
THE United States is winning the war. But the news on the economic home front is bad and getting worse.
 After another week of worse-than-expected economic data, many economists now believe the United States is on the verge of slipping into its second recession in two years, even if American and British forces quickly depose Saddam Hussein. 
 Though many Americans may believe the economy crossed that threshold awhile ago, the gloom is not universal. Some economists think the economy will eke out another year of slow growth, aided by interest rates that are at historic lows and the rising federal budget deficit, which in the short run helps the economy. 
But the risk of another recession is real, and it appears to be rising each week the war continues. Even if the United States technically avoids recession (two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth), the economy almost certainly will not create enough jobs this year to keep up with the expansion of the labor force.
"It is clear that the war is not the only problem the economy has," said David Wyss, the chief economist at Standard & Poor's. "The best case is that the war gets over quickly and that it stays over, that we don't decide to straighten out Iran, Syria, North Korea, France, or whatever country is next in line, and people can then go back to business as usual, but business as usual is still only moderate growth."
The economy is stalling even as the Federal Reserve and the government do everything they can to stimulate growth. In economic cycles since World War II, government spending and low interest rates pulled the United States out of recession. This time, even though the Fed has lowered short-term interest rates 12 times in three years, and the government has swung from a $237 billion surplus in 2000 to a projected deficit of more than $300 billion this year, the medicine appears not to be working. 
On Friday, the Labor Department reported that the United States lost 108,000 jobs in March, on top of a loss of 357,000 jobs in February. That decline followed reports earlier in the week that both the manufacturing and service sectors shrunk in March.
"The numbers don't look good," said Rory Robertson, an economic strategist for Macquarie Equities New York, an Australian investment bank. Like other forecasters, Mr. Robertson attributes the economic woes to a combination of war and other factors. 
Through the winter, many businesses put off making investments in advance of a conflict they believed might provoke terrorism and disrupt oil supplies worldwide.
Now, in the midst of a war, businesses are still postponing investments. Meanwhile, many business sectors, including telecommunications, information technology, financial services and airlines, have too much capacity and are continuing to cut jobs.
Mr. Wyss, who counts himself an optimist, noted a bright spot: oil has fallen by more than $10 a barrel in the last month, aiding businesses and consumers. He predicts that the United States economy will grow more than 3 percent this year, and that the unemployment rate will end the year below its current level of 5.8 percent.
But Mr. Wyss, who says he is a Republican, said he is disappointed in President Bush's economic proposals. Like most mainstream economists, he believes the administration's tax cut proposals are too large, given the deficits they would create. Also, the cuts would go mainly to wealthy people, who are less likely to spend them immediately than middle- or working-class Americans.
"I don't think we can afford huge tax cuts in our current state," Mr. Wyss said.
The administration argues that its tax cuts, which would increase the deficit by $726 billion over the next 10 years, will help the economy. 
The plan will "stimulate consumer spending and small business investment," Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said in a speech in Florida on Thursday.
Stephen Roach, the chief economist at Morgan Stanley and long one of Wall Street's most pessimistic forecasters, said the latest statistics show the precarious position of the United States and world economies. The world economy probably shrank during the first three months of this year, for the first time since at least 1991, he said. And the outlook is clouded further by the disruptions caused by the new illness, SARS, which is hitting Asian economies hard. 
"I'm trying to be optimistic and I'm not getting anything to lean on," Mr. Roach said. 
And with short-term interest rates at their lowest levels in 40 years, Mr. Roach said he did not know how much difference rate cuts will make. "If you look at the sectors that always respond the most to easier money, they've already responded, like housing and cars."

Heard the One About the I.R.S. Auditor?

BYLINE:  By Abby Ellin (COMPILED BY MARK A. STEIN)

 BODY:
Amid the corporate scandals, bankruptcies, rising unemployment and falling consumer confidence, it's a glum time on Wall Street. But if you look a little closer you can find something to laugh about. So believes David Moore, chairman of Sonostar Ventures L.L.C., a private equity and venture capital firm in Chappaqua, N.Y. 
 That could explain why Mr. Moore, 47, who moonlights as a stand-up comedian, is the host of the first annual "Business Comedy Night" at Caroline's on Broadway, the comedy club between 49th and 50th Streets in Manhattan. The show is scheduled for April 15, the deadline for personal tax returns. 
 On this night, which Mr. Moore describes as "the most unfunny day of the year," he and other comedians, including Kevin Meaney and Jim Gaffigan, will crack wise about corporate scandals, economic policy, unemployment -- and, yes, the Internal Revenue Service.
"People who've paid their taxes are done crying, and now they want to laugh," Mr. Moore said. "The reality is there are a lot of comedians who make fun of big business. The bad press -- Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, Martha Stewart, Bill Gates -- has certainly been good for comedians."
Mr. Moore offered a sample from his act: "I keep reading that they can't find any written evidence to indict Martha Stewart." Pause. "Are we supposed to believe that Martha Stewart made $200,000 on the stock trade and never sent a thank-you note?"
Mr. Moore, who received an M.B.A. from Harvard, said he was a toast maker extraordinaire at weddings and bar mitzvahs, but did not follow his interest in comedy. Three years ago, a friend faxed him information about an amateur comedy night; he went, performed, "killed" and was hooked. Caroline Hirsch, who owns Caroline's, calls him "the world's funniest C.E.O."
He is modest about this honor. "I'm not sure that's such a great moniker -- it's like 'the world's funniest undertaker,' " he said. "I'm not sure there's that much competition; I think I'm the only C.E.O. currently on the comedy circuit." Abby Ellin

Arabs Have a Litmus Test for U.S. Handling of Iraqi Oil

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
IF popular opinion in the Middle East is united on anything, it is that oil -- not terrorism, not regional stability and not any intention to bring democracy to the Iraq -- is the real reason the United States decided to oust Saddam Hussein. In Jordan, a longtime ally of Washington, a recent poll showed that 83 percent of people there think that the United States wants to control Iraq's oil.
 Oil "has become the symbol of a colonial power which all the countries of the region have experience with," said Edward S. Walker Jr., president of the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based research organization, and a former ambassador to Saudi Arabia. 
 Because of that, and with all eyes upon it, one of the first challenges the Bush administration will face after the fighting ends is managing the world's second largest reserves of oil in a way that gains the trust of the local population and dispels the skepticism of others in the region. 
Iraq has as much experience with colonialism and oil as any Persian Gulf state. In 1918, three years before creation of the Kingdom of Iraq under a British mandate, Sir Arthur Balfour, the British foreign secretary, said of Mesopotamia's untapped reserves: "I do not care under what system we keep the oil. But I am quite clear it is all-important for us that this oil should be available."
To achieve that end, British forces captured the northern city of Mosul several days after the World War I armistice was signed.
Throughout the 1920's, Britain, France and the United States (which denounced the "imperialism" of the other two) jockeyed for control of Iraq's oil. It was not until after World War II that Iraq began to gain some measure of control of its own. It was a founding member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the first meeting of which was held in Baghdad in 1960, and nationalized its oil industry in 1972. 
"Oil has been so integral to the emergence of a modern Iraq," said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. "What will unfold in Iraq will remind us of how tightly woven oil and nationalism -- national identity -- can be." 
Iraqis and other Arabs are already insisting that the United States guide the oil industry, not run it. What "guidance" would entail remains mostly vague, but some Arabs have a few clear ideas. For example, Arabs will be watching closely to see if the Iraqis themselves set their oil policies and whether they choose the foreign service companies to repair their badly dilapidated oil fields, and whether a disproportionate share of those companies are American, said Nader Sultan, the chief executive of the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation.
"The Americans have to demonstrate that in the process of awarding contracts, there is a level playing field for interested companies," Mr. Sultan said. "At the same time, you cannot liberate the industry from Saddam's regime and then not leave the decision-making in the hands of the liberated Iraqis." 
So far, the Bush administration has consistently said that Iraqi oil belongs solely to the Iraqis, but it has also said it intends to control how the country is rebuilt. On Tuesday, industry experts who had spoken to administration officials said that Philip J. Carroll, a former chief executive of Shell Oil Company, the American arm of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, had emerged as the leading candidate for the job. The administration declined comment.
United States involvement, at least in the near term, seems unavoidable. The safety of Iraqi oil fields has to be assured, and there is the possibility of ethnic conflicts if, say, the Kurds or the Shiites try to exert control over the fields in their regions. 
Then, too, Iraq's oil industry has badly declined after years of war and United Nations sanctions, and the Bush administration will not want the billions in reconstruction and expansion contracts to go to what it considers the wrong people. It will also want to control the revenues from oil exports to ensure that it can manage the rebuilding of the country.
"It's going to be a real problem," Mr. Walker said. "There's almost no way to use oil to reconstruct the Iraqi economy without having an American oil czar, which seems to be what the Pentagon is planning," Mr. Walker said.
The administration's task is helped and complicated by the competence within the Iraqi oil industry. Though the industry's physical plant is a mess, its work force of 60,000 or so is regarded as a model of professionalism among oil-exporting states. Any attempt by outsiders to take over, many regional experts say, could touch off a backlash. Iraqi resistance to American control of the oil industry could take the form of strikes or simple inaction. In that event, an American oil overseer would be faced with arresting strikers or firing them, and bringing in people from overseas, said Issam al-Chalabi, a former Iraqi oil minister. Resistance might even extend to sabotage or terrorism, other regional experts said.
The impact of this on the Middle East could be "an increase in fundamentalism and increased threats to governments that have been friendly to us in the past," Mr. Walker said. "Some of those governments could pull back from us," he added. "We might have difficulty getting help in the war on terrorism or there might be an uptick in acts of terrorism."
ONE move that would be welcome, at least by the Iraqis and some Arab leaders, is if the United States opened the books on how the oil revenues are used, regional experts said. 
A recent report by Human Rights Watch found that oil money usually subverts democracy by making a country's leaders unaccountable to its citizens. The United States could work with Iraqis to disclose the sources of oil revenue and the awarding of contracts, the report said. The group also encouraged independent auditing of the oil company's books, and the creation of a trust fund, similar to a system Norway has for investing a portion of the profits to benefit future generations.
"A postwar Iraq could become a model for other petroleum economies," said Arvind Ganesan, director of the business and human rights program at Human Rights Watch. It could prove, Mr. Ganesan said, "that it is possible to benefit from oil wealth without sacrificing human rights, democratic freedoms, or fueling massive corruption."

HEADLINE: The World; 
The Strategists Fight a War About the War

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
IN recent days, military traditionalists who emphasize the importance of large, conventional forces have tried to associate the initial setbacks in the Iraq war with the military innovators -- those who think the future of warfare lies with lighter, smaller, more mobile and better-coordinated units.
 Yet even as large armored units rumbled toward the war's climactic showdown in Baghdad, the dramatic rescue of Pfc. Jessica Lynch last week, with her rescuers sending video signals back to base, was one of several successful elements of the war so far that relied on the innovators' strategies: surprise action with nimble networked units as opposed to the huge deployments of the past. 
 Typically, the debate over military planning has been framed as a question of quantity, or of whether technology in the air can replace boots on the ground. But those are misinterpretations, said John Arquilla, a professor of defense analysis at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif. 
Together with David Ronfeldt of the RAND Corporation's National Defense Research Institute, he is a leading proponent of an approach to combat called "Battle-Swarm" and "netwar."
Global dangers increasingly lie in paramilitary bands and guerrilla tactics as opposed to conventional, massed armies, the new strategists contend. So, they say, the American military must transform itself into a leaner collection of dispersible "pods" and "clusters," whose mobility and interconnection can better match the mobility and flexibility that are the hallmarks of guerrillas themselves. 
For a modern army, the authors argue, critical elements are the connection of these pods and the ability to "swarm" unexpectedly on targets and call in distant, powerful weapons with precision.
Careful calibration of force and continuous sensitivity to public opinion are also crucial, they add, because winning in combat cannot be separated from "winning the larger story."
In Iraq so far, Mr. Arquilla said, "both sides have been using swarming, though both sides also have traditional elements in play." But he argues that the coalition's early successes -- the rapid movement to save the southern oil fields, the pre-emption of the Iraqi scuds in the west and "the special-forces-led Kurdish swarm in the north" -- were done the "netwar" way.
Likewise, the surprises in Saddam Hussein's campaign were consistent with the principles of netwar, which is less about sophisticated technology than about playing a different game: one not analogous to Western chess, but to the ancient Chinese board game known as Go, in which equal pieces can be placed anywhere on the board.
In Go, the use of massed concentrations is to be avoided, especially in the early phases of a game, because assembling them wastes time and they are vulnerable to attack. Instead of massing his forces as he did in 1991, Saddam Hussein delegated extraordinary authority to area commanders, dispersed loyalists and paramilitaries in the southern cities, and relied on small, shifting guerrilla formations to attack the long supply lines needed by American infantry units rolling north toward Baghdad.
In the debate over new and classic forms of warfare, the traditionalists argue that the Iraqi war so far shows that any so-called revolution in military affairs has fallen short, and they blame its chief champion, Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld. 
"There is a view that the nature of warfare has fundamentally changed, that numbers don't count, that armor and artillery don't count," retired Gen. Barry M.. McCaffrey said recently. "They went into battle with a plan that put a huge air and sea force into action with an unbalanced ground combat force."
Both sides say the war plan was a compromise between innovators and traditionalists. In a commentary in U.S. News and World Report, General McCaffrey praised the special forces missions, but blamed "senior civilian Defense Department officials" for not listening to traditionalists who wanted to send more troops to support the three-division drive on Baghdad.
The showdown in Baghdad, like the war so far, is blending elements of old and new. Last week, for example, even as American tanks gathered at Baghdad's airport, coalition commandos were swarming at one of Saddam Hussein's presidential palaces a few dozen miles outside the city.
"On balance, the Iraqis have shown a better concept of swarming operations than the U.S.," Mr. Arquilla said. But "they are having great trouble carrying it off," he added, because American technology can see even a swarm of 200 Iraqis in a sandstorm, as it did in the war's first days, allowing the forces to call in precision airstrikes. 
At the same time, Mr. Arquilla argued, it is the most traditional elements in the American plan that seem to have caused problems, like the supply-guzzling "march up Mesopotamia" and the intense bombing of Baghdad.
Harlan K. Ullman, the national security expert who coined the term "shock and awe," acknowledges the shortcomings of strategic bombing, but remains a skeptic about netwar. 
"Swarming is a great term, but I think it's a pretty hollow term," he said in an interview. "What does it achieve that other things don't? What is its purpose?" 
What the war proves, Mr. Ullman added, "is that we have an unbelievable firepower advantage over the Iraqis."
To which Mr. Arquilla counters: "Ullman misses the point, which is that the networked approach can achieve, at far lower cost in blood and treasure, the same thing that can be done with the bigger package."
The concept also gives great weight to international consensus, and that has brought Mr. Arquilla, for example, into the significant minority of military experts who wanted to delay this war to give inspections and diplomacy more time.
In an information age, he explained, the right metaphorical choice is not between Mars and Venus, the Roman deities of war and love. It is between Ares, Mars' bloodthirsty counterpart in the Greek Pantheon,and Athena, who had prowess in battle but preferred to settle conflict peacefully. (Mr. Arquilla, with Mr. Ronfeldt, produced a collection of essays by like-minded strategists titled "In the Camp of Athena: Preparing for Conflict in the Information Age," published by RAND in 1997.) History holds dire warnings for those who choose Mars instead, he said, though one has to look back seven centuries, to the Mongol hordes, to find the equivalent of modern American supremacy on the battlefield.
Outnumbered, but seemingly invincible, the Mongols swept across Asia and the Middle East in the 12th century, learning the location of their enemies while staying hidden, using fast horsemen, long-range bows and careful coordination to attack -- and crush -- their opponents.
It was suicide to meet them on the battlefield, so their adversaries fell back to the cities -- and their cities fell, too. "We are so much like the Mongols," Mr. Arquilla said. "No one will fight us in the open."
The Mongols besieged Baghdad, in 1258. Two years later, they were surprised and defeated on another battlefield by a vengeful Muslim army. And churches throughout Europe sang Te Deums in thanksgiving.

Preparing for Post-Hussein, And for Potential Dangers

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: KUWAIT, April 5 

 BODY:
On Friday, members of the American team that intends to govern Iraq after the war were given lessons on what to do in Baghdad if they were taken hostage. In recent days, a small contingent of British soldiers, known as Gurkhas, arrived to enhance the team's security -- both here and in Baghdad. The Americans are scouring the region for armor-plated vans for the diplomats and retired generals to use once they are in Iraq. 
 European and American leaders may still be arguing over whether the United Nations plays a role in postwar Iraq, and, if it does, how large that part should be. But those disputes are considered largely irrelevant by the team here, whose members argue that they are better off unfettered by the United Nations. 
 When President Bush meets Prime Minister Tony Blair in Northern Ireland on Monday, the discussion about the United Nations' role -- which Mr. Blair favors, in part because of pressure at home and in the rest of Europe -- will doubtless resume. Here, it seems settled.
Several hundred Americans -- retired military officers, diplomats, and aid experts -- meet every day under the leadership of a former United States Army general, Jay Garner, to shape the new government. They are joined by a few Iraqi exiles handpicked by the administration, and by a small number of British officials. 
General Garner has declined all requests for interviews, although today he announced plans to hold a news conference on Monday in a Kuwaiti hotel.
But participants in the sessions here report that one basic understanding has emerged: that aid programs should run in conjunction with experienced United Nations agencies, particularly the World Food Program.
In Washington, officials of the United States Agency for International Development have argued strenuously for the United Nations to carry out its traditional role in distributing food, water and medical services.
Without the United Nations, the American effort -- costing hundreds of millions of dollars -- would be "dead in the water," a senior aid official said. This official said this was because the United States relied on nongovernmental organizations -- like CARE or the International Rescue Committee -- to do aid work on the ground. These groups cannot work without the heft of the United Nations aid machinery, chiefly the World Food Program, which delivers food to ports and trucks it around whichever country needs the help.
On the more delicate, but equally important questions, like the future of the oil industry and who will do much of the reconstruction of Iraq's ailing infrastructure, the United Nations is treated as a nonplayer, several members in the planning process said.
As the planning progresses here on how to manage the 23 Iraqi government ministries, the future of the Ministry of Energy, which oversees the oil industry, has not been resolved, officials here said. This is of intense interest to Washington's European allies and to Russia.
At the United Nations there is a preference for keeping the revenues from Iraqi oil in the United Nations escrow account that has been in operation since the end of the first gulf war. The British have proposed a new trust account in which to deposit Iraq's oil money. Washington has not declared a postwar Iraq oil policy yet.
In underplaying a role for the United Nations, a member of the team said that General Garner was also looking to give the United States a freer hand to interpret the obligations of the United States as an occupying power under the Geneva Convention. 
Under the fourth Geneva convention, which deals with the question of an occupation, an occupying power must protect the interests of the civilians under its control. The occupying power does not have the right to make radical changes in existing institutions in ways that could be deemed to harm the people. 
The presence of senior United Nations officials in Iraq could complicate the situation for the Americans, hamstring decision making and "add confusion," an international lawyer who met with the American team said.
General Garner rarely refers to the United Nations in the meetings he is conducting here, participants said. As the Iraqis have put up more resistance than expected, he has expressed a modicum of anxiety about the tenor of his welcome, two officials who have spoken with him in the last week said. But he did not raise the possibility of a United Nations presence as a way of alleviating whatever concerns Iraqis may express toward American, or Anglo-American, administration of their country, they said.
In talks with Kuwaiti officials, who are the strongest Arab ally in the war effort, General Garner has said he wants to hand the government of Iraq back to the Iraqis as soon as possible. In this equation, he has inferred that having a reduced United Nations role would be best. 
"There are many people waiting in the wings to show the war is won, but the peace is not," said Ahmed Bishara, the secretary general of the National Democratic Movement, a liberal political party here, who has met with General Garner. "The United Nations will bring in unending arguments. We say this from experience -- Kuwait dealt with the United States, not the United Nations" after the first gulf war. 
The American team would look to the resources of the United States and Britain to protect itself, not that of the United Nations, officials here said. 
As the war has dragged on longer than expected, and the Iraqis have put up stiffer resistance, the security of the members of the Americans in Baghdad has become a more urgent matter. 
One thing was clear. As the debate swirled about the United Nations role, General Garner was described as anxious to get going, and to make his debut. 
A military man at heart, the general wants to go to Baghdad soon, even if only to the international airport, one of his people said. In this way, his very presence would "create facts on the ground."

HEADLINE: Broad Support For Pataki Is a Casualty Of Budget Fight 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 5 

 BODY:
Five months ago, Gov. George E. Pataki coasted to a third term after a nonpartisan campaign that appealed not just to his Republican base, but to many moderates and liberals as well. He seemed to pull off the rare electoral trick of being all things to all people.
 Today, the governor is assailed from all sides. Union leaders and Democrats who supported him are criticizing him for proposing deep cuts in education aid and health care programs to close a $11.5 billion gap in the state budget. Legislators from his own party are hesitant to make such deep cuts, and even Mr. Pataki's Republican ally in New York City, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, is fighting him over federal security aid. 
 Mr. Pataki is also drawing fire from conservatives who complain that he has not cut spending and reduced debt enough. Some of them say he has taken their support for granted as he championed causes like gay rights and gun control to appeal to Democratic voters. A few have accused him of lacking principles. 
The governor himself maintains that his political stance has been consistent, saying that he has always stood for lower taxes, policies that are tough on crime, welfare programs that foster opportunity rather than dependency, and less intrusive government. What has changed, he says, is the economic situation around him, not his beliefs or priorities.
Still, the politician who had allies across the political spectrum has recently become isolated, political strategists and elected officials from both parties say. His approval ratings, which peaked after the Sept. 11 attack in 2001, have sunk to their lowest point in years, according to at least two public opinion polls conducted by colleges.
Mayor Bloomberg, once one of Mr. Pataki's staunchest supporters, is openly feuding with him over how much federal aid the city deserves for security, as well as the governor's refusal to support a commuter tax to help solve the city's financial crisis. Dennis Rivera, president of the state's largest health care workers' union, who last year was the governor's most powerful ally among labor leaders, led 35,000 protesters to Albany on Tuesday to denounce his proposed cuts to the health care system.
Several other labor leaders who supported Mr. Pataki last year have mounted hard-hitting ad campaigns that accuse him of shielding the wealthy from tax increases while trying to save money at the expense of students and poor people.
Even State Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader, who usually stands with the governor, has made it clear he cannot support all of Mr. Pataki's budget cuts.
Several members of the state delegation to Washington, including a few Republicans, are angry with Mr. Pataki for what they see as the clumsy way he has handled lobbying President Bush and Congress for more aid to help prevent terrorist attacks. Mr. Pataki threw the talks into turmoil by objecting to the aid formula after the House Appropriations Committee had already approved it.
Some prominent conservative thinkers, among them George J. Marlin, who was Mr. Pataki's first Port Authority executive director and is a longtime member of the Conservative Party, and E. J. McMahon, a senior research fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, have publicly taken the governor to task for not reining in spending enough in the late 1990's, when the economy was robust.
"You can look at any issue you want and find people unhappy with him," said one Republican strategist in Albany.
Mr. Pataki's defenders say his predicament illustrates the enormous difference between running for office and governing during hard times. There is almost no way to close such an enormous budget gap without hurting some segment of the body politic, they say. The governorhas made that balancing act even harder by taking what he considers a principled stand against new taxes, his aides said.
"The governor proposed a budget that required some very tough choices and tough decisions," said Mr. Pataki's chief spokeswoman, Lisa Dewald Stoll. "He expected debate. He encouraged debate, and that's what we are seeing now."
His detractors, however, say he hid the size of the looming financial crisis until the ballots were counted and squandered the state's surplus to avert budget cuts in an election year and buy support from unions. Once his third term had begun, however, he reverted to the pro-business, fiscally conservative formula he used when he first became governor in 1995: cut spending, cut taxes, hunker down and wait for an economic rebound.
"It's in times of adversity that people show their colors more," one labor leader said.
Many politicians in both parties speculate that Mr. Pataki has taken a strong stand against taxes to better position himself for national office, but he has denied this.
For most of the last eight years, Mr. Pataki was able to cut taxes and increase spending because of a boom on Wall Street, which kept the state treasury flush with money. He could satisfy both ends of the political spectrum at once, offering tax cuts to please Republicans and handing Democrats record spending increases for education and health care.
Those heady days began to end when the stock market bubble burst in 2000. Then, with the economy already sinking, the attack on Sept. 11, 2001, dealt another blow to the region and saddled the state with extra costs for security.
Mr. Pataki has responded to the current financial crisis with a vow not to raise income taxes or taxes on businesses. He has proposed cutting $1.2 billion in state aid to schools and curbing the growth in Medicaid by more than $1 billion, promising to restore those programs once the economy comes back.
That stand, however, has earned him the enmity of many labor unions that supported him last year after he had provided extra money in the state budget that made pay raises possible in their contract settlements. The United Federation of Teachers in New York City and the state's largest health care workers' union, 1199/S.E.I.U., have spent millions of dollars on ads attacking Mr. Pataki, just months after they spent lavishly to help elect him. The ads warn of layoffs at schools and hospitals if Mr. Pataki's cuts go through.
"We had expected the budget to be bad, but not this bad," said Mr. Rivera, the president of the health care workers' union. "It is fair to say that last year he was more committed to many of these programs than he is perceived to be at this moment."
The governor's stance against raising taxes has been hard on many state legislators from his own party, who must stand for re-election next year and do not want to take the blame if local property taxes increase to cover the loss of state aid.
"We know the result of this budget will be massive property taxes, and we are not going to do that," one aide to Senator Bruno said.
On the other side, Mr. Pataki has alienated many moderate and liberal supporters by choosing to protect businesses and the wealthy from tax increases at the expense of students and people who depend on government programs, political strategists say.
Some of these constituents and their political leaders say they were duped. 
During the election campaign, Mr. Pataki skillfully avoided answering questions about how he would deal with the budget crisis and never said how large the shortfall would be.Only in January did his administration finally acknowledge the size of the problem.
"I certainly think he downplayed the size of the deficit," said Roger Benson, the president of the Public Employees Federation, a civil servants' union, which supported the governor. "He indicated throughout the campaign we had faced deficits before and got through them. After Election Day, it became a lot more painful."
Immediately after Mr. Pataki introduced his budget, his approval rating dropped to 49 percent, the lowest level in seven years, according to one statewide poll by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. Monthly surveys by the Siena Research Institute in Loudonville, N.Y., show a similar downward trend, with Mr. Pataki reaching a nadir of a 47 percent approval rating in early February.
The ideological right wing of New York politics is not happy with him either. Conservatives, both in Congress and in the private sector, say they have been disappointed over the years with the steady rise in New York State's spending, not to mention the governor's support of gun control, abortion rights and gay rights.
"When you burn the candles at both ends, which he has done ideologically, it catches up with you on both sides," said Mr. Marlin, the former Port Authority official.
Still, the chairman of the Conservative Party, Michael R. Long, said most conservatives applaud the governor's stance against raising taxes as a hopeful sign he is returning to his conservative roots. "I would rather believe the cup is half-full rather than half-empty," he said.
In the end, political strategists from both parties say Mr. Pataki's winning coalition last year was always fragile. It held together partly because the Democrats presented a weak challenge that never exposed the extent of the state's budget crisis or tarred Mr. Pataki with it.
"The people he rented last year, he just rented," one prominent Democratic political strategist said. "The coalition couldn't hold together, because there were parts that did not work together."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: BAGHDAD; 
Defiant Iraqis Say U.S. Push Was Thwarted

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, April 5 

 BODY:
Senior Iraqi officials remained defiant today in the face of American military might, asserting that Iraqi soldiers and suicide bombers had "crushed" American troops at Baghdad's international airport and broken the American advance on the capital into isolated pockets that were surrendering to relentless Iraqi attacks.
 On a day when American commanders sent advance units probing within miles of central Baghdad, the official Iraqi response was mocking and triumphalist, much as it has been throughout the 17 days of war. 
 To Westerners here who have kept abreast of the military situation by satellite telephone links to the outside world, the situation appeared to confirm, ever more strongly, that the rigidities of the system built by Saddam Hussein have become a debilitating handicap to Iraq's ability to confront American power. After years of unquestioning fealty, senior Iraqi officials seemed unwilling to provide any interpretation of military events that might prejudice Mr. Hussein's claim to be the embodiment of Iraq's invincibility. 
Nothing seemed to demonstrate this more clearly than the events that shook the capital this morning. Not long after dawn, Iraqis venturing into southwestern Baghdad toward the international airport returned to the east side of the Tigris River to report having seen American tanks a few miles from the palaces and ministries in the city center that have been the most visible symbols of Mr. Hussein's dominance. They began speaking as if the day might end with the government's collapse and the Stars and Stripes flying over the capital.
That this response was not peculiar to Iraqis favoring Mr. Hussein's fall was apparent from the sudden frantic stirrings in the streets around the Palestine Hotel, quarters for the foreign journalists sequestered by the government on the Tigris's eastern bank. Cars driven by loyalists of the governing Baath Party began touring the neighborhood with loudspeakers proclaiming Mr. Hussein's glories and Iraqis' resolve to fight Americans to the death.
Simultaneously, a cavalcade of police cars, sirens wailing, set out on a demonstration of their own, as if to remind any waverers that Mr. Hussein remained the decisive force in the neighborhood.
By sunset, the excitement had subsided. It became clear that the probing advances by the American forces had been, mostly, just that -- thrusts into the city, as an American military spokesman at the Central Command headquarters in Qatar said, intended to shake Iraqi confidence without yet making a challenge for outright control.
The thrusts, Maj. Gen. Victor Renuart said, according to a Reuters report, were intended to "demonstrate to the Iraqi leadership that they do not have control in the way they continue to say on their television."
But if this was the American strategy, it was far removed from the Iraqi construction of the day's realities. Information Minister Muhammad Said al-Sahhaf made his regular daily foray to the Palestine Hotel to put things into perspective, Iraqi style. His main point was that the American capture of the airport on Friday had been reversed by an Iraqi counterattack using regular units and "a very innovative way of war" involving suicide bombers.
General Renuart, in Qatar, said today that the Americans remained in firm control of the airport and that they would continue moving into Baghdad as and when they chose. 
But Mr. Sahhaf said, essentially, that the Americans were in the world of make-believe.
"We have defeated them, in fact we have crushed them in the place of Saddam International Airport," he said. "We have pushed them outside the whole area of the airport."
To drive home this claim of American desperation, he added this account of the battle: "They have done everything crazy, everything crazy, in order to lessen the pressure we have put on their troops."
The Iraqi strategy, Mr. Sahhaf said, was to drive the Americans back to pockets of resistance outside Baghdad. One place mentioned was Abu Ghraib, west of the capital, notorious as the site of the grimmest prison in Mr. Hussein's gulag.
Travelers reaching Baghdad in recent days described American troops with tanks at checkpoints on the expressway that passes Abu Ghraib on the way to Jordan. But Mr. Sahhaf said that the American units there, and at two other locations he named as Hadithi and Qadisiya, were surrounded by Iraqi troops.
"We nailed them down," he said. 
These expressions of bravado appeared to have been reinforced by film shown on television on Friday and again today of a man identified as Mr. Hussein visiting neighborhoods in western Baghdad and being greeted with jubilation by ordinary citizens. Iraqis who saw the broadcast said they had no doubt that the man was indeed Mr. Hussein, not a double.
While questions lingered, including when the video was made, the effect on Mr. Hussein's most zealous loyalists was beyond doubt. At the Palestine Hotel, the mood among Iraqi officials brightened.
For two weeks, they had pointed to the nightly television broadcasts of Mr. Hussein meeting senior officials as proof that he was still in command. But perhaps they, like officials in Washington, had begun to doubt whether these scenes were new or recycled from the past.
Now, with the Iraqi leader's appearance on the streets, they seemed to rediscover the confidence shaken when the war began on March 20 with a cruise missile strike aimed at a meeting in Baghdad of senior officials who, the Pentagon said, might have included Mr. Hussein.
Oddly, the political flourish involved in the Iraqi leader's televised walkabout was followed today by a reversion to one of the expedients that had led American intelligence analysts -- and many Iraqis -- to conclude that Mr. Hussein might have been killed or incapacitated by the missile strike. This afternoon, Mr. Sahhaf was back on television reading a message from Mr. Hussein, without any explanation as to why the leader could not have delivered the message himself.
The message made no reference to the Americanseizure of the airport or the Iraqi counterattack that followed, curious perhaps given that most television viewers -- a small minority, because Baghdad has been without electricity for 48 hours -- must have known of the fighting on the city's southern rim.
Mr. Hussein's statement was economical in his references to the fighting, saying only that the "invaders" were concentrating on Baghdad but weakening elsewhere.
"The criminals will be humiliated," he said.
Later, scenes of Mr. Hussein presiding over a gathering of top aides were broadcast, but it was unclear when or where the meeting took place.
Twice today, the Information Ministry took reporters on a tour of the city's western districts where the American thrusts had been reported around dawn. The Iraqis seemed particularly keen to show that the district of Yarmouk, about five miles from the airport, remained under Iraqi control. Reporters who saw the Yarmouk hospital this afternoon reported no sign of American troops, or of any battle in the area.
But there were other signs that something had happened in the area, and that the Iraqis were not eager for it to be known. An American photographer who reached the hospital this morning described large numbers of Iraqi casualties arriving on stretchers. When the busload of reporters arrived hours later, they were told the visit to the hospital was canceled, without explanation.
What the bus tours did show was that defenses in the city center had been strengthened. Today, tanks and artillery were positioned beside tall buildings or in parks. Soldiers could be seen digging bunkers.
Just about everywhere, families were busy loading up cars with possessions, mostly food and clothing. But the question on almost every Iraqi's lips when meeting Westerners was the one that nobody could answer: How long before the Americans push into the city to stay? How long before this war will be over?
