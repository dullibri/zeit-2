HEADLINE: Art and Money

 BODY:
The arts are headed for trouble. Public funding is shrinking as legislators cut programs for ideological or budgetary reasons. Private funding, which some hope will fill the gap, is also tightening as foundations and individuals struggle to meet expanding needs in an uncertain economy.
The potential for harm is dismaying. The marriage of public and private funds has sustained a remarkable diversity of organizations and made the arts an important, accessible part of American life. You do not have to live in a great urban center or travel hundreds of miles to see a great dance company or a great painting anymore. In the 30 years since the National Endowment for the Arts was established, for instance, the number of professional orchestras in this country has increased from 110 to 230, dance companies from 37 to 450 and opera companies from 27 to 120. 
 According to a new Rockefeller Foundation report, "Looking Ahead, Private Sector Giving to the Arts and the Humanities," public-private financial support for the arts is diminishing just when Americans are showing a powerful enthusiasm for them. Total private giving to the arts (from individuals, corporations and foundations) was $9.57 billion in 1993 and $9.68 billion in 1994. Adjust the figures for inflation and the result is actually a 2 percent drop in giving. That drop is almost certain to continue, given the increased competition for private support from various social and community groups suffering government cutbacks.
The slackening of support for the arts may have economic as well as cultural consequences. Many states and localities have discovered that the arts are considerably more than enliveners of the human spirit. They also generate tourist dollars.
If the N.E.A.'s commitment to decentralizing the arts was not wholly responsible for the cultural buttering of America, it was certainly a catalyst. But the N.E.A.'s funding has already been cut and is scheduled to take a bigger hit -- 39 percent -- next year.
Foundations, the report warns, are in no position to take up the slack. Many have even shifted some money that once would have gone to the arts to human services. Furthermore, there has been a decline in the willingness of Americans to support charitable giving in general, and arts giving in particular. The same percentage of households continues to contribute but on a much smaller scale -- a shift paralleled by the increase in the percentage of people worried about their own economic futures. Corporate giving, which had sunk steadily since 1987, is slowly rising, but not to its 1980's levels.
Money for new projects and new artists and an ability to leverage private funding are not all that the N.E.A. has contributed to the cultural scene. Its size has allowed for long-range planning and innovation. It constitutes, in effect, a national knowledge bank on the arts and arts organizations.
The recently formed Center for Arts and Culture, established by a dozen or so foundations -- Rockefeller among them -- to study the state of cultural policy in the United States, can help fill the gap, at least as an educator and disseminator of information. But it cannot possibly replace a Federal agency's reach and scope. Cities and regions that recognize the potential revenues in cultural tourism will have to provide more of their own funding. Struggling arts organizations everywhere will have no choice but to scratch harder for support.

HEADLINE: MARKET TIMING

 BODY:

Tuesday
The Federal Open Market Committee meets to discuss the state of the economy and to determine monetary policy for the next six weeks. There is no clear consensus among economists and Fed watchers as to whether interest rates will be cut, despite a slew of data indicating that the economy has slowed.
 
The Commerce Department reports final numbers for gross domestic product in the third quarter. Growth of about 4.4 percent is expected.
 
The Commerce Department reports on November housing starts. After declines in September and October, an increase of less than 1 percent is expected.
 
The Senate is expected to approve a $275 billion military spending bill that President Clinton has said he will veto because of the costly anti-missile defense system it includes. The bill, which includes $7 billion more than the President sought for the military, was approved by the House on Friday -- but not by the two-thirds majority that would be needed to override a veto.
 
The Bank of Mexico will offer short-term Treasury notes with terms of 28, 90, and 182 days, with a total value of 2.7 billion pesos, about $347 million.
 
The Johnson Redbook research service will issue its weekly survey of sales at department, discount and chain stores. All the indications are that it has not been a happy holiday season for most retailers.
 
Wednesday
 
Shareholders of the Union Electric Company of St. Louis are expected to approve a $1.2 billion merger offer from Cipsco.
 
The Commerce Department reports on merchandise trade for October. A deficit of $8.7 billion is expected, with import growth likely to be stronger than export growth. The monthly deficit was $8.4 billion in both September and October.
 
The Energy Department issues its weekly report on petroleum stocks, production, imports and refinery use, while the American Gas Association releases its weekly report on natural gas inventory.
 
Thursday
 
The Treasury Department releases its November budget statement. A deficit of $29.2 billion is expected, up sharply from $22.8 billion in October.
 
The Commerce Department reports on personal income and spending in October. Income is expected to rise one-tenth of 1 percent.
 
Friday
 
The University of Michigan releases its monthly report on consumer sentiment. In October, the index of consumer confidence dropped to 88.2 from 90.2, which was lower than expected.

 BODY:

THE NETWORKS
 
An Active Week for NBC
Persuading the International Olympic Committee to abandon competitive bidding, NBC agreed to pay $2.3 billion for the broadcast and cable rights to the 2004 and 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2006 Winter Olympics, even though where those games will be held -- and significantly for broadcasters, in what time zone -- has not been decided. The committee went along with NBC's pre-emptive strike in return for the promise of a cut of the advertising revenues if they exceed certain levels. NBC had previously won the rights to the Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, in 2000 and the Winter Games in Salt Lake City in 2002.
Then, gaining what could be an enormous advantage over ABC, which has announced plans for an all-news cable channel, NBC said Microsoft would pay $220 million for a 50 percent interest in NBC's America's Talking cable channel and help convert it to an all-news operation. The big question is whether the audience for all-news programming is big enough to sustain a rival to CNN. The companies will also cooperate in providing news to computer users through an on-line service.
 
DEVELOPMENT
 
E.P.A. Veto Power at Risk
Buried deep in a spending bill now before Congress is a provision that would strip the Environmental Protection Agency of a major tool for protecting the wetlands: its veto over permits that the Army Corps of Engineers issues for wetlands development projects. One interesting footnote: Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri and the author of the provision, said he had "no idea" what projects might be affected by the change.
 
BANKING
 
Addition, Then Subtraction
The Bank of Boston said it would pay $2 billion for Baybanks, the leading consumer bank in New England, in a deal that would create the 15th-largest bank in the country. The banks said they would close 85 of their combined 400 branches and eliminate 2,000 of their 24,500 jobs.
 
TRADE
 
Renewed Concerns on China
While standing by its policy of not linking trade relations with human rights, the White House made clear that China's increasingly belligerent positions on both fronts had made it politically impossible to support Beijing's admission to the World Trade Organization.
 
MANAGEMENT
 
Arrivederci, Agnelli
After 30 years as head of Fiat, Italy's largest employer, Giovanni Agnelli said he would step down soon as chairman and be succeeded by the managing director, Cesare Romiti. That will allow more time to season Giovanni Alberto Agnelli, 31, the eventual replacement for his uncle. Fiat, an acronym for Fabbrica Italiana di Automobili Torino, was founded in 1899 by the grandfather of the retiring chairman.
 
AIR SAFETY
 
Cockpit Time, Sack Time
Asserting that pilot fatigue contributes to crashes, the F.A.A. proposed limiting pilots to a 14-hour shift followed by 10 hours of rest, down from the current 16-hour shift and an 8- or 9-hour break. The Airline Transport Association, an industry group, objects to the proposals. The agency also put into force rules for commuter aircraft that are intended to make them as safe as larger airliners.
 
COSMETICS
 
A Makeover for Maybelline
L'Oreal, based in France and the world's largest cosmetics company, agreed to buy Maybelline, broadening its line and its reach in the United States. Maybelline's strength is modestly priced products sold in discount and drug stores, L'Oreal's Cosmair unit makes Lancome, Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Armani and other prestige lines.
 
RETAILING
 
Does Staff Morale Affect Sales?
Sales staff at 15 Macy's stores, most in the New York suburbs, have been told they will receive a sales commission of 3.96 percent, a steep cut from the 6 percent they have received until now. Unionized employees at the flagship store in Herald Square and three others are not affected by the cut, which Macy's executives said was but another attempt to reduce operating costs.

GRAPHIC: Photo: LABOR -- Back to Work at Boeing -- Approving a contract that gave them much of what they sought, machinists to work after a 69-day strike at Boeing, the world's largest aircraft maker. Under pressure from airlines whose orders for planes were in jeopardy, Boeing retreated from its demands, including one that workers pay more for health care insurance. The company also agreed to retrain and retain any worker whose job was eliminated because of subcontracting to nonunion plants in the United States or cheaper foreign manufacturers. On their first day back at work, Irv Sensel, above left, and Matt Bauermeister, work on an engine on a 777 jetliner. (Associated Press)

THE MEXICAN SHOCK
Its Meaning for the United States.
By Jorge G. Castaneda.
254 pp. New York: The New Press. $23.
MEXICO'S violent awakening from the first-world dreams it entertained during the presidency of Carlos Salinas de Gortari has been a boon to the country's publishers. The struggle to explain what happened -- the peasant uprising, the political assassinations, the anticlimactic election and the economic collapse -- has become a melee of memoirs, exposes and campaign year kiss-and-tells. Book parties in Mexico City are often no parties at all, but political events attended by hundreds of people and by great debate about who did what to whom. 
 Jorge G. Castaneda, a political scientist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and a longtime critic of the Salinas Government, is among the first to produce a book-length study of the country's recent turmoil for readers in English. The effort already seems overdue. A new relationship with the United States was central to the bright future that Mr. Salinas promised; the image of a new Mexico that he appeared to embody helped win approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement in Washington. The Clinton Administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill shared the shock when Mr. Salinas's chosen successor, Ernesto Zedillo, botched a long-postponed devaluation of the peso and needed commitments of almost $50 billion in foreign loans to save the economy from collapse.
As Mr. Castaneda sees it, the Americans had it coming. Politicians, scholars, businessmen and the media all fell blindly in love with Mr. Salinas and his band of young, English-speaking technocrats, he asserts; thrilled with the Salinastas' faith in free markets and free trade, most of the gringos chose to ignore the undemocratic politics and unequal distribution of wealth that went along with them. "No one, it seems, was willing to analyze the overwhelming evidence of abuses and financial mismanagement in Mexico since 1988," Mr. Castaneda writes in "The Mexican Shock." "Those surprised by the economic collapse and the stench of it all had simply neglected to open their eyes."
The steadiness of Mr. Castaneda's own skepticism cannot be faulted. When others praised the renegotiation of Mexico's huge foreign debt in 1990, he warned that the terms could condemn the country to indentured servitude. While most Mexicans welcomed the trade accord, he saw another raw deal: uncompetitive Mexican industries left to perish, wrongheaded American immigration policies left intact. Mr. Castaneda, who sometimes advised leaders of the country's main leftist political party, states proudly that his lens is one of "systematic, virtually across-the-board criticism of the Salinas administration's program and the authoritarian political system upon which it rested."
His indictment is handed up in a series of essays written since mid-1993 for audiences ranging from Inter-American Dialogue to The Atlantic Monthly's. The concerns of this somewhat disparate compilation have to do with the shortcomings of Mexico's economic model, the breakdown of the political system and the dangers looming for the United States should it fail to grasp Mexico's predicament. If there is a central argument, it is perhaps that a successful transformation of the heavily protected and state-dominated economy was impossible without deeper political change. Mr. Castaneda contends that the failure of a flawed economic strategy was predictable, even inevitable so long as the Government's authoritarian controls allowed it to ignore pressures for moderation, from a slower opening to foreign trade to adjusting the exchange rate.
Mr. Castaneda's complaints about the refusal of the Salinas Government to adopt some sort of industrial policy and build domestic savings sound even more valid now, as the Zedillo administration gropes for a way to absorb the growing millions of unemployed. Some analysts will quarrel with his dismissal of the possibility that Mr. Salinas might have succeeded in his gamble to balance huge deficits in Mexico's trade and debt accounts with foreign investment, but the case is at least clearly argued. Readers will probably have more trouble sorting out what Mr. Castaneda means to say about Mexican politics. At one point, he explains the violence that racked the country in 1993 and 1994 as a national equivalent of what French psychoanalysts call "the return of the repressed" -- "indirect results, consequences indecipherable in their precise mechanism, of a problem left unresolved or buried in the national unconscious." Farther on, he attributes the killings of a Roman Catholic cardinal and two governing-party leaders to the partial dismantling of the patronage system that traditionally resolved disputes within the ruling elite. The problem with this idea is not simply that it is still rather speculative -- Government investigations have yet to show any clear tie between the various crimes and continuing struggles within the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party -- but that makes it harder to understand the party's resilience now.
MR. CASTANEDA wonders whether the current chaotic state of affairs might not in fact represent a kind of status quo. But while that notion represents a noteworthy break from the prevailing faith among Mexican intellectuals that the PRI, as the governing party is called, will disintegrate any day now, readers unschooled in Mexican politics may be hard pressed to understand from the preceding discussion how Mr. Zedillo ever got elected and why he hasn't been overthrown. Mr. Castaneda emphasizes the fears of an opposition victory that the Government worked hard to build, particularly among the poor. Still, his triumphal focus on the evils of the Salinas regime tends to obscure other sources of the country's difficulties: the weakness of demands for political change among ordinary Mexicans, the failure of opposition leaders to articulate convincing alternatives, the remarkable (if largely superficial) adaptation of traditional ruling-party bosses to changing rules of the game.
Admirers of Mr. Castaneda's 1993 study of the political left in Latin America, "Utopia Unarmed," may wish that he had sat down and written a whole book about Mexico's moment, instead of patching one together from earlier writings. The sort of profile sketches that made "Utopia Unarmed" more readable are missed here: Mexican political figures drop into the narrative like strange guests and then quickly disappear, while others are mentioned but never identified, and the same statistics and ideas are sometimes marshaled more than once in slightly different form. An essay written in mid-1993 makes clear what political consequences Mr. Castaneda foresaw for the free trade agreement before it passed, but it does not make for an irresistible read now. Throughout "The Mexican Shock," Mr. Castaneda makes a strong case for Americans' need to understand his country better. This time, however, he contributes less to that cause than he might.

FRESH BLOOD
The New American Immigrants.
By Sanford J. Ungar.

AMERICAN DREAMING
Immigrant Life on the Margins.
By Sarah J. Mahler.
Illustrated. 268 pp. Princeton, N.J.:
Princeton University Press.
Cloth, $49.50. Paper, $15.95.
SANFORD J. UNGAR and Sarah J. Mahler recount the human tales that are ignored when Americans, and their politicians, turn their anger against immigrants. If we appreciated the difficulties recent arrivals face, both authors maintain, we would be less likely to blame them for problems of our own making. 
In "Fresh Blood," Mr. Ungar, the dean of the School of Communications at American University, talks to immigrants everywhere, but he concentrates on such relatively unknown groups as the Laotian Hmong in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area; the Mashadi Jews of Iran, now living in Queens; Washington's Ethiopians and Eritreans; and "second wave" Poles and Irish migrating to already well-established ethnic neighborhoods in Chicago and Boston. Through his eyes we experience the conflicts felt by nearly all immigrants between group loyalty and the seductions of assimilation, the benefits of having karate lessons or Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in one's native language, and the tensions within ethnic categories that most Americans view as homogeneous.
"Fresh Blood" humanizes the people it depicts. Christopher Thao, one of 11 children of illiterate Hmong parents, came alone from Laos to Jasper, Ark., at the age of 18 and is now a lawyer in a major St. Paul firm. Sophia Kim, who is married to an Ethiopian, is proud that her children "may be the only Korean-Ethiopians in the United States." But Mr. Ungar's fine book is not simply a collection of success stories. He favors expansive welcoming policies but is unsure whether they demand an appreciation of "adaptation gone awry," or a recognition that "immigrants help renew, enrich and rediscover the values of America." As if in acknowledgment of the complexities of the matter, his policy proposals are modest, his opinions muted.
In this he is worlds apart from Ms. Mahler, an anthropologist at the University of Vermont who, in "American Dreaming," focuses on illegal immigrants on Long Island. Her subjects -- poor Salvadorans and primarily middle-class South Americans from Peru, Chile and Colombia -- have fascinating stories to tell. At home there was little but horror: a nun speaks of her rape and subsequent pregnancy, other people of being caught between left-wing guerrillas and right-wing terrorists, and most tell of a subsistence existence unimaginable to the majority of Americans. The passage from that world to this one is filled with anxiety: near-starvation on the journey through Mexico, possible betrayal from the "coyotes" who act as brokers of human freedom, the uncertainties of the border crossing itself. Once the immigrants are here, their jobs pay well compared to those at home, but the cost of living is unexpectedly higher. For Ms. Mahler, the life of illegals is filled with "deceit, dejection, marginalization and exploitation."
Ms. Mahler's narrative skills bring these people to life, which makes it a shame that her didactic intrusions and overweening political opinions squeeze the life right back out of them. Juanita is overcharged by fellow Hispanics for housing, but, Ms. Mahler laments, "she never mentions the structural causes of the crisis." Some people proudly manifest their success by wearing gold chains and fancy clothing, but, Ms. Mahler editorializes, "more substantial success remains elusive." The Salvadorans and Ms. Mahler speak different languages: she wants them to talk about injustice, discrimination and alienation, they want to talk about their accomplishments, their disdain for African-Americans and their in-group bickerings. They drive cars; she complains about the costs of automobile insurance and the design of the Long Island Expressway.
Both authors believe that to like immigration it helps to like immigrants. But this is just as fallacious as the notion, common on the right, that to dislike immigration one must dislike immigrants. Most immigrants are just trying to get by. Personalizing their stories, as important as that may be, runs risks in the debate over immigration that neither author fully appreciates.
For one thing, the personal experiences of the immigrants themselves are not the crucial factor in judging the morality of immigration policy. Even if life on the margins in the United States is as awful as Ms. Mahler maintains, most would still choose it if it offered the possibility of a better life for their children.
In addition, tales of woe raise the inevitable question, which personal stories can never answer, of whether there exists a means of comparing suffering. Yes, immigrants find life difficult in America. But so do native-born Americans. Mr. Ungar dutifully records stories about immigrant children having racial epithets thrown in their faces, while Ms. Mahler explains the many ways in which illegal immigrants can be paid too little or charged too much. Yet surely some perspective is required before the moral books are closed. The obvious reason these authors lack perspective is that Mr. Ungar, and to a much greater degree Ms. Mahler, want Americans to feel guilty for the way they treat the immigrants in their midst. But one can also feel proud to belong to a country that offers immigrants a chance.
FINALLY, personalized accounts of immigration are of little help for policy makers. Since we can never open our borders to everyone, we have to make distinctions among different categories of claimants, all of whom have some justice on their side. The most important one we make is between political and economic refugees. Mr. Ungar is uncomfortable with that distinction, while Ms. Mahler snorts with contempt over its absurdity. Indeed it can be blunt. Yet something much like it is essential if we are to preserve a humanitarian immigration policy. Sometimes justice to those we do not yet know requires harshness to those in front of our faces. And that remains true even if we hear their stories and come to know them as people.
The most illustrative story in either book is told by Rafael Ramirez, a Peruvian described by Ms. Mahler. His journey to the United States was oppressive, his employment in this country sporadic. His family remained behind. Injured at work one day, he was awarded $40,000 and returned home to Callao. "I spent the first month drinking beers with everyone I knew," he told Ms. Mahler. "But I got bored. I had bought a house and furniture for it and everything, but I knew that I could no longer stay. So my wife and I decided to come back to the United States and we snuck over the border." Figure out the rights and wrongs in that one, and you may have an answer to the immigration question the rest of us lack.

THE SAME AND NOT THE SAME
By Roald Hoffmann.
Illustrated. 294 pp. New York:
Columbia University Press.
$29.95.
TO savor the beauty of objects far too small to see or feel or taste requires a special sense -- one that develops in people who have a deep understanding of chemistry and its wondrous transformations. Most of us cannot share this sense, and we may consider the delight chemists claim to take in the contemplation of molecular beauty a mere affectation. 
 We are wrong, though, to scorn the chemist's vision of beauty; chemistry may seem smelly, violent and dangerous, but to its practitioners a molecule may really be a thing of beauty -- a beauty inaccessible to outsiders, cut off as we are by barriers between the languages of science and ordinary discourse.
Most of the high priests of chemistry eventually give up trying to explain to others what they do and why they relish their work. Arguably, chemistry is the most difficult of all the fundamental sciences, and to translate its quasi-mathematical nouns and verbs into spoken language is beyond the ability of most scientists. Even the ingenious metaphors writers invent to describe chemical processes -- devices the physicist Leon Lederman calls "tap-dancing" -- generally fall far short of expressing the reality of chemistry, much less its underlying beauty.
But Roald Hoffmann of Cornell University is a poet as well as a winner of the 1981 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, and he has never given up his lifelong campaign to illuminate the beauties of chemistry for the unenlightened. His latest book, "The Same and Not the Same," consists of roughly equal parts art and science, and its relaxed style, uncomplicated explanations and clever illustrations could qualify it as a primer for chemistry haters.
Despite his passionate love of the science, Mr. Hoffmann is no defender of the chemical industry or of suggestions that important policy issues involving science should be decided by scientists. It is perfectly proper, he believes, for ordinary people to favor words like "natural" and "organic" over "chemical" and "synthetic," even though the popular meanings of these words differ wildly from the chemist's understanding of them. Chemistry, like everything else, should be an element of democratic society, accessible to all and under the control of ordinary people, he says. And he contends that the tragedy of thalidomide -- which resulted in the birth of thousands of deformed infants -- could have been avoided by more effective social supervision of the chemical industry.
At the same time, Mr. Hoffmann is acutely aware that many people fear and dislike chemistry. He even seems to feel a certain isolation imposed by his calling. A Jewish survivor of the Holocaust whose father died in a Nazi concentration camp, Mr. Hoffmann writes:
"Chemists encounter frustratingly conflicting signals from society -- economic dependence and reward, coupled with an attitude from the media and some intellectuals that is abusive. I wonder if there are some parallels to the attitudes toward Jewish moneylenders in Europe in the Middle Ages."
Mr. Hoffmann cites the story of Fritz Haber, one of the greatest synthesis chemists of the 20th century, as illustration of the ambiguities inherent in the popular image of chemistry. Haber, an ardent German nationalist, was one of the inventors of a cheap and efficient process for making ammonia out of hydrogen and nitrogen. The process was ready when Germany went to war in 1914, providing not only fertilizer ("making bread out of air," as German propagandists called it) but munitions. In 1918 Haber was awarded the Nobel Prize for his synthesis of ammonia.
Haber also gave Germany one of the most horrible of weapons: poison gas. The German high command first put Haber's gases to work at Ypres in 1915, beginning the scourge that killed or maimed many thousands. But when the Nazis came to power in 1933, Haber, a Jew, was forced out of his university job and into exile in Switzerland, where he died an embittered man.
While Mr. Hoffmann's breezy style makes the synthesis of ammonia by the Haber process easily understood, he also offers a few samples of chemistry at its most impenetrable. Even with his great skill, he is occasionally reduced to hand-waving in place of real explanations of, say, the electronic orbitals that bind atoms together into molecules.
But a central theme of "The Same and Not the Same" is easily grasped: chemistry is strongly influenced by yin-yang symmetries and complementarities. It is a science of contrasts. For example, many molecules exist as pairs of mirror-image forms, each containing exactly the same atoms as the other but each differing radically from the other in its properties. The "left-handed" versions of some molecules may cure disease, while their "right-handed" mirror images may be deadly; they may differ as greatly from each other as did Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
The final chapter sums up by alluding to the author's mythological hero, Cheiron the centaur. Cheiron, Mr. Hoffmann tells us, was "man and beast, not whole human, not wild beast. Stationary and fleet, a tenser, complex yet integrated being. Capable of harm, seeking for the good. Like chemistry."

WHERE THE SUCKERS MOON: The Life and Death of an Advertising Campaign
By Randall Rothenberg. Vintage, $14.
 The account was Subaru (stodgy), the agency was Wieden & Kennedy (young and hip), and the author, a former advertising columnist for The New York Times, had good reason to be skeptical of the union. This is the story of how the marriage unraveled, and it is "a delicious, subtly subversive fly-on-the-wall exploration," Joseph Nocera said here last year.
 
WHAT REMAINS AND OTHER STORIES
By Christa Wolf. Translated by Heike Schwarzbauer and Rick Takvorian. University of Chicago, $14.95. 
 Once an ardent East German Communist, the author grew to criticize her Government while also being its ostensible ally. These pieces of fiction articulate her uncomfortable position in narratives that are frequently autobiographical, evoking her feelings at the fall of Berlin to the Allies in 1945 and at being watched by her country's secret police as a mature woman. In 1993 our reviewer, Peter Demetz, wrote, "They provide an illuminating chance to enter Ms. Wolf's changing world . . . and to come closer to a consciousness increasingly pained by the creeping loss of what utopia had promised so easily." The University of Chicago has also reissued THE AUTHOR'S DIMENSION: Selected Essays, edited by Alexander Stephan, translated by Jan Van Heurck ($14.95), a collection that spans more than 25 years, in which Ms. Wolf reflects on subjects from the art of reading to the art of governing. Her "few speeches and essays after the fall of the Berlin wall are astonishingly accurate . . . in them, she has ceased to play ideological poker," Mr. Demetz said in the same review. The work of another contemporary German writer, this one from the West, is gathered in THE SELECTED STORIES OF SIEGFRIED LENZ, edited and translated by Breon Mitchell (Hydra Books/Northwestern University, $15.95). Also quietly critical of history, Mr. Lenz writes fiction that examines life during World War II and Germany's later "economic miracle." In 1989 Mr. Demetz wrote in these pages that the author's "voice has remained as sober, steady and sympathisch as ever."
 
WISHING ON THE MOON: The Life and Times of Billie Holiday
By Donald Clarke. Penguin, $13.95.
 This biography examines the often harsh circumstances that led to Billie Holiday's dual addictions to heroin and abusive men; it also lauds the singer's fine musicianship. The author "has written what may be the most thorough and valuable of the many books on Holiday," Francis Davis wrote here in 1994. The legacy of another jazz artist is explored in ASCENSION: John Coltrane and His Quest, by Eric Nisenson (Da Capo, $13.95), which combines the saxophonist's life story with a guide to his recordings. Last year our reviewer, David Royko, said the author brings "to life Coltrane's inner world by viewing music of today through the prism of his accomplishments." Da Capo has also reissued LISTEN TO THE BLUES, by Bruce Cook ($13.95), a study of a musical form many find hard to define. Published with a new introduction and discography, it offers insights "both valuable and fascinating," Frank Conroy wrote in the Book Review in 1974.
 
THE WAY TO THE CATS
By Yehoshua Kenaz. Translated by Dalya Bilu.
Steerforth Press, $14.
 This Israeli novel presents old age with all its ravages. Yolanda Moscowitz, 76, is recuperating from a broken leg in a rehabilitation center in Tel Aviv, where she hopes that her dignity won't go the way of her beauty. "Mr. Kenaz captures in sharp close-up the disjunction between one's self-image and the grim actuality," Lore Dickstein said in these pages last year.
 
IMPERIUM
By Ryszard Kapuscinski. Translated by Klara
Glowczewska. Vintage International, $13.
 These essays form a highly personal account of the functioning and ultimate decline of the Soviet Union as seen by a Polish correspondent who until recently was the state's subject as much as its chronicler. Because the author "is such a keen observer, there are treasures in this book," our reviewer, Bill Keller, wrote in 1994. There is more about what it means to be Central European in A YEAR OF THE HUNTER, by Czeslaw Milosz, translated by Madeline G. Levine (Noonday/Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $12). This Nobel laureate's journal of 1987-88 examines his identity as a poet and as a Pole. "It seems on first reading indigestible only because so many alternative 'digests' can be made of its chastening wisdom," Donald Davie said here last year.
 
FACE OF AN ANGEL
By Denise Chavez. Warner, $11.99.
 The narrator, Sovieda Dosamantes, is a Chicano woman growing up in a rural New Mexican town, where she ultimately weathers trials ranging from waitressing to widowhood. Last year our reviewer, Robert Houston, said the author "is at her best . . . working her way through one of her tour de force comic scenes." PARADISE, by Elena Castedo (Grove, $13), also features a feisty heroine coming of age in an inhospitable New World. Solita, a refugee from Franco's Spain, finds herself at a Latin American hacienda, which her mother says will be paradise, but which proves quite the opposite. "Ms. Castedo's language is exuberant," Lyll Becerra de Jenkins said here in 1990.
 
THE PRESIDENT'S DAUGHTER
By Barbara Chase-Riboud. Ballantine, $12.
 The author of "Sally Hemings" has written another novel about the consequences of Thomas Jefferson's purported love affair with a slave. Here, Harriet Hemings, the child of that union, finds freedom in Philadelphia, where she passes for white. "With intelligence and immediacy, 'The President's Daughter' illuminates the brutal politics of slavery," Kiki Olson wrote in the Book Review last year. LAUREL GRAEBER

HEADLINE: TAMING THE BULLIES OF BOSNIA

BYLINE: By Roger Cohen; Roger Cohen covered the Balkan wars for The Times for the past two years. His most recent article for the Magazine was about the Zecevic family of Sarajevo.

 BODY:
THE HELICOPTER LANDS near the summit of Mount Igman, just outside Sarajevo. It's a cool morning with low clouds, the rain has just stopped and the city, encircled by the Serbs as it has been for more than three years, lies spread-eagled beneath the Americans. It is Aug. 19, and Richard Holbrooke is on the first of his Balkan shuttles, which will lead, some months hence, to Dayton, Ohio, and an agreement that will end -- temporarily, at least -- the brutal war in Bosnia. This day he leads a team that includes Robert C. Frasure of the State Department, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Joseph Kruzel, Col. S. Nelson Drew of the National Security Council and Lieut. Gen. Wesley K. Clark of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
These senior officials find themselves atop a waterlogged Bosnian mountain about to descend a twisting dirt track into the besieged capital because, the previous day, Holbrooke failed to obtain security guarantees from the Serbs for a flight into Sarajevo. He had demanded the guarantees from Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian President, saying it was "demeaning and dangerous" for his team to take the Igman road. 
 Milosevic spoke with Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Commander of the Bosnian Serbs and the orchestrator of the long Sarajevo siege. No deal. "Well, Mr. President, can you give us your assurances?" Holbrooke asked Milosevic. Not without Mladic. The usual Serbian run-around.
It had been this way for more than three months. Milosevic blaming Mladic or Radovan Karadzic, the political leader of the Bosnian Serbs. Karadzic blaming rogue paramilitary forces beyond his control or the inventions of Muslim propaganda. Americans and Europeans gazing into this hall of mirrors, trying to make sense of it, blaming each other for failing to do so.
Meanwhile the facts were plain. This August day of 1995, with the shells still falling on Sarajevo, roads other than the Igman track are unusable, and the Serbs have just completed the eviction and mass execution of Muslims from the United Nations "safe area" of Srebrenica. The Srebrenica operation is a rerun of what happened on a much wider scale in 1992, the first year of the war, when about three-quarters of a million Muslims were chased at gunpoint from their homes and herded into camps.
The presence of Holbrooke's team on a remote Bosnian mountain is thus the expression of a terrible failure -- that of the Clinton Administration, NATO and the United Nations to end the siege of Sarajevo or do anything but bow to the whim of the Serbs. This impotence exasperated Frasure, a seasoned State Department official who, on returning from an inter-agency meeting on Bosnia, remarked, "Boy, that was like a little-league locker-room rally."
Bosnian diplomacy, Frasure explained to his State Department colleague and friend Christopher Hill, was like white-water rafting: "You've got to decide which waterfall you're going to go off." Instead, the Administration kept trying to straddle the chutes. The result was a series of debacles, like the May bombing of the Serbs, aborted as soon as 400 United Nations hostages were seized. Frasure believed that perhaps the only way to end the Bosnian impasse was to bomb the bridges over the Drina River, which link Serbia with Serb-held Bosnia.
Holbrooke says now that he agreed with Frasure. But during the year he had spent in Washington as Assistant Secretary of State for Europe -- after returning in summer 1994 from his first Clinton Administration post as Ambassador to Germany -- he had failed to make a difference on Bosnia. Increasingly frustrated by the Washington bureaucracy, he had dispatched Frasure to the area and adopted a despairing mantra: Bosnia was "the greatest collective failure of the West since the 1930's." When the Serbs seized the United Nations hostages on May 29, 1995, the day Holbrooke wed the author Kati Marton in Budapest, the Assistant Secretary's exasperation finally exploded: "Give the Serbs 48 hours, and if they don't release the hostages, bomb them to hell." But, Holbrooke concedes, "everyone back in Washington thought I was joking."
Washington tended to see Holbrooke that way, or worse. His year there had been an unhappy one. "He was a very frustrated functionary in an enormous bureaucracy, being driven increasingly crazy by the generic underminers, the envious, ferretlike Washington subspecies," his wife says.
He had been brought back to head the regional bureau for Europe because 1993 had been a disastrous year for the Clinton Administration in Europe. "We needed a much higher profile on Europe and Bosnia," says Thomas Donilon, chief of staff to Secretary of State Warren Christopher. "We had not realized that in the post-cold-war era we had to consolidate the base, not take it for granted. That base was NATO. We didn't give it enough attention."
For Donilon, higher profile meant "Hurricane Holbrooke." But Anthony Lake, the national security adviser whose now-uneasy relationship with Holbrooke goes back more than 30 years, had doubts. Officials say Lake had come to view the man who was once his closest friend as a "high maintenance" personality, gifted but disruptive. Lake says his question was merely whether Holbrooke would find satisfaction in being an assistant secretary -- a rank he held almost two decades before.
There was a line on Holbrooke in Washington. Domineering. Imagines he's a seventh-floor official when he's only sixth floor. Too undisciplined to follow instructions. There was anger at his high-handedness, unease at his bald ambition. Such was the wariness that, at the National Security Council, thought was given to using Charles E. Redman, the former Balkan envoy, who replaced Holbrooke as Ambassador to Germany, to promote the peace plan that would be put forward in August. By then, Holbrooke, feeling underused and boxed in, was spreading the word that he was ready to quit and return to Wall Street. But Donilon and others prevailed upon him to stay, and Christopher convinced a skeptical N.S.C. that Holbrooke could be entrusted with so delicate a mission.
So at last in August, Holbrooke puts himself on the front line. He is a brave man. Unlike other Administration officials, he has been around the conflict. He took a careening car ride into Sarajevo in December 1992 and spent New Year's Eve there. Just for the hell of it. "I went because I didn't have a date," he says, laughing. He is also a man driven to be a central protagonist in the shaping of the American empire. In Vietnam in the 1960's, in the Philippines of Ferdinand Marcos in the 1970's, on Wall Street in the heady 1980's and most decisively in the Balkan wars, he has been involved in the exercise and projection of American power. Now, on Mount Igman, he is trying to settle Europe's worst conflict since World War II.

A Transforming Moment
 
GENERAL CLARK PUTS HOLbrooke beside him in a Humvee because "I knew that way Dick would be able to see more and he's always very curious." The others get inside a French armored personnel carrier, more secure against Serbian gunfire but bulkier. The delegation starts down the track, the Humvee leading the way. Then a French truck coming up the mountain blocks the vehicle. The truck driver jumps out and tells Clark an armored personnel carrier has gone over the edge.
Holbrooke and Clark dash back up the hill about 100 yards and look down. "It seemed like a giant lawn mower had gone down the mountain, scything the trees," Clark says. "We heard an explosion." The two men run back down the road, which is exposed to Serbian fire, around a hairpin. Holbrooke, fearing an ambush, orders his Humvee turned around. He has not heard the intermittent crack of small-arms fire since Vietnam.
Lieut. Col. Daniel Gerstein was inside the ill-fated armored personnel carrier. "On the first roll, I thought it would be one roll and stop," he says. "We went over so slowly. Kruzel landed on top of me and said, 'What's going on?' Then I realized it was rolling. We were airborne. At one point, I felt four revolutions without touching the ground. I felt the bones around my eyes break. I tried to go with the roll, not against it. There was an awful cracking and groaning. A terrible noise."
Clark, scrambling over fallen trees and branches, reaches the vehicle at last. It is on its side, the wheels are burning. Gerstein, a mortally injured Kruzel and a security officer named Peter Hargraves have managed to get out. French soldiers are gesticulating, warning Clark not to go near the vehicle because it will explode.
He radios Holbrooke on the road above, asking for a fire extinguisher. Then the General takes a log and pries open the hatch. He peers into the fire, caused by oil and fuel on hot pipes as the vehicle rotated and by exploding anti-tank rounds. The scene reminds him of a gas boiler in a power plant: a round metallic interior and roaring flames. Frasure and Drew are utterly gone. Kruzel dies later on the way to a field hospital.
Holbrooke says that when he heard of Frasure's death: "It just hit me. I yelled, 'No, no, not possible.' " But he remained calm. Strobe Talbott, the Deputy Secretary of State, took one of the first conference calls from Holbrooke, with President Clinton also on the line. "We were all listening very carefully for any hint whatsoever of something that would have been totally understandable," Talbott recalls. "But he was in control, shattered but totally in control. I remember him saying to the President, 'Mr. President, we must suspend the mission long enough to bring our fallen comrades home.' Dick was making the right judgments."
At an early age, on his return from a three-year stint as a foreign service officer in Vietnam, working for Robert Komer in the Johnson White House and then for the Deputy Secretary of State, Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, Holbrooke watched the best and the brightest falling apart under the pressures of Vietnam and America's deepening fracture. "The pressure was excruciating -- I saw people fall back on Scotch before lunch," he recalls. The experience is clearly a point of reference; his commitment on Mount Igman to comrades fallen on the field of battle is an echo of Vietnam and the dignity hard won there.
Something shifted, in Holbrooke -- who had been inclined to throw up his hands on Bosnia -- and in America. A war long clouded by complexity was now reduced to physical fact in the weight of the coffins against Holbrooke's and Clark's knees on the chopper rising above the ruins of Sarajevo. Moreover, the obfuscation and the loss of the three men were linked. It was repeated weakness, prolonged preoccupation with avoiding failure and pusillanimous policy that put these senior officials on a road they should never have been on.
"What has impelled Holbrooke in part has been the memory of Frasure," says Ron Nitesky, the former deputy chief of mission in Zagreb. "He knows Frasure was much too good a man to die putting the best possible twist on a bad policy." Marton saw a man "suddenly driven and propelled by a larger force. He felt terrible over the deaths, and at some level responsible, and the only way to redeem this was for these people in the Balkans to come to terms and end the war."

 Peace, Justice and the Pursuit of Glory
 
IN MAY 1968, HOLBROOKE WAS trying to end another war. He came to Paris as a young member of the delegation led by W. Averell Harriman to embark on the first negotiations with the Vietcong. But where he was then trying to help extract an increasingly lacerated America from its most disastrous cold war failure, he now finds himself in a vastly different role. At 54, he has become a principal architect of the nation's most ambitious, and chancy, overseas military engagement since the Vietnam War.
The dispatch of 20,000 American troops as part of a NATO force to police the tenuous Bosnian peace is a mission that may well decide the fate of the Clinton Administration. At a time when isolationist temptations are strong, it is also likely to define the scope of America's global ambitions in the post-cold-war era. Holbrooke, who is more at home with the American military than many in the Clinton Administration, seems comfortable with the odds. He rejects what he calls the "Vietmalia syndrome" -- the compounded fears born of Vietnam and the aborted peacekeeping mission in Somalia.
"I've had my disagreements with the Joint Chiefs," he says. "I think they have had the wrong fear. At the beginning, on Bosnia, from what I've heard, the Administration could not take on the Chiefs because of the President's Vietnam record and the gays-in-the-military question. But the fact is, the thing the Pentagon should be seeking is success, not avoiding failure."
What constitutes success to Holbrooke, a man who now looks well placed to become Secretary of State if Clinton is re-elected? Is he moved by the notion of asserting American values around the globe, values that attracted his Jewish parents to the United States from Nazi Europe? Or is the thing that excites him the flexing of American muscle to advance the nation's strategic and commercial interests?
Or, as his many detractors say, do notions of public service, the kicks of Realpolitik and promoting democracy enter into it only marginally, if at all, because everything is essentially grist for the mill of Holbrooke's consuming quest for greater glory? And if hubris and Holbrooke are indeed inseparable, as many contend, then isn't the Bosnia accord itself flawed, and treacherously so?
"It's nothing but self there, all self," says Patricia Derian, who clashed repeatedly with Holbrooke when she was Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights during the Carter Administration. "He sets his mind on getting something and then just has a fit if he doesn't get his way. His arms flail, he yells, he shouts, he leans forward. As you go along, having one sort of encounter after another with that personality, you see that the main motor is how he is going to appear and be seen. The rest is marginal and infinitely malleable."
 Lake, who served in Vietnam with Holbrooke, sees a rather different person. Their close friendship has eroded over the years, but a bond of sorts remains. When they met in London on Aug. 14, as Holbrooke was about to set out on the feverish four-month Balkan shuttle, Lake says he allowed himself "a moment of sentimentality."
The sentiment was about dreams. The dreams, he says, were those the two men shared when they went together to Vietnam in 1963 -- youthful visions of settling conflicts, changing things, even making the world a better place. Ideals of action and public service. The allusion, obviously, would have had scant resonance with a pure narcissist, a man unmoved by the destiny of peoples or by old-fashioned patriotism. Lake says, "What Holbrooke wants attention for is what he's doing, not what he is -- that's a very serious quality, and it's his saving grace."
Holbrooke had long sought to lead a major international negotiation. An unremitting thirst to make a historical mark characterized him from an early age. His father had such high ambitions for him that as a bright teen-ager he was told to aim for the Nobel Prize in Physics. When, at 16, his father died, he gravitated toward the family of Dean Rusk, the former Secretary of State, whose son David was his closest high-school friend in Scarsdale, N.Y.
Rusk came to embody the ideals of patriotism and public service that led Holbrooke into the foreign service after college at Brown, and now make up one element in his personality. Onto this was grafted an unusual appetite.
At one meal he counts the number of clams on his plate, complains that his grilled "super-rare" tuna is smaller than his neighbor's and ends up eating everyone else's dessert. The food is vacuumed down with impressive speed between two prolonged sorties to chat with a colleague he has spotted at another table. When it comes to the wine, he nonchalantly tosses ice cubes into a very respectable chardonnay and downs a glass as if it were his preferred Diet Pepsi.
His appetite goes beyond the table. It is a force of nature. It gulps down movies, often two in an evening. It mops up books. It zaps restlessly from channel to channel. It has propelled him through two marriages and now into a third. It gives him, says Marton, who was previously married to the ABC anchor Peter Jennings, "this great, wonderful physicality, this very tactile big-bear quality."
It leads him to carry on two or even three telephone conversations at once. It causes him to size up people in extremely short order. It endears him to children, whose language he readily grasps. It impels him to acts of generosity. It is, at times, transparently insatiable about publicity, driving him to such stunningly guileless acts of attempted self-aggrandizement as suggesting to journalists how to write their leads. It guides him through labyrinthine, sometimes maddeningly meandering sentences interspersed with phrases like, "Just let me finish this" or "I'm really serious" or, ominously, when he is most entangled between the truth and the spin he wants to impart, "I just want to be sure there's no misunderstanding." In general with Holbrooke, the more long-winded he is, the more manipulative he is trying to be.
The appetite fills rooms and disrupts meetings. It is, in short, a devouring zest for life that sweeps over people, embracing them in its intrusive warmth or crushing them in its roughshod power, complicating his life and sometimes putting his Ruskian ideal of service and self-effacement grotesquely at odds with the baroque reality of being Richard Holbrooke.
Arriving in Zagreb in October, on the last of his five Balkan shuttles, he is greeted by Peter Galbraith, the American Ambassador. Galbraith's taste for the limelight has grated on Holbrooke. He was appalled when, in the glare of television cameras, Galbraith tried to join him and General Clark in the cortege as the coffins arrived at Split airport from Sarajevo after the Igman accident. He nudged the Ambassador out of the way.
The tension between the two men is thinly masked. Later in the evening, after a meal at the Ambassador's residence, which Holbrooke has enjoyed in bare feet, talk turns to Galbraith's former job on the House Foreign Relations Committee. Holbrooke's comment: "It's not really adult work." Then, not so gently, he rubs it in: "Of course, somebody as aggressive and forceful as you, Peter, can perhaps make something of it."
But the energy and the impatience with form are also constructive, imbued, as they often are, with an intellectual audacity, a courage and sheer historical range that seems increasingly rare in Washington. "He lives in three time zones all the time," says his friend Leslie Gelb, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations. "Past, present and future. They are all there in his speech in a very conscious way because he wants to make his life consequential. He has never wanted to leave the stage until he has done something of real consequence."
That goal had eluded him until the Bosnian peace settlement. He had been, at age 34, head of Far Eastern Affairs and a Wunderkind of the Carter Administration. But then his star seemed to fall. When the Republicans took office in 1980 he went to New York, made a lot of money as a rainmaking investment banker at Lehman Brothers, dated the television journalist Diane Sawyer and cut a figure around town. But a big country place in Connecticut and a condo in the Rockies were no substitute for a life of consequence. His ambitions lay in becoming a statesman.
In Washington, however, that ambition made people wonder: could he be trusted? And could a personality of such explosive impatience work in a bureaucracy?
Patricia Derian is among those who have concluded that Holbrooke's relation to truth-telling is fragile, eternally vulnerable to what she calls "the willingness to do anything to keep up the pace." She recalls Holbrooke, in his days as Assistant Secretary for Far Eastern Affairs, returning from a visit to the Philippines in 1977, where he was lavishly entertained by President Marcos and his wife, Imelda, on the presidential yacht.
"It was extraordinary," she says, "Holbrooke is a real sycophant to people like Marcos, but he started regaling me with these stories about how sickening the party had been, how vulgar the Marcoses were, how imperious she was, how disgusting they were. He was really so scornful I had a little pang of pity for Marcos! But, you know, it was almost as if they were two different people, the Holbrooke on the yacht and the man talking to me. It must be a difficult lifetime role to play, but maybe not, maybe it's a twin, an evil twin."
The root of the differences between Derian and Holbrooke lies in a battle over the relative place of human rights and broader American interests in the conduct of foreign policy -- an issue that haunted Holbrooke in his extensive dealings with Slobodan Milosevic.
She believed that the sweeping human rights abuses of the dictatorial Marcos regime should head the Administration's Philippine agenda. Holbrooke saw other priorities. In particular, he focused on the renewal of an agreement for two important American military bases, Subic and Clark, in the Philippines. This renewal, which had eluded others, was secured under his watch in 1979.
"Derian thought human rights should be our entire foreign policy," Holbrooke says. "She's naive. She sent an unclassified message to Vance saying we should use all our leverage to remove Marcos. I said that's not the way to conduct policy. She simply does not understand the American national interest."
In December 1980, Derian and Holbrooke clashed again over a plan to invite the Philippine opposition leader, Benigno Aquino, to speak at the State Department. Aquino, who was assassinated by a Marcos agent in 1983, had been released in 1980 after a long imprisonment, an achievement, Holbrooke insists, that illustrates his striving to balance human rights and the national interest. But when Holbrooke heard of the invitation to Aquino, he was furious.
Lake, then the head of State's Office of Policy Planning, weighed in on Holbrooke's side. He sent a memo to Derian arguing that Aquino's appearance at the State Department was not in America's interest. Lake, who was angry, then visited Derian. Holbrooke followed, "arms akimbo, just a raving, furious man, telling me that it was bad for the country," Derian says. In the end, the Aquino meeting was relegated to a back room.
Holbrooke now argues that he has always tried to tread a middle path between moralism in foreign policy and a Kissingerian focus on raison d'etat, defined in purely strategic and economic terms.
"There's been a long tension in America between a value-based Wilsonian foreign policy and the Realpolitik of a Kissinger," he says. "The fact is, America is one of the few countries whose inhabitants came here in pursuit of an idea, and that ideal is part of our values at home and abroad. Often we have not lived up to these ideas, but they are our values.
"I am not a Wilsonian. I think he was naive. I think he was a failure. Those thick red lines he drew at Versailles around imagined ethnic boundaries made a significant contribution to what is going on in the Balkans today. But I also believe Realpolitik for America is self-defeating in its cynicism. We cannot choose between the two -- we have to blend the two."
The fact is, however, that it is the mature man who seems to have found the blend, or at least become convinced of its central importance. The evidence is compelling that 15 years ago American military bases and the seductive companionship of the Marcoses held sway over an impressionable Holbrooke.

 An 'Infuriating Childishness'

DAVID HOLBROOKE, WHO WORKS for the "Today" show and is the older of Holbrooke's two sons by his first marriage, was once waiting for his father on a ski slope in Telluride, Colo. The elder Holbrooke came down the mountain toward him, then abruptly veered off toward a bump, "got a lot of air and came down in the biggest heap of skis and poles and hats and gloves that you have ever seen."
Baffled, David made his way over to his splayed father. "I didn't know what the hell he was thinking," David says. "He said, 'I saw you waiting below and I just thought I would impress you.' "
For many years Holbrooke's many friends had the intermittent impression that his pronounced sense of theater and his need to impress might leave him in a heap. His manifold talents seemed matched by equally manifold flaws. Above all, his rapid insights into others seemed unmatched by any real self-knowledge.
Holbrooke had always been torn between the desire to be a protagonist and to be an observer. He wanted to write the story, but more than that, he wanted to be its subject. He recalls watching his journalistic heroes -- Rick Smith, Stanley Karnow -- standing in the rain outside the American Embassy in Paris in 1968 and feeding them some line about the Ho Chi Minh trail being renamed "The Highway of Aggression." They reported it. "My God," he says with his slightly crazed giggle, "it just hit me then. That's what I wanted to do for a living -- stand in the rain and report nonsense!"
Holbrooke's mother, whose Jewish family fled Hamburg in 1933 for Buenos Aires before coming to New York, took him to Quaker meetings on Sundays. "I was an atheist, his father was an atheist," says his mother, a potter now married to a sculptor. "We never thought of giving Richard a Jewish upbringing. The Quaker meetings seemed interesting."
Holbrooke's father, a brilliant doctor born of Russian Jewish parents in Warsaw, died of cancer. There is a faded black-and-white photograph of the gangly teen-ager holding his father's hand in the Scarsdale woods that seems to capture a closeness abruptly shattered. His father changed his name to Holbrooke when he arrived in the United States in the 1930's. Such, however, is the family's loss of contact with its roots that his original name is unknown.
"He was my father," Holbrooke says, when asked how the abrupt death affected him. "He was my father. What can I say? I leave the psychoanalysis to others."
His marriage to Marton, however, has led him to look more closely at his past. She was born into a family of Hungarian Jews but raised to believe she was a Roman Catholic. Only in researching a book did she learn that one of her maternal grandparents had died in Auschwitz. This shared experience is clearly important to them. She and Holbrooke are not religious, but there appears to be some nascent sense of Jewish identity, or at least sensibility, that binds them. They visited Budapest's main synagogue together. She talks of "just melting into each other as we watched 'Schindler's List.' "
Fritz Stern, a professor of history at Columbia University, is an old friend of Holbrooke's. "I think you have to see there was a deliberate mystification of the child," he says. "He grew up believing one thing -- he was another. And now, at times he has this endearing and infuriating childishness. It's interesting."
His mother, Trudy Kearl, says: "I never imagined that Dick might think about his roots. Oh, my God, I never thought of that. I do not believe in the roots business. But perhaps, he is on a sentimental journey. And why not?"
Holbrooke notes that his maternal grandfather, Samuel Moos, a German Jew, fought for the Germans during World War I. When, in 1993, Holbrooke became Ambassador to Germany after failing to get the job he wanted as Deputy Secretary of State, he placed a photograph in his Bonn office of his grandfather wearing the Prussian spiked helmet and an Iron Cross.
"People would ask me, why that picture?" Holbrooke says, his blue eyes twinkling with apparent amusement behind his Calvin Klein glasses. "I would say, it is simply a historical truth. My grandfather fought for the Kaiser against the Western Allies and later fled Germany. It is an event so complex you could weave a novel around it. If I was a novelist, which I would have loved to be, I would make that photograph a centerpiece. I used to tell the Germans, 'If it had not been for your history, perhaps I would be Germany's Ambassador to the United States today.' "
But Holbrooke is not the German envoy to Washington or a novelist. He is a Jew intrigued by the incongruity of his grandfather's wearing the military uniform of the state that would herd Jews into gas chambers. He says he knew exactly who he was. "I never made any bones about it. I knew what my background was. Those who thought I was not Jewish enough were having their own problems."
There were such people. Perhaps the issue was not really Holbrooke's Jewishness. It was his apparent willingness, at times, to bend the truth to suit his purposes and rush forward headlong with an unexamined life. Thus, the now-notorious 50th birthday party at the "21" Club in Manhattan, where the names Holbrooke constantly dropped all showed up to roast him. "The story that Holbrooke is only half Jewish," Gelb said at the party, "is only half true." Such gibes were all well meant. They also cut close to the bone.

 An Eye on Milosevic, and History

SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC, WHOSE VIRulent nationalism unleashed the wars of Yugoslavia's destruction, is a very seductive man. Warren Zimmerman, the last American Ambassador to Yugoslavia, maintains that he deceives everyone once. He is a deal maker, like Holbrooke, quick, sometimes funny and extremely hospitable. He does not have Marcos's yacht, but he does have a couple of hunting lodges where he likes to entertain visiting dignitaries. Frasure, who spent many hours with the Serbian President, was plied with so much food that he once cabled Washington with the message, "The lambs of Serbia will be delighted that I'm leaving!"
When Holbrooke and Milosevic first met in mid-August, a rapport was quickly established. Frasure, just a couple of days before his death, described the relationship to the chief European envoy, Carl Bildt: "The two egos danced all night."
Holbrooke, perhaps more than anyone in the Administration, knew exactly with whom he was dealing. He had been in Banja Luka in August 1992, where he witnessed "an insane asylum, with all these half-drunk Serb paramilitaries and middle-aged men going and raping and killing young Muslim women." Later he was given a wooden carving from a Muslim survivor of a Serbian concentration camp. The pose, head bowed in abject humiliation, captures the Serbian terror of the war's first months, carried out largely by paramilitary forces equipped and financed by Milosevic. Holbrooke wrote about it for this Magazine and put the sculpture in his Washington office.
Asked if he thought of the carving when dealing with Milosevic, Holbrooke becomes defensive; when he's defensive, he does not answer questions. "The sculpture's sitting there. I point it out to people," he says. When the question is pursued, he says: "No, it's not that linear. I don't sit there looking at one of those guys and thinking of this piece of wood. You wouldn't, either. But I understand the connection. I'm sure we all do."
Holbrooke does care. There can be little doubt about it. He saw what happened to Bosnia's Muslims. But it was also clear to him that Milosevic was the key to closing down the war because he was the person who wanted most badly for it to end, so that trade sanctions against Serbia would be lifted.
This realization became overwhelming on Aug. 29 in Belgrade. NATO had embarked on its first serious bombing of the Serbs, following an Aug. 28 mortar attack on the Sarajevo market. Holbrooke had hesitated about going to Serbia in these circumstances, but he says he recalled Nixon's bombing of Hanoi on the eve of the SALT II signing in 1972. Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet President, signed anyway.
Milosevic does not even mention the bombing. He produces a piece of paper that becomes known as the "Patriarch document" because it is endorsed by the Serbian Orthodox Patriarch. In it, Karadzic and Mladic cede authority to Milosevic to negotiate on their behalf. The Serbian hall of mirrors -- the same one that put Holbrooke's team on Mount Igman just 11 days earlier -- had finally been shattered. A serious negotiation had become possible.
Referring to Frasure, who has just been buried in Washington, Holbrooke turns to Christopher Hill, his State Department colleague, and says, "Boy, I wish Bob were here with us now to see this."
The relationship with Milosevic develops. It is, says Roberts Owen, the lawyer on Holbrooke's team, "uniformly good, candid, direct and easygoing." Milosevic, says Bildt, is so obsessed with America, "he even loves American coffee." The Serbian President astounds the American delegation repeatedly by saying, "I want to smell New York again, the wonderful smells!"
Milosevic has the bluntness of the city that he so admires: details in the talks are "mere technology." American obscenities litter his conversation and are uttered, Owen recalls, "with a lovely distinctive roll to them." The gulf between the sides, Milosevic explains, "is wider than those that Evel Knievel used to jump."
Holbrooke clearly enjoys all this. The two men go on long walks in the woods. They laugh a lot. Holbrooke, almost certainly, has half an eye on history: here he is again in the heart of the action. The old inebriation, as in Manila.
But the more mature man also has a much surer eye on the target and seizes on the leverage provided by Milosevic's evident obsession with American culture: if he wants readmission to the West, the Serbian leader has to change his ways.
Discussions on human rights, and on the continuing atrocities of Serbian paramilitary leaders, become increasingly frequent. Holbrooke pushes for the removal of Karadzic and Mladic. He insists that the killing of civilians has to stop. It is a condition for peace and sanctions relief, he tells Milosevic.
When, just six days after Milosevic presents the "Patriarch document," the question arises of whether NATO bombing of the Bosnian Serbs should resume after a three-day pause, Holbrooke does not hesitate: "History would never forgive us if we stop now."
His judgment proves sound, as it has throughout the past months. The bombing, as Frasure long predicted, balances the situation on the ground for the first time and so makes peace a possibility.

Closing on His Prey

POWER WAS THE KEY. THE Balkans are a snake pit, and good intentions are worse than useless. Holbrooke understood this. He was ready and willing to be the biggest snake of all. It is doubtful that anyone else in the Administration could have bullied the parties to a close. Holbrooke knows about closing. When he sniffs it, he is like a wolf closing on his prey. The peace, in a real sense, is his.
He began by giving what amounted to a green light to the Croatian attack on Serb-occupied Krajina in late July. Others in the Administration were hesitant. "He took a risk on that," says one senior official. "He acted independently, but whatever hunch he had proved right." For the first time in the war, the Serbs suffered a humiliating defeat. Moreover, it became clear that Milosevic was no longer ready to help the Serbs outside Serbia. At the price of creating about 200,000 Serb refugees, a road to peace was opened.
Holbrooke's last note from Frasure was written on Aug. 18, at a lunch with Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian President, in Zagreb. There was pressure in Washington to stop the Croats from moving forward against the Serbs in southwestern Bosnia. The note, slipped to Holbrooke at the table, reads: "This is no time to get squeamish. This is the first time the Serb wave has been reversed. That is essential for us to get stability. So we can negotiate and get out."
After Frasure's death, Holbrooke remembered the message. He vigorously supported the NATO bombing of the Serbs in late August and September. In its shadow, the Croats and the Muslim-led Bosnian Army advanced. Serb-controlled land in Bosnia was reduced from 70 percent to 49 percent, the share envisaged in an international peace plan.
When, at a meeting outside Belgrade on Sept. 14, General Mladic, who had compared NATO to Hitler, went into a customary tirade, Holbrooke cut him short. "Look," he shouted, "either we can negotiate an agreement on the removal of your guns around Sarajevo or we can all go home. There's nothing more to say." Mladic was silenced. He negotiated.
"There is no question in my mind," Owen says, "that we bombed the Serbs to the bargaining table." It took 42 months.
Holbrooke was equally tough with Bosnia's President, Alija Izetbegovic, and his chronically divided Government. When Izetbegovic hesitated over a Bosnian cease-fire in mid-September, Holbrooke warned him that NATO would not be his air force. He invented intelligence estimates suggesting that the Serbs would counterattack. When Izetbegovic's hand trembled hesitantly over the cease-fire accord on Oct. 5, Holbrooke said, "Here, I'll sign it." He did so, with a theatrical flourish, and the Bosnian President reluctantly followed suit.
Most critically, on Sept. 19 in Zagreb, he bullied Izetbegovic and Tudjman into abandoning an offensive that was closing in on Banja Luka, the main Serb-held town in Bosnia. "The light was red, red, red," Holbrooke says. Although he knew what the Serbs had done in Banja Luka, where Muslims were made to wear white arm bands like the yellow star with which the Jews were branded in Nazi Germany, he claims never to have had a moral qualm about this decision. There might have been another quarter of a million Serb refugees pouring into Serbia; Milosevic may have fallen, or he may have intervened.
Either way, it is clear that the "peace process" would have been derailed. For the Administration this would have been a disaster. The morality of not attacking Banja Luka seems much less clear. Holbrooke's pressure amounted to an act of consummate Realpolitik, of a man weighing America's overriding interest in Balkan stability. That stability, he effectively argued, lay more in a de facto division of Bosnia between a Serb republic and a Muslim-Croat federation, with a weak central government over them, than in the pursuit of an unpredictable offensive.
Throughout the exhausting shuttling he maintained a remarkable morale among his team. Part of this stemmed from the shared determination that Frasure, Drew and Kruzel should not have died in vain. But Holbrooke's informality and humor were also important.
Boarding a plane in Zagreb on one of the shuttles, Rosemarie Pauli-Gikas, Holbrooke's personal assistant, hands him a blond Barbie doll. "Here," she says, "you've been away from home for a long time." Removing a shoe with one hand, eating a bunch of grapes with another, Holbrooke replies, "No thanks, I've given up on blondes." The banter is almost constant.
When, on Sept. 23, Hill and Owen were heading home from an exhausting negotiation in Belgrade and landed at Shannon airport to refuel, they got a call from the pilots, who said the plane was being held "by order of the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense."
Hill turned to Owen and said: "That can only be one person -- Dick Holbrooke. Nobody else would avail himself of both those titles."
A hitch had emerged and Holbrooke, in New York, ordered the two men back to Sarajevo. When they reached Ancona, Italy, at 6 in the morning, en route to the Bosnian capital, a dog-tired Hill called his boss. "Look," Holbrooke said, "we're all being inconvenienced by this. I'm up late and you're in Ancona."
"Yeah," Hill shot back. "You're up late and I'm in Ancona."
The demands from Holbrooke were outrageous. But his team clearly believed in him. Indeed, they understood: without his outrageousness, without his swagger, America could not have imposed its peace.

At Dayton, Threats and Theatrics

HOLBROOKE BROUGHT THE three widows and six fatherless children of his fallen colleagues to Dayton, where the final tumultuous lap of the marathon negotiation was held. The women, particularly Mrs. Drew, cried a lot. Frasure's younger daughter was silent. Meetings with the Balkan leaders were sometimes awkward. Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian Prime Minister, said that he was overwhelmed. Marton replied, "If you promise them peace, that would be the best memorial."
To the last, Holbrooke pushed and cajoled, shouted and maneuvered. The French, kept on the margins because Holbrooke knew the Balkan leaders wanted to negotiate through the Americans, came away denouncing him as a "schizophrenic, brutal Mazarin," referring to the French statesman who, along with Richelieu, was the father of raison d'etat.
When Milosevic objected to one plan for Sarajevo, Holbrooke took the piece of paper, tore it up in front of the Serbian President's eyes and said, "Tell us what you want." When Milosevic insisted on plying him with brandy in midmorning, Holbrooke drank. When somebody then objected that Milosevic had got Holbrooke "drunk on plum brandy," Holbrooke obediently laughed when Milosevic replied: "No, I did not get him drunk on plum brandy. I got him drunk on pear brandy."
Confronted by an unyielding Izetbegovic, Holbrooke took Silajdzic for caviar at L'Auberge, the best restaurant in Dayton, and talked to the younger man about the economic opportunities for a Bosnia at peace. He let the Bosnians know that this was America's last big push for a settlement: it would not be repeated and the Bosnians would be largely on their own.
A lifetime's experience of negotiation obviously helped Holbrooke. He studied physics at Brown and insists that you have to start with facts. The strategy of isolating the wavering Bosnian Government by first settling the last differences between Serbs and Croats was lucid. But Robert S. McNamara, the former Secretary of Defense, cured Holbrooke of coolly dissecting problems. Watching McNamara's "ruthlessness in suppressing the emotional, the irrational or the dynamic" convinced Holbrooke that such an approach can lead to tragic error. People are what count, not numbers.
Indeed, his rapport with Milosevic paid off. The Serbian President gave away Sarajevo and provided a land corridor to the eastern enclave of Gorazde. But at the last, when he realized that Holbrooke was giving the Serbs 45 percent of Bosnia instead of the promised 49 percent, Milosevic pointed an accusing finger and said with cold rage, "I trusted you and you tried to cheat me."
A desperate scramble ensued over the last two days of the three-week conference to find more land for the Serbs. With a prod from Clinton, the Croats eventually obliged. But still the Bosnians hesitated, confronted at last with the cold fact that the suggested peace meant dividing the country with no certainty that it would ever be reunited in anything but name. Holbrooke's frustration built to the breaking point. On the last night he screamed at Silajdzic, "You're going to throw this all away for a couple of mountain ridges."
In the end, however, American power, in the person of Holbrooke, and American persistence, in the person of Warren Christopher, carried the day. A fragile peace was reached. For all its imperfections, it is a settlement that the majority of people in Bosnia will welcome. American troops will go to Bosnia. "What will happen then," Holbrooke says with disarming frankness, "we do not know."
It is a far from uplifting peace, one that presents half of Bosnia to the Serb leadership that created the "insane asylum" that Holbrooke witnessed in Banja Luka in 1992. Almost 21 percent of the country is in Croat hands. Aggression has worked. Nevertheless, Holbrooke insists that it is not partition and that it is the best that could be secured. "The world community," he says, "was never ready to use all-out military force to destroy the Bosnian Serbs, although many, myself included, thought that appropriate. So then you have to negotiate. What was done in the end was done with the acquiescence of the Sarajevo government."
Holbrooke says he believes that with real American leadership NATO might be able to leave Bosnia in about a year as "a single country under a democratically elected leadership in which Serbs and the federation are ready to live together." But one year seems an absurdly short time to heal a country so devastated. The alternative, he concedes, is as possible as it is bleak: "A country that divides despite our best efforts -- partition and Serbian anschluss."
Testifying at a Senate Armed Services Committee meeting on Dec. 6, Holbrooke scrawled a note to William Perry, the Secretary of Defense. "If we succeed in Bosnia," he wrote, with the "if" underlined, "history may well record that the month of November-December 1995 was a seminal period in the forging of a new American post-cold-war policy in Europe (Dayton, Russia, France, NATO)."
He was referring to a number of concurrent developments: America's rediscovered leadership over Bosnia; the agreement to work with Russian forces there; France's return to the military wing of NATO and its acceptance of America's central role in European security, and NATO's new mission as crisis manager and peacekeeper in a turbulent Europe. These are indeed big shifts, the kind Holbrooke, with his steady eye on the history books, has always wanted to shape.
Ever since Paris in 1968 he had wanted to test himself in the toughest of negotiations. "This is what I always wanted to do," Holbrooke says. "And thank God, it has worked out so far. I do feel different."
Holbrooke, in other words, has found consequence, in his work, and apparently also in his marriage. He says he will quit before the summer and return to New York to "do some writing" and spend more time with the extended family he is building with Marton, his two children and her two teen-agers. Beyond that he declines to speculate. His wife says he feels vindicated at last against those who tried to push him aside. Talbott says simply that he is "in pig heaven."
As for Lake, the eternal professional rival, he says he would have felt envious of Holbrooke if this had happened two decades ago. And now? "If Holbrooke wins the Nobel Prize," the national security adviser says with his impish smile, "I'll write his acceptance speech."

HEADLINE: Welfare, End of

 BODY:
The following interactive encyclopedia entry looks back from the year 2015. References to events before December 1995 are real; subsequent developments may become so all too quickly.
 SUMMARY. For 60 years, until 1995, the United States Government ran a social program technically called Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and commonly known as welfare. The program, which provided cash grants to indigent families, was abolished as part of a bipartisan deal that reduced Federal spending and transferred power to state governments. At the time of its demise, welfare was a thoroughly discredited program -- often accused of causing long-term poverty rather than helping people survive it. 
 A handful of critics accurately predicted that ending welfare would bring rising numbers of "street families," just as the closing of mental hospitals had produced "street people" in the 1970's and 80's. But most welfare abolitionists argued that the poor would be better off without the program. They would have been astonished to learn that today, in 2015, the program they reviled as "welfare" is often described nostalgically as the last thread of the "Federal safety net." This entry summarizes the consequences of abolishing welfare, and the odd political dynamics that led to its end.

 THE STATES
Though it grew into a potent symbol of social decay, the A.F.D.C. program was established amid little controversy, as a sidelight of the Social Security Act. It was intended to provide small pensions to indigent widows, instead of placing their children in orphanages. But the program changed during a period of explosive growth in the late 1960's, as millions of never-married women joined the rolls. If the program's public face was once that of a West Virginia miner's widow, it then became that of a young black woman in an urban ghetto. There were about 14 million women and children receiving benefits when the program ended, with the average family of three getting about $370 a month.
Initially, those who warned of social catastrophe seemed alarmist. In abolishing welfare, Congress gave the states annual lump-sum payments, called block grants, to assist the poor virtually any way they saw fit. The states were barred from aiding families for more than five years, but most set much shorter limits. By later standards, the sizes of the first block grants were generous, and difficult as it is now to imagine, the late 1990's seemed a golden age of state experimentation.
In 1997, Mississippi contracted with church groups to run its relief programs; within a few years the teen-age pregnancy rate dropped 10 percent. Vermont placed a two-year limit on benefits but offered subsidized jobs to those who were still unemployed. Tennessee took a tougher tack, imposing a strict 18-month cutoff with no further aid. But in the late 1990's, Tennessee had a 3 percent unemployment rate, and most mothers found at least part-time work. While millions of poor families still led hand-to-mouth existences, they always had; local control, whatever its problems, was not unambiguously worse.
Then came the 1999 recession. Faced with declining revenues and rising aid requests, states slashed their payments; the mother of two who had received $370 in 1995 was now getting $180 a month. With families crossing borders in search of aid, the "race to the bottom" ensued, with each state trying to be as tough as its neighbors. Just months after Texas barred payments to legal immigrants, for instance, the other border states followed. As an entitlement, the old A.F.D.C. system promised a check to any qualifying family within 45 days; waiting lists now grew as long as two years. As many as a million families who would have received aid under the Federal system now received nothing.
Though the economy recovered in subsequent years, state spending did not. As the number of neglected children skyrocketed, the child welfare system snapped. In 1995, there were approximately 460,000 children in foster-care programs; a decade later, the number approached one million. As the numbers grew, the Federal Government began a 10-city experiment to test the performance of orphanages -- an idea first broached by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.

THINKING.]
The experiment earned high marks, but Congress balked at its cost. A year at the latter-day Boys' Towns cost more than a year at Harvard, and lawmakers refused to keep financing them.

THE PEOPLE
----------
 The end of welfare was accompanied by major cuts in food, housing and medical programs. And it came when the wages of low-skilled workers were already in a free fall because of global competition. So it is not surprising that poor people have seen their standard of living decline, while their numbers are rapidly increasing. Until 1995, for instance, all poor children in America had health insurance under a program called Medicaid. The successor state programs have largely devoted their resources to the elderly, leaving about half the nation's poor children uninsured.

Not all former recipients have fared poorly. As many as a quarter of the five million A.F.D.C. families found and retained full-time work. For them, the end of welfare worked much as it was intended -- as a prompt to greater self-reliance. They received considerable publicity in the late 1990's as welfare abolitionists tried to rebut charges that the cuts had been cruel. A coalition of conservative groups sponsored the "Million Mothers March," a day of speeches and prayer by former recipients to celebrate their new lives. While their earnings remained quite modest -- often little more than they had received on welfare -- many mothers praised the psychic rewards of serving as "positive role models."
Far more numerous are those in a second category: "cyclers," who have alternated between short-term employment and charitable aid. The cycling phenomenon was first identified in the mid-1980's by researchers at Harvard University who hoped to see expanded Government aid. Part of the cyclers' continuing problem has been economic: whether they work as telemarketers, cosmetologists, cashiers or clerks, they are typically the last hired and first fired.
But even in good times, the chaos of many low-income homes spills onto the job. Broken-down cars, sick relatives and a lack of child care are perennial problems -- indeed, a 2007 study by the Children's Defense Fund found that dozens of mothers were arrested each year for locking their children in cars as they worked. Sociologists estimate that since welfare ended, about half the former population has fallen into this pattern of sporadic work with little hope for advancement.
At the same time, about 25 percent of the A.F.D.C. families -- that is, more than a million of them -- have fallen into utter destitution. The public now sees them lining up at shelters, stealing into abandoned buildings and begging on street corners. At the time of abolition, half the welfare mothers lacked a high-school diploma, and in inner cities as many as one in three had histories of some drug or alcohol abuse; a subsequent study by the Rockefeller Foundation emphasized how many remained deeply disturbed. It found that by 2005, three-fourths of the families entering shelters were those of welfare mothers who had exhausted their lifetime eligibility.
The Rockefeller study, "Repeating Mistakes," compared the 1995 law ending welfare with the 1960's move that deinstitutionalized the mentally ill. Schizophrenics were supposed to find community-based programs; welfare recipients were entrusted to state agencies. In neither case did the local safety net appear. Like the 1980's street people, the homeless families of the early 21st century enjoyed a brief period of Hollywood vogue. Meryl Streep won an Oscar in 2006 for her portrayal of a destitute woman.

SPEECH CALLING FOR A RETURN OF THE FEDERAL SAFETY NET.]
But once again, charity chic faded.
The end of welfare also brought unintended consequences in the area of morality. The abolitionists had hoped to spur a return to work, marriage and responsibility. But for some of the poorest women, the loss of aid had the opposite effect. Some became more reliant on abusive boyfriends, and reports of domestic violence rose. Abortion rates hit record levels and so did arrests for prostitution, leading several cities to decriminalize the practice in specified red-light zones.
POLITICS
--------
Antipathy for the dole is as old as the country itself, but it gained a sudden new potency in the mid-1990's, just before the program's demise. Oddly enough, it was President William Jefferson Clinton, a Democrat, who set the new forces into motion. In his 1992 campaign, he famously promised to "end welfare as we know it" by imposing time limits and work requirements. When he later failed to promote his plan, the Republicans pushed his rhetoric to a conclusion he had not envisioned.
Clinton's initial plan for ending welfare had included new training, universal health care and job guarantees. But the actual end meant only that. And a President who had pledged to expand the income and medical security of all Americans wound up presiding over an unprecedented contraction of the safety net.
In his recent memoirs, the ex-President describes his handling of the issue as "one of my greatest regrets." He acknowledges that his party's defeat in the 1994 elections left him reluctant to spend political capital on the welfare poor. His own plan had included the toughest work requirements any President had ever proposed. But by the fall of 1995 Clinton had joined those dismissing it as weak, apologizing in an interview: "I wasn't pleased with it either."
At the same time, Clinton argues in his memoirs that he was genuinely surprised that the subsequent state-based system collapsed so quickly. Throughout 1995 he had looked skeptically at his own aides' predictions that poverty would rise sharply. But the memoirs do recount one moment of doubt. On the day before Thanksgiving 1995, Clinton served dinner at a homeless shelter in Washington, where, as he explained at the time, he was disturbed to see that "the fastest growing group of homeless people in our country are young women and their young children."
Looking back 20 years later, Clinton confessed something he did not disclose that day at the shelter. Standing in the serving line, a month before welfare's end, he feared that he had just got a glimpse of America's future.

THE MURDER BROADCASTING SYSTEM

BYLINE: By MAX FRANKEL 

 BODY:
HOW MUCH longer will Americans tolerate the cult of violence that passes for "local news" on television? Even as crime rates subside, the wicked nightly assault on our senses gets louder. The more advanced the technology by which stations prepare their 10 or 11 P.M. summaries of the day, the greater the mayhem they import to arouse our anxiety and disturb our sleep.
Deliberate? You bet. Cynical? Completely. And pervasive. 
 Although this profitable programming is devised by hundreds of separate stations, almost all of them cling slavishly to the same dreary format. Their newscasts are distinguishable only by the speed and skill with which they drive the audience from rage and fear to fluff and banter, leading the way to long commercials that exploit aroused emotions. Sports results, too, are delivered at a manic pace, spiced with scenes of violence or pathetic pratfalls, and even the weather reports are used to drive our moods up and down, from alarm to calm and back again.
I have learned from my own recent viewing in New York that when local events fail to supply this "news" machine with enough depravity, it quickly imports more by satellite or syndicate. In one 48-hour period that offered only modest local criminality, viewers had to suffer bulletins on every channel about a woman, conveniently cast as a "model," missing in California and another, dubbed an "heiress," missing in Mississippi. We saw the killing of a tiger who had mauled a 3-year-old in South Carolina, the rampage of highway bandits along the Mexican border, a mob's machete assault on a crook in Thailand and the lynching of a bank robber in Brazil. It was also a poor couple of days for disasters nearby, so we were subjected to scenes of: 1) "leptospirosis injury" in Nicaragua, a bleeding into the lungs caused by a "Central American bacterium" that "is coming our way"; 2) an overturned bus in Maryland in which five people died, and 3) bits of debris from the crash of a single-engine plane into an apartment building, killing three, in Fullerton, Calif.
(Full disclosure requires me to note with sadness that the next morning The New York Times ran a huge picture of two firefighters at that Fullerton crash scene, for no apparent reason except that their illuminated passage before a fully splayed palm tree created a striking, albeit soothing, composition.)
Finally, at the end of that week, New York news came into its own again. All channels could feast on a horrendous crime, which they eagerly portrayed -- with no appreciation for the irony -- as the imitation of a crime depicted in a new movie, "The Money Train." Two hoods torched a subway token booth with a flammable liquid and sent the clerk screaming, naked and ablaze, into the night. And there stood the purveyors of our nightly mayhem piously interviewing officials who had warned the film producers that this would happen because sick minds find instruction in the bizarrely stimulating images set before them.
Whether or not it provokes much crime, the appalling diet of nightly violence obviously crowds out all reasonable reporting of local life and strife. These sordid telecasts by grinning anchors are local in design and thus protected from frequent monitoring and criticism. But the Rocky Mountain Media Watch in Denver, whose first survey of local news drew my attention in the spring, has enlarged its survey and brings evidence of a further decline of standards.
It analyzed the tapes of 100 local programs in 58 cities on a single night, Sept. 20, and found a disheartening sameness. The typical half-hour program offered about 12 minutes of "news," more than 40 percent of it depicting violent crimes or disasters. Commercials on average consumed more than nine minutes and sports and weather nearly seven, leaving two minutes for promotions ("Don't go away") and chatter.
Of the 100 programs, 37 led off with crime, 15 with disasters. On 70 stations, the favorite disaster that night was a mild California earthquake, 1 of 200 that month, which caused no injuries and little damage. Yet WSMV in Nashville reported it as "very powerful"; KEYE in Austin said, "Southern California shakes, rattles and rolls," and WSVN in Miami assured its listeners that "news crews are on the way." Early snow in Colorado, floods in Thailand, hurricanes in Mexico and a ferry aground in the English Channel were among the night's other disastrous diversions.
The smallest cities tended to depict less mayhem, but there were no significant differences among the stations owned by, or affiliated with, the four networks. The CBS station in Memphis, owned by The New York Times, ranked 44th in mayhem (44 percent of its news), 49th in time devoted to commercials (31 percent) and a merciful 98th in the proportion of fluffy chatter, promos and celebrity gossip to news (17 percent).
Virtually no station offers thoughtful coverage of important local issues, including crime. Few ever try to analyze the local economy or the school, transportation and welfare systems.
Why has local television sunk so low? And why does the public buy it?
A prominent television executive tells me it's wrong even to think of these programs as ventures in "news." They are "spot deliverers," meaning they are low-cost noisemakers looking to attract the largest possible audience for ads whose revenues the station keeps entirely for itself. I am not persuaded that even such crass motivation requires universal departure from the standards of civilized news gathering. If at least one of four or more competing stations tried a truly different approach, it might well attract 25 or 30 percent of the audience.
But assume the worst: public taste has sunk so low that a more moderate approach to news would truly be less profitable. How then can the community enforce a higher standard? Censorship is neither practical nor constitutional. Boycotts are clumsy and crude weapons.
I think the answer is shame: explicit and frequent declarations that condemn the mayhem and compel coverage of the criticism by the very stations under attack. Politicians and other prominent citizens in every community should name and embarrass the national media moguls, who directly control dozens of local stations, and the local owners and managers, who pride themselves on their good citizenship.
Business is business, they will protest. Yes, but recklessly disturbing the peace is the public's business. Faced with some resistance, the perpetrators, as my local broadcasters might say, would cut and run.

HEADLINE: ARCHITECTURE VIEW;
A City's Inner Workings Are Part of the Design

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp 

 BODY:
IT'S BEEN RAISING TINKLY LAUGHTER at Christmas cocktail parties: the Municipal Art Society has hired a sanitation man as its new president. And it's true that the appointment of Brendan Sexton, a former Sanitation Commissioner, does present an unexpected clash of images. The Municipal Art Society, a century-old private civic organization founded to boost the quality of architecture in New York, has a reputation as a bastion of gentility, dedicated to promoting noble but somewhat enfeebled notions of taste, civility and esthetic refinement. Mr. Sexton's resume, by contrast, evokes images of landfills and recycling depots, the messy underworld of detritus that cities prefer to keep out of sight.
Well, let's hear it for garbage. And let's salute the Municipal Art Society for recognizing architecture and urban design as much more than ways to decorate surfaces. They are also powerful tools for bringing parts of a city together: streets, sewers, subways, parks. Art can deal with the systems that make a city tick, not just the individual buildings that enhance the way a city looks. 
 This is a good time for the society to refocus its mission. Situated in the Urban Center, a wing of the landmark Villard Houses on Madison Avenue and 51st Street in Manhattan, the organization sponsors varied public programs, including walking tours, symposiums and exhibitions in its ground-floor galleries. It also lobbies government agencies, like the City Planning Commission, on issues ranging from waterfront redevelopment to the use of public spaces in midtown Manhattan skyscrapers. The society may be best known for its battles to protect major landmarks, like Grand Central Terminal, and for opposing imprudent real estate developments, like the plan for the Coliseum site at Columbus Circle.
In some areas, however, the society's effectiveness has been less than brilliant. Of course, it is not to blame for the generally lackluster quality of the city's architecture and urban planning in recent years. Even so, it has shown little awareness of the extent to which a changing city demands new visions.
Under the direction of Kent Barwick, president for the last 12 years, it often seemed that the group had renamed itself the Municipal Art History Society. Mr. Barwick, who resigned to become president of the New York State Historical Society, was once in charge of the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission, and his esthetic passions tended toward the antiquarian.
New York has a glorious past, of course, and the preservation movement is not to be taken for granted. But neither is the city's future, nor the contributions that living architects could be making to it. Perhaps the society's greatest shortcoming has been its failure to recognize and promote their work. It has also shown a painful lack of interest in developments in architecture and urbanism elsewhere. New York is a world city in an increasingly global culture. While its own heritage is well worth protecting, the cosmopolitan outlook is an important part of that heritage. Turning its back on the rest of the world is hardly the best way to sustain it. Paris, London, Barcelona and Tokyo also have distinguished histories, but this has not prevented their architects from doing work of a high creative caliber. The Municipal Art Society should make better use of its galleries to keep New Yorkers informed about the international scene.
Mr. Sexton, whose appointment was announced earlier this month, is not well known in New York cultural circles. A 50-year-old resident of Staten Island, he has wide experience in government and private enterprise. Most recently employed by the Rockefeller Group, a development firm, as vice president for government and community affairs, Mr. Sexton has held posts in five mayoral administrations, most prominently from 1986 to 1990, when he headed the Sanitation Department under Edward I. Koch.
I don't recall that streets were any cleaner in the late 1980's. But those who follow contemporary art and design should be thrilled by the appointment of a former sanitation commissioner to head a major cultural organization. As some architects have recognized, sanitation is not just an urban utility; it's a cultural system, part of what binds a city together and joins it to the planet's ecology. Buckminster Fuller once said, "It's all in the plumbing."
In recent years, some American cities have made urban infrastructure the focus of public art. In Phoenix, for example, a waste-treatment and recycling plant is the centerpiece of the city's ambitious public art program. Combining elements of landscape design, sanitation engineering and public education, this visionary project shows how art can help integrate the pieces of a fragmented modern metropolis.
The Municipal Art Society dates back to the turn-of-the-century City Beautiful era, when private interests and philanthropists, not government, assumed responsibility for services ranging from the New York Public Library to the city's subway system. Architects in private practice, not urban planners, took the initiative to raise the quality of urban design. This is a valuable legacy to draw on today, at a time when the city's government favors the privatization of municipal services.
In a recent interview, Mr. Sexton said he expects all major development projects in the foreseeable future to require cooperation between the public and private sectors. He believes that his experience in both sectors will enable the society to play an essential role in improving their quality. He expressed his approval of Riverside South, Donald Trump's 75-acre residential development on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
FOR THIS CONTROVERSIAL PROJECT, the society and four other civic groups have joined in developing a plan that would moderate the development's impact on a densely built neighborhood. In exchange for a package of amenities, including a new park, a public-art program and architectural design guidelines, the civic groups agreed to endorse Riverside South. But the project remains controversial, even within the society's own ranks. Political opposition to Riverside South and cuts in Federal money may sharply reduce the promised public benefits. More important, some fear that the society has compromised its effectiveness as a public advocate.
After all, the society's willingness to oppose rather than accommodate real estate developments has produced its most glorious moments in recent years. And there are a host of pressing issues -- the growing influence of Business Improvement Districts, the redevelopment of the waterfront and lower Manhattan, the proliferation of superstores, to name a few -- that it cannot address effectively unless it protects its independence from market pressures. Mr. Barwick was a master at negotiations, but he also knew when it was time to stop building bridges and stand his ground.
Riverside South was an experiment worth undertaking but by no means a model to be followed in the future. The problem is not, as some critics believe, that an angelic civic institution made the mistake of shaking hands with the Devil. It is that the concept of being a mediator among entrenched interests is seriously flawed.
What the city needs most desperately is not to please elements of the status quo but to look above and beyond them toward the fragile interests of art that require a defender. What the Municipal Art Society should do now is meditate seriously on the meaning of its middle name and look toward those fugitive apparitions of vision and imagination where art comes to life.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Making Downtown a Round-the-Clock Village;
Office Building Going Residential

 BODY:
The first major project bringing reality to visions of a bustling, round-the-clock village in downtown Manhattan's commercial canyons is to begin by spring when workers start converting a 21-story Italian Renaissance building at 25 Broad Street from office to residential space.
The 500,000-square-foot building, erected at the turn of the century, has 15-foot-high ceilings on its first four floors and a 125-foot-long marble lobby, all of which are in the conversion plan of the architect, Costas Kondylis. 
 The building is owned by Crescent Heights Investors, a Miami-based company that helped revitalize much of that city's waterfront. The company plans to create 345 rental apartments. Crescent Heights and the Hirschfeld Realty Company paid $5 million for the building in 1994, with Crescent Heights subsequently buying out the Hirschfeld interest. Bruce Menin, president of Crescent Heights, declined to comment further on the project's financing.
The apartments will "all be, on average, 20 percent larger than the typical New York apartment," said Mr. Menin, who hopes to have the building ready for occupancy by next fall. There will be a mix of studios, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments, Mr. Menin said, with a one-bedroom unit renting from $1,350 to $1,800 a month and a two-bedroom apartment for $1,750 to $2,600.
Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, a business improvement district, said the building is the first major project started under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's Downtown Revitalization Plan, which provides tax incentives for conversion to residential use.

HEADLINE: For Managing Agents, It's a New World

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
AFTER a series of kickback indictments stained an otherwise colorless industry, many managing agents -- the men and women who handle millions of dollars of expenditures and hiring for the city's co-ops and condos -- have spent much of the last year reforming, consolidating and reorganizing their businesses.
With the 49 indictments leveled 18 months ago as the catalyst, some managing agents have hired private investigators and public relations people to clean up their images and their procedures; some have formed their own association, which promptly passed a code of ethics; some have merged or sold or dissolved their companies; some have introduced multiple bidding systems. 
 Some have spent heavily on computerized central purchasing and billing systems -- reforms they say are not only more corruption-proof, but save their co-op clients money as well.
These actions, many say, also give them an edge in what they call a "dog-eat-dog" industry, where they say they are often underpaid and seldom appreciated, a business in which there is always some hungry young company willing to undercut their fees.
The kickback investigation -- which the assistant district attorney supervising the case said last week was continuing in both the residential and commercial property management segments -- dramatized what the managing agents say they had known all along about the industry: that it was a dinosaur that desperately needed to become more high-tech; that it could no longer be treated as a secondary arm of a real estate company -- as one agent put it, a "loss leader" for the more lucrative sales and rental division.
Property management is "an industry that is in the process of defining itself," said Leslie Bogen Winkler, president of the Association of Cooperative and Condominium Managers, which had its first general meeting in June. Kent M. Swig, co-chairman at Brown, Harris, Stevens -- an old-line firm that changed hands in March after having been badly tainted by the corruption scandal -- called the industry "chronically underfunded" and said it was currently undergoing a "global change."
Donald Goodwin, a Brown, Harris managing agent, ticked off the changes in the old-line firms or their management units: "We've been bought; Douglas Elliman has been bought; William B. May Management has been bought; Sulzberger-Rolfe is gone. Of the smaller firms, Bellmarc and Regal merged at the end of last year. Almost half the major firms have either merged or disappeared, and the pace is accelerating."
Such changes, Mr. Swig prophesied, will include still more consolidation of the major players, fewer and fewer midsized firms and a constantly shifting group of "one- and two-man shops."
Oskar Brecher, head of American Landmark Management, which oversees 8,500 units, called Mr. Swig's predictions "the common wisdom" in the industry. "There will be further polarization -- only very large full-service companies and very, very small hands-on owner/managers with maybe 10 or 15 buildings will be left," he said.
Mr. Brecher, who termed his own company "mid- to large-sized," is looking for a company or companies to join with -- either wholly or as a back-office-only collaboration. He said talks with Charles. H. Greenthal Management, which oversees 15,700 units, recently fell through.
"The way the fee structures are set up, it is difficult to have a decent bottom line," he said, adding that the pressure is particularly intense for midsized firms, with more salaries and more office expenses than the small firms. "If we aggregate ourselves into larger entities, we feel we can be more efficient," he said. "It's a personal-relationship-driven business. Boards are demanding access to senior management -- they don't want to feel like small cogs -- but they want to keep fees tight to the line. It's a difficult act to balance."
The changes that have already occurred were at least partly caused by the increasing sophistication of co-op boards, which have started demanding a lot more bidding and budget information and a lot more financial advice from their managing agents -- often without increasing their fees.
"The industry is becoming much more pro-active," said Jay Seiden, a lawyer who spoke at the managing agents' association's first educational seminar, held two weeks ago. But at the same time, Mr. Seiden warned, agents must become "more careful in your dealing with contractors because you're at great risk."
IN the wake of the indictments, many managing agents have instituted reforms. They range from hiring private investigators to vet their own procedures in bidding jobs and hiring subcontractors, to forcing contractors to submit to lengthy background checks.
Brown, Harris, Stevens -- with 17 of its agents indicted -- had, as part of its civil settlement, agreed to hire its own independent inspector general "to insure that its employees do not engage in improper conduct in the future." The company hired Kroll Associates to look at the scope of the way it did management business and to monitor its procedures.
"For years we always assumed people were honest," said Mr. Goodwin, a New York City managing agent for 36 years who has been with Brown, Harris for 8 years. "Now we are taking a more aggressive stance. We monitor procedures, policies and people. We don't take anything for granted."
Last week, Daniel J. Castleman, the assistant district attorney supervising the kickback case, said that in addition to the 48 indictments against individuals and one against a corporation -- the now-defunct Darwood Management -- his office has obtained an additional 34 sealed guilty pleas by individuals and three by corporations as part of the initial investigation.
Subsequently, a number of additional individuals have pleaded guilty and have had their pleas sealed. One official with knowledge of the investigation said that the exact number who had pleaded guilty in the continuing investigation was not being released because "obviously these are people who are cooperating and we'd prefer not to let the public know exactly how many they are."
So far, there have been no trials -- 94 percent of those charged have pleaded guilty. One managing agent has pleaded not guilty, but no trial date has been scheduled. Five cases were dismissed because those involved, either as defendants or witnesses, were either dying or left severely impaired by illness. Only one man is serving prison time; he is spending 20 weekends in jail.
The district attorney's office has not pushed for prison terms, Mr. Castleman said, "because our goal was to change the way the management business was conducted."
"With white-collar crime, we want to see the kickbacks paid back," he said. "We feel that's a powerful enough deterrent."
He added that with "the critical shortage of jail space, we feel it's wise to reserve the scarce jail cells for violent criminals."
Thus far the District Attorney's office has received $4 million for a restitution fund to reimburse victims. The District Attorney has not yet come up with a recommendation -- which would have to be approved by a court -- on how to dole out the money.
"It's not easy," Mr. Castleman said. "We've come up with plans for securities industry infringements, but in those cases it's clear who's the victim and how much they lost. In these cases, a managing agent might have taken money from a contractor who serviced 60 buildings in varying degrees. How do you assess that?"
ACCORDING to the owners of management companies, real estate lawyers and other real estate professionals, the indictments only accelerated the consolidation of the industry -- in the most recent cases, two big firms were bought by a national management firm and one was bought by a partnership that includes one of the city's biggest developers.
"You have to step back to 1976, when this all started," said Neil J. Kreisel, who until a few months ago owned the Kreisel Company. In September, that management firm -- along with the management arm of Douglas Elliman -- was bought by the Insignia Financial Group, a national concern based in Greenville, S.C.
"In 1976, changes in the co-op conversion law made it easier to convert and there was a proliferation of co-ops," said Mr. Kreisel, who remains president of Kreisel. "In a profession which until then many defined as rent collectors, this was a major change in the business. Sales of apartments or insurance came before management. In the mid-80's, developers began to manage their own buildings: Rose Associates, Marty Raynes, even Donald Trump. Everyone was a manager, and some were better than others."
According to Mr. Kreisel, the management services did not keep up with the expansion and "the infrastructure was never improved to meet the needs." The managing agent scandal, many agents say, merely hastened the necessary reforms.
"In the old days, nobody paid that much attention to the management part of the business; it didn't count as much," said Ruth Lerner, managing director of a company that manages over 3,000 units in two large residential complexes, Waterside Plaza and Manhattan Plaza, and who owned her own small company before she became, as she says, "burnt out" with all the hard work now required.
"It used to be that if they didn't get the financial package done, it would just be late -- if they bothered to prepare it at all," she said. "Boards didn't used to push and in those days, the physical plants often got neglected; today, the boards are examining everything much more closely. The new firms know they have to meet certain goals, and the old-line firms are beefing up and becoming more proficient."
After the indictments, co-op boards -- already stung by a recession that left many of them scared of defaulting shareholders, unsold units and drawn-down reserve funds -- became more demanding. Especially after the indictments spotlighted the diligence necessary to oversee a co-op corporation and its building, the boards started asking for "more sophisticated purchasing analyses, and sophisticated use of funds, including types of mortgage refinancing," Mr. Kreisel said.
The indictments speeded up a pattern of mergers and acquisitions: The Helmsley organization , faced with a $1 million payment to the New York District Attorney's restitution fund for wrongdoing by some managing agents at Brown, Harris, Stevens, a company they owned, paid the money and sold the company to a partnership consisting of William and Arthur Zeckendorf, Mr. Swig and David Burris -- two pairs with 50-50 control -- and to Allied Partners, a passive real estate investment company. The price was a reported $3 million.
The new owners have instituted a series of major changes, which included a move to the Upper East Side two weeks ago and the hiring of Kroll Associates.
Michael Cherkasky, who runs the New York office for Kroll, stressed that each managing agency has reacted differently to the indictments. "It's not monolithic," he said. "Some elements of the industry now understand that certain management efficiencies instituted to lessen corruption are actually good business."
Mr. Cherkasky said that firms like Brown, Harris, Stevens now have strict prequalification standards for suppliers that include background checks. "If a company has been sued 30 times because their work is not up to standard, or if a company has been debarred by the city, any good management company would want to know that," he said.
In addition to enforcing codes of ethics for both the management agents and the suppliers, Kroll also recommends periodic audits of the managing agents' purchasing and billing systems and across-the-board monitoring of all procedures.
At one time, 80 percent of the old-line companies' business was sales or rentals, Mr. Goodwin said. Getting the management contract was a quick ticket to getting the inside track on sales within that building. "It was like they'd do it for free -- or practically free -- just to get the other business," he said. But with the increasing sophistication of co-op shareholders, who often wanted to list their apartment with a number of real estate brokers, or even sell it themselves, the property management divisions were forced to become more efficient -- or die.
"It's now a stand-alone business," the managing agent continued. "In our case, we still sell real estate, but the management arm must stand on its own merits; it must make its own profits and losses. "
William Zeckendorf, one of the company's new owners, said Brown, Harris will prosper because it charged fees that were fair and adequate, considering the services it offered. "A lot of these small companies start out by trying to undercut the bigger companies," he said. "But they might be a one-man shop, operating in an apartment."
INDEED, the question of fees for managing agents is a perpetual subject of discussion -- and most agents contend they are paid far too little. Many say they simply cannot survive on the "bare bones" fees paid them, fees that are usually based on a yearly price per apartment unit.
Although owners of management companies refuse to make public their fees, the consensus is that the companies charge an average per unit cost that ranges from $350 per year in the largest buildings to between $550 and $700 per unit in the smaller buildings. Yet that is only an average; yearly management fees for a co-op building can run from $15,000 all the way up to $150,000. Yet universally, managing agents say the fees are not high enough for the amount of work accomplished.
"We got out of the management business because we weren't making any money," said Peter Marra, president of William B. May Real Estate. "It just isn't a profitable business to be in -- at least not for us."
Three years ago, May sold off its management arm. "We tried doing to do it small and we tried to do it big," Mr. Marra continued, "and we couldn't make money either way." "It's a thankless business with endless problems," he said, repeating the comments of many. "Somebody must be making money -- there's still people doing it -- but we're glad to be out of it."
To compete today, managing agents -- even the smaller operations -- say they must have state-of-the-art computer systems and what Mr. Kreisel called a "non-revenue-producing support staff."
"You need a central purchasing department -- that doesn't directly generate revenue," he said. "Fifteen years ago, I can't imagine the owner of a management company spending money on a purchasing agents and sophisticated computer systems."
BUT now they are. Mr. Zeckendorf said he has already invested $750,000 on upgrading the company's office space, computer and purchasing systems and telephones, and plans to spend $250,000 more.
Mr. Kreisel said the main reason he sold is to take advantage of Insignia's "bells and whistles," including state-of-the-art computers and optical scanning systems that allow 24-hour access by board members to receipts and purchasing information.
For his part, Mr. Zeckendorf quoted before and after figures to demonstrate how company-wide purchasing -- not building-by-building purchasing, as was often done in the past -- saves buildings money. And with more buildings signing up, it makes the management business make money, too, he said.
By buying in bulk for Brown, Harris's 120 buildings, the individual buildings would pay $260 for a doorman's uniform compared to $300 to $350 if bought separately, he said. They would pay 30 to 32 cents for a 40 watt light bulb, compared to 48 to 94 cents. They would pay a flat $2 fee to have their fire extinguishers inspected, compared to paying between $10 and $20.
Although these suppliers are chosen through a bidding process, Mr. Zeckendorf stressed that the low bidder is not always chosen; quality, delivery time and guarantees are also checked.
Increasingly, property managers say boards are looking for ways to save money. By offering them savings through central purchasing and new ways to refinance their underlying mortgage and invest their reserve funds, they are hoping boards will not seek to undercut their fees -- or worse yet, find another, cheaper company.
"There seems to be a proliferation of small firms," said John G. Marden, treasurer of the board of 205 East 63d Street. "There's a lot of eager-beaver firms out there. In the course of a year I get anywhere from a dozen to two dozen letters from management agencies. It's not as centered in the large firms as it used to be."
Despite the entreaties, Mr. Marden said the board is happy with its present management company, Heron Management, a relatively young management firm owned by a lawyer and an architect.
With their help, he said, the board has actually reduced maintenance twice -- the high maintenance being the main reason apartments in the building weren't selling.
Since maintenance payments went down, "the market has picked up dramatically," he said. "The market didn't respond until we restructured, and the managing agent helped us with that. The building is being managed much more perceptively."
To one of the partners of Heron, Ronni Lynn Arougheti, co-op management is "a crazy field," in which managing agents are underpaid and underloved.
"After the managing-agent scandal, we thought the management fees would go up to a normal professional level," said Ms. Arougheti, a lawyer. "But we'd go and pitch a building and they'd want us to do all the work we'd say we'd do -- for $10,000 less.
"How many times have I sat at a table and the board will vote the super a $4,000 bonus and I'd put in a $1,500 raise and they'd say: 'Hey, what did you do for us? The super polishes the brass every week and says hello to us.' And on and on, and there goes our raise."

 CORRECTION:
An article in the Real Estate section on Sunday about changes in the business of managing residential co-ops and condominiums misstated the timing of reductions in monthly maintenance at 205 East 63d Street in Manhattan. While the board has announced them, they have yet to take place. The article also misspelled the surname of the board's treasurer. He is John G. Marder, not Marden.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: MIDWOOD;
Aid for 'Antique' School Lab

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
Midwood High School students consistently win awards in the prestigious Westinghouse Science Talent Search -- no thanks to their laboratories.
Chemistry lab tables have no gas to light Bunsen burners and no water to wash away chemicals. A ventilation problem has allowed fumes to corrode metal shelves. Physics lab tables have no electricity to power energy experiments. And the biology lab -- a single room that serves 900 students -- became a flooding geyser last year when a spigot blew. 
 But on Tuesday night, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew told a packed town meeting of Brooklyn parents at the school that help is on the way. "There are dollars that are going to be provided for upgrading the labs in Midwood," Mr. Crew said after a parent, Alberto Belinfante, complained that Midwood's labs "are antiques and relics."
"They could be used to study the prehistoric ages," Mr. Belinfante said. "That's how old they are."
After consulting briefly with William C. Thompson Jr., a Midwood graduate who is Brooklyn's representative on the Board of Education, Mr. Crew delivered the welcome news that come January, the board will allocate capital funds to repair and modernize the labs. Mr. Crew did not specify a dollar amount, and calls to his spokesman, David Begel, were not returned.
For two years, Mr. Thompson has worked with Midwood parents and staff on a proposal to renovate the labs, which were built with the school in 1940. Two previous plans were scrapped by budget cuts.
Students, meanwhile, use the substandard labs as well as those at Brooklyn College across the street, and at Downstate Medical Center and Maimonides Hospital. Last year Midwood had 16 Westinghouse semi-finalists. Stuyvesant and the Bronx High School of Science were the only schools in the nation to have more. This year 95 students submitted Westinghouse papers, copies of which are piled a foot high on a credenza in the office of the principal, Louis Frolich.
At his town meeting, Mr. Crew said that labs at many city schools are in desperate need of repair. "We've got to create a system," he said, "where regardless of where you grew up, regardless of what language you speak, regardless of what neighborhood you come from, regardless of what socio-economic bracket you're in, you can go to school and get the kind of lab that would serve you going to any medical school." He did not say how such a system would be financed.

HEADLINE: Ad Campaign Brings Responses From Companies

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
SEVENTY-FIVE leads from companies that are interested in relocating have been generated from an advertising campaign promoting Westchester as a prime business location.
The commercials, sponsored by the Westchester Business Partnership, a nonprofit joint venture of the public and private sectors, have been appearing on cable television and radio since September. The spots feature business executives explaining why they have chosen to locate to or expand within the county, and they give a number (800-791-6683) to call for information. 
 The response to the campaign has been tremendous, said Geoffrey S. Thompson, a principal in the media relations firm of Thompson & Bender in Pleasantville, which developed the campaign. "In the five years that we have been involved with advertising campaigns promoting Westchester, this is by far the most successful and has had the greatest response," Mr. Thompson said. "I've taken some of the calls myself, and we have received over 300 responses."
George J. Delaney, president of the Westchester Business Partnership and vice president of Con Edison's Westchester division, said: "This campaign has cost us about $250,000. But the potential payback, in terms of new jobs created and new business activity, is enormous."
In the next two weeks, Mr. Thompson said the leads will be turned over to the Westchester Economic Development Office, a private agency, and to the Economic Development Specialists office at Con Ed's Westchester division.
The television ads are running on CNN, ESPN, CNBC, MSG and A&E Networks on various cable systems. The radio spots have been running on WCBS-AM, WVOX and WVIP.
"This is the first time we have run TV ads, and their placement has given Westchester exposure before the audiences of 'Larry King Live' and the Knicks and Rangers games," Mr. Thompson said. "Westchester is getting a lot of exposure to a prime audience."
In the ads, executives who have relocated or are about to, talk about the benefits of doing business in the county, citing reasons like strategic location, safe environment, good transportation systems, good value for the money invested in real estate and the overall quality of life.
"It generally takes from 6 to 18 months from the time you first get a response until a company actually relocates," Mr. Thompson said. "It took Mastercard two years to relocate to Purchase, but considering they brought 65 new jobs with them, it's a win-win situation. Absolute Coding bought a building in New Rochelle, and they moved their company from the Bronx as a direct result of our 1993 campaign." PENNY SINGER

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Workers and Bosses, a Society Askew

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

 BODY:
TED, an egoless young man, is an undercover agent chosen by Feathers, the eccentric master of a surveillance racket. Ted's first assignment, for which he is renamed Kenneth, is to turn in the employees who are ripping off a canning factory. The pseudonymous private eye takes to the job with "an incredible ability to enter an environment and become one with it."
With that endorsement from Feathers arrives another assignment, this time in a leather plant that employs hundreds of thousands, robbers all. And Ted a k a Kenneth is to have a new name: Dennis. 
 How Ted is chosen in the first place sets the tone for a bizarre comedy. How the mysterious Feathers gives the innocent Ted an identity, and how the young man finds his own purpose are at the heart and soul of "Robbers," a new play of immense imagination at the Long Wharf Theater's Stage II in New Haven.
"Robbers" -- are they the underpaid exploited workers who pilfer ham or the bosses who say "Let 'em eat Spam"? -- is finally a rare thing to behold, a play of conscience. Its sheer moral urgency is embodied by Vinnie, the ringleader of the robbers.
In the haunting performance of Paul Ben-Victor, Vinnie -- who can come up with questions like "Ain't that the simple truth of earthly existence?" -- boils over with the desperation of the philosophically correct. One cannot turn away from Vinnie's theory of "economic necessity" or his cry of the underclass: "Are we no better than the rats?"
"Robbers" is filled with such vivid resonating characters in performances that linger, especially Peter Rini's wide-open young man in victorious search of self, talking of Kafka and Kira Arne's Cleo, the factory worker who vulnerably represents the hold of love.
Lucky for Long Wharf to have Marshall W. Mason's chameleonesque, terrifically swift staging of an uncommon play, although Judd Hirsch, as the many faces of Feathers (Japanese, Orthodox Jew, Russian lay priest) as well as the Indian owner, a real robber baron, does not take to all of them with equal reserves of energy.
It is now time to talk of the playwright Lyle Kessler, who wrote "Orphans," a striking 1984 play, with shades of Shepard and Pinter, about two strange brothers and the man they kidnap.
"Robbers" -- hardly an instantly accessible play for everyone -- exists and shifts on a self-created reality plane that many prefer to perceive as fantasy, given Mr. Kessler's learned and critical view of a society askew. We are perilously close to a thin line of derangement, Mr. Kessler seems to be saying. (Feathers's wife and his son are confined to a mental hospital; he and his daughter Lucinda, of many guises played sassily by Katherine Hiler, are not.)
Mr. Kessler also seems to believe that the "source of power" Kenneth finds, when he is no longer Ted, is good. In the search for signs of adventure and purity in theater, it is rewarding to listen to the voice of Mr. Kessler.
"Robbers," Long Wharf Theater's Stage II, 222 Sargent Drive, New Haven. 787-4282. Performances through Dec. 23.

HEADLINE: Ethos at Keio Academy Is Both Japanese and Fun

BYLINE: By JAMES V. O'CONNOR 

DATELINE: PURCHASE

 BODY:
WHEN David McGuckin came to Keio Academy here as a basketball coach, he was told that students took soccer very seriously. He did not appreciate how seriously until he was leaving basketball practice one night last January and heard a tapping noise coming from the middle of the soccer field. When he went out to investigate he found two players juggling a soccer ball in the dark on the snow-covered field.
Keio Academy, a Japanese high school, won the New York State Class C soccer championship on Nov. 18 at Canisius College in Buffalo, defeating Northrose-Walcott of Rochester 3 to 1. The entire student body took the eight-hour bus ride to Buffalo. In Japan it is a tradition to cancel classes and travel to championship games to show support for one's school. 
 "Teaching at Keio is very different from teaching in the public school system," said Mr. McGuckin, who is now the school's athletic director. "You don't have to spend a lot of time getting kids in order, and teachers are treated with a great deal of respect." Keio is part of Keio University near Tokyo. In the Japanese system students can be accepted from a so-called feeder school, which starts in kindergarten, guaranteeing them a spot at the University.
Wataru Osada, the top scorer for the Keio Unicorns, said: "It is the best university in Japan, similar to Ivy League schools in this country. You are pretty much guaranteed a good job when you get out of there."
There are 417 boys and girls attending Keio Academy here, with 380 living on campus. The boy-girl ratio is about 2 to 1. Most of the students are children of Japanese living in the United States, the Middle East and Central and South America. Only about 1 percent will not return to Japan to attend the university. Last year one graduate went to Brown, two to Stanford, two to Juilliard and the rest, 119, to Keio University.
Keio Academy is selective and expensive. Students must take an entrance exam, a writing test in English and Japanese and the S.A.T.'s and have two interviews. Tuition is $23,000 a year. Some recent graduates include the granddaughter of the founder of Toyota and the Emperor's nephew.
The program is as rigorous as the seriousness with which they take soccer, but some students look at going to school abroad as a respite from the demands of growing up in Japan. Pride and respect are frequently used terms at the school, but when an outsider looks below the surface, having fun is just as important to these teen-agers as it is to Americans.
Hideki Sasaki, a senior and member of the soccer team, spent last summer in Japan for the first time in 10 years. He played soccer for a local club and found it completely different from what he was accustomed to. "They were trying so hard to win that they didn't end up having any fun," Mr. Sasaki said. "We have a lot more fun playing here."
Daisuke Agari, another senior soccer player, said, "I probably won't be playing when I go back to Japan because I wouldn't fit into the program there."
Although having fun is the reason for most players being on the team, the intensity that they brought from their homeland was evident after they defeated Westlake High School 3 to 0 in the sectional finals. "Right after the sectionals, the kids started to get really intense," said the coach, David Symes. "So I called a team meeting and stressed going out and having fun. I had to remind them that this was high school soccer, not a job."
Classes at Keio are taught half in Japanese and half in English. Although staying current on Japanese language and cultural skills is important, the school is a model for multicultural education, which is being stressed in Japan now. Dr. Noriyuki Sugiura, the headmaster and a former economics professor at Keio University, was sent to the academy to insure that students were being educated to live in an increasingly global society.
"The single language, single culture that is in Japan today is becoming obsolete," Dr. Sugiura said. "Keio in New York is playing a very important role in the university's expansion of the global curriculum. We are linking the different campuses through information technology to accomplish this."
The global economy is not what most of the Keio students spend their time worrying about. They are dealing with the more universal problem of being teen-agers. Mr. McGuckin lives on campus in faculty housing, which is attached to the dormitory, and students often seek his advice. "Some kids come to me because they are homesick, or they want to know how to ask out a girl or how they should deal with a tough teacher," Mr. McGuckin said.
The school buildings are similar to most American high schools, and dormitory rooms are kept in the same fashion as adolescents' rooms worldwide: messy. What is different is that the cafeteria offers Japanese food as well as American, and there is a replica of a Japanese teahouse in the main building. This is used by some students for tea ceremonies and by others as a private place to get in touch with their cultural and religious roots.
Sports are probably the most popular form of extra-curricular activities, and they include rugby, basketball, volleyball and soccer. The state championship is important to the tradition of Keio Academy, which is 7 years old. The winning team was made up of the first class of the students attending four full years.
"It was a very fulfilling season for me, and they are probably the best team I have ever coached," Mr. Symes said. "They are my guys. I saw them the first day that they walked on campus."
The Keio Unicorns won the state championship with their fellow students watching. The team victory photograph not only has the team and coaches in it but also the entire student body and faculty. Being a bicultural institution, the team wanted the victory celebration to reflect American traditions as well, but they had forgotten one thing.
"After the game they had forgotten to dump the water bucket on me," Mr. Symes said. "So they called a meeting in the cafeteria after we got back and dumped cold water all over me."

HARD TWIST
Western Ranch Women.
By Barbara Van Cleve.
Illustrated. 162 pp. Santa Fe:
Museum of New Mexico Press. $50.
AS the cardinal icon of the free and the brave, the cowboy trumps even the Statue of Liberty in American visual consciousness. The statue, after all, offers itself as a beacon to the tired and the hungry, to the implicitly urban yearning huddled masses. It represents liberty as a communal virtue, freedom as a kind of high charity tendered to all comers. 
 The cowboy, on the other hand, riding solo across the raw Eden of the range, is the personification of a proud individualism. His is liberty understood as solitude and, more coldly, as inviolate isolation. It is the cowboy's lean face, plastered on billboards, that sells cigarettes. Nothing's going to get him.
In "Hard Twist," her striking collection of photographs and interviews with "Western ranch women," Barbara Van Cleve only appears to turn her attention away from the classic American icon of the cowboy. Her subjects may be the underrepresented women who, along with their fathers, husbands, brothers -- and sometimes without them -- run the cattle ranches of the West. But her abiding passion is for ranching itself, a way of life her subjects feel is threatened at every turn.
Ms. Van Cleve's territory is "an area more or less designated as the Rocky Mountains from Canada to Mexico." Her "hard twist" women (the term comes from the tough rope used in cattle work) represent all ages, from Bobby Brooks Kramer, an 81-year-old widow who still trains cutting horses, riding them herself, to Mary Bailey Davis, in one picture shown herding cattle and in another nursing her daughter like a ranching Madonna, her dark Stetson bent over the baby's head. Most of the women, like Ms. Van Cleve herself, were born in or married into families of cattle ranchers. They are resolutely attached to a life so physically demanding and economically precarious that only the romance of it and the beauty of the landscape could make it worth the trouble.
The book, a coffeetable album printed on heavy, silky stock, conveys dignity, and the black-and-white images have a grave appeal. Thirteen chapters, each devoted to a ranch woman or a family group, form the heart of the book. Each chapter, with as many as 12 or 14 photographs, provides resonant images of the women's lives and of their elemental landscape. Some of the pictures are documentary: pretty young women roping steers or branding calves, a middle-aged platinum blonde riding a bucking bronc at a rodeo (some of the women, like some cowboys, make part of their living at rodeos or running dude ranches).
The most intriguing images are the face-to-the-camera portraits for which Ms. Van Cleve's subjects were willing to sit. The very formality -- and implied collaboration -- of these photographs goes beyond the documentation of "a way of life" and begins to pierce the veneer of life style to enter the privacy of character. The candor of the faces is remarkable, and bespeaks the qualities these women profess in the interviews to revere: steadfastness, self-reliance, the rigors of hard work in even the hardest weather. The outfits are impressive too -- chaps and dusters, spurs and boots stiffened with mud, the great outlandish hats of our cowboy movie heroes, worn here by women.
The text, unfortunately, maintains neither the detachment nor the appeal of the photographs. To begin with, what is the long-winded, bluff-voiced memoir by Spike Van Cleve (Ms. Van Cleve's late father) doing in this book about ranch women? With the notable exception of an afterword by Michael W. Duty, which attempts to place ranching in a cultural context, Ms. Van Cleve and her subjects often seem lost somewhere between boosterism for ranch life and a complaint against people (that is, "the government," "environmentalists," "agencies," "the bureaucracy") who won't leave them alone to live that life. Ms. Van Cleve herself sticks to boosterism and takes no political stance, except to note with pride her ability to gain access to women wary of "the media." Because of her father's reputation as a cowboy poet, "they felt that I could be trusted," she says, "and that I wouldn't betray or misrepresent their position."
The book is a homage, and a homage never pretends to be objective. Still, it is unsettling to hear the aggrieved undertone in these interviews go unchallenged. "It isn't good enough that a rancher and his family have been here a hundred years and have taken good care of the land and raised food on it," one woman says. "Now we have to defend our position on it." This seemingly reasonable frustration presumes an unquestioned right of possession.
In his foreword, Thomas McGuane quotes Henri Cartier-Bresson, who, when asked what compelled him to photograph something, said, "My general culture." The "general culture" of the West, so much a part of American consciousness, has lately forced us to pause over its assumptions, even its "traditions," which include taking land from people who inhabited it far longer than the hundred years or so of ranching history. It may be not only their way of life that is under fire, as these ranch women believe, but the strangely defensive model of liberty the West has come to claim for itself.

THE MOST DANGEROUS MAN IN DETROIT
Walter Reuther and the Fate of American Labor.
By Nelson Lichtenstein.
Illustrated. 575 pp. New York:
Basic Books. $35.
WHEN Walter Reuther died in a plane crash in 1970, he had been president of the United Automobile Workers for 24 years. During much of that time, he was arguably the most important and revered labor leader in the world and a symbol of one of postwar America's greatest successes -- the dramatic improvement in the standard of living of its industrial workers. Reuther's death came as the labor movement he had done so much to shape was unraveling around him. And one of the many achievements of Nelson Lichtenstein's excellent biography, "The Most Dangerous Man in Detroit," is to show how Reuther's extraordinary life contributed both to the rise of that movement and, unintentionally, to its eventual decline. A professor of history at the University of Virginia and the author of an important earlier book on the C.I.O. during World War II, Mr. Lichtenstein has produced more than a biography. He has given us an elegantly written and unfailingly intelligent portrait of American labor in the mid-20th century. 
 Born in 1907, Reuther grew up in a world that by the time of his death had almost entirely disappeared: a world in which the working class was dominated by European immigrants, a world of socialist politics and an intense working-class consciousness fostered by exclusion and relative powerlessness. Schooled in both socialism and labor activism by his father, a German immigrant ironworker in Wheeling, W.Va., he moved to Detroit in 1927 to find work in the booming auto industry. He soon became a skilled diemaker at Ford's immense River Rouge plant, a well-paid member of the working-class elite. But his "self-improving ambitions," as Mr. Lichtenstein calls them, drew him beyond that insular and relatively privileged environment.
Early in 1933, he and his brother Victor (himself later an important figure in the trade union movement) left Detroit to visit the Soviet Union. They spent nearly two years in Gorky, working in a large auto plant and helping the Russians master their machinery, much of it purchased from Ford. Their time in Gorky coincided with the early Stalinist purges and with a growing disillusionment with Soviet Communism among American socialists. But the Reuther brothers, Mr. Lichtenstein explains, remained enthusiastic about the Soviet "experiment," and they left for the United States in 1935 still talking about "the atmosphere of freedom and security . . . an inspiring contrast to what we know as Ford wage slaves in Detroit." Reuther later became a committed anti-Communist and a harsh critic of the Soviet Union, but his youthful enthusiasms haunted him for the rest of his life.
Back in Detroit, Reuther plunged into the excitingly fluid world of labor organizing. He was committed to the C.I.O. vision of industrial unions -- unions that would unite all the workers of an industry, whatever their skills or tasks, into a single bargaining unit. And like many labor militants of the time, Mr. Lichtenstein says, he worked closely with (although he may never have actually joined) the Communist Party, which was at the center of many of the great organizing drives of the mid-1930's. Reuther's effectiveness in organizing auto workers was critical to the C.I.O.'s success. It also established him as one of the pre-eminent leaders of the new United Automobile Workers union that emerged from the battles.
By the time Reuther became president of the U.A.W. in 1946, the American political landscape had assumed a new and very different shape. The great corporations -- the automobile companies perhaps foremost among them -- had shed their Depression-era images as capitalist predators and assumed fresh ones as the great engines of American victory and prosperity. The newly powerful industrial unions -- of which the U.A.W. was now the most prominent -- were, if not popular, at least well established. And the economy, after a decade of stagnation, was once again a productive dynamo, growing more rapidly than almost anyone had believed possible even a few years earlier.
Reuther saw in the political economy of the postwar years an opportunity for a new era in labor-management relations. Workers and employers had essentially common interests, he argued. A dynamically growing economy with full employment would create more wealth for everyone. "Labor is not fighting for a larger slice of the national pie," he said in 1945, using the ebullient Keynesian language that was beginning to dominate American liberalism. "Labor is fighting for a larger pie."
Conflicts between workers and employers would continue, of course. Indeed, Mr. Lichtenstein reports, Reuther was unusual among postwar labor leaders in his willingness to tolerate, even encourage, strikes. For the most part, however, the stoppages he supported were tactical ones. He was no longer a militant socialist; he was a defender, even a champion, of American capitalism (and one of the principal figures in purging the union movement of its Communist members in the late 1940's). The future, he claimed, lay in collective bargaining and a steadily rising standard of living for all. The U.A.W. was fighting "to make progress with the community and not at the expense of the community."
The symbol of Reuther's brand of postwar unionism was the landmark contract he negotiated with General Motors in 1950. Fortune magazine hailed it as the "Treaty of Detroit," and Reuther himself called it "the most significant development in labor relations since the mass production industries were organized." It accepted the union shop and guaranteed a 20 percent increase in workers' standard of living over five years; that meant not just wage increases, but a built-in cost-of-living allowance. But labor gave up much in return. The G.M. contract, and the many mass production industry agreements it inspired in the following years, cemented corporate control over most basic decisions governing production, investments, pricing and the nature of the workplace. Reuther's youthful vision of a restructured industrial world in which labor would share power with employers had given way to an explicitly Keynesian model of ever-expanding prosperity within an economy whose existing relationships of wealth and power remained essentially unchanged.
For the next 20 years, Mr. Lichtenstein tells us, Reuther worked constantly to improve the terms of the "treaty" but never seriously challenged its essential structure. In 1955, he helped negotiate the merger between the C.I.O., of which he was then president, and the more conservative A.F.L.; the once-profound ideological differences between them now seemed to him less important than their opportunity to work together for a liberal industrial order (although Reuther's bitter personal feud with the A.F.L.-C.I.O. president George Meany so disillusioned him that he took the U.A.W. out of the organization in 1968).
But his greatest crusades after 1950 were the new battles for rights that characterized postwar liberalism. More than any other major labor leader, he immersed himself in the civil rights movement. He spoke fervently of the need to rebuild American cities and address the problems of the inner-city poor. (That was one reason he became so deeply committed to Lyndon Johnson once Johnson launched his War on Poverty; as late as 1968, Reuther still refused to criticize the Vietnam War publicly, even though he was filled with private doubts about its wisdom.) And in the face of vast economic changes that were, by the late 1960's, endangering the future of the labor movement, he struggled to sustain a role for unions. He died, in fact, in the course of an inspection trip to his last major project: a lavish new U.A.W. conference center in northern Michigan, where a new generation of labor leaders would, he hoped, "keep the stars burning brightly in the eyes of the U.A.W. for years ahead."
THAT project was already doomed. Reuther had staked his hopes for labor on the Democratic Party and its ability to mobilize a broad liberal constituency. But by the late 1960's, that constituency -- a fragile one even in the best of times -- was rapidly collapsing along cultural, regional and above all racial lines. It has never recovered.
Reuther understood how dangerous the growing polarization of American life was to his hopes. But he never recognized how inadequate the liberalism he so ardently embraced would prove to be in healing those divisions. There is a distinctly wistful quality in Mr. Lichtenstein's discussion of Reuther's last years -- a suggestion that Reuther had accommodated too easily, had sacrificed too many of his earlier and more radical views. But this gripping book also makes it clear that Reuther never gave up on them entirely. The purpose of a union, he always insisted, was "eternal vigilance and militant resistance." Had he lived to encounter the very different world of the 1970's and 80's, the sclerotic labor movement of those years would likely have found a vigorous challenger.

IMPERFECT PARADISE
By Shen Congwen.
Edited by Jeffrey Kinkley.
Translated by Jeffrey Kinkley, Peter Li, William MacDonald, Caroline Mason and David Pollard.
537 pp. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press. $42.
THIS has been a hard century for China's writers. Dynastic collapse, civil war, Japanese invasion and the insistent pressures of dictatorial one-party governments have formed their political contexts. Their own once-hallowed language, with its rich traditions and endless subtleties, has been subject to constant assault and reconfiguration in the name of accessibility and modernity. Groping for order in the chaos, they have had to adjust their styles to the cadences of ordinary speech, and at the same time to absorb a bewildering mass of new foreign influences and concepts. As the century nears its end, only a handful among them can be clearly seen to have had a creative center so strong that they could overcome these challenges, forging a unified and enduring body of truly rich and original work. Among them is Shen Congwen. 
 Shen was born in the western part of Hunan province in 1902, to a family with military traditions going back several generations. The region in which he grew up was an area of wild rivers, hills and forests, a place where little influence from the newly emerging east coast urban centers had yet penetrated. After a brief stint in a local military academy, Shen was assigned at the age of 15 to a regiment stationed in a Hunan country town; there he performed mainly clerical work.
The regiment's supposed task was to keep the peace and cleanse the surrounding areas of bandits, but military action was sporadic, and Shen had ample time to observe the minutiae of garrison life, as well as the soldiers' responses to the civilians among whom they were stationed. He also noted carefully the rhythms of life of the Tujia and Miao tribal peoples who farmed, fished and hunted in the surrounding countryside. And he read voraciously: not only Chinese traditional and modern works but foreign literature in translation. By 1922, after some years of wandering, he settled in Beijing, determined to be a writer. By 1935 he had already completed 35 volumes of work: short stories, essays, vignettes, novels and transcriptions of Miao songs and rural tales.
Shen is unusual among major 20th-century Chinese writers in his refusal to be political. If politics impinge at all on his work, it is only to set the scene, and the details are always left hazy. What absorbs him, as can be seen so well in this new collection of translations, is human dignity and genuine emotion -- the ways that men and women are capable of responding to each other, and the ways that those responses relate to their culture's past and present.
This is not a naive rustic utopianism, as the book's editor, Jeffrey Kinkley (the leading expert in the West on the work of Shen Congwen and the translator of a number of the entries in this volume), makes clear in his choice of a title, "Imperfect Paradise." Shen's bygone world of western Hunan does look like paradise, and both the tribal peoples and the Han Chinese who live there are often of startling strength and physical beauty, and unsullied by the corruption that seeps across China from the eastern cities. But the inhabitants of this remote countryside are also capable of extraordinary violence and cruelty, and their stoicism can be so blinkered that at times it becomes indistinguishable from stupidity, causing irreparable damage to themselves and to those they most dearly love.
Shen Congwen is an expert on loss. This can be seen in many of his finest stories. "The Husband," for example, is a powerful and absorbing account of a married woman from the country who helps support her family by working in a brothel boat moored on a riverbank outside a market town. Here the loss is apparent in the face and gestures -- even in the cramped and uneasy sleep -- of the woman's husband as he comes on a rare visit to see her, and finds that he too must wait his turn. In "Guisheng," another simple countryman is partly done out of his chance for a lifetime's happiness by the superior wealth of the local elite family, but it is mainly his own gullibility and stubbornness that cause his ruin. "Sansan" features one of the most lyrically etched adolescent girls in Shen's fiction, a heroine who endures a double loss -- of her work in a mill, with its tranquil pond, and of the imagined love of an ailing man from the city. In "The Vegetable Garden," a widowed mother who has created her own ordered world through hard work and skill sees her only son snatched away by an incomprehensible act of official violence.
There is no doubt that Shen is a man who loves women, and he describes them in many ages, moods and modes. Their worlds of strength and dignity are most effectively contrasted with those of the men around them in the group of stories that draw on Shen's army and garrison-town experience. Especially in "Staff Adviser," written in 1935, he shows absolute mastery in contrasting the fleshly greed of the title character (as he gleefully gobbles down his noontime meal of stewed bull penis, cabbage soup and Scotch whisky) with the largely unseen world of the man's pregnant wife and child. This story, along with "My Education," written in 1929, gives perhaps the best descriptions extant of garrison and warlord life in China. In "The Company Commander," written in 1927 at the beginning of Shen's greatest creative decade and translated here with the skill and sensitivity shown throughout the collection, the military world is drawn together into the world of loss -- "passive, helpless, possessive" -- with an extraordinary economy and freshness.
At one point in the story, yielding to the entreaties of his mistress, an officer reluctantly remains with her through a snow-filled evening rather than return to camp:
"Deprived of drink, the company commander regarded the outline of the woman, now turned away from him, by the light of the faint blue flames of the brazier beside him; he still uttered no word. Then out of boredom he swept together the husks of the peanuts and chestnuts on his lap, on the table and from beside the brazier and strewed them on top of the burning charcoal. First they smoked and crackled, then burst all together into roaring flames. In this blaze the company commander could see that the woman's face was streaked with tears. Nodding his head, close shaven in army style, he said husk ily he would obey her order and not go back to the barracks."
As any fine writer must, Shen experimented by describing situations and moods that were outside his ordinary realm. It is to Mr. Kinkley's credit that he includes stories that are not always successful but show Shen's varied attempts to move beyond the depictions of rural, tribal and army life for which he was best known. These include "Quiet," which tracks the thoughts of a teen-age girl, a refugee in the countryside, as she looks after her little nephew and waits for her father to come back to her; "The Housewife" and "Gazing at Rainbows," which depict the anomie of an uneasy marriage and the varied worlds of erotic stimulation within a relationship; and several stories that in different ways illuminate or parody the mental and sensual worlds of university professors, whose ranks Shen himself eventually joined as a teacher of literature.
IN the 1935 story "Big Ruan and Little Ruan," Shen is overtly satirical as he sketches the school days and subsequent careers of two young men in republican China. Each joins one of the two groups into which the schoolboys have divided themselves, the Gentleman's Society and the Cudgel Club; these titles and the values they express stay with the young men as one becomes an amoral bounder, the other an amoral political activist. This is one of the few Shen Congwen stories that deal with political issues, and Little Ruan is perhaps one of the least sympathetic radicals in the 20th-century literature of any country. Cadging money from his landlord father so he can pay the rent on his garret, planning to "strike down this, abolish that," Little Ruan "ridiculed conservatism and sneered at compromise, so the life style from his days at school and in Shanghai continued developing in the new environment." But when Big Ruan hears indirectly that Little Ruan has starved to death in prison after a hunger strike, Shen joins with Big Ruan in an uncharacteristic reflection:
"He was very happy, and that was enough. In these strange times, many people looking for happiness fall down in silence and are gone forever. Others, among the living, tend to think that they live happily and that raising a family and being successful in everything makes them the backbone of society -- indispensable to it. Especially those like Big Ruan."
Shen wrote little fiction after the Japanese invasion of 1937, and though he stayed on in China under the Communists, he ceased fiction writing altogether. After enduring many "struggle sessions" on the ground that he was a "pro-bourgeois" writer, as well as a period of "thought reform" and an attempt at suicide, Shen found a kind of release by working in the Palace Museum in Beijing. Before his death in 1988, he wrote a distinguished history of Chinese textile design through the ages and a careful study of archaic bronze mirrors. These scholarly works have their virtues, but it is for the mirror that he held up to his own youthful world that Shen Congwen will be remembered.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In an account of Vice President Gore's visit to our Union Building Trades Program in South Africa (news article, Dec. 7), you state this is a joint project of our union and South African construction companies. 
 While it would be desirable to have support from the South African building industry, the project has been a union-to-union effort of our union with the black construction unions.
South Africa needs a new social compact for its construction industry. No longer can a training program be dominated by white employers. To be successful, labor-management programs require two partners. Our support has come from grants of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s African American Labor Center and the United States Agency for International Development.
We hope by the time we leave South Africa, there will indeed be a joint project of the black South African unions and construction companies.

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
The children at P. S. 27 in the Bronx must share their math books one for every two students. When a class ends, the books are collected and sent down the hall where another class is waiting. Are spending cuts to blame for this shortage?
Hardly. From 1980 to 1993, spending on New York City public schools increased 148 percent, even though the number of students increased only 3 percent. Even after taking inflation into account, New York City spent 37 percent more per pupil in 1993 than in 1980. 
 Where did the money go? The State Education Department's data provide the answer. (The data are available only through 1993.)
Each year, a decreasing share went into regular classrooms to pay for computers, textbooks, lab equipment and teachers, while an increasing share went to central administration and special education. Spending on central administration increased almost five times as fast as spending for regular classroom teaching.
Too much money went for bureaucrats, not books; administrators, not educators; red tape, not learning aids.
The problem is not merely citywide, it is statewide: From 1980 to 1993, school enrollment in the state declined by 9 percent but spending shot up by 142 percent. School districts spent more and more and taxed local residents to pay for these outlays. Even after adjusting for inflation, spending per pupil increased 48 percent, yet many teachers are so exasperated by the lack of resources that they reach into their own pockets to pay for classroom supplies.
That's why local boards of education should be required to publish report cards on every school. The cards should tell how much is spent on each pupil, how much spending has increased and whether it has resulted in better student performance on standardized tests.
Such tests are not a perfectly fair and complete measure of performance, but still they will help parents evaluate how their child's school stacks up and whether the dollars are making it to the classroom.
School report cards would help create a groundswell of support for education reform, especially in schools like P. S. 27. Students there do so poorly on reading and math exams that it has been on the list of failing schools since 1989. That's six years -- half a child's time in public school. Yet even the committed parents who are classroom volunteers at P. S. 27 said they had not heard that it was on the failing list. That's why they need report cards.
State government is doing its part. Our administration reduced mid- and upper-level management costs in the State Education Department by 19 percent last year so that more money would be spent in classrooms, not government offices. We're proposing further management savings in this year's budget.
The Regents recommend that school districts that hold down bureaucratic costs be rewarded with additional state aid. Our administration's new budget does just that.
For more than a decade, school spending in New York State doubled while the number of students declined. School enrollment is on the upswing again. We face a formidable challenge: improving schools for an increasing number of students while controlling costs.
Education is 30 percent of New York State's budget. It is 100 percent of New York State's future.
Parents, taxpayers and teachers need to work together to hold school boards and elected officials accountable for spending so that the scarce education dollars are used wisely to give every child a chance in life.

From Tourists, A Timely Gift Of Perspective

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
THE time is Sunday morning, the place is a cold and windy Battery Park, the players are tourists who came to catch a ferry to the Statue of Liberty or Ellis Island. They couldn't, because parts of the Federal Government were shut down again, and they were disappointed. But they were not all that upset about it. This is New York, after all. As 14-year-old Awenlue Kante of Oregon put it: "In Portland, there is only one place to go, and that's the mall. There's always something to do here."
That there is. And there is always something happening. Too much, lately, a lot of it bad. In one week alone, eight people died in one racially tinged attack in Harlem, a woman was pushed in front of a subway train, the subway clerk whose token booth had been torched died and two police officers were shot. Enough to make the term New Yorker seem more like an accusation than a proper noun. 
 But New York is more than the sum of its tragedies, headlines and tabloid television sound bites. It is easy to forget that. Unless you speak to a few of the tourists who are crowding the city's hotels this holiday season, and have more perspective on New York than some New Yorkers. "Where we come from," explained Tori Lyle of Baton Rouge, La., "crime is worse per capita than it is up here."
Her husband, Kevin, drew a distinction: "Ours is good old-fashioned murder. There's no political agenda behind it."
It is something of a revelation to listen to outsiders describe their perceptions of New York. They see only a narrow slice of the city. But is their view any more limited in its way than the city that millions of New Yorkers see in their daily lives? It's the old story -- the media focus on the most outrageous things that happen because they should. By definition, the exceptional is news. But that does not mean that shopping on West 125th Street or traveling by subway is dangerous. Actually, it means it is not.
"My sister told me not to ride the subways, but I am," said Tina Kastner, who was here from Michigan. Warnings about crime, and the tragedy in Harlem, have not intimidated her, said Ms. Kastner, who works for a lumber company. "Not when you live in Detroit. You've just got to be on your guard."
MOST of the visitors knew about the incident 10 days ago in Harlem -- when Freddy's clothing store was destroyed in a fiery attack that took eight lives. But most felt distant from it and from Harlem. Not so Basko Kante and his four daughters. Mr. Kante lives in Portland now, but comes from Ghana, and all of the Kantes were planning a trip to Harlem.
Mr. Kante, an auditor with Oregon's Public Utility Commission in Portland, said he's "a little antsy" now about going to Harlem, but will go anyway, and does not think that what happened at Freddy's is representative of New York. He blames economic disparities and the pressures of the holiday season, and over all, finds New York to be a "peaceful," rather efficient place.
"New York City is very well organized," he said. "For what is it -- $1.50? -- I came all the way from our hotel in Queens down here on the subway. It's really very well organized."
His 18-year-old daughter, Wentirim, just back from studying in Ghana, added that she found quite a contrast between the city and its image: "On TV it looks so dirty, you see homeless people. But you come, you don't see that. We have the same thing with Africa. It looks so different when you go there. It's how the media portray it."
Shirley Turley of Dallas, who works in her husband's law firm, agrees: "People only know what they hear on the news, so they're afraid, but it's not true." Ms. Turley, her husband, Wendell, and granddaughter Lacey Stutz, tried to get to Lady Liberty three times on this visit and failed, either because of fog or the standoff in Washington. But they did get to Radio City, the Museum of Natural History, Rockefeller Center and (for Lacey) FAO Schwarz.
Nieves Perez of Spain, here with two friends, hit some of the same spots, along with Little Italy, Wall Street, Chinatown and Fifth Avenue. Ms. Perez, studying and working for a while in Minneapolis, is stunned and delighted by one aspect of New York that the city considers its greatest strength, but that others -- especially with the rise of suburban Republican politics -- consider its greatest weakness: "There is an amazing contrast of races here," Ms. Perez said. "Nobody cares who you are, where you come from. I like that. Everybody accepts the way you are. In Spain, everybody is the same."
She and her two friends won't get to the Statue of Liberty on this visit. But a trip on the Staten Island Ferry was a decent substitute. Which proves, perhaps, that while the Federal Government has done plenty of things to hurt New York City, closing down isn't necessarily one of them.

HEADLINE: Trade Surplus Falls in Japan

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, Dec. 18

 BODY:
 Japan's trade surplus with the United States marked its biggest decline in five and a half years in November, thanks to falling auto exports and rising imports of computers, airplanes and semiconductors, the Finance Ministry said today.
Japan's trade gap with the United States fell 45.2 percent from a year earlier, to $2.82 billion, the sixth straight decline. 
 Japan's global trade surplus fell for a fifth month, declining 23 percent from a year earlier, to $6.578 billion, the ministry said. Economists had predicted, however, that the decrease would be larger.
The last time Japan's overall trade gap shrank for at least five months in a row was in 1991.
Rising imports over the last year, particularly of computer-related products, have helped rein in the surplus. But import growth is starting to slow, suggesting that Japan's trade gap will not continue to shrink at the current pace.

Gunman's Ardent Credo: Black Self-Sufficiency

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
On May 26, 1967, Roland J. Smith Jr. stood before Judge Alfred L. Luongo in Federal District Court in Philadelphia. Mr. Smith was 23 years old, a hard-luck car thief and self-taught ideologue who called himself a laborer. He made his argument with an inalterable simplicity.
As a black man, Mr. Smith told the judge, he considered himself a "subject" of the United States and not a citizen, and thus he refused to be inducted to fight in the Vietnam War. 
 "I owe no legal, no national, no moral obligation, nor do I desire to serve in the armed forces of the enslavers of my forebears," Mr. Smith said.
The judge listened and asked if Mr. Smith believed "a great deal of injustice" had been done to blacks in America. Mr. Smith said he did.
"And you feel, then," the judge said, "that the way to combat it is to refuse to accede to the rules and regulations laid down by the society that has been unfair to you -- and that is your philosophy?"
Mr. Smith answered, "I respect the laws of the country and I abide by them if it is at all possible."
Moments later, the judge ended the hearing this way:
"You are still a young man. I hope that somewhere along the line you will see a different kind of light. You certainly have seen a light up to now, whatever that light may be and wherever it comes from; you have some principles. I can only say to you that if you adhere to those principles, life ahead is going to be rocky."
The unfortunate life forecast for Mr. Smith was realized in full, and it ended Dec. 8 in an act of numbing violence.
Mr. Smith, who had protested regularly outside Freddy's clothing store in Harlem, opposing the Jewish owner's eviction of a black subtenant, walked into the store on 125th Street and opened fire with a .38-caliber revolver. Police say he then set the store ablaze and turned the gun on himself. Eight people lay dead in the ruins, seven of them workers at Freddy's.
Mr. Smith's brutal end concluded a life his sister said was lived "outside the system." It was an existence of study and incarceration, modest jobs, protest and pamphleteering. It was a life steeped in perceived victimization and deep distrust, in conspiracy theories, poetry and lots of anger. To some, he was "intense," to others "spiritual," to others "odd and someone to watch out for."
"He always had what I think of as a broken warrior's heart," said Otis Anthony, the former senior adviser to Mayor Sandy Freedman of Tampa, who knew Mr. Smith years ago when he lived in Florida. Mr. Anthony said he thought Mr. Smith might have embarked on the arson attack as one in "a long line of people who thought it was up to them to stop talking, stop begging and start acting, even if that was out of some twisted sense of what a real revolutionary act is."
"It was an act of insanity for all of us looking in on it," Mr. Anthony said. "But I'm 98 percent sure he didn't view it as an act of criminality, but as a strange act of suicide against an institutional force, based on what I knew of him dating back to the early 70's when we all had romantic and adventurous ideas about our role and struggle."
The police, saying they know little about Mr. Smith's life or beliefs, offer a starker perspective on the crime. According to one senior investigator, Mr. Smith is regarded as having been one of the "hard-core" vendors who tried to defy the city's 1994 effort to move the street peddlers off 125th Street.
A wide-ranging criminal investigation of the assault has begun, and investigators are looking into whether Mr. Smith had any history of mental problems. The criminal investigation will examine whether Mr. Smith had accomplices and how much the heated words of the Rev. Al Sharpton and Morris Powell fueled his embrace of destruction.
The investigator said there was "absolutely no doubt" that Mr. Smith was well known to Mr. Powell, the vendors' confrontational leader with the criminal past and taste for racist language, and that Mr. Smith's action was an outgrowth of the anti-Semitic atmosphere that prevailed among the protesters outside Freddy's.
 
Rough Beginnings
A Mother Dead, A Father Departed
Mr. Smith was born in Harlem in 1944, the second of the three children of Roland J. Smith Sr. and his wife, Satronia Nottingham. Mr. Smith's sister, Abiona Adadevoh, said that their mother died as a result of complications during an abortion and that her brother, then 3 years old, "cried for two years afterward." Their father, she said, managed a bar in Harlem and later became an advance man for the Royal American Show, a traveling carnival.
The single son in what his sister called a "broken home," Mr. Smith moved between Harlem and Philadelphia, attending Public School 186 in Manhattan and then Barry Elementary School and Shoemaker Junior High School in Philadelphia. He enrolled in, but apparently never attended, Overbrook High School in Philadelphia. Court records show Mr. Smith lived with aunts and uncles, and was kicked out once for failing to pay his share of the rent.
Mr. Smith was 13 when he was first arrested, and within several years he had been charged with multiple car thefts, inciting to riot and receiving stolen goods. He served two stints at the House of Corrections in Philadelphia, and in 1966 the police found him in an apartment with a .38-caliber revolver, a machete, a dagger, a bayonet and a hatchet.
But Mr. Smith's seminal moment in court came on what he said was a question of conscience. He said that he would not "vilify his race" by submitting to the draft, and that he was involved in "man's just struggle" to "control their own destiny."
"All of these principles are morally just and shared by all normal people and should always be solidly defended," Mr. Smith said.
Judge Luongo asked, "Is this an expression of your own philosophy, Mr. Smith, or is this something that has been instilled in you by others?"
"This is the way I view history," Mr. Smith answered. "It is the onliest conclusion I can come to."
Mr. Smith was sentenced to four years in a Federal prison. He served two years at a medium-security complex in Danbury, Conn., and was released in 1969 to a halfway house in New York City.
 
The Florida Years
An Advocate Is Shaped
 Mr. Smith, who moved from Harlem to live with his sister in Tampa in 1974, arrived "with a strong Afro-nationalistic background," according to friends in Florida. He had read dozens of history books, and was dedicated to the ideology of Marcus Garvey, the advocate of black economic independence and racial separatism. His beliefs struck a chord, and Mr. Smith became a quiet political presence in West Tampa, the largely black section of the city dominated by public housing.
"He seemed studious, very concerned about the overall conditions of the community," Askia Aquil, Imam for the Believers Mosque in St. Petersburg, said of Mr. Smith. "He was the type of person who would encourage people to get involved."
Mr. Smith's political participation included unremarkable contributions -- people remember him helping set up chairs for a Martin Luther King Jr. tribute, for instance -- as well as greater efforts. He distributed his own newsletter, and he became affiliated with the Black Organization Project, an advocacy organization concerned with substandard housing and empowerment of parents and students in the public schools.
He is consistently described by Tampa acquaintances as an introspective, reserved man who could go a year after meeting someone before trusting him enough to talk freely. His sister, who said Mr. Smith was a mentor to her son and many of the neighborhood's young people, said he moved about their apartment "like a spirit."
He is also recalled as a hard-working self-employed laborer who ran his own multipurpose handyman operation. He was a mover, a furniture repairman, a manual laborer. "The original Sanford and Son," his sister said.
"He was the hardest-working person I have ever met, and no work was beneath him," said Robert Gilder, the former president of Tampa's chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. "If you said you needed a tree cut down, he'd ask where the ax was. If you said, I need the sprinkler system put in, he'd get the shovel."
But Mr. Smith always had his flashpoint.
"The only time he would get angry is when you started talking about racism," said James L. Pettiford, a former journalist who is now director of human relations for the city of High Point, N.C. "That would bring up the fire from within."
That fire was often ignited by the topics of police brutality and the lack of black economic power. Mr. Gilder said Mr. Smith resented the Iranian immigrants who had come to own many of the grocery stores and gas stations in West Tampa. Mr. Gilder said that Mr. Smith believed the owners refused to hire black applicants for meaningful jobs.
"Roland was a poor man, but he was always a very proud man," Mr. Gilder said.
That pride was most likely at the heart of Mr. Smith's 1989 encounter with the Tampa police. Stopped at a checkpoint and asked for his driver's license, according to the police account, Mr. Smith did not have a license and tried to burn an officer with his cigarette. A brawl ensued. Ms. Adadevoh, however, insisted that the police set upon and "hog-tied" her brother.
"The extent to which he resisted us was unbelievable," said Officer Mickey Mashburn, one of the officers on the scene. "He tried to get one of the police officer's guns. He said he was going to kill us, or that we would have to kill him. It didn't make any sense."
At Mr. Smith's trial, his character witnesses included the president of Hillsborough Community College, who is Jewish. Mr. Smith was convicted in a nonjury trial and sentenced to 18 months' probation and 50 hours of community service.
In July 1991, Mr. Smith, $20 behind on his court supervision payments, told his probation officer, Susan Stumpf, that "it was too much to expect a poor man to work and do all that community service," and walked out. In violation of his probation, he left for Harlem.
 
Back to Harlem
A Cause, And a Meltdown
Mr. Smith, who had traveled to Africa and Haiti, ultimately changed his name to Abugunde Mulocko. His sister said it translated as "one who searches for the truth."
Mr. Smith and his sister had traveled to Harlem from Tampa frequently over the years and sold their wares in the eclectic, often electric world of the 125th Street vendors. Mr. Smith made African jewelry and sold rare books; Ms. Adadevoh sold African dolls.
Back in Harlem in 1991, he saw the growing confrontation between the vendors and the store owners and police as an emblematic struggle for blacks to retain their marginal economic strength. Ms. Adadevoh said he firmly believed that the vast majority of Harlem stores and buildings were owned by whites. And for Mr. Smith, the particular plight of the black-owned Record Shack crystallized the inequity.
"The vendors had made Harlem rise again from a ghost town," Ms. Adadevoh said. "We were not selling drugs or stealing. The only dignity we had was the vendors."
In October 1994, Mr. Smith was arrested and charged with aggravated harassment as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani enforced his relocation of the vendors. Morris Powell consequently organized sporadic protests on 125th Street to rail against individual white-owned or Asian-owned businesses. Mr. Smith -- termed an industrious "pioneer" by some vendors, dangerously unbalanced by others -- was a regular in those protests.
"I used to see him all the time," said a vendor who used to sell clothes next to Mr. Smith. The vendor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Smith often ordered white tourists in Harlem to stay away from his table. "Everything to him was a conspiracy against black people. It was always, 'Cracker this, cracker that.' He would say, 'These crackers come through our town looking at us as if we were caged animals.' "
With his arrest, Mr. Smith's mood appears to have darkened badly. His sister said that he feared that the revitalization of Times Square would send the pornography industry to 125th Street, and that he had recently sent his belongings back to Tampa. Late last month, the Bronx apartment Mr. Smith lived in burned.
Police officials said they believed that Mr. Smith spent most of his final two weeks living in one of the city's emergency shelters. So far, they have been unable to trace the gun he used.
Mr. Powell insisted last week that he knew Mr. Smith only from seeing him and talking with him on the street over the last several years, and that he last saw him Dec. 5 outside Freddy's. But Walter Wells, who shopped at Freddy's on Thursday, said Mr. Smith called him an Uncle Tom and spit at his companion.
Despite the initial findings of the police, Ms. Adadevoh said she has many questions about what actually took place inside Freddy's on Dec. 8, chiefly whether her brother killed himself or was shot by someone else. If the police are right, she said she could only interpret it as the work of a person who had for so long perceived himself a victim that he at last "had his spirit crushed."
"Everything that means something to you is taken from you," she said in summarizing her brother's life. "No one ever listened to him. He may have been sick and tired of being sick and tired. He reached the breaking point in his beliefs. He always said he'd never be happy in America."

HEADLINE: A New Grinch Turns Up at the Mall

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: WESTLAND, Mich., Dec. 15

 BODY:
For all the commotion and clatter that surrounds holiday shopping, one sound has traditionally symbolized the compassion and generosity of the season: the peal of the Salvation Army bell. But now an increasing number of malls and stores around the nation are banishing the charity's bell ringers and donation kettles, part of a strategy to keep unions out.
These retail establishments, including Sears, Toys 'R' Us, Super Kmart Centers and hundreds of shopping malls, say that granting access to charities might require them to do the same for union organizers. 
 Officials with the Salvation Army have expressed alarm at the trend, saying that the holiday kettle drives collect about $65 million nationwide, about a quarter of the organization's annual budget, which goes largely to aid the poor.
"It's a problem that's getting worse all the time," said Col. William Peck, an official with the Salvation Army in Detroit. "Without exception, they throw us out with apologies, telling us they love us and so on. But in the meantime, we've got people who are out of work, facing poverty, maybe in need of substance-abuse help, who are doing without because of this policy."
The retailers began evicting the Salvation Army and other charities after a 1992 Supreme Court ruling, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, that strengthened the hand of private property owners in keeping union organizers at bay. The ruling, which involved the Lechmere store chain, owned by Montgomery Ward, made no mention of the Salvation Army, but noted that a retailer could not discriminate against unions in its policy on letting in outside groups.
"It's a Trojan horse issue," said Keith McCown, a lawyer with the Boston firm of Morgan, Brown & Joy, which argued the case for the company. "If a company lets a Salvation Army bell ringer in for three weeks, the union might come back next June and say, 'We want access, too.' "
But Dave Parker, a spokesman for the National Labor Relations Board, which rules on disputes between unions and companies, said the retailers were overreacting.
"The N.L.R.B. has never, never found unlawful an employer's refusal to grant access to a union solely because it has granted access to the Salvation Army," Mr. Parker said.
He noted that an N.L.R.B. case in 1982 said an employer did not violate labor law by permitting "a small number of isolated beneficent acts" as narrow exceptions to the non-discrimination rule.
But retailers say such wording does not define what constitutes a small number. And they point out that the N.L.R.B. has ruled against companies who gave access to several different charitable and civic groups, while keeping out unions.
Representative Peter Hoekstra, Republican of Michigan, has proposed a bill that would protect companies who grant access to charities from union claims of discrimination.
Some stores, including the Super Kmart Centers, say they have found ways to give to the Salvation Army, even as they banned the bell ringers. Mary Lorencz, a Kmart spokeswoman, said $170,000 in proceeds from the the sale of poinsettias had been donated to the Salvation Army.
The reason that bell ringers are allowed at the regular Kmart stores, but not at its 87 Super Center stores, is that the latter has full-service groceries. The United Food and Commercial Workers has had success in organizing food stores, while retail stores are generally not unionized.
John Hiatt, a lawyer for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., noted that none of this would be a problem if retailers were not so fearful of their employees talking to labor organizers.
Here in Michigan, where unions are relatively strong, retailers have been especially vigilant about keeping labor organizers at bay. If that means excluding the Salvation Army, they are willing to do so.
Rob Stuart, a spokesman for Compass Retail, an Atlanta-based company that manages the Westland Mall here and shopping centers in more than 20 states, said the policy had come about when union members tried to pass out leaflets to shoppers about the Detroit newspaper strike.
He said the company's lawyers had advised the mall that it had to turn away the Salvation Army if it wanted to keep union activities out.
He said the move had not been received well by the public. "It's been a real black eye for us," said Mr. Stuart, who said the company had made contributions to the Salvation Army. "We've gotten about 50 angry phone calls and some letters."
Some people, including one woman who works there, have sworn that they will no longer shop at the mall.
Dorothy Mitchell, a secretary, said she could not fathom the decision. "It's just awful," she said. "Don't they know what Christmas is about?"
Harold Bell, a bus driver, said the union issue might be only part of the reason behind the mall's decision to banish the Salvation Army. "I think a lot of people don't want to be bothered by thoughts of poor people," he said. "They're out shopping, buying nice things, and it's a downer to think about some kid who doesn't have shoes."
Since the anchor stores at the Westland Mall are privately owned, they are free to invite a Salvation Army bell ringer. One of them, the Hudson's store, did just that. But only some of the shoppers at the mall pass by the store.
Outside the entrance door, the Salvation Army bell ringer, Sandra Beasley, thanked shoppers for plunking coins and bills into her kettle, telling them how grateful the needy beneficiaries would be.
It is something she knows well. Ms. Beasley, a 26-year-old divorced mother who does not have a job, was being helped by the Salvation Army in return for her work. The oldest of her four children is 6, and it will be a lean Christmas.
"My daughter, the only thing she wants for Christmas is that doll that eats and wets, but it costs like $40, so there's no way I can get it for her," Ms. Beasley said. "These people who make these big decisions at the malls, they don't have no idea what that's like."

HEADLINE: To G.I.'s, Disputed Corridor Will Test Path to Peace

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: BRKA, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Ferid Pamukcic bought a large American flag this morning, and he plans to hang it on the wall of a paneled, low-ceiling bar he has just finished behind his Caffe King.
Mr. Pamukcic started building the hideaway, which has colored spotlights on the wall, well before he knew the Americans would be coming, and while he expects them to patronize his bar, he harbors a hope for something more. 
 "We want them to help us get back what we lost," said Mr. Pamukcic, a Bosnian Muslim.
What the Bosnian Muslims lost to the Serbs, after some of the fiercest fighting of the early days of the war, in April 1992, was the town of Brcko. It is only six miles from here and was the seat of government for this village and the place where many of the village's residents worked and shopped. The Serbs seized the Posavina corridor, which is three miles at its narrowest point and is within the county of Brcko, as is this village.
The Bosnian Serbs have insisted that the town of Brcko remain under their control. As for the corridor, which links Serbian-held territory in western Bosnia with land held by Serbs in the east and with Serbia itself, they want it widened to 12 miles to allow aircraft to fly through.
Thus, this bitterly contested county will present the American troops, who are expected to have a post near this village, with what is likely to be their most sensitive, potentially dangerous and challenging assignment. While the Americans in the NATO-led peacekeeping operation will patrol the confrontation line on this side of the corridor, Russian troops will patrol on the Serbian side of the line.
The difficulty in resolving the struggle for control over the area was underscored at the peace talks in Ohio last month, when the Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-led Bosnian Government could not reach an agreement on the status of Brcko or the width of the corridor, leaving it to an international arbitration panel to seek a resolution. The Bosnian Government essentially wanted the corridor to be eliminated so it could gain access to the Sava River at Brcko.
But the Deputy Mayor of Brcko County before the war, Munib Jusufovic, who is now Mayor of the roughly 65 percent of the county under control of the Bosnian Government, says he thinks that the panel will not be necessary.
"It will be easier to find a solution now than at Dayton," he said. "I'm optimistic."
Asked about the reason for his optimism after nearly four years of war, he said: "Because we've had enough of this war. Too many people have been killed on both sides."
With a year of peace that the American troops will insure during their deployment in Bosnia, Mr. Jusufovic said, communications between officials on both sides will be opened, as will the natural economic links between the divided county.
"We were enemies until now, but we can be business partners," Mr. Jusufovic said.
Most of the industry is in the city of Brcko -- a slaughterhouse, textile factory and automobile battery plant -- but many of the 20,000 workers there lived in the surrounding villages, which also provided food for the city.
Mr. Jusufovic said that since the peace talks in Dayton in November, there have been contacts between lower-level Serbian officials in the town of Brcko and his office. And the Serbian Mayor in Brcko, Miodrag Pajic, is one of his best friends, he added.
Both men are lawyers who worked together for 15 years in a cooking oil company, and served together as mayor and deputy mayor of the county before the war.
"We were very good friends," Mr. Jusufovic said. "In his house, I would feel as if I were in my house."
Although the two men have not talked since the war broke out, Mr. Jusufovic said they would probably meet soon after Christmas.
Mr. Jusufovic does not argue that Brcko should be controlled by the Bosnian Government. Rather, he wants it to be an "open city," with three sectors -- one controlled by the Bosnian Muslims, another by the Serbs and the third by Croats. The Serbs rejected this at Dayton. Before the war, Brcko's population of 90,000 was 45 percent Muslim, 25 percent Croatian and 20 percent Serbian, with a mixture of other nationalities.
Mr. Jusufovic said he is confident that the international arbitration panel would rule in his favor, and that it would not enlarge the corridor.
If not? "Then we'll take Brcko."
But he said there would be no war while the Americans are here. "We'll respect them," he said.
His sentiments were echoed by residents of Brka, a poor agricultural village rendered even more dreary by the war and now by snow blackened by soot. On a building at the corner of the T-junction where the village's only paved roads meet, one arrow painted on the boarded-up window points in the direction of Tuzla, while a sign on the other side points to the "war front." A piece of paper stuck to the board announced a chess tournament today, in which the winner would receive 100 German marks.
Across the slushy street, standing at a table where she was selling an array of plastic pails, pitchers and clothes pins on a cold gray day, Ferida Mulamujic said she was happy that there would be no more shooting, but she was not satisfied with the peace agreement. "Brcko was always part of Bosnia," she said. "They took it away from us."
Before the war, she had a job only 4 miles and a 20-minute bus ride away. But only a few hundred yards away, a Serbian checkpoint bars Muslims in Brka from traveling any farther.
Asked about the possibility that the international arbitration committee might give Brka to the Serbs, she said, "I don't think the Bosnian Army will let that happen."

HEADLINE: U.S. and Mexico Try to Halt Nafta Provision on Trucking

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
American and Mexican officials continued negotiating today in search of a way to delay the implementation of a central provision of the North American Free Trade Agreement that would allow trucks from Mexico to travel freely in American border states starting this week.
While the border technically opens to wider trade on Monday, firms on both sides have to register their trucks with American or Mexican authorities before they can freely go beyond the current limit of 26 miles beyond the border. That gives negotiators a number of days to complete the delicate negotiations, which are politically sensitive in both countries. 
 Administration officials have expressed fear that the trucks, many of which do not meet safety standards, could cause severe accidents and become a conduit for illegal trade in drugs. The Mexican Government is concerned about a mirror-image provision of the agreement that will allow American-owned delivery trucks to go deep into Mexico, competing with Mexican companies.
In Washington, the Teamsters Union has sought to delay the border opening, and a court hearing on an injunction they seek is scheduled for Monday. In Mexico, officials are trying to find a way to change the accord, which Mexico passed as a formal treaty, without opening up other provisions of Nafta that are now unpopular among Mexican businesses, which are suffering from a deep national recession.
For both countries, a decision to delay the wider opening of the border would represent a sharp backing away from a symbolically important part of Nafta. But President Clinton's advisers say they fear that a spill of toxic materials from Mexican trucks in the United States, or a severe accident, would be both tragic and a political liability.
"We're not at an agreement yet, but we are getting there," a senior Administration official said today.

HEADLINE: A Church Opens Its Heart For a Fragile Community

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Sylvia Romera and her two children, ages 4 and 6, stood patiently outside the First African Methodist Episcopal Church on a chilly night, hopeful that when the sun rose they would receive all the fixings for a plentiful Christmas dinner, some new clothes, and, just as important, presents.
"Last year, I didn't have any toys for the kids," said Ms. Romera as her son, Hyunjin, 4, clung to her side, trying to absorb a bit of his mother's warmth. "I went to a different place and they said I had come too late." 
 By 10:30 P.M. on Friday, despite cold winds, families were lining up outside the First A.M.E. Church on the edge of South-Central Los Angeles, awaiting Saturday's annual giveaway of Christmas toys, food and clothing.
Ms. Romera, like many of the those in line, said she held a full-time job. But on her $1,000 monthly salary, Ms. Romera could not save up for Christmas shopping.
First A.M.E., one of the city's largest black churches, moved from downtown to South-Central, a once-prosperous area, in 1968. During the 1992 riots after the beating of Rodney G. King, it served as a neighborhood refuge. People flocked to the church to sleep and find solace. Known as "the house on the hill," the church remained safe from the orange wall of flames nearby.
Mention South-Central to many of the Angelenos who live in surrounding communities, and images of riots, poverty and crime are all that come to their minds.
"South-Central is part of a stereo-type. People don't take a look," said Lois Wood, a church member and volunteer, as she filled bags with celery, bell peppers, potatoes and onions in the church recreation hall.
But a look inside the church reveals a dedication and commitment by many in the community to help rebuild lives in South-Central. Even before the riots, many in the area counted on the church's support.
Elizabeth Burgess, who gained the first spot in line by arriving at 10:30 A.M. on Friday, has been coming to the church at Christmas for 11 years. Her job as a telemarketer is not enough to insure a merry Christmas.
"I have nine kids, and I just want to make sure I get nine presents," she said while huddling in the back of a van with three friends and a box full of chips, pretzels and cookies.
As the night wore on, an urban campsite sprouted outside the church. An abandoned shopping cart cradled a mini-barbecue where Ms. Burgess warmed a teapot. Others hauled in lawn chairs and laid out blankets. And children slept in cars parked nearby.
By 7 Saturday morning, more than 600 sleepy parents clutching babies and strollers had picked up a number; by the afternoon, 1,500 turkeys had been eagerly hauled off by as many families.
Since 1992, the church's outspoken and charismatic leader, the Rev. Cecil L. Murray, has gained the attention of politicians, movie moguls and corporations, and they are helping to bring vitally needed jobs and investment to the economically depressed area.
"Out of the negative of the burning came the positive of the yearning," Mr. Murray recites in a honey-coated baritone, as if in the middle of a sermon. "The challenge is to raise the awareness so that Christmas is not just Dec. 25."
Every month, the church provides food and clothing for up to 800 families, but, as most charitable organizations find, the donations do not start pouring in until the holidays. In addition to $35,000 worth of food donated for this holiday, the Bandi Corporation donated 14,000 Mighty Morphin Power Rangers -- filling 17 tractor-trailer trucks -- earlier in the year. The toys were shared with other groups in South-Central and neighboring areas.
The night before the giveaway, church volunteers worked from dawn until past 10 P.M., filling more than 3,000 grocery bags with boxes of stuffing, canned yams, corn, beans and other holiday foods.
They laughed with lighthearted ease, working in the same room where many of them had prayed and held hands as they had anxiously watched the verdicts in the Rodney King and O. J. Simpson trials on a big-screen television.
By 9 Saturday morning, the Romera family had finally made it through the winding line. Ms. Romera's 6-year old daughter, Hyuhi, clutched a Wedding Barbie, and her son, a smile filling his small face, barely managed to wrap his arms around a brightly colored box of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.
Since the riots, the church has seen a surge in interest from corporations willing to help the area. Mr. Murray said he was sorry that it had taken a terrible event like the riots -- or the uprising, as church members call it -- to begin drawing such interest. But he and many church members said they were nonetheless thankful.
"The fires have died out, and the fumes are no longer detectable," Mr. Murray said. "We hope we will have more positive outreach that won't require trauma to inspire."

HEADLINE: Getting Personal and Global in Farm Broadcasting

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
Back in 1956, when Orion Samuelson first thought he hit the big time as a farm broadcaster for a television station in Green Bay, Wis., the high points of his year were trips in the company's painted station wagon to the 4-H and livestock conventions in Chicago and to the state fair.
Daily programming was mainly wire service reports, local livestock prices, weather reports and music from a live studio polka band. Animals and the newest tractors were shown either by driving them into the studio or by propping Polaroid photographs in front of the camera. 
 These days, as director of agricultural broadcasting for the Tribune Company's syndicated radio networks and host of "U.S. Farm Report," the nation's most widely distributed farm television program, the 61-year-old Mr. Samuelson still starts work before dawn and still reads wire-service reports.
But the programs may well originate in China, Russia or a rural barnyard, instead of from the Tribune Tower here. During planting and harvest seasons, farmers use cellular phones to join the broadcasts live from tractors and combines.
In short, farm broadcasting, one of the oldest media niches, is hustling to keep up with its increasingly technology-driven and globally minded audience. Mr. Samuelson is delighted to be at the forefront of the changes.
"I'm still scared to death I'll have to go to work for a living some day," he said. Mr. Samuelson figures his hectic life style is a breeze compared with the regimen he grew up with on a small Wisconsin dairy farm.
He likes to joke that to avoid "getting up at 5:30 to milk cows I ended up getting up at 4 A.M. to prepare farm reports for the folks getting up at 5:30."
Behind the self-deprecation lies Mr. Samuelson's keen awareness that what counts is not so much how early he starts his day as how much he stuffs into it. Mr. Samuelson has many advantages over his competitors, including airtime on two radio networks, one anchored by Tribune's powerful flagship station here, WGN, the other a nationwide syndicate of 350 stations; a widely admired radio sidekick in Max Armstrong, and the weekly "U.S. Farm Report," which is carried by WPIX, Tribune's television station in New York, and enough other stations to reach 93 percent of the national audience.
Mr. Samuelson also writes a column every other month for Farm Journal, a leading trade publication that Tribune acquired last year.
Then there is the benefit of more than three decades of networking. Mr. Samuelson is the journalist of choice to invite along when agribusinesses like the fertilizer maker IMC Global or trade groups like the United States Feed Grains Council are organizing trips abroad to meet politicians and farm groups.
And finally there is the voice, the resonant bass of a large man, unaccented but hinting of the Norwegian he spoke as a child in its occasional swells and distinctive extended syllables. The Big O, as Mr. Samuelson is known, is as instantly recognizable to farm audiences as Walter Cronkite was to television viewers in his heyday, and no less authoritative, even though (like other farm broadcasters) he reads advertisements during his news broadcasts.
"Orion has the pipes!" said an admiring Senator Conrad Burns, an ex-farm broadcaster from North Dakota.
All this has put Mr. Samuelson at the pinnacle of success among the 300 or so members of the National Association of Farm Broadcasters. He has a six-figure income and a Cessna to fly him around.
When WGN sends its main farm program, "The Noon Show," on location at state fairs or farm shows in the Midwest, Mr. Samuelson is treated as a celebrity.
Still, he cannot rest on his reputation. Farm broadcasting is in many ways a unique media segment, but like others it is being redefined by competition from new outlets like on-line services.
In addition, the primary audience of farm broadcasting is both shrinking and becoming more diverse. Fewer than two million Americans now live on farms, but the difference between the large and the small, the technologically advanced and the traditionalists, those who have diversified and those who have specialized, have never been so large.
Mr. Samuelson believes a partial solution for large urban stations like WGN is to make some programming speak for farmers instead of to them. More than 100,000 Chicagoans keep their dials on WGN through "The Noon Show," though Mr. Samuelson is the first to acknowledge that no one knows how many are listening closely. But he noted that many city dwellers owned farmland or were interested in environmental and agricultural issues.
"People eat every day," Mr. Samuelson said. "They ought to know more about where it comes from."
Whatever the size of its urban audience, farm broadcasting remains a test bed for the economics of specialty broadcasting in an era when new technology could create enough television and radio channels for many different professions or interest groups.
The staples of farm broadcasting have not changed. Weather and grain and livestock prices make up the bulk of the 28 daily radio reports broadcast on WGN and Tribune's Agri-Voice network of more than 90 smaller radio stations in the Midwest. Even his taped programming, including his television program and the syndicated "National Farm Report," which is broadcast on 350 radio stations nationwide, often deals with such basics.
But more than a third of the nation's largest farmers -- the advertisers' favorites -- are now linked to computer networks providing similar information, which is often more localized and up to the minute. Some have even created home pages on the Internet to share information. And while the prevailing wisdom is that computer screens will never be as handy a news source as radio when farmers are planting or harvesting, broadcasters are looking for new ways to add value.
"We are doing more on why the prices are what they are than when I started," Mr. Samuelson said. "And that means much more international news. In 1960, we didn't care if it rained in Brazil or there was a credit crunch in Russia."
Farm broadcasters also use technology to interact with their audience, building on a relationship that data networks can never duplicate.
When Mr. Armstrong noticed farmers were acquiring cellular telephones, he and Mr. Samuelson began inviting them to call in progress reports from the fields. This year, Mr. Armstrong broadcast parts of "The Noon Show" from combines in the fields.
"It breaks up the day when you are out there by yourself," said Bob Barkei, a farmer in Stewart, Ill., who called the program from his combine this year.

HEADLINE: His Goal: Keeping the Web Worldwide

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

DATELINE: BOSTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
By now, the World Wide Web is a full-fledged media star, hailed and hyped, part technology and part fashion accessory.
The Web is the popular multimedia branch of the Internet, and it has helped bring the Internet to the masses. So suddenly, the addresses of corporate Web sites are plastered on billboards and on television ads. Without the Web, there would be no Internet craze. No Wall Street fixation with Internet stocks or instant Internet millionaires. And no striking declaration from the Microsoft Corporation this month that it would alter its strategy to adjust to the changes the Web portends for the software business. 
 Yet while the World Wide Web is a household name, its creator, Tim Berners-Lee, a 40-year-old Englishman, is certainly not.
"Berners-Lee is the unsung hero of the Internet," said Eric Schmidt, the chief technical officer of Sun Microsystems Inc., which builds powerful work stations and has created of Java, a Web-based programming language. "If this were a traditional science, Berners-Lee would win a Nobel Prize. What he's done is that significant."
So why isn't Mr. Berners-Lee better known? Vinton Cerf, an Internet pioneer who is now a senior vice president for the MCI Communications Corporation, offers one explanation: "He didn't try to cash in and make millions. He took a different path."
That path stretched from Oxford University to a series of jobs with big companies and startups in Britain, and then on to the CERN physics laboratory in Geneva. There, to help physicists around the world collaborate on research projects, Mr. Berners-Lee, an expert in communications and text-handling programs, wrote the Web software in December 1990, and put it on the Internet the following summer.
Since then, Mr. Berners-Lee has been both the Web's chief evangelist and the arbiter of disputes surrounding it. After a few years, it became apparent that a physics lab in Geneva was probably not the appropriate place for that task. So in September 1994, Mr. Berners-Lee joined the Laboratory for Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the organization that sets standards for the Web.
And as the Web increasingly becomes part of the commercial mainstream, the consortium and Mr. Berners-Lee will be sorely tested.
Private corporations are profit-seekers, and the technical standard they covet is the Internet equivalent of Microsoft's Windows, one controlled by a single company.
Mr. Berners-Lee clearly recognizes that challenge. "There's always the threat that a particular company would dominate the market and control the standards of the Web," he acknowledged during an interview at a Web conference in Boston, attended by 2,000 corporate executives and academicians.
The consortium's membership numbers more than 100 and includes all the major software companies trying to find riches on the Internet -- Microsoft, I.B.M., the Oracle Corporation, Sun Microsystems, Silicon Graphics Inc., the Netscape Communications Corporation, and others. Working groups and committees are formed to make recommendations about Web standards. But in the end, Mr. Berners-Lee decides.
He seems an unlikely authority figure, this slender man with an unruly head of thinning blond hair. He speaks as fast as he thinks, sometimes faster. "Now where was I?" he inquires, breaking off in mid-answer. His multilingual colleagues at the CERN lab eventually asked him to speak in French, hoping to slow him down.
Mr. Berners-Lee has the English touch with self-deprecating humor. In front of an audience of 1,000 people or so, he encounters the inevitable computer foul-ups in demonstrating some software. Puttering with a keyboard as he fixes the problem, he says as an aside, "Oh, you'd all be talking amongst yourselves if we set this up properly."
His favorite Web sites betray a certain black humor. He mentions sites put up by people pursuing the fastest way to light a barbecue. One site (http://ghg.ecn.purdue.edu) displays text and pictures of a person lighting a barbecue with three gallons of liquid nitrogen. It shows 40 pounds of charcoal burning in three seconds. Just considering it must violate innumerable health and safety ordinances. "It's seriously stupid behavior," Mr. Berners-Lee said, grinning gleefully.
The man who recruited him to M.I.T., Michael Dertouzos, the director of the computer science lab, said that Mr. Berners-Lee seems to embody the "libertarian idealism" of the Internet culture. "He has a real commitment to keeping the Web open as a public good, in economic terms," Mr. Dertouzos said. "That's his mission."
For his part, Mr. Berners-Lee said he often thought about trying to commercialize his creation and, at CERN, received offers from several major software companies, which he declined to name. He considered it, but decided against it.
"The essence of the Web is that it's a universe of information," he said. "And it wouldn't be universal if it was tied, in any way, to one company."
The consortium's best hope for keeping the Web open is probably neither Mr. Berners-Lee's commitment nor the goodwill of the consortium members, but the diverse nature of the Internet itself. The world of computer networks may be too decentralized to be dominated by one or a few companies. In short, the PC business model does not apply to the Internet.
But that concept of openness is likely to be tested by the "proprietary extensions" to Web browsing programs, like those produced by Netscape and Microsoft. To understand that, consider Mr. Berners-Lee's basic Web software.
Specifically, he came up with the standards for addressing, linking language and transferring the multimedia documents on the Web. And they have acronymic names now familiar to millions of computer enthusiasts: URL's (universal resource locators), HTML (hypertext mark-up language), and HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol).
Using hypertext links, the Web lets the curious roam a vast chaotic information storehouse -- from Vatican manuscripts and literary magazines to personal ads and pornography -- with the simple point-and-click of a computer mouse. And browsers, in effect, sit atop the basic Web software and make it much easier to navigate around the Web.
The danger, in Mr. Berners-Lee's view, is that browsers or Web programming languages, like Sun's Java, could become the equivalent of competing "network operating systems" -- each proprietary, setting off turf wars on the Web, so that users would need several browsers to tap into everything on the Web.
There are signs of the proprietary drift already. For some sites, users are informed that Netscape is the preferred browser.
But Mr. Berners-Lee points to an agreement a few days ago on inserting applications features -- from spreadsheets to animated entertainment for children -- into Web documents that will keep things open.
"Reasonable competition speeds the pace of innovation," Mr. Berners-Lee said. "Companies will promote the proprietary aspects of their browsers and applications, and they should. But the navigation of the Web has to be open. If the day comes when you need six browsers on your machine, the World Wide Web will no longer be the World Wide Web."

HEADLINE: China's Challenge to Washington

 BODY:
If the United States intends to develop a relationship of mutual respect with China, it must defend its interests as vigorously as Beijing does. Now is the time, for China has shown a dangerous new bellicosity in matters from human rights to military threats.
Last week Beijing again showed its contempt for the rights of Chinese citizens by convicting Wei Jingsheng of sedition and sentencing him to 14 years in prison. The activities the court cited included organizing art exhibitions to benefit democracy and writing articles that advocated Tibet's independence. This heavy-handed muzzling of the country's leading dissenter is a measure of the Chinese belief that America and other Western countries will not make them pay a diplomatic or economic price for the abuse of human rights. 
 Chinese behavior has been equally provocative in other fields. In recent months Beijing has bullied the Philippines over contested islands in the South China Sea, twice conducted missile tests in the waters off Taiwan, resumed irresponsible weapons transfers and imposed its own choice as the reincarnated Panchen Lama, the second most important religious figure in Tibet. Meanwhile, as The Times's Patrick Tyler reports, influential military commanders have begun pushing for military action against Taiwan and turned to confrontational rhetoric against the United States.
Washington has minimized these provocations, setting them in the larger perspective of China's encouraging economic reforms and Washington's hopes for political liberalization. That was the same logic that led the Administration, early last year, to abandon its efforts to link trade privileges for China to Beijing's record on human rights, arguing that anything that helped China's booming economy would ultimately advance political freedom as well.
It is not working out that way. The 19 months since that policy change have been marked by a serious deterioration in China's responsiveness on human rights and other issues. Discouragingly, this seems to be happening not simply because a new generation of leaders is maneuvering to succeed the failing Deng Xiaoping. Nationalist military officers are steadily gaining political influence, and the two top civilian leaders, President Jiang Zimen and Prime Minister Li Peng, seem committed advocates of political repression. That suggests the newly belligerent policies may not be just a transitional phase, or a sign of insecurity in the leadership group, as some China scholars in the West have said.
The Clinton Administration, having done all it reasonably could to smooth relations, including an October meeting between Presidents Clinton and Jiang, now needs to recognize that a less indulgent policy is required to encourage more responsible behavior by China. The first step is to respond far more sharply to Wei Jingsheng's sentence, beginning with a concerted diplomatic drive to condemn China before the United Nations Human Rights Commission next March. U.N. condemnation would be an international embarrassment for China, one it desperately wants to avoid.
Another step is to oppose non-humanitarian World Bank loans to China, as already provided for under United States law. Some Administration officials also want to consider human rights issues in judging China's application to join the new World Trade Organization, even though that is likely to bring objections from other W.T.O. members.
The Administration still refuses to reconsider the simpler, more obvious step of restoring a link between trade and human rights. In this critically important diplomatic game, the United States may no longer be able to deny itself the leverage that link could bring.

HEADLINE: About Lilco, Hard Questions

 BODY:
Customers of Long Island Lighting Company pay the highest utility rates in the continental United States, thanks in part to the costly Shoreham nuclear plant that was blocked from opening by public and political opposition. Two New York Governors, first Mario Cuomo and now George Pataki, have offered plans to cut those rates, but the reaction indicates that significant rate relief is still far distant.
Governor Pataki would rely on both public ownership and market competition to reduce rates by up to 12 percent. He would dismantle Lilco, selling its generators and gas business to private companies and its transmission and distribution lines to the Long Island Power Authority, a state agency. The chief savings would come from the public takeover of Lilco's transmission system. The power authority would issue $4.5 billion in tax-free revenue bonds to refinance Lilco's debt. The agency's tax-exempt status as a public body would enable it to sell bonds at lower interest rates than Lilco's current debt. 
 The other half of the plan -- selling Lilco's energy-generating facilities to private companies that would compete to offer the lowest rates to the power authority -- is also designed to produce savings, at least eventually.
But Mr. Pataki's plan has been beset with questions. Some commentators suspect the projected rate reductions will prove exaggerated. Financial experts have wondered who will subscribe to the largest municipal bond issue in history and whether New York's credit rating, the nation's second-worst, can stand the strain. Even the Long Island Association, the influential business-boosting organization, rebuked the plan.
The association complains that even if the Governor showed his arithmetic for achieving the savings, the savings are simply too meager. Cutting 12 percent from an average rate of 16.8 cents per kilowatt hour saves 2 cents -- still leaving Long Island with about twice the national average.
Other hard questions remain unanswered after two public hearings. The association wants to know why Mr. Pataki does not even discuss energy conservation as a source of power economies. It worries also about the power authority's heavy threat to use state condemnation proceedings if Lilco resists buyout offers. That threat could prove empty, or worse, lead to years of litigation over the utility's value, itself a key element of the complicated rate-reduction package.
Public reaction already has caused the power authority to postpone a vote on the Pataki plan. More public hearings, and more answers, are needed before the authority can seriously consider a vote. The Long Island Association's objections are the latest proof that many nagging questions, though politically potent, are hard business questions demanding candor and much more study.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
An Atomized America

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

 BODY:
When Alexis de Tocqueville sought to explain democracy in America, 150 years ago, he pointed to the fact that "Americans are forever forming associations." They get together, he said, for commercial, religious, moral and practical objectives -- or "to proclaim a truth." Civic groups, he argued, are an essential element of a democratic culture.
The phenomenon that de Tocqueville shrewdly saw -- America as a nation of joiners -- is now withering away. So we learn from a fascinating article by Prof. Robert D. Putnam of Harvard in the new issue of the quarterly The American Prospect. 
 Surveys of average Americans over the last 30 years, the article says, show that participation in voluntary associations is down between 25 and 50 percent. That is so of groups as diverse as P.T.A.'s, the Elks, the League of Women Voters and the Red Cross.
"Americans today are significantly less engaged with their communities than was true a generation ago," Professor Putnam concludes. And with that has come a decline in what he calls "social trust": belief in one another.
Professor Putnam's purpose is not just to note the decline but to explain it. A clue is that it is generational. Those born between 1925 and 1930 have been "exceptionally civic: Voting more, joining more, reading newspapers more, trusting more." (De Tocqueville, too, noted a link between civic participation and newspaper-reading.) Those born after World War II participate much less.
Why? Professor Putnam's answer is: television.
The average American spends 40 percent of his free time watching television -- and those who watch a lot participate little. Television discourages "social trust and group membership," Professor Putnam writes. "Heavy readers [of newspapers] are avid joiners, whereas heavy viewers are more likely to be loners." Surveys show that readers belong to 76 percent more civic groups than watchers.
The time spent in front of the set is one reason why television may discourage joining groups and participating in the community. Another is the negative picture television usually gives of American society.
"Heavy watchers of TV are unusually skeptical about the benevolence of other people," Professor Putnam says -- "overestimating crime rates, for example. . . . Heavy TV watching may well increase pessimism about human nature."
A final point goes beyond television. It is that the whole electronic revolution in communications, even while it enlarges our opportunities, has a profoundly fragmenting effect on the society. In other words, we can sit alone at our computers and interact only through electronics. Technology, Professor Putnam concludes, "may indeed be undermining our connections with one another and with our communities."
To that provocative analysis I would add another point. The United States today is in the grip of free-market ideology carried to the extreme: a belief that the society will thrive if nearly all decisions are left for individuals to make on economic grounds. That ideology no doubt thrives on the atomization described by Professor Putnam -- and feeds it.
But individual decision-making cannot give a society clean water or safe drugs, much as the right-wing ideologues in Congress today like to pretend it can as they remove governmental safeguards. Nor can pure commercialism give a country a decent television service, as all other civilized societies understand.
The former director of the London School of Economics, Lord Dahrendorf, warned recently against "an economism run amok," an attitude that disdains "non-economic motives -- motives that lead people to do things because they are right, or because people have a sense of duty, a commitment."
Making the values of commerce emperors of our souls, Lord Dahrendorf said, leads to "the destruction of public spaces and the decline of the services that go with them, the weakening of health systems and public education, transportation and safety."
When people in a society care only for themselves, when they are taught by demagogues to sneer at government and the communal good, it cannot be surprising that social bonds and social trust decline. In that process, everyone will eventually lose. In a society where fewer people vote or care or join -- a society that has lost its sense of community -- individualism will not bring contentment.

HEADLINE: Gambling's New Winnings: A Special Report;
Gambling Owners Spend Lavishly To Gain a Voice in Many States

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

 BODY:
In only five years, the gambling industry has bought its way into the ranks of the most formidable interest groups in American politics, spending huge sums to gain the kind of influence long wielded by big business, big labor and organizations of doctors and lawyers.
From the Empress riverboat casino in Joliet, Ill., to the Mashantucket Pequot tribe in Ledyard, Conn., gambling interests, which now run casinos in 24 states, have used vast profits gleaned from their craps tables and slot machines to fatten the campaign coffers of political candidates and wage multimillion-dollar lobbying offensives. 
 While state officials have been the primary beneficiaries of the industry's largesse, there has also been a surge in contributions to Federal and local officeholders.
Gambling-financed political action committees gave three times as much to Congressional candidates and the national parties in the 1993-94 election cycle as they gave in the previous two years, according to Common Cause and the Center for Responsive Politics, two Washington-based organizations that monitor campaign financing. The $2 million total for the cycle put the industry in the same league as long-established interest groups like the United Automobile Workers, which gave $2.4 million, and the National Rifle Association, which gave $2.2 million.
At the state level, meanwhile, the rising tide of gambling money has in many places become a flood. In Florida last year, pro-gambling forces spent $16.5 million in an unsuccessful effort to win approval of casinos in a referendum. That sum was almost as much as the state's two gubernatorial candidates spent combined.
In other states, the industry's wealth has allowed it to outspend its opponents by as much as 50 to 1. In the process, that wealth has contributed to major corruption scandals in Louisiana, Missouri, Arizona, Kentucky, South Carolina and West Virginia, all since 1989, when legalized gambling began its cross-country expansion.
Perhaps most significant, the torrent of dollars has rapidly eroded a longstanding stigma against the intermingling of gambling and politics.
"Twenty years ago, if you got support from gambling interests it would have been the kiss of death," said one Federal lawmaker, Representative Frank R. Wolf, a Virginia Republican who opposes the continued expansion of gambling. "If you were running for office in Illinois or Iowa and got money from gambling interests, you wouldn't want to tell your brother or mother."
Noting that today's casinos are run by Indian tribes and Fortune 500 companies, not mobsters, gambling industry officials assert that it is only natural for a heavily regulated, high-growth business to play an active role in politics, just as public utilities and tobacco companies do.
"The only industry that is more regulated is the nuclear power industry," said Mark B. Edwards Jr., a gambling analyst for the State Capital Resource Center, a private group that monitors political developments for casino companies. "Therefore, it's more important for the gaming industry to flex some political muscle. A lot of it is the nature of the beast."
The gaming industry has focused its lobbying campaigns on state capitals, where governors, lawmakers and regulators hold the authority to determine whether to expand gambling, which companies will get gambling licenses and vending contracts, and how extensively gambling will be taxed and controlled.
Gambling opponents say the abundance of lobbying money, and the promise of bountiful tax revenue, has helped the industry move its operations into impoversished communities, with little attention paid to social consequences.
A backlash has begun to emerge in which grass-roots anti-gambling drives in some states have managed to neutralize the influence of big money. But that is no easy task. In the last two years, campaigns to establish or expand legalized gambling in Florida, Missouri, Virginia and Connecticut have spent more money than was ever before spent in those states on any lobbying effort.
During Virginia's legislative session this year, gambling interests hired 48 lobbyists. In Texas, they hired 74, more than two for every state senator and one for every two members of the Texas House.
The lobbyists are often enlisted from the ranks of former public officials. The lobbying payroll in Illinois has included a former governor, a former state attorney general, a former state police director, two former United States attorneys, a former mayor of Chicago and dozens of former state legislators, including a Senate president and a House majority leader.
Two years ago a Nevada casino company, Primadonna Resorts, offered two Illinois lobbyists a compensation package of $20 million over 20 years if they could reel in a riverboat license. (They have yet to do so.)
For an April 1994 referendum on allowing slot machines in Missouri, committees financed by out-of-state casino companies paid out $4.2 million, outspending the proposal's opponents by 50 to 1, according to a study by Alfred Kahn, a retired professor of planning at Southern Illinois University, at Edwardsville. The measure failed by one-tenth of a percentage point. Seven months later, the gambling companies were back, this time spending $11.5 million. The proposal passed with 54 percent of the vote.
The gambling opponents, Mr. Kahn said, "were just overwhelmed by wall-to-wall television commercials."
 
'It's a Sea Change In the Political Landscape'
Like lobbying expenditures, campaign contributions have been flowing as freely as complimentary cocktails on a casino floor. Only one state, New Jersey, prohibits political contributions from gambling interests.
In Louisiana, gambling interests in 1993 and 1994 gave state legislators more than twice as much as did the petrochemical industry, a study by The Times-Picayune of New Orleans showed.
"I've been told by legislator after legislator that the gambling industry has become the single largest political influence in their states," said Robert Goodman, a professor at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., who is the author of "The Luck Business" (Free Press, 1995), a book critical of legalized gambling's spread. "It's a sea change in the political landscape in the states where the gambling industry is operating."
As in many other states that now have casinos, the spending in Illinois has been spurred by competition among gambling concerns whose interests conflict.
Wealthy businessmen who want casino licenses, which now allow casino gambling only on riverboats, are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in campaign contributions to help persuade legislators to expand gambling to Chicago and suburbs. Fearful of new competition, the owners of the state's 10 existing licenses are contributing hundreds of thousands more to protect their monopolies. In doing so, they have placed themselves in an unusual alliance with those who oppose gambling on moral or social grounds.
In Washington, the rise of the gambling industry has created influential power brokers. In a single afternoon last June, Steve Wynn, chairman of Mirage Resorts, one of the country's largest casino companies, raised nearly $500,000 for the Presidential campaign of Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader. The fund-raising luncheon, at a posh Las Vegas country club, came one day after Mr. Dole had traveled to Los Angeles to level a withering attack on what he described as the mercenary values of the entertainment industry.
Mr. Dole opposes new taxes on the gambling industry, said his spokesman, Clarkson Hine, but supports creation of a Federal commission to study gambling's effects. The industry opposes such a commission, believing that it could lead to heightened regulation. But Mr. Hine said Mr. Dole "feels strongly" that regulation should be left to the states.
In any event, Mirage Resorts is hardly the only gambling-industry player in the capital. The 370-member Mashantucket Pequot tribe, virtually unknown until it opened the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard, Conn., in 1992, is one of many others, having given $465,000 to the Democratic National Committee and $100,000 to the Republican National Committee from 1991 to 1994.
Gambling money is so abundant that on occasion it reaches out even to the most vocal of gambling opponents, like Gov. Kirk Fordice of Mississippi, where casino operations have been growing for five years.
In 1993, Mr. Fordice accepted $73,500 in contributions from casino interests, almost a third of all the money he raised that year. Then, beginning last Jan. 1, he swore off accepting any more gambling money, although he declined to return the earlier bounty. The purpose of the new policy, said Andy Taggart, his campaign manager, was to take an issue away from his opponent this year. Mr. Fordice won.
 
First the Boom, Then a Backlash
It was political money, along with the promise of new tax revenue for recession-racked states, that provided the kindling for the wildfire spread of legalized gambling in the 1990's.
In 1988, only Nevada and New Jersey had casinos. Now, 24 states have casinos on land, water or Indian reservations, and 48 states have legalized gambling of some kind. In the last four years, annual legal-gambling revenue has grown by 50 percent, to $39.9 billion. That is nearly a quadrupling since 1982, according to an annual survey by Christiansen/Cummings Associates, a consulting firm that specializes in the gaming industry. On average, profit margins are high, ranging from 15 to 20 percent, said Will E. Cummings, managing director of the firm.
"Without the outside influence coming in" to lobby in this state or that, "there would be no spread of gaming," said William N. Thompson, a professor at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas who is co-author of "The Last Resort: Success and Failure in Campaigns for Casinos" (University of Nevada Press, 1990). "The opponents don't get to make their case."
In the last year, though, the industry has suffered several financial and political failures, suggesting that the market for betting may finally be saturated. A casino in New Orleans and riverboats in Louisiana and Mississippi have failed, and voters and lawmakers have rejected the expansion of gambling in a number of states.
Industry analysts say some of the backlash can be attributed to growing revulsion with the amount of gambling money in politics, and to concern about corruption among holders of public office.
In the most recent scandal, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in August that it was investigating whether video poker operators in Louisiana had bribed lawmakers into killing anti-gambling legislation earlier this year. That inquiry is continuing, but many of the legislators who are targets of it either have chosen to retire or failed to win re-election this fall.
In Pennsylvania, State Attorney General Ernie Preate Jr. pleaded guilty in June to hiding campaign contributions from operators of illegal video poker games. And from 1989 to 1992, lawmakers in Arizona, Kentucky, South Carolina and West Virginia were convicted of accepting bribes from gambling interests.
 
Much 'Like a Bull In a China Shop'
Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., president of the American Gaming Association, the industry's trade group, told a Congressional committee last month that singling out legalized betting as a corrupting influence was unfair.
"The problem," said Mr. Fahrenkopf, a former Republican national chairman, "is that where there is money, there is the potential for corruption, and that is by no means confined to gaming interests." After listing political scandals from Teapot Dome to Abscam, he added, "To suggest that it is unique to our industry is manipulative, cynical and, frankly, dishonest."
Even when operating within the law, though, gambling supporters have sometimes lacked subtlety.
In 1994, the president of the Louisiana Senate, Sammy Nunez, handed out envelopes to colleagues on the Senate floor, each containing a $2,500 campaign check from a casino owner. Mr. Nunez lost in a bid for re-election in November.
In Illinois in 1993, Al Ronan, a legislator turned casino lobbyist, pulled lawmakers off the floor and handed them white envelopes containing campaign checks of $50 to $300.
"The gambling companies have been like a bull in a china shop," said William R. Eadington, director of the Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial Gaming, at the University of Nevada at Reno. "These were companies that did not have the sophistication to understand the nuances of political activity."
Some experts, noting the intense issue that gambling money has become in some states and localities, believe that the industry has turned into its own worst enemy.
Despite devoting $16.5 million to the referendum on casino legalization in Florida last year, pro-gambling forces were crushed at the polls, 62 percent to 38 percent, at least partly because of voter discomfort with that level of spending.
And given the corruption investigation in Louisiana, candidates for governor there spent much of the race this year trying to trump each other's anti-gambling stands.
Further, after the St. Louis County Executive, George Westfall, accepted more than $150,000 in contributions from companies competing for a riverboat casino license, the County Council this year approved a ban on the industry's political donations.
In recent months, some casino companies have decided to put a stop to their own multimillion-dollar political wagers.
One such company is Mirage Resorts, which spent more than $10 million in a four-year failed campaign to place a casino in Bridgeport, Conn. "Our company policy right now is that we are not going to go out in any jurisdiction and actively lobby to change any law, to actively try to convince people," said Richard D. Bronson, a member of Mirage's board and president of the company's development arm. "Look what happened in Connecticut."
Alan M. Feldman, Mirage's vice president for public affairs, added: "It has told us that this isn't our bag. We're just not political animals."

New Jersey gained nearly 57,000 new jobs in 1995, but job growth is expected to slow dramatically next year, when only 39,000 new jobs will be created, the director of the Rutgers Economic Advisory Service said last week. 
 "We've seen an increase in employment in the service sector, in construction and in wholesale and retail trade," said the service's director, Nancy H. Mantell. "But there has been a decrease in the hospital sector, in manufacturing and in communications and utilities, and that will continue." TERRY PRISTIN

HEADLINE: STOCKS AND BONDS IN SHARP RETREAT

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
In what analysts called a resoundingly negative reaction to the failure of Congress and the White House to resolve their budget impasse, Wall Street sent stock and bond prices down sharply yesterday, a day before the Federal Reserve's policy-making panel meets to consider a second cut this year in short-term interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 101.52 points, or 1.96 percent, to 5,075.21, its largest percentage decline in more than a year. Even sharper declines were felt in the Nasdaq composite index, which is rich with the technology companies that have fueled much of the broad market's gains this year. As bond prices plunged, the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond jumped to 6.20 percent, from 6.09 percent on Friday. [Page D20.] 
 In recent weeks, hopes that Federal Reserve policy makers would move to cut short-term interest rates and that Congress and the White House could agree on a plan to balance the budget in seven years helped push the markets higher. The Dow industrial average climbed above the 5,200 level and just last Wednesday set its 69th record closing high of the year, while the yield on long-term Treasury bonds fell to its lowest level in two years.
But the hope for an interest rate cut apparently all but dissipated by yesterday morning. And as the Government formally shut down and many Federal workers were furloughed for a second time this year, the outlook for a quick budget compromise dimmed.
Adding to Wall Street's consternation, a computer glitch at the New York Stock Exchange delayed trading for an hour at the outset, and some traders said that the pent-up demand to sell stocks compounded what had been expected to be an opening decline in market indexes. Another set of disappointing earnings forecasts from technology companies helped to pull the market down further.
Whether the markets recover before the end of the year will depend first on the Federal Reserve's action today. Analysts said it would be hard for the markets to rebound if the Fed did not trim short-term rates.
A recovery will also depend on the reaction of individual investors, who, in the last few years, have learned to take advantage of steep market declines to buy stocks and mutual funds.
"People have learned to buy the dips, but everybody knows that strategy is not going to work forever," said Byron R. Wien, a managing director and strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "This one has a somewhat eerie feeling to it."
Mr. Wien said he expected the rest of this year to be a rocky one for the stock market, but he foresaw higher prices early in 1996. Not all market strategists agree, however. Charles I. Clough Jr., who fills the role for Merrill Lynch, said that yesterday's activity could be "a shot across the bow" warning that "the first part of 1996 might be a lot rougher."
Yesterday's selloff hit technology stocks particularly hard, pushing the Nasdaq composite index down 27.92 points, or 2.71 percent, to 1,002.56, where it was in October. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 9.53 points, or 1.55 percent, to 606.81.
"There have been a lot of big bets made going into the end of the year that Washington would reach a budget compromise and that the Fed will cut rates," said Jack Baker, head of equity trading at Furman Selz Inc.
"Many people have been expecting and waiting for a rally to sell into," he said. "Now, if you want to nail down profits before the end of the year, you have to sell. There is no support for stepping up to the plate to buy stocks here."
If the budget and interest rate worries were not enough to unnerve an increasingly skittish stock market, the New York Stock Exchange announced at 9:15 A.M. that trading would be delayed because a computer software foul-up had closed the electronic system that accepts orders for program trades and individual investor transactions.
Officials of the exchange and the Securities Industry Automation Corporation, a majority-owned subsidiary of the Big Board that operates its computer systems, said that the problem was not related to Friday's record trading volume, when 653.2 million shares changed hands. The only previous times that Big Board volume exceeded 600 million shares were Oct. 19 and 20, 1987, when the market crashed and then began to recover.
While computer problems have halted trading on the New York and other stock exchanges at various times, yesterday was the first time since December 1990 that the Big Board's opening was postponed. Shortly after that incident, the Dow industrials began a rally that has now lasted nearly five years.
In yesterday's shortened session, more than 426 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and exchange officials said they expected no further computer problems today.
Mr. Baker and other traders yesterday questioned the New York Stock Exchange's decision not to inform the public of the possibility of a delayed opening until shortly before trading was scheduled to begin. "That definitely added fuel to the fire," he said. "If the exchange had opened at 9:30, I think the market would have settled down at midday 40 to 50 points lower."
Richard A. Edgar, an executive vice president of the exchange, said that while the software problem was detected at about 4:30 A.M., the exchange and its software unit held out hope that the problem would be fixed and that trading would begin as scheduled. But at 9:15 A.M., the possibility evaporated.
Stock prices fell precipitously once trading began at 10:30. The Dow industrials fell 50 points in the first 11 minutes of trading, setting off the first of the New York Stock Exchange's circuit breakers, intended to prevent the market from going into a free fall.
Stock prices stabilized at about 11 A.M., but headed lower again in the late afternoon. The Dow industrials did not breach the 100-point loss mark until the final hour of trading and finished with their biggest daily point decline in four years.
The breadth of the decline in stock prices was strong as well. Of the 30 stocks in the Dow industrials, 27 declined. Only 54 of the stocks in the S.& P. 500 rose, while 416 fell.
Among the most active stocks, Intel fell 1, to 57 1/4; Cisco Systems fell 3 1/8, to 70 7/8, and Micron Technology lost 1 5/8, to 43 1/4.
Even several merger and acquisition moves announced yesterday did not add much support. Cobra Golf, which agreed to be acquired by American Brands, was the lone gainer among the 10 most actively traded stocks yesterday, rising 7 7/8, to 35 1/2.
The Steris Corporation, a maker of devices to sterilize medical equipment, agreed to acquire Amsco International, a competitor. But the market did not view the deal very kindly, as Steris shares declined 9 3/4, or 23 percent, to 32 1/2, and Amsco fell 2 5/8, to 15 1/8.
The negative tone was set early in the day by the latest in a series of disappointing earnings announcements from a technology company. Advanced Micro Devices said lower-than-expected shipments of its 486 line of semiconductors would cause profits to fall below the previous quarter; the company's shares fell 1 1/8, to 17 1/8, the lowest level in three years.
Information Storage Devices, which makes semiconductors for telephone answering machines, similarly said fourth-quarter revenues would be below expectations. Its shares fell 3 1/2, to 9 1/2; the company went public in February at $15 a share.
But the disappointments were not limited to the high-tech sector. The James River Corporation, a leading paper producer, said weaker demand and lower prices would cause fourth-quarter profits to fall below expectations. James River shares fell 6 1/8, to 25 1/4.
But Advantage Health rose 8 1/4, to 45, after it agreed to be acquired by Healthsouth for $325 million in stock. Healthsouth fell 3/8, to 30 1/2.
Manhattan Bagel shares fell 5 7/8, to 15 1/8; the company was the subject of a column in Sunday's Money and Business section of The New York Times, which said that two executives of the bagel chain had been indicted on criminal charges in California.

HEADLINE: 2 More Spending Bills Vetoed, But Clinton Offers to Negotiate

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
With a sizable chunk of the Government shut down over stalemated negotiations on a balanced budget, President Clinton used both carrot and stick on Congressional Republicans today by vetoing two more spending bills but then holding out the possibility of renewed face-to-face talks and compromise.
The second partial Government closing in a month idled about 260,000 Federal employees, who were sent home around the nation because the temporary spending measure that had financed their offices expired at midnight Friday. The resulting uncertainty helped send the stock market skidding more than 100 points. 
 After once again denouncing the Republicans, in his veto message, as too eager to cut programs for health, education and the environment, Mr. Clinton offered a private olive branch at midafternoon. In separate telephone calls to Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, the President proposed two alternatives to end the standoff, White House aides said.
By evening, the two leaders had formally accepted neither but said they wanted to go to the White House on Tuesday for talks with the President alone. White House aides said no meeting was yet scheduled but suggested that one was likely.
In his phone call, aides said, Mr. Clinton proposed that if the Republicans agreed to drop their insistence on using Congressional Budget Office estimates to balance the budget in seven years, he would agree to join the talks personally, with no preconditions and everything negotiable. Or, if the Republicans insisted on using the Congressional estimates, aides said, Mr. Clinton would demand that they drop their proposed cuts in the growth of Medicare and Medicaid spending in favor of his own, smaller reductions before negotiations could resume with senior White House aides.
The Republicans' initial response was circumspect enough to suggest that serious talks might be in the offing.
"There will be a 30-minute private conversation, just the three of us," Mr. Gingrich said tonight after a meeting of the Republican leadership. "We're not discussing either option. We're going down there."
Later, Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Dole issued a joint statement saying: "We have asked to meet with President Clinton tomorrow to discuss fulfillment of the commitment he made 29 days ago to enact a 7-year balanced budget using nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates. We do not view this as a negotiating session but as an opportunity to discuss face-to-face the importance of getting a balanced budget agreement this year, and how we might achieve that goal."
After the President's phone call Mr. Dole said, "The President's call does demonstrate that he has at least heard our pleas over the weekend, and indicates a willingness to talk about a balanced budget over seven years using C.B.O. figures."
For weeks, negotiations over balancing the budget have been tangled up in disputes over the assumptions about national economic performance that would underlie any spending projections. Republicans have insisted on using the figures of the Congressional Budget Office, which are only slightly more conservative than the Administration's, but which translate into multibillion-dollar differences over seven years.
Last month, to re-open the Government after a six-day shutdown, Mr. Clinton agreed to balance the budget in seven years with Congressional assumptions, but only if doing so protected his own spending priorities. White House aides said that his second proposal to Mr. Dole and Mr. Gingrich today was merely meant to enforce the second half of the earlier agreement, by insisting that they accept his original proposed cuts of $124 billion in Medicare spending and $54 billion in Medicaid spending -- less than half the size of their own.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, senior White House aides said the Republicans had seemed more sympathetic to the President's offer to join the talks personally with no preconditions, since any budget must eventually be based on the Congressional Budget Office's assumptions. The aides said a meeting could come as soon as Tuesday.
With the Christmas holiday fast approaching, both sides faced growing pressure to find a solution. Republicans and conservative Democrats sponsored a nonbinding resolution in the House calling for a balanced budget in seven years using Congressional estimates, and it passed overwhelmingly on a bipartisan vote of 351 to 40.
"This shows a growing bipartisan movement for everyone to get in the box of seven years and then fight it out," said Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is the chairman of the House Budget Committee. "The earth is shifting under the White House now."
But Mr. Clinton began the day by standing his ground, and the oratory on both sides was hot.
"It is wrong for the Congress to shut the Government down just to make a political point a week before Christmas," Mr. Clinton said in a brief Oval Office ceremony where he vetoed bills that would have financed the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Interior and Veterans Affairs, and the Environmental Protection Agency. He is to veto a bill to provide funds for the Departments of State, Justice and Commerce, and for the Federal judiciary on Tuesday, the White House said.
Republicans were quick to blame the President for the shutdown.
"The bills are on his desk; the burden is on him," Mr. Gingrich told reporters at a fund-raising breakfast in Richmond.
Speaking on the Senate floor moments after the President's veto, Mr. Dole said: "He had it in the stroke of a pen -- all of these Federal employees employees could have been back to work today," and added: "It's the same old deception -- scare the American people, scare the children, scare the senior citizens, scare the veterans. Tell everybody the sky is falling in."
But Mr. Clinton insisted that the price of the spending bills was too high, and he had threatened for weeks to veto them. His main objections included cuts in spending for environmental enforcement, elimination of his Americorps national service program and provisions on the use of public lands that the White House says favor developers.
In the meantime, the shutdown moved into its first regular workday, with 260,000 employees, about 13 percent of the nonmilitary Federal work force, either sent home today or off the job since Saturday.
"For agencies affected by the shutdown, the only work being done is of an emergency nature related to imminent threats to life and property," said Lawrence Haas, spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget.
Among the departments and agencies still without regular appropriations are Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, Commerce, Justice, State, Interior, Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Small Business Administration.
Federal museums, parks and monuments were closed as were passport offices, for all but emergency applications.
The idled workers were many fewer than the 800,000 affected by the six-day closing in November, since civilian employees of the armed forces and Internal Revenue Service workers are on the job because the President signed appropriation bills for their agencies last month.

HEADLINE: California Economy Shakes Off Doldrums

 BODY:
The California economy is showing signs of a vigorous revival after five years of decline.
Job growth is running better than 2.3 percent a year, about 50 percent faster than growth nationwide. The entertainment, technology and international trade sectors are leading the way. 
 By early next year, economists say, most of the 525,000 jobs lost in the recession, mostly in the still-depressed construction, aerospace and military industries will be replaced.
The migration to other states has slowed while an increasing number of people are moving in. The recovery is going so strong that state taxes are 3 percent ahead of estimates.

HEADLINE: Communication Legislation Stirs Talk of Mergers By Baby Bells

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
With Congress on the verge of sweeping away six decades of communications laws, the nation's telephone companies are jockeying furiously in preparation for a wide-open race for customers and profit.
Two regional Bell telephone companies, Nynex and Bell Atlantic, are reportedly exploring a merger that would create the second-largest telephone company in the United States. Only AT&T, the largest long-distance provider, would have more customer lines. 
 At the same time, Wall Street executives said that a third regional Bell, the Pacific Telesis Group, was trying to negotiate deals with several phone companies, including Nynex and Bell Atlantic.
Investment bankers and communications executives floated an array of other potential deals yesterday that would pair local phone companies with long-distance carriers or overseas phone companies.
These days, picking up a rumor about a telecommunications deal is about as easy as picking up the phone. "With the starting gate going up, the Bells are going to have AT&T in their business tomorrow," said Robert Waldman, corporate bond research chief at Salomon Brothers, "They want people to know that they can potentially serve far more customers, too."
For Wall Street, a frenzy of deals would be a bonanza. For many consumers, though, the activity is unlikely to make much difference in the price or quality of their phone service. Only in metropolitan areas, where the lure of lucrative markets might intensify competition, could the small customer hope to see much benefit.
Congress has yet to pass the telecommunications bill, which would allow the local and long-distance carriers to compete in each other's markets. But a House-Senate conference has nearly completed a compromise measure. And if a bill does not make it to the White House before the end of the year, many industry executives and lawmakers expect it to do so early next year.
A report of discussions between Nynex and Bell Atlantic, something long assumed in the industry and the subject of a Wall Street Journal article yesterday, caused little stir in Washington, where the conference did not hold a meeting.
But Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, who has harshly criticized the monopoly power of the regional Bells companies, threatened to mount a filibuster against the bill when it reaches the Senate floor. "This is a signal of where the industry is going after the legislation," he said, "and it is toward greater concentration."
Industry consolidation, though, may be a fact of the future, with or without a law, as companies seek the advantages that size and economies of scale can bring. The antitrust consent decree, the court-supervised settlement that has governed the seven so-called Baby Bells since they were spun off from AT&T in 1984, does not prohibit two of these companies from merging. Nor does it prohibit a long-distance company other than AT&T from acquiring or merging with a Baby Bell.
Although telephone executives are still treading lightly around regulators for fear of derailing the bill, most are scrambling behind the scenes to line up partners and allies to help them compete.
And in a public gesture, AT&T announced a move yesterday to further distance itself from the local phone companies with which it expects to soon be competing. It said it would begin billing some customers in Florida, Texas and California directly for long-distance service. Until now, AT&T has generally paid local phone companies to add its charges to their monthly bills.
A merger of Nynex and Bell Atlantic has been talked about in recent months as increasingly likely, a powerful local-phone franchise stretching from Maine to Virginia. The companies have merged their cellular properties, and they are partners with Pacific Telesis in a television programming venture, Tele-TV.
Nynex and Bell Atlantic declined to comment on the talks yesterday. And an investment banker familiar with the discussions cautioned that the two were at least weeks away from any deal.
Ivan G. Seidenberg, chairman and chief executive of Nynex, said in an interview yesterday that his company was exploring a broad range of relationships with other phone companies, ranging from joint ventures to marketing alliances.
"This industry is so dynamic that we have to be flexible," Mr. Seidenberg said. "We have explored any number of options to do that, and we will continue to do so. But any discussion that we've had with any company is inappropriate to comment on."
He noted that Nynex had not waited for telecommunications legislation to strike several of its deals. But he acknowledged that the bill, if it became law, would open the door to new relationships. Mr. Seidenberg said Nynex would try to gain some share of the huge number of international calls in and out of New York City. To do that, analysts said, Nynex could conceivably form an alliance with an overseas carrier.
In seeking to compete against AT&T in the domestic market, analysts said Nynex and Bell Atlantic would each benefit by consolidating their local-phone franchise on the Eastern Seaboard. "What you need to have is a large footprint to reach more customers with one network," Mr. Waldman said, "There's no reason on God's earth why you have to have seven Bell companies."
If a merger would help both companies, most analysts said that on balance, it would be more beneficial to Nynex. Mr. Waldman said Bell Atlantic -- which covers the area from New Jersey to Virginia -- had better debt ratings and was viewed as one of the best run of the regional Bell companies. Though Nynex, serving New England and New York, had improved its reputation under Mr. Seidenberg, it was viewed as the weaker of the two.
Nynex shares bucked a sharp stock-market decline yesterday, rising 25 cents, to $49.875, on the New York Stock Exchange. Bell Atlantic shares dropped $1.625, to $67.
Regional Bell companies are not the only candidates for deals. Several analysts said MCI Communications was an obvious partner for a local phone company because it could gain access to local customers while offering access to its long-distance network in return.
Analysts regard GTE as another natural candidate for a deal because it controlled local markets throughout the country. Indeed, an investment banker said Pacific Telesis had expressed interest in merging with GTE because the two companies both controlled lucrative local phone markets in California.
Consumer advocates, however, were alarmed by a linkup of regional Bell companies. "In a merger like this, you're talking about two companies that border each other," said Bradley Stillman, director of telecommunications policy at the Consumer Federation of America. "This assures that they will never compete in each other's markets."
Critics of the legislation, including Senator Kerrey and Mr. Stillman, want the Justice Department to help determine whether there is adequate competition in the local phone business before the regional Bells are let loose in the long-distance business.

HEADLINE: A Rail Union That Could

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The hope was that Paris and the rest of France would limp back to normal this week after a paralyzing national rail strike and a struggle between public-sector labor unions and the Government over austerity measures to reduce the federal deficit.
But after three weeks in which many hundreds of thousands marched to support the strikers, it seems clear that it will take a long time to heal the wounds. 
 The strikes revealed a deep gulf between technocrats like Prime Minister Alain Juppe who tell the nation that it has to tighten its belt to insure France's place in a more competitive European economy, and French workers who have not been convinced they should have to make sacrifices to allow public and private enterprises to flourish.
In the short run, the railway workers who closed down the national rail network on Nov. 25 and who were still blocking trains to the Channel Tunnel today were clear winners.
Led by Marc Blondel, a cigar-smoking 57-year-old career union official whose like has all but disappeared from Britain and the United States, the workers forced Mr. Juppe to promise in writing not to touch their special pension rules. These allow some locomotive engineers to retire at 50 on pensions based on their last six months' average earnings. Mr. Juppe was also persuaded to shelve a five-year plan that would close 3,750 miles of unprofitable railroad branch lines.
Thousands of civil servants, now permitted to retire after 37.5 years' work instead of the 40 years common in the private sector, closed schools and post offices, and they, too, forced Mr. Juppe to withdraw proposals to curtail their benefits.
In a television interview on Sunday night, Mr. Juppe said nobody understood his proposals. But backed by President Jacques Chirac and the strong conservative majority in Parliament, he is still hoping to convince union leaders of the need for changes in the comprehensive French health insurance system, which has fallen $46 billion into the red during the last three years.
Neither Mr. Chirac nor Mr. Juppe ever came right out and said that the speeded-up deficit reduction was necessary for France to qualify to join Germany and other countries in a common European currency at the end of the decade. But under rules agreed to by the European Union four years ago, France will have to reduce its deficit from $59.3 billion, or 5 percent of its gross national product this year, to 3 percent of its G.N.P. by 1997 in order to qualify.
Meeting in Madrid late last week, Mr. Chirac and other European leaders did not even suggest the possibility of stretching out the timetable, a request Mr. Chirac would see as a humiliating sign of weakness. And none of the European leaders want to attract domestic public opposition to a common currency that most portray as a way to insure the continuation of Europeans' comfortable life in the future.
Mr. Chirac's thinking is that a strong euro, the name given to the future currency, could stand up to the dollar and the yen better than the franc could, but only if the new money is as sound as the German mark.
What played itself out here during the last three weeks is a French domestic struggle over austerity measures, not a Franco-German struggle. The problem is that French governments, afraid of stirring opposition, have never adequately explained to the electorate why they cannot just go on running up deficits to keep paying benefits.
Pierre Laroque, the 88-year-old former Resistance leader who put the health insurance and pension system in place in 1945, said recently that the core of it was a feeling of solidarity born of the war: the sense that those holding jobs in a full-employment economy would make the financial contributions, through health insurance and pension premiums, to enable older people to live in dignity in retirement and to allow all to enjoy modern medical benefits.
But the system was never intended to support three million people without jobs. Mr. Juppe's plan for the health system would keep its benefits intact. He rejected raising out-of-pocket costs for hospital stays, which now are $10 a day.
But the Prime Minister did not explain the plan that way when he introduced it in Parliament. Many people were baffled and angered by portions of the plan, including a new 0.5 percent tax on income to pay off the accumulated deficit and tighter controls over prescriptions.
What a humbled Mr. Juppe appears to be planning to do is to start a long process of public education on the effects of the welfare-state on jobs and economies.
It is not a task that comes easily to French bureaucrats, but Mr. Juppe will start by meeting with union leaders on Thursday. Some think he should have started much earlier.

HEADLINE: Latest Shutdown Disrupts Services

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Cold impersonal numbers were translated into blunt reality yesterday when the executive branch of the United States Government furloughed an estimated 260,000 of its two million nonuniformed workers in the continuing Congressional budget battle.
On an average day in December, according to the Office of Management and Budget, 383,000 people visit national parks, monuments and historic sites. 
 But with the National Park Service shut down yesterday, Marcelo Tillen, 26, a civil engineer from Sao Paulo, Brazil, stood despairing near the ferry landing that serves the Statue of Liberty. "I don't know if I'll be able to see the statue again," he said. "I don't know if I'll be able to return to New York again."
He added, "I think that it's ridiculous because the normal people don't have to suffer just because of discussions going on between politicians."
Across the country, from Liberty Island in New York Harbor to Alcatraz Island off San Francisco, Government workers deemed nonessential were, in the parlance of the day, furloughed. As they left their jobs, the impact rippled through museums, the passport agency, the Federal Housing Administration and beyond.
Workplace safety complaints went unanswered at the Labor Department, the 20,000 students and parents who would be expected to apply for Federal grants and loans at this time of year found that they would have to wait for a chance at college aid, and there was no one to hear the 100 complaints of discrimination in the schools that would be expected this week at the Education Department.
Outside 26 Federal Plaza in Manhattan, a civil rights investigator, Ronald A. Thomson, 65, of Ridge, L.I., expressed resentment at being furloughed. "To be told you're not essential when you're dealing with people's civil rights, which affects their lives and well-being, really bothers me," he said.
No one was handling the telephone lines where the Environmental Protection Agency receives 240 calls a day reporting contamination of drinking water. And farmers seeking emergency exemptions from the agency to use restricted pesticides to fight pest outbreaks had no one to turn to for authorization and faced the prospect of severe crop damage and loss of income.
In South Dakota, the services of the Pine Ridge Reservation office of the Bureau of Indian Affairs are vital to the Oglala Sioux; the reservation includes one of the poorest counties in the United States. But only 5 of the 75 regular employees remained at work there yesterday afternoon.
Because the shutdown was anticipated, arrangements had been made through the bureau's Aberdeen office to send payments to welfare recipients in the Oglala and 15 other tribes through the end of the month to spare them hardship during the holidays.
"Federal workers want to work," said Steve Walanka, a general counsel for the Department of Labor in Chicago. "Maybe the public doesn't believe that, but we do. This is a terrible disruption."
Karen Vaughan, an administrator in Chicago for the General Services Administration, an agency that escaped the furloughs, said: "We can barely keep up as it is with all the paper work. The furloughs and the shutdowns make it that much more impossible. Then people complain about Government service.
"Believe me, we're trying," she added. "But many of the offices that serve the public, like the I.R.S. and the Social Security offices, they've never caught up from the last shutdown."
Dianne H. Pilgrim, director of the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in Manhattan, part of the Smithsonian Institution, said that she was annoyed by perceptions that the second round of furloughs in a month was less serious than the first and that it affected mainly national parks, monuments and museums.
"It's putting us down as if we're not important," she said. "We are an educational institution, and it's tourist time."
On an average day, the Federal Housing Administration processes 2,500 loans for home buyers and refinancings, a total of $200 million worth of mortgage loans. But it did no business yesterday.
In Los Angeles, at the western regional office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the spokesman, Ron Rogers, was hopeful that the public would be shielded from the shutdown as long as possible. Most employees sent home from that office yesterday were support staff, individuals who handle budget, payroll and computer services.
But Mr. Rogers said: "If this were to last any significant time, services would start to erode. We've got people out there servicing the public, but it's like driving a car. When you run out of fuel, and there's no one to refuel you, there's a problem."
But the ill wind that blew through the Government yesterday did some good for some people.
A few furloughed workers welcomed the extra time for Christmas shopping. And the Federal Parent Locator Service, which receives 20,000 cases a day, was closed yesterday, making it, in effect, a national holiday for deadbeat dads.
At passport offices, though, life and death were the order of the day. On an average day, the State Department gets 23,000 passport applications. It also issues 20,000 visas for visitors, who each spend an average of $3,000 a trip, pumping $60 million into the United States economy.
But only emergency service was available yesterday, and not much of that.
In Chicago, Linda Graham Reichert, whose brother died on Sunday in Iceland, waited forlornly on a bench inside the Federal Building while her husband, John, waved itineraries and tickets in front of guards and shrugging Federal officials.
"I have to get a passport," Mrs. Reichert said quietly. "This is a nightmare. I understand politics. But why should it have to end like this, in this kind of mess?"
After a while, Mr. Reichert told his wife that the sole remaining employee in the passport office said he would call Washington to see what could be done.
"I have one thing to say about all this," he said. "Throw the bums out. That's the lesson I learned today."

HEADLINE: U.S. and Mexico Postpone Nafta on Truck Crossings

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration and the Mexican Government backed away from a politically volatile and highly symbolic provision of the North American Free Trade agreement today, indefinitely delaying the day when Mexican trucks can move freely through much of the Southwest.
The action came after days of round-the-clock talks in which the Administration sought to forestall the border opening, which was supposed to begin today. Under pressure from labor unions and officials in the border states, the Administration complained that Mexican authorities have done far too little to improve the safety standards of its long-haul trucks. The United States wants Mexico to be tougher on the training and licensing of drivers and to increase enforcement of drug laws to prevent the trucks from becoming a conduit for traffickers. 
 The trade agreement calls for the trucks to move without restrictions in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas after a brief registration process that was supposed to begin this month; American trucks would have reciprocal rights south of the border. Currently, trucks from both nations are limited to a commercial zone that is as wide as 26 miles in some places near the border.
At a news conference today, Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena portrayed the action as a minor delay while Mexican officials and the Administration "continue consultations to place an even greater emphasis on safety and security."
In the interim, Mr. Pena said, the Interstate Commerce Commission, which is slated for elimination in the budget for this fiscal year, would receive applications from Mexican companies seeking to send their trucks over the border, but would not certify any of them to do so.
But other Administration officials said it would probably take months and perhaps far longer before Mexico would be able to meet the new requirements.
Despite the delay in the agreement, Federal and state officials began a scheduled program of tougher inspections they had planned for the new phase. Agents pulled over trucks heading north into the commercial zone, conducting the new safety inspections and sending sniffer dogs to detect hidden caches of drugs.
Past surveys have found that roughly 1 in 4 Mexican trucks entering the country do not comply with American safety regulations. Many trucks regularly haul toxic chemicals, corrosives and waste, and they will be operating on highways that, as of last week, are no longer subject to the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit.
The action today was the first in which the two countries worked together to slow the Nafta accord, a telling reversal of their effort two years ago, when both Washington and Mexico City were rushing to approve the accord, which had faced considerable domestic opposition.
And the suspension of this phase calls into question whether Administration officials and their Mexican counterparts were too optimistic two years ago when they spoke of the speed with which Nafta would spur the integration of two very different economies, bring their environmental, safety and highway rules into rough equilibrium.
While both Governments portrayed the issue as simply a matter of safety, politics was also clearly a factor on both sides of the border.
Texas and California are key states in the Presidential race, and Mr. Clinton's advisers are clearly concerned that a serious accident, a toxic-waste spill or influx of drugs would be linked to one of his signature accomplishments: the passage of Nafta, the most far-reaching trade pact in North American history.
Mexican business interests, which initially embraced the accord, have become equally reluctant. With the Mexican economy mired in a deep recession, trucking companies in Mexico feared an influx of American competition. By delaying the opening, President Ernesto Zedillo can insulate a key part of the Mexican economy from going head-to-head with more efficient delivery services based in the United States.
"This is a case where everyone wanted a time-out," a senior Administration official said today. It is unclear how the delay would affect the agreement's next big milestone on transportation, in the year 2000, when Mexican trucks are to be allowed to go anywhere in the country.
Integrating the two economies has turned out to be far more difficult than simply reducing tariffs and eliminating other government-created trade barriers. American officials, while insisting that the agreement has created jobs in the United States and increased American exports to both Mexico and Canada, the other signatory of the tripartite agreement, say that Mexican compliance with safety and environmental rules has been scanty at best.
"We needed to wake them up," one official here dealing with the trucking issue said the other day.
Mr. Pena and the United States Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, insisted today that the action was not a setback for the accord.
"It will only help Nafta to underscore how serious we are being," Mr. Kantor, who played the central role in negotiating the agreement at its final stages in 1993, said today. "We need to show an abundance of caution and responsibility."
At the White House, Mr. Clinton's political advisers said they were trying to handle the issue with particular care because two of its most vocal and frequently disappointed constituencies, unions and environmentalists, were strongly opposed to the broader opening of the border.
The teamsters union went to court last week in Washington seeking a delay in the opening of the border, though the Administration acted today before the first court hearing on the subject could be held. On the other hand, lobbyists representing American trucking interests wanted the opening to go ahead, so that they could get a better foothold in the Mexican market. Under the accord, however, they can begin to invest in Mexican trucking companies.
Bill Bronrott, a spokesman for Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways, a consumer group that has been critical of lax standards for trucks, said today, "Delay is good if it is used as a real moment to look at safety and environmental issues."

HEADLINE: Counting the Wealth of Nations;
G.D.P.'s Accuracy Is Under Attack From All Sides

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Jean Brown is an energetic widow who works nine hours a day, four days a week doing clerical work and sometimes pushing the toiletries-laden "comfort cart" at the veterans hospital in downtown Baltimore. Her pay? Nothing, unless you count a parking space, a $4 lunch chit or the offer of a free flu shot.
The V.A. hospital estimates that the work done by hundreds of volunteers like Mrs. Brown is worth at least $350,000 a year. But none of it registers on the gauge most widely used to assess the nation's well-being -- the gross domestic product -- which represents the estimated total of goods and services produced in the American marketplace. 
 No other statistic plays as influential a role in the nation's economic and political life as the G.D.P. does. These days momentous Federal budget negotiations hang on impossibly precise projections of economic growth over the next seven years. As the Presidential campaign hits full stride, politicians with next to no idea of how the gross domestic product is compiled will soon be invoking it as evidence of how well or poorly the country has done in recent years.
But within economic circles, the compilation of the gross domestic product is coming under increasing attack from all sides. Environmentalists argue that it overstates the health of society by ignoring the drain on natural resources and the cost of ecological damage.
On the other side, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is among economists who argue that it understates the strength of economic growth by overlooking much of the productivity and quality improvements technology brings.
And analysts from various spots on the political spectrum note that volunteer work, child care and other work at home are ignored, while the figures include the cost of building prisons and the fees of divorce lawyers -- items that could more properly be deemed a reflection of social breakdown, not economic advance.
The G.D.P. "isn't really a measure of economic welfare," said Gail D. Fosler, economist at the Conference Board, a business-sponsored research group in New York.
Indeed, close scrutiny helps explain one of the central mysteries of the day -- how total output can grow at a brisk rate while much of the population believes it is losing ground. A lot of the reported growth of the last 20 or 30 years has come from Americans working longer and harder rather than smarter. The gross domestic product has grown, but often only because some activity like child care has been shifted from the home into the paid sector -- where quality might well be inferior.
The Government itself has long recognized that the statistic is flawed. Starting with the newest figures for the third quarter, which were scheduled to be released today and now will be available as soon as the partial Government shutdown ends, the Commerce Department will switch primary emphasis to a calculation method known as the chain-weighted system from the traditional fixed-weight system. The new method, which has been used as a backup measure for several years, will lead to calculations showing a slower pace of economic growth.
But rather than satisfying the critics, the new accounting system is likely to widen the debate over the appropriateness of the G.D.P. as a measure of whether Americans are actually living better.
In simplest terms, the statistic is designed to measure the sum total within the borders of the United States of consumer spending, business investment, government purchases and foreign trade. But nothing is simple about the calculations that go into it.
Analysts say the figure, while still probably the best single gauge of the overall pulse of the economy, no longer accurately reflects the changing dynamics of an increasingly service-oriented society. Its conceptual deficiencies, they say, are grounded in the statistic's roots as a World War II-era tool for judging military-industrial potential.
Nor is gross domestic product viewed as simply a neutral judgment of the economy. The fiercest criticism comes from environmental groups and others fearful that their interests are being swamped by an all-consuming attention to sheer output.
"The G.D.P. was never intended to be a yardstick of economic progress," said a report by Redefining Progress, a public policy institute in San Francisco. "It says nothing about the impacts of current modes of production upon the nation's health and well-being. Yet economic analysts and the media accord the G.D.P. a totemic stature and regard its growth as the ultimate measure of economic success."
The group has begun to publish an alternative version that takes the Commerce Department's tally of economic activity and adjusts it, among other ways, to include unpaid work and exclude social and environmental costs. The difference is striking. The group's so-called Genuine Progress Indicator shows almost uninterrupted decline since 1969, with the measure slumping at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the third quarter of 1995. That contrasts sharply with the Government's estimate of a 4.2 percent rate of expansion during that period.
The Commerce Department, encouraged by Clinton appointees, published data in spring 1994 that sought to account for the depletion of oil and other nonrenewable resources. The department hoped to eventually include factors like the use of forests and changes in air quality. But further development of the measure has stalled because some members of Congress worry that such data might be used against the oil and mining industries.
In contrast to these criticisms, which suggest that the G.D.P. exaggerates national well-being, some important economists believe the G.D.P. errs in the other direction. They say the economy -- at least in terms of material prosperity -- is actually considerably stronger than the official figures show. Mr. Greenspan, a leader in this camp, said recently in a Chicago speech that the G.D.P. "increasingly underestimates the market value of goods and services," primarily because advances in technology have improved life and bolstered productivity in ways statistics fail to capture.
That view is shared by private economists like Stephen S. Roach of Morgan Stanley and Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch.
"If properly measured, real G.D.P. growth was probably stronger during the 1990's than currently reported, rather than weaker," Mr. Steinberg told clients.
The Government revision is part of a longstanding effort to keep this gauge up to date and realistic -- an effort that one official compared to trying to fit someone running a 100-yard dash for new clothes.
The goal is to halt a systematic overstatement of G.D.P. caused primarily by the sharp drop in computer prices since 1987, the base year. The widespread use of personal computers has swelled G.D.P. more than thought appropriate because the formulas assume that a unit of computing power -- such as the ability of a central processing unit to crunch numbers and manipulate data -- still costs as much as it did eight years ago. In fact, it is many times cheaper. The distortion becomes greater over time.
The department will now use a combination of preceding-year and current prices for a range of products and services, with G.D.P. reported as an index whose individual components -- consumption, investment, government purchases and net exports -- will no longer add to total G.D.P.
The result, economists believe, will be that the chain-weighted figure will be about a percentage point lower than the fixed-weight calculation for the last three years. While only the method of measurement has changed, that may well have a negative effect on the way many people view the economy.
Many specialists insist the changes only scratch the surface.
"They're only working on the input side, not on the output side," said Joseph W. Duncan, formerly a top-ranking Commerce Department statistician and now chief economist for Dun & Bradstreet. By this he means that the G.D.P. will still not pick up hard-to-measure changes in the quality and convenience of services, such as education, computer software or banking.
And since the components no longer add up, economists say it will be even harder to construct meaningful forecasts and provide readily understandable data for policy makers.
Indeed, some critics say it is time to start over with entirely different measures. Richard M. Salsman, an economist at H. C. Wainwright Economics in Boston, disparages the G.D.P. accounts as based on an era when most economists believed that consumption was the driving force of the economy. He argues that the statistic undervalues business investment, does not capture the dynamism of new inventions and fails to account correctly for transactions that take place among companies.
"It's a kind of tweaking of a system that is so horrible to begin with that it's almost comical," Mr. Salsman said. "It excludes the bulk of activity that goes on."
Others complain that the G.D.P., in looking at only measurable things, holds a distorted mirror to daily life. William R. Mattox Jr., vice president for policy at the Family Research Council in Washington, argues that the gauge needs to be put in perspective.
"If we hold it up to exalted status," he said, "and ignore families and volunteers, including the church, we run the risk of creating the false impression of great health while experiencing cultural collapse."
As for Mrs. Brown, the 71-year-old volunteer at the V.A. hospital and the widow of a World War II veteran plans to keep on contributing to the well-being of the community even if it never shows up on the bottom line.
"I'm giving back to the country," she said, "and the men who were with my husband."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Impasse Takes A Toll on Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The yield on the long bond surged to its highest level in nearly three weeks yesterday, as prices fell, reflecting both traders' anxiety about the stalemated budget negotiations in Washington and their fear that as a result of the Government shutdown, the Federal Reserve will not cut interest rates today.
The 30-year benchmark issue dropped 117/32 , to a price of 1095/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose 11 basis points, to 6.20 percent, the highest since Nov. 28, when it was 6.23 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
 Also weighing on prices was a weak dollar; the potential for currency translation losses caused foreign investors to shy away from buying American securities.
When the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee meets today to decide whether to cut interest rates, it may not have all the data it needs for the decision, lessening the possibility of a cut.
The Commerce Department said yesterday that it was postponing the release, scheduled for today, of both the revised gross domestic product report for the third quarter and for November housing starts. It also warned that should the shutdown continued, it could also force the postponement of the scheduled release tomorrow of trade data for October and the scheduled Thursday release of personal income figures for October and November.
Traders are also uncertain about investor demand for this week's sale of Treasury notes, starting with today's $19.25 billion auction of a new two-year maturity, followed by tomorrow's $12 billion of new five-year notes. If the auctions are less than successful, interest rates would have to rise to attract buyers.
In when-issued trading ahead of today's auction, two-year notes were being offered at a price to yield 5.39 percent, and the five-year notes at a price to yield 5.62 percent.
At the regular weekly bill auction yesterday, rates declined to September levels, with the average rate for both three-month and six-month bills down to 5.15 percent. Last week they were 5.30 percent and 5.20 percent, respectively.
In what is now becoming a norm at these auctions, the Government, to remain under its debt limit, again prohibited foreign central banks from buying any bills exceeding the maturity of bills they already hold.
Anthony Chan, chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corporation in Columbus, Ohio, said that everyone knew that some budget deal would eventually be reached, but that the uncertainty as to the details of such a deal appeared to worry the market.
There is concern that a deal would favor higher expenditures, which would mean higher interest rates, instead of greater debt reduction, which would lower rates.
Mr. Chan put the odds of a Fed easing today at about 40 percent: "We believe the negative market reaction to the collapse of budget negotiations has tilted the balance in favor of no change in policy."
Dana Johnson, managing director for research at First Chicago Capital Markets, said of the budget impasse: "Until now the markets had done a pretty good jop of ignoring the posturing. Now we are in this crucial period, and people are beginning to realize that the impasse is real."
He added that the market "is really concerned that Government is going to be a more lasting competitor for borrowing in the capital markets."
Mr. Johnson saw yesterday's market reaction as just the start of a response that would grow if Government negotiations continued to stall. "The bond market, stock market and dollar are all reacting as one to the budget negotiations, or lack of," he said. "I think the economy is O.K. and see no sense of urgency of the part of the Fed toward an easing."
Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston, noted the widening of the yield spread between short and long maturities and said: "On Friday there were high hopes; now both sides are not even talking numbers, but ideology. The market does not see the signs of progress it would like to see, and there is concern on how the Fed will react. I don't think the Fed will be forced into adjusting interest rates just because of the financial markets."
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.698	97.396	Discounted Rate	5.15%	5.15%	Coupon Yield	5.31%	5.38%	High Price	98.698	97.401	Discounted Rate	5.15%	5.14%	Coupon Yield	5.31%	5.37%	Low Price	98.693	97.396	Discounted Rate	5.17%	5.15%	Coupon Yield	5.33%	5.38%	Accepted at low price	11%	95%	Total applied for	$52,233,640	$43,852,022	Accepted	$14,065,853	$14,053,931	Noncompetitive	$1,441,000	$1,153,202	
 
Both issues are dated Dec. 21, 1995. The three-month bills mature on March 21, 1996, and the six-month bills mature on June 20, 1996.

HEADLINE: Mr. Pataki's Block Grants

 BODY:
The welfare and Medicaid proposals made by Gov. George Pataki last week would apply to those New York State programs the same misguided reform principle that Congressional Republicans are using to refashion Federal poverty programs. In his own variation of a block-grant system, the Governor would turn over parts of Medicaid and welfare to counties to run with fixed allotments of state money that would not change as local poverty rolls changed.
Block grants would make for bad Federal policy -- and even worse state policy, encouraging counties to skimp on New York's neediest families. Specifically, Mr. Pataki would turn over home-care and Medicaid coverage of able-bodied single adults to the counties. He would have counties run employment and other non-cash assistance programs for welfare recipients and give counties the option of taking over cash assistance for the poor. 
 The cruelty of this idea would be obvious the next time a recession hits. Counties would have to handle burgeoning caseloads either by cutting benefits, dropping enrollees or raising revenues through higher taxes, hardly likely in a recession.
Even in ordinary times, counties will be tempted to cut poverty programs, including Medicaid coverage, and pass along the savings in the form of tax cuts to businesses and families. That way counties can discourage needy people from moving in and encourage their own poor citizens to move out. Because family migration across county lines is potentially great, the incentive for counties to slash poverty benefits will also be great.
The tone of the Pataki budget plans is unfair. It rails against paying for training residents at teaching hospitals under Medicaid even though many health-care experts say the system has provided relatively high-quality, low-cost care to the hospitals' indigent and other patients. The administration accuses Medicaid of helping teaching hospitals add unnecessary layers of residents, even though the state system scrupulously avoids paying more to hospitals that hire additional residents.
New York does pay too much for Medicaid. Some of the Governor's reforms, such as placing recipients in managed care, make sense. But the excess should be put in perspective. For example, state Medicaid spending on children is only about 13 percent higher per recipient than in other Middle Atlantic states.
Some of the gap between New York and other states can be explained by New York's high cost of living. New York includes under Medicaid benefits such things as hospital coverage for able-bodied single adults that other states provide under separate programs. That way the Federal Government picks up half the tab, hardly something the Governor should be attacking. The gap that is left, after putting the accounting systems on the same basis, would not be gigantic.
Medicaid and welfare can no doubt be pruned without doing injustice. But the huge cuts proposed by Mr. Pataki and the perverse incentives that would be unleashed by the block-grant reform are attacks aimed primarily at counties and cities, like New York City, that care for the state's poor.

HEADLINE: With Cheap Fixes Completed, the Cost of Clean Air May Exceed the Benefits

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
The retreat sounded by California last week from its commitment to a tough mandate for electric cars reflects the larger quandary facing the officials who must grapple with the increasingly stringent demands of the Federal Clean Air Act. The problem with the effort to reduce air pollution further is that most of the relatively cheap fixes have already been made, economists argue, and the expensive ones may not be worth the price.
The very premise of the cleanup -- that smog can be reduced to such low levels that it no longer poses any health risk at all -- is now being questioned by serious academics as well as industry. "The technology now available will not meet the legal standard," argues Ted Russell, an environmental engineer at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh. 
 Just how the underlying conflict between the dictates of law and economics will be resolved is far from certain. The Environmental Protection Agency -- or the courts -- may reinterpret the law to allow all but a few cities off the hook. Congress may link enforcement to evidence that the benefits exceed the costs.
Some conservative analysts want to limit Washington's role altogether. "In the end, communities should decide whether improvements in air quality are more important than, say, schools or parks," suggests Jonathan Adler, the director of environmental studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington.
The Clean Air Act requires Washington to set standards for ground-level ozone -- the key pollutant in smog -- that provide "an adequate margin of safety" against "any adverse health effects," without reference to cost. And in 1993 the agency set the standard at a maximum of 12 parts ozone per billion, averaged over a one-hour period at any one of dozens of monitors in each metropolitan area.
One bad day is to be ignored. But once a city exceeds the standard at least one day a year over a three- year period, a sliding scale of remedies -- from modest policing of large- scale polluters to the reformulation of consumer products for "extreme" and "severe" ozone areas -- is supposed to apply automatically.
Ground-level ozone is formed by reactions between nitrogen oxides (NOX) and carbon-based vapors called volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the presence of bright sunlight. It builds to dangerous levels in summer, particularly where winds do not clear the air. Los Angeles has the highest concentrations and most frequent violations in the country. Sacramento, San Diego, Houston and Chicago have serious problems, too. And many cities in the Northeast -- notably New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Hartford -- are not far behind.
Virtually all gains in the war on ozone have been achieved by reducing auto emissions. And apart from a few hot summers that cloud the figures, those gains have been heartening. Outside of California, calculates Kay Howard Jones, a former E.P.A. official who is now an environmental consultant, violations have been cut in half since 1985.
But these gains have come at substantial cost. Paul Portney and Winston Harrington, researchers at the nonprofit Resources for the Future in Washington, estimate that roughly $13 billion was spent in 1994 to clean up the air. And once the additional controls on power plants, new cars, consumer products, commuting habits and vehicle maintenance kick in, Mr. Portney expects the annual bill to double.
Will Americans get their money's worth?
Along with Alan Krupnick, Mr. Portney calculated that the value of reduced incidence of asthma and other lung disorders, as measured by surveys of how willing the afflicted were to pay to alleviate the damage, was more than $1 billion a year, far short of the cost. And the disparity may only get worse over time. "There are only so many times you can go back to the well and expect a full bucket," said Robert Hahn, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute.
Take autos. By 1994, the tailpipe pollution standard reduced the uncontrolled exhaust of VOC pollutants by 98 percent. Getting the figure down to 99.5 percent will at least double the cost. And producing zero-emissions electric vehicles with the range and performance of today's cars would take another technological revolution. "People are appalled when they actually understand how little they get," Mr. Jones argues.
There may be some technical fixes but they do not go to the core of the quandary. Relying on more current data, adjusting the standard slightly and averaging it over an eight-hour period and allowing an average of three days of excessive pollution per year rather than just one would move every non-California city except Houston within spitting distance of compliance. In the same spirit, Mr. Krupnick would average ozone readings over all monitors in an area rather than simply recording the worst case.
Neither approach is likely to pass legal muster, though. For one thing, there is evidence that the damage from superfine chemical particles produced in smog along with the ozone may exacerbate lung disease. For another, the health effects of ozone have been observed at very low exposure levels. "There is no obvious place to stop," Mr. Krupnick concedes.
A straightforward alternative to fudging the health standard would be to subject it to a formal test of costs and benefits. That's the approach advocated by Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, who is a leading Republican candidate for President. But Ron White of the American Lung Association touches a popular chord of resistance to such bloodless calculations. "People have a right to breath healthful air," he said flatly.
A third approach would catch the fashionable wave of governmental decentralization. If states can set their own welfare policies, as many in Washington now favor, why not let them set their own air quality policies?
One reason is that big business is quietly -- but strongly -- opposed. Auto makers are already lobbying for a 49-state emissions standard for cars (California has its own) that would wrap the Northeast states up with the rest of the country. And consumer product manufacturers support national standards for everything from hair spray to lighter fluid: they fear the Balkanization of markets more than the chance to play one state regulator off against another. Decentralization of regulation will also be resisted by environmental groups, which are better able to influence national legislation and lack the resources to fight state-by-state battles.
However the issue plays out, the battle of electric cars in California is only one of many signs that the time of easy fixes is over. Last week California outlined three proposals that would gut the mandate that 2 percent of all vehicles sold in the state by 1998 be emission-free. Among the proposals is one that would call for voluntary electric-car production. And in New Jersey and other states, initial attempts to tighten state auto inspection programs and to mandate "trip reduction" programs for commuters in the most heavily polluted areas have already met with bitter protest. For now, the E.P.A. -- worried that it might lose the war if it attempts to fight every early battle -- has held its fire.
But the showdown cannot be postponed for long. "As cities struggle to come into compliance with virtually unattainable goals," Mr. Krupnick said, "something's got to give."

HEADLINE: The Communist Comeback

 BODY:
Less than five years ago as Communist Party leaders fled their Moscow offices, frantically destroying files as they went, the very survival of the party seemed in doubt. Sadly, Sunday's parliamentary election erased that doubt. Though a final count will not be available for several days, the Communist Party seems likely to finish with better than 20 percent of the vote, double the nearest rival. That makes it the strongest political force in Russia.
Together with the robust showing by the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party, led by the firebrand Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the election was a reversal for the forces of reform, and an undeniable rebuff to President Boris Yeltsin. His party is running third, with about 10 percent of the vote. 
 Many Russians, disillusioned by disorder and economic dislocation, plainly want stability and greater financial security. But whether they want the new Russian empire cavalierly promised by the Communists is doubtful.
The Communist resurgence is disheartening, but not calamitous. Political and economic reform in Russia have advanced too far to be brought to a dead stop by this election. The new State Duma, or lower house of Parliament, will be more conservative than the old, but not much more unified. Unequal in power to the presidency, it cannot force a drastic change in direction unless an opposition coalition can put together a two-thirds majority to overturn Yeltsin vetoes, which seems unlikely.
What it can do is slow reform. Through obstruction more than action, the new legislature can force Mr. Yeltsin to continue a drift toward more conservative policies that he began after the last parliamentary election two years ago.
Russians, taught by their own history to expect the worst, are already talking darkly of civil conflict and a return to the violent confrontations between the President and Parliament that shook Moscow in October 1993. Speculation is high that Mr. Yeltsin will cancel next June's presidential election. The same prophets predicted earlier this year that he would cancel the parliamentary election.
Russia has certainly proved itself capable of political deformity over the centuries, and there is no guarantee against new turbulence. But several points ought to be kept in mind in Moscow and Washington in the days ahead that suggest this election was a warning, but not necessarily a prelude to the end of reform.
To begin with, this was a democratic election, one of the largest in history. More than 60 percent of eligible voters, or about 60 million Russians, cast ballots. Whatever their doubts about the future, they showed their commitment to democracy. When the Bolsheviks, an earlier incarnation of the Russian Communists, came back from near-extinction in 1917, their popularity was hardly put to a vote. Nor did the Soviet Communists ever need to assemble a legislative coalition to pass a law.
While moderates remain divided, and at least one reform party lost ground, the threat of a united front of neo-Communists and nationalists seems premature. The Communist leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, an obscure official in the Soviet era, will find it no easier than other politicians to work with the mercurial Mr. Zhirinovsky.
Both men have made promises they cannot keep. Russia lacks the military and economic muscle to rebuild its empire, no matter how much the two men may like to talk about it. The Russian economy, just coming out of a tailspin, cannot be forced back under state control without crashing.
Mr. Yeltsin, for his part, must resist the temptation to resort to authoritarian rule as he deals with a quarrelsome legislature and looks ahead to a presidential election that could put a Communist or nationalist in his Kremlin office. Russians clearly relish the exercise of their voting rights, something their political leaders will have to accept.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The American Way

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL; Russell Baker is on vacation.

 BODY:
Americans really have to feel sorry for the French. They just don't have a clue how to run a country during a budget crisis. Over there the people, millions of them, go on strike against the Government. The American way is that the Government goes on strike against the people.
Our way is far better, anybody can see that. First, it takes only a handful of people, politicians in Congress and the White House, to get the job of shutting down the Government done. 
 Second, the streets don't get all clogged and messy, so there is no garbage to clean up.
Third, not too many people get hurt to make it very risky for politicians. Tourists, who can't get into museums or national parks, should be at home anyway, watching a football game or something.
The Federal employees who lose paychecks can go see the President's Christmas tree, and get all snuggly at the idea that he is paying for the electricity himself.
Maybe if the shutdown goes on he will consider paying rent for his family's personal quarters. Maybe members of Congress will charge themselves for office space. Maybe they will all evict themselves if they cannot get up the cash. That would be excellent burden-sharing.
And here is the beautiful part of doing it the American way: In a relatively short time and without having to call out the cops or the garbage collectors, the Government strike against the people will have accomplished its purpose.
Breathes there an American with mind so dead as not to understand what is going on: shutting the Government to make the other side look mean, stupid and the enemy of the people as the Presidential election campaign is really getting going?
Of course not. We know the Government was shut down not because of money or deep principle left unsettled but for political advantage.
Money: There is a gap of about $300 billion over seven years between the hardest Republican position and the official Clinton response, which is not chewing gum. But Washington knows that the gap will narrow after the Government shutdown.
As for principle the President, turning this way and that, has wound up giving the Republicans much of what they wanted: a balanced budget with a deadline, the surrender to the states of control over welfare and other parts of the budget, tax cuts and recognition of the need for Medicare change.
Now he is left with the matter of Medicaid. If he surrenders on the need and right of poor people -- just plain poor, you understand, not immigrants, welfare recipients or other such miserable specimens of humanity -- he will have jettisoned not just the poor but his own political honor.
But about the shutdown, Congress and the President are not talking either bottom-line money or unshakable principle. There is no end of legislative devices that would allow them to do the sensible thing: arrange for funds to keep the Government going while they argue over money and principle.
That approach, in case you forgot, is known as democracy, problem-solving, conciliation, common sense, judgment, words like that.
Many of them are taught, I believe, in schools that still have courses in civics, excuse the expression. And for a couple of hundred dollars a day the Government could hire a mediation expert to do the job, maybe one of the non-essential people who have been shut out of their Federal jobs.
Now: Breathes there an American with soul so dead as not to boil with rage against Congress and the White House for making such a clown out of the American government system?
Obviously yes, tens of millions of us.
Otherwise the fortunes that politicians spend for polls to keep their sticky fingers on our political pulse would have told them to watch out, that Americans would turn hard against the party that squeezes the last drop of dignity out of government, and give their votes to the party that shows any sign of political adulthood.
If I were a foreign correspondent in the United States, I would write about this Government's strike against its people, not as an economic story but a kind of style piece, the latest happening in the growing American passion for self-mutilation.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Suffers From Stalemate Over the Budget in Washington

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar kept pace with the sliding stock and bond markets yesterday as the stalemate over the Federal budget made currency traders nervous.
In early trading in Europe, the dollar was hurt as traders sought out the Swiss franc as a safe currency after gains by Communists and nationalists in Russian elections. Later drops in the United States bond and stock markets kept investors away from the dollar, as did the budget fracas, which sent some Government workers home for the second time this fall. 
 The dollar's weakness against European currencies helped bring it lower against the Japanese yen. "The dollar is closing out on a soggy note," said Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst at Smith Barney Inc.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.4290 German marks, down from 1.4432 late Friday. The dollar was also changing hands in New York at 101.52 yen, down from 102.
Meanwhile, the dollar dropped to 1.1465 Swiss francs from 1.1638 francs. During trading, the dollar hit 1.1455 Swiss francs, a level not seen since Nov. 27, when the dollar touched 1.1385 Swiss francs.
The German mark, typically a safe haven in Europe, lost some of its appeal because of its close economic ties to Russia.
European investors are also not sure if the political problems in Italy and France will allow those countries to remain committed to European unity and a single currency, which is another plus for Swiss assets.
Once trading opened in the United States, attention shifted to traders' displeasure with the stalemate over the budget. "It's like little kids, I think," said Margaret Kudarauskas, a senior foreign exchange analyst at Technical Data in Boston.
Currency traders were unsure whether the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee would lower interest rates today and were equally uncertain about what effect a rate cut would have on the dollar.
The stock and bond markets were equally uncertain, with the price of a 30-year bond dropping more than a point during trading and the Dow Jones industrial average plunging 101.52 points.
"With such a sharp decline in stocks and bonds, the few participants in the markets got spooked and squared" their positions, Ms. Kudarauskas said.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday, were: 4.9200 French francs, down from 4.9620; 1,595 Italian lire, down from 1,597, and 1.3776 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3740.
The British pound was quoted at 1.5403, down from 1.5360 on Friday.

HEADLINE: Moderate Growth Is Seen by Economists

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The economy is expected to grow moderately in the short run with inflation easing, a semiannual survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported today.
It said inflation forecasts among the 56 economists polled were lower than its last survey, in June. The Consumer Price Index is expected to grow at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the first half of 1996, compared with projections of 3.5 percent in the last survey. 
 The gross domestic product is expected to grow at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in 1996, compared with an expected rate of 2.1 percent in the current quarter.
The survey also said the economists projected that the Consumer Price Index would rise at 3 percent annually for the next decade, far lower than the 3.4 percent of the last two surveys.

HEADLINE: World of Ancient Iceman Comes Into Focus

BYLINE: By BRENDA FOWLER 

 BODY:
IT was four years ago that a vacationing German couple happened across a well-preserved body lying face-down in a slushy pocket of glacier in the Italian Alps. Since this chance discovery of what turned out to be a 5,300-year-old corpse, the world's oldest known human-flesh remains, scientists and archeologists have teased out remarkable information on the man and his environment from the equipment and clothing found with him.
A bit of ember he carried to restart his campfire was from a tree likely to have grown south of the spot where he died. That evidence suggested he was on his way from the fertile Venosta Valley in northern Italy and had probably made his home there. A grain of domesticated wheat clinging to his fur clothing indicated that he had had contact with civilization, which in those days and parts would have been a small farming village. 
 In the last year, studies of the Iceman, as the body is known, have moved beyond his accouterments to his flesh. His guardians at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, where he is being preserved at glacial temperature and humidity, have at last opened up the corpse itself to research. Using specially designed titanium instruments that leave no trace elements, doctors have snipped off tiny samples from the man's shrunken organs and tissues and delivered them to scientists in Europe and the United States for studies that are slowly building answers to the questions about the man's life and death.
In September, Dr. Werner Platzer, the Innsbruck anatomist who oversees research on the body, announced that preliminary findings showed the man's stomach was empty when he died. But his large intestine contained considerable amounts of material.
"That means he had probably not eaten for eight hours," Dr. Platzer said in a telephone interview, adding that the contents of the large intestine were being investigated now. The finding, which had been predicted by radiologists' interpretations of CAT scans, hinted that the man may have been hungry and weak when he died. A hypothesis that has strong support among scientists is that he died of hypothermia after being surprised by one of the sudden snowstorms that come up on the Hauslabjoch, the 10,500-foot pass over the main ridge where he was found.
Other new findings suggest that the man had not been in perfect health. Dr. Andrew Jones, an environmental archeologist at the Archaeological Resource Centre in York, England, identified the eggs of a parasitic whipworm in a small sample from the man's colon. The preliminary results do not reveal how severe the infestation was, and Dr. Jones could not say whether the parasites caused the man any discomfort. Light cases often go unnoticed , but severe infestations carry severe symptoms, Dr. Jones said, and even a moderate infestation may have weakened the man.
Another potential vulnerability appeared in the man's lungs, where Dr. Raul J. Cano, a microbiologist at the California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, recently found a fungus called Aspergillus, most likely the species fumigatus.
"I know that Aspergillus has been associated with lung disease, but we have no reason to believe he died of anything other than natural causes," said Dr. Cano, who isolated the DNA of the fungus. And last year doctors found that the lungs were as black as a smoker's, probably a result of living in a shelter with an open hearth.
Discussion of what caused the man's death has been complicated from the start by X-rays that show five broken ribs on his right side. Radiologists are unable to determine whether these fractures occurred before the man's death, under the weight of the glacier or during the rough recovery.
"There are so many rib fractures, they're angled, the chest is severely decreased in diameter, and the posterior ribs are dislocated from the spine," said Dr. William A. Murphy Jr., the head of diagnostic imaging at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and one of the radiologists who has studied the thousands of X-rays and CAT scans of the body. "It's my opinion that it would take significant force to do that, and I can imagine that force from the weight of ice."
But neither he nor Dr. Dieter zur Nedden, his Austrian colleague, believes the question will soon be laid to rest. That keeps alive the theory of Dr. Konrad Spindler, the University of Innsbruck prehistorian who proposed that the man had been involved in a fight in his village then fled into the mountains, where he succumbed to his injuries.
There are, indeed, signs that the man's life had not been easy. Dr. Horst Seidler, an anthropologist at the University of Vienna, said the man may have lived through episodes of extreme hunger, illness or metal poisoning that arrested his growth. Examining X-rays of the man's shinbone, Dr. Seidler and his colleagues found 17 Harris lines, thin layers of bony material that form in the hollow of a bone when growth stops. They calculated that severe disturbances occurred in the man's 9th, 15th and 16th years.
"Possibly this had to do with periods of hunger in the transition between seasons," Dr. Seidler said.
One of Dr. Seidler's next projects is to compare tissue samples from the Iceman with those of the 500-year-old Peruvian girl whose discovery on an Andes mountain was announced in October.
"These two finds were conserved in the same condition," said Dr. Seidler, who was recently in Peru. "This is the first time we've had material with which to compare him."
Other findings illuminate the man's activities during his life. In September, Dr. Don Brothwell, an archeologist at the University of York in England, announced that his team had detected unusually large amounts of copper on the surface of the man's hair. In a telephone interview Dr. Brothwell suggested that the prehistoric man, who was found with a copper ax, may have been involved in the processing of copper, the first metal smelted.
"What I'm hoping to do is check out if there is copper on the fingers and in the lungs," Dr. Brothwell said, noting that if the man were smelting he would have been breathing in copper particles.
In the Copper Age, a period that may have begun as early as 3,000 B.C. in the Alpine region, people searched for malachite, a copper carbonate that appears naturally as a bluish-green efflorescence on rock and cliff sides. They scraped and flaked off the malachite and then smelted it in a crucible in a campfire. They increased the fire's temperature by blowing oxygen into it through bellows. The nearly pure copper would then be poured into a stone mold, for an ax, for example. Some prehistorians have wondered whether the man was in the mountains looking for malachite, though he was not found with digging tools..
"We can only speculate about how metal production was organized," said Dr. Lawrence Barfield, an archeologist at the University of Birmingham in England who studies the Copper Age in northern Italy. "We don't know whether there were specialists doing it or whether it was something that anybody could do."
But even if the man did not make his copper ax, he still had to polish and sharpen it, and that process, too, could have left dust on his hands that he then rubbed into his hair, said Dr. Markus Egg at the Roman-Germanic Central Museum in Mainz, Germany, where the equipment and clothing have been conserved and studied.
While much of the remaining research is in the court of doctors and scientists, archeologists, too, are still intrigued with the find. Archeologists in Italy and Austria have spent the last three summers looking for more signs of prehistoric human activity in the high valleys below the Hauslabjoch, and recent excavations have turned up several sites where hunters who lived millennia before the Iceman stopped to camp overnight, built a fire and left a few flint tools and flakes behind.
At least three of these sites were found along a path over which local shepherds still guide their sheep to summer pastures, and the Iceman was also found on this route, said Dr. Annaluisa Pedrotti, an archeologist at the University of Trient in Italy.
At that time, Dr. Pedrotti pointed out, a person would not climb to such altitudes without sound economic or, possibly, religious reasons. Like most prehistorians involved in the project, both she and Dr. Egg think the man was probably a farmer or shepherd on his way to or from the summer pastures nearby. Yet even this interpretation has problems.
"We still don't have any typical shepherd equipment with him," Dr. Butterfield said. "Where is his walking stick? Why isn't he wearing anything made of sheepskin?"

HEADLINE: PERSONAL COMPUTERS;
Digital Outlets for Your Holiday Generosity

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
BEFORE hyperlinking directly to the traditional roundup of last-minute holiday computer gift suggestions, it seems appropriate to switch the computer off for a moment to consider gifts that cannot be measured in megabytes or dollars.
The headlong rush to the Internet and the Information Age has left many people behind, and others befuddled. True, many people have no desire to log on and get sucked into what they consider cybernonsense, but others are worried that they will be at a social and economic disadvantage in years to come if they do not learn to surf the Internet and the World Wide Web. 
 In a world that has increasingly come to value nanoseconds and megahertz, one of the greatest gifts one can give is time. Many readers of this column are experienced computer users and cybernauts, and there are unlimited opportunities to share their skills and insights with the information-needy at schools, nursing homes, community centers, houses of worship and neighbors' homes.
The assistance can be as simple as helping a harried elementary teacher who is trying to multitask 25 second-graders in the computer lab or taking over the task of troubleshooting the printer connection.
Thanks to America Online's aggressive mailing campaigns, dumping a steady stream of trial diskettes in everyone's mailboxes, many of us have stacks of perfectly good but unwanted diskettes that a church or community center can put to good use. The same goes for old equipment and retired software.
Someone with a laptop and modem might find it rewarding to take the folks at a local retirement center on a surfing safari on the Internet.
They may be surprised, as I was recently at one retirement facility, that the questions are not "What's a modem?" but rather, "Our global positioning satellite system on the roof is malfunctioning; can you help?" (Sorry, no.)
Our senior citizens, it turns out, are just as likely as our young school children to be interested in and experienced with computers and on-line technology.
Thomas E. Miller, publisher of Interactive Consumers, a monthly report from the research firm Find/ SVP, said a recent survey "poked some holes in the cybernaut image." The heaviest Internet and on-line use among teen-agers occurs at college, he said.
"Once you break through the stereotype of the teen hacker, you find most kids don't know much about it," Mr. Miller said. "We found more adults were on line, and stayed on line longer, than kids. The average age of the modem user is in the 40's."
For seniors who are physically isolated, the Internet allows them to continue an education or connect with someone, somewhere, with whom they share an interest, Mr. Miller said. For others, the attraction might be the electronic mail that reconnects them to children, grandchildren and friends who are far away.
For reasons not fully understood, it seems easier to write or reply to electronic mail than to pick up a phone or type a physical letter.
For those with dollars to spend, as always there is no shortage of computer-related things to buy.
One often-overlooked possibility for computer-related holiday giving is a second phone line. The cliche of the next decade may be the teen-ager who is exasperated because Mom and Dad are tying up the phone for hours, doing their stupid modem chat sessions and electronic banking.
Another gift favorite is a CD-ROM drive. Almost all of the really cool software arriving in this office in the last six months (indeed, more than 75 percent of all software, interesting or not) came on laser-pitted CD-ROM disks.
A quad-speed, or 4X, drive is the current standard and is likely to remain so until the new generation of digital video (or maybe versatile) disks arrive late next year. I am distrustful of the newer 6X drives, which recall the fiasco of the 3X drives that were in vogue for about 10 minutes during the transition from double-speeds to quad-speeds.
Okay, now for some Macintosh software picks, all in the $50 range. Nick, a 13-year-old beta tester, wants Santa to know that games are intrinsically more valuable and fun than educational software or personal productivity applications. As a guide, he offered us his top picks of the year and some pithy comments:
1. A-10 Attack!, from ParSoft, telephone (214) 479-1340. "Simply the best flight simulator," based on the ugly but effective A-10A Thunderbolt II Warthog that chewed up Iraqi airfields in the last war. May see action in Bosnia.
2. Wing Commander III, from Origin Systems, (512) 434-4263. "Just incredible, lots of video, and a plot." Not just a plot, a whole screenplay. Origin spent several million dollars making this one, and it shows.
3. Dark Forces, from LucasArts, (415) 472-3400. "By far the best first-person virtual shoot-'em-up." Very similar to Doom, except that it has more plot and fewer internal organs splattered on the walls.
4. Havoc, from Reality Bytes, (617) 261-2581. "The polygon graphics are great." Essentially, a flight simulator in which alien bad guys shoot back over a surreal landscape.

Financial Markets Plunge On the Budget Impasse
Financial markets tumbled in what analysts called a resoundingly negative reaction to the failure of Congress and the White House to resolve the budget impasse. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 101.52 points, or 1.96 percent, to 5,075.21, its largest percentage decline in more than a year. The Nasdaq composite index, which is rich with the technology companies that have fueled much of the broad market's gains this year, slid 27.92 points, or 2.71 percent, to 1,002.56. [Page A1.]
 
The yield on the long bond surged to its highest level in nearly three weeks, 6.20 percent, up from 6.09 percent on Friday, as prices in the credit markets slid. [D20.]
 
The Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee is to consider today whether to cut rates for the second time this year, a tough decision with so much of the Government closed and economic data delayed. [D2.]
 
Clinton Vetoes Two Spending Bills
President Clinton used both carrot and stick on Congressional Republicans, vetoing two more spending bills but holding out the possibility of renewed face-to-face talks to compromise on budget balancing. The second partial Government shutdown in a month idled about 260,000 Federal employees. [A1.]
 
 
Advanced Micro Sees Profit Slide
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. said its fourth-quarter earnings would be lower than last quarter's, which would also be earnings below the consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts, because it has not yet been able to produce a chip to compete with Intel's Pentium. The announcement sent its stock down $1.125, to $17.125, and helped fuel a broad selloff in technology shares. [D5.]
 
Encyclopaedia Britannica to Be Sold
Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc., the troubled publisher of the venerable encyclopedia, said that the company would be sold for an undisclosed amount to an investment group led by Jacob E. Safra, a financier based in Switzerland. [D2.]
 
A Merger in Surgical Equipment
Two companies that make surgical sterilization equipment, Steris and Amsco International, agreed to merge yesterday in a stock swap initially valued at about $660 million; the value of the deal plunged to $505 million in later trading. [D4.]
 
Healthsouth, which provides surgical and rehabilitation services on an outpatient basis, agreed to buy Advantage Health for stock worth about $325 million. [D4.]
 
American Brands
To Buy Cobra Golf
Cobra Golf Inc., a maker of premium clubs, said that it had agreed to be acquired by American Brands Inc. for $700 million, sending its stock up $7.875, to $35.50, in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq market, just under American Brands' offer of $36 a share. [D4.]
 
Con Ed Accused of Intimidation
A Federal monitor criticized Consolidated Edison, saying it had punished several employees for reporting environmental problems. The monitor was appointed after the utility failed to report asbestos was released in the 1989 explosion of a steam pipe, for which it was ordered to pay a $2 million fine. The company defended its efforts to improve its environmental practices. [B1.]
 
Trade Provision Postponed
The Clinton Administration and the Mexican Government delayed the day when Mexican trucks can move freely through much of the Southwest, backing away from a politically volatile provision of the North American Free Trade Agreement. [B10.]
 
Arch Agrees to Buy Westlink
Arch Communications agreed to acquire the privately owned Westlink Holdings for $340 million. After the deal, Arch would have almost 2.5 million subscribers. [D7.]
 
 
California Economy on the Mend
California is beginning to recover its standing as the nation's most powerful economy, after its worst economic slump since the Depression. Fueled by the entertainment and technology industries and international trade, job growth in the state is now running above 2.3 percent annually, about half again the national rate of 1.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Down for 5 Years, California Economy Shows Signs of Regaining Its Glitter

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Battered for five years by Mother Nature and the worst recession since the Depression, California is finally beginning to recover its standing as the nation's most powerful economic machine.
Job growth in the state is now running better than 2.3 percent annually, about half again the national rate of 1.5, thanks to an employment explosion in the entertainment industry, advanced technology manufacturing and international trade -- the new Big 3 of the California economy. 
 By early next year, economists say, most of the 525,000 jobs lost in the five-year recession will have been replaced -- significantly without any real recovery in the construction, aerospace and military industries, the old Big 3 whose collapse led the state into its grinding downturn.
"California is back!" Gov. Pete Wilson now boasts, prompting his aides to order him a limousine license plate that sports that happy proclamation.
The great exodus of people fleeing to other states to escape California's fires, floods, earthquakes, riots and economic cave-ins, including the Orange County bankruptcy debacle, has sharply slowed, as much as 20 percent, according to real estate agents and driving permit bureaus in some of those states.
Conversely, housing agents and driving bureau officials in California say that the migration rate this year to California from other states is running more than 15 percent ahead of last year's.
Demographers report that California -- still the nation's most populous state, with almost 33 million people -- is again becoming a magnet for the young, adventurous, entrepreneurial types who have flocked here for more than 150 years.
Based on current trends, demographers say, in the coming decade California's population will increase 1.6 percent a year, almost twice the nine-tenths of 1 percent annual increase estimated for the nation as a whole.
Indeed, California's recovery is proceeding so rapidly that state tax receipts are running close to 3 percent above original estimates for the current fiscal year, a budgetary miscalculation that works out to a yearly windfall of more than $1 billion. And the pulling and tugging over this windfall is already under way at the Capitol in Sacramento over whether to spend the surplus on schools or prisons, or to use it to cut taxes.
Before the state's economy collapsed, the total value of California's annual output of goods and services was about $750 billion, enough to rank it not only as the biggest economy in the United States, but also as the eighth largest among all the economies of the world. With its gross product now close to $900 billion, California has regained that economic status and, indeed, now ranks seventh among the world's economies.
"It's been an impressive bounce back from a really tough place," said David Hensley, a specialist on the California economy for Salomon Brothers Inc., the New York financial concern.
"The old California energy is back in the air," Mr. Hensley continued. "There's the old churning and dreaming and business adventurism.
"There's also the old determined optimism that sees opportunity in the ashes of recession, earthquakes and fire. I'm definitely bullish on California."
Howard Flagg, president of PairGain, a manufacturer of advanced technology telecommunications equipment in the Los Angeles area, was one of those who saw opportunity in the depths of adversity and helped turn the state's economy around. His company has increased gross sales tenfold in the last three years, to more than $100 million annually.
"We decided to expand right when things were at the worst in the state," Mr. Flagg said. "We never lost faith in California or cutting-edge industries like ours that we're convinced are the state's future. We were positioned right and the time was right and we moved, even while others were still sinking. It's the old California success story."
But there are some qualifiers.
Despite all the favorable economic indicators, the state's unemployment rate in recent months has been hovering stubbornly around 8 percent, at least two percentage points above the national rate. As much as anything, that high figure reflects just how low California's economy fell during the recession and how far it still has to go to fully recover.
Moreover, the most recent figures from the United States Labor Department indicate that California's unemployment rate could be as much as three points above the national rate, though many employment experts question that estimate, saying the recovery is moving so fast that labor surveys cannot accurately follow it.
Also, the California housing market, once the most overheated in the nation, remains in the economic doldrums, as does the residential construction industry. Many houses -- those few that are selling -- are going for 30 percent to 40 percent less than they might have brought at the turn of the decade.
Nor is there any sign that the aerospace and defense industries will soon make an economic comeback, given the big national cutbacks in both fields.
And if California has to contend with another natural disaster or if the national economy falters, the state's economy might again find itself in big trouble.
But for the moment, most businesses here are doing very well, and expectations are again running high.
"The pluses far outweigh the minuses," said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy, a Palo Alto firm that supplies analysis to private companies and public institutions, "and they are especially dramatic because many trace their roots to the depths of the recession, when everything else seemed headed down the tubes."
From 1990 to 1995, for example, international trade grew so rapidly in California -- 70 percent over all -- that the twin ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles overtook the ports of New York City and northern New Jersey as the nation's busiest. The value of goods going across the California docks is nearing $150 billion a year, compared with about $140 billion for the docks in the New York area.
Equally striking -- and equally unheralded until recently -- while the recession and cutbacks in military spending slashed employment in the state's defense industries to 150,000 workers, from a high of more than 400,000, employment in the film and television industry was almost doubling.
At the start of the recession, "Hollywood" employed about 85,000 people. Today, according to the California Employment Development Department, the entertainment industry employs at least as many people as hold jobs in what is left of the defense industry.
The ultimate economic metaphor for this switch may have been the site recently chosen for building the newest high-tech California studio, DreamWorks. It is a hangar once used to build military aircraft, including Howard Hughes's experimental Spruce Goose, a 2,000-ton seaplane built almost entirely of wood. The plane, designed to ferry soldiers and tanks in World War II, made its only flight on Nov. 2, 1947.
Along with DreamWorks, nearly 43,000 new businesses have been incorporated in California in the last year, a 7 percent increase. For the nation as a whole, the rate was 5 percent.
"At almost every important turn," Mr. Levy said, "you find that California once again is outstripping the national average."
Many of the new businesses that were incorporated were in entertainment, advanced technology and international trade, industries that have now fully replaced the aerospace, military contracting and construction industries as the economic pillars of California.
And the new companies tend to pay higher salaries than the older industries, thus raising average earnings in the state.
Twenty-two percent of California households now have annual incomes of more than $75,000, compared with 17 percent nationally.
"This is a recovery like no other, in a state that has had its full share of boom and bust over the years -- the gold rush, the oil gush, the house craze, aerospace and defense contracting," said Joel Kotkin, an analyst at Pepperdine University in Malibu who specializes in West Coast business trends and public policy. "The fundamental economic mix has changed hugely, and it's the kind of change that is positioning the state extremely well for the 21st century."
Mr. Kotkin added: "While it's true that high-paying, cutting-edge technologies, new-age television and film and expanding Pacific Rim trade were all present in California before the recession started, each of these industries happened to really boom and come fully into its own in the middle of it. Now they're leading our way to the new future."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
After Many Selloffs, a Rally. And Now?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Once again, Wall Street has thrown a small panic. Now the question is whether individual investors will once again throw money into the market to combat weakness. Recent history suggests they will.
Yesterday's plunge of the Dow Jones industrial average, in which it lost 101.52 points, or 1.96 percent, closing at 5,075.21, was the worst for the index in more than a year, and was the eighth worst day since the start of 1991. That period has been remarkable for being the longest stretch in history in which the index has not had a 10 percent correction. 
 With technology stocks hit especially hard, the Nasdaq composite index turned in an even worse performance, falling 27.92 points, or 2.71 percent, to 1,002.56.
Explanations for the fall ranged from concerns over 1996 profits to the continued budget stalemate in Washington. That dispute had heretofore been deemed irrelevant except as poor theater by most investors, who assumed a deal would be reached eventually.
But for the first time, Wall Street seemed to have something immediate at stake in the budget battle. The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets today, and it has widely been expected to cut short-term interest rates. Indeed, the bond market has rallied so strongly that it was clear a cut was expected. But there is fear that the Fed may defer any action until a budget deal is cut, and that sparked selling in the bond market yesterday, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rising to 6.20 percent from 6.09 percent.
A cynic might even suspect that in selling off just before the meeting, the markets were sending a message to Washington that the Fed had better ease credit if it did not want a continued slide in prices.
It could also be argued that by some traditional methods of valuation -- notably the level of dividends -- the stock market is overvalued, but that has been true for months, without bothering investors very much. Quantitative types have taken refuge in rapidly rising profits and falling interest rates, both of which have tended to indicate that stocks were not ridiculously high. Were either or both of those to come into question, stocks could be vulnerable.
But since the 1987 crash -- which proved to be a wonderful buying opportunity -- and especially since the end of the 1990 correction, one of the saving graces of the market has been that mutual fund investors were willing to throw money at stocks at any sign of weakness. They have generally been right to do so, at least so far, as prices have generally rallied quickly.
The willingness of mutual fund buyers to leap in at any sign of weakness has, in fact, helped to produce remarkably few days this year that closed with significant losses. Many days that started badly have seen rallies -- brought on in part by mutual fund buying -- that pared the dips by the end of the sessions.
Yesterday was, in fact, only the sixth day of 1995 in which the Dow fell at least 1 percent. By contrast, there were 18 such days in 1994.
Among the other nine days on the 10 worst list for 1991-95, the Dow has rallied the following day in seven instances. Only twice did it take as much as a month for the index to completely recover its losses from the bad day. On the worst day of the period -- Nov. 15, 1991, when the index fell 3.93 percent in part due to drops in biotechnology stocks, that year's high fliers -- it took six weeks, until Dec. 26, for prices to totally make up the loss.
And -- the precedent that might be most bothersome if yesterday's bond market weakness were to continue -- the 2.42 percent plunge on Feb. 4, 1994, coming as the Fed tightened credit, set off a weak market that endured for months. Not until Sept. 8, 1994 did the Dow return to the level it was at the day before the big drop.

 Otherwise, though, it has generally been clear sailing. In one case, the Dow tumbled 2.36 percent on Aug. 19, 1991. Two days later, it had wiped out that entire fall.
Will it happen again? There was no immediate sign of panic among mutual fund investors yesterday, reported Steve Norwitz, a spokesman for T. Rowe Price, who said there were many more questions about end-of-year tax issues than about the falling market.
Charles Biderman, the publisher of Mutual Fund Trim Tabs, a newsletter that compiles figures on fund cash flows, said that two weeks ago the flow of cash into stock funds was the highest ever, and that while it was down last week, the figure was still very strong. He said he expected prices to reverse by tomorrow.

HEADLINE: Pressure on Fed Grows With Budget Standoff

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
When the Federal Reserve's interest-rate policy committee meets on Tuesday, nervous budget negotiators and nervous financial markets will be watching closely. And that makes the Fed itself nervous.
The recent record-setting climbs on Wall Street have been based in part on interlocking assumptions about what would happen in Washington: that President Clinton and Congress would strike a deal to balance the budget, and that the Fed would give its blessing in the form of an interest rate cut that would allow the markets to continue their climb. 
 Today's 101-point fall by the Dow Jones industrial average reflected investors' worries that since the politicians show no sign of delivering on their part of the equation, the Fed will not deliver on its.
The Fed, which loves to see itself as above the political and market fray, hates outside pressure. Yet to an unusual degree, it finds itself in a pickle of its own making.
While the central bank has customarily kept a low profile in budget battles, Alan Greenspan, its chairman, has been more vocal this year in pushing for a balanced budget.
Of all the Washington officials who welcomed the prospect of a Republican Congress producing a balanced budget, few were as optimistic as those at the Federal Reserve. And within the Fed's chambers, few were as enthusiastic as Mr. Greenspan.
In January, he volunteered to the House and Senate Budget Committees a quick way to save up to $50 billion a year: reduce the inflation adjustments for many tax and spending programs. In February, he predicted that the Fed would cut interest rates if Republicans cut the budget so deeply that the economy slowed. And in the months since then, he has repeatedly called for a credible plan matching Federal spending with Federal revenue.
Mr. Greenspan has said that a credible deal to reduce the budget deficit would produce a drop in market interest rates, as demand for credit diminished, and that the Fed would likely accommodate that fall, presumably by reducing the short-term interest rates it controls.
Fed officials have justified Mr. Greenspan's role by pointing to his background as a budget expert. And they have emphasized the long tradition among central banks of pushing for balanced budgets, which tend to reduce inflation pressures.
As evidence increases that the economy is slowing while inflation remains under control, the question now is whether the Federal Reserve is willing to cut interest rates without waiting for a budget deal. By coincidence, Fed officials will be meeting for a second time during a partial shutdown of the Government.
Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman and a Clinton appointee who has often differed with Mr. Greenspan, is increasingly critical of linking interest-rate policy and the budget. "The idea that we should or would reward or punish the budget deal is pernicious," he said in a recent interview.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, another Fed governor, sided with Mr. Greenspan in contending during a recent interview that the central bank should pay close attention to budget policy because Federal spending accounts for nearly a quarter of the nation's economic activity.
A growing number of Wall Street analysts and former Fed officials say the central bank may decide to put aside the uncertainty about the budget and focus on the economy's strengths and weaknesses. While the Fed may not know the overall shape of the deal, they point out that many of the outlines are becoming clear.
President Clinton has already signed seven of the 13 spending bills for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. Even if all 13 bills are passed in the form Republicans want, they would only cut spending by $23 billion, or three-tenths of 1 percent of the nation's economic output. And while some of the spending cuts in the budget reconciliation bill are ambitious, many would not take effect this fiscal year.
"The budget deal is really not going to factor into their thinking to any significant degree," said Lyle E. Gramley, a former Fed governor who thought the central bank would leave rates unchanged. "Their discussion is going to be focused primarily on how fast or how slow the economy is going to be growing in the second half of next year, and the signals are really hard to decipher."
Evidence that the economy may be slowing includes weakening demand for new factory equipment, a slow start in October to the Christmas retail season, lackluster car sales, the absence of consumer inflation in November, and the growing number of Americans who are behind on personal debts. But evidence that the economy is still fairly strong includes shortages of skilled workers in Midwest cities, strengthening commercial real estate construction, rising bank loans, a rise in producer prices in November, and a recent rebound in most retail sales.
The Federal Reserve's situation is complicated by the approaching Presidential primary season and the expiration on March 2 of Mr. Greenspan's term as chairman. As the Administration's decision on Mr. Greenspan's reappointment draws near, the Fed's decisions are seen in an increasingly political light.

HEADLINE: U.S. Responds Calmly to Communist Gains in Russian Vote

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration responded with equanimity today to the preliminary outcome of parliamentary elections in Russia, despite the revival at the polls of the once-moribund Communist Party.
"I think there's a sense of calm and perspective about this election," said Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman. 
 Mr. Burns said the outcome, which was largely expected, was inconclusive in the fractured political environment of 43 parties, even though the Communists have gained more than 20 percent of the votes reported when today's round of counting ended.
The results so far indicate that the Communists are replacing the nationalist party of Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky as the leading anti-reform element in the lower house of Parliament. But Administration officials said they did not see any need to adjust Washington's policy toward Russia and the Government of Boris N. Yeltsin.
Even the apparent plurality achieved by the Communists leaves them well short of a working majority, said Administration officials, who concluded that more than three in four Russian voters did not support a return to the past. They noted that the Communist surge was offset by a decline in support for Mr. Zhirinovsky's nationalists, which meant that the coalition of forces opposing President Yeltsin's liberalization policies had not really increased.
"At this point, I think it seems likely that the new Duma that was elected yesterday will not be strikingly different than the Duma that has been in session for the last few years," Mr. Burns said today, referring to the lower house of the Parliament. In essence, he said, the results mean that one-third of the legislators would oppose economic reform, another third would support it and the rest would be in the middle.
The votes reported so far apply to seats allocated to political parties, which account for only half of the 450 seats in the lower house. The results for remaining seats will not be known for some days. Those seats are elected from among individual candidates who represent themselves and are expected to hew more closely to the center because they will be elected foremost on the basis of local issues.
Because the lower house of Parliament is constitutionally much weaker than the presidency, Administration officials are also treating yesterday's elections as a kind of rehearsal for the presidential elections next June that will determine Mr. Yeltsin's political survival.
It also seems likely that the Administration has been looking beyond President Yeltsin, who is not only politically unpopular at home but also suffered a heart attack recently, to identify younger, more vigorous Russian politicians who support economic reform.
Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, said, "What remains clear after the election is that the political culture of Russia is still multi-faceted and quite dynamic, with a lot of different participants, a lot of different factions, a lot of different points of view of what Russia's political future should hold."
While conceding that the Communists had made a strong showing, Mr. McCurry said, "We also believe that there is a strong presence in the newly elected Duma of reformers and those committed to democracy and market economics."
Even so, Administration officials acknowledge some discomfort with the new prominence of the Communists, whose leader, Gennadi Zyuganov, has spoken of reconstituting the Soviet Union.
"It certainly doesn't hearten those of us who believe in democracy and reform," Mr. Burns said at today's State Department briefing.
But another senior Administration official observed that it would be hard to put the Soviet Union back together because Russia, like the West, recognizes the sovereignty of the other former Soviet republics.
"Russians are looking to the future, not looking to turn back the clock, but they have very different ideas of what the future should be," he said.
The official observed that foreign policy issues had not figured in the recent political campaign, which focused far more on the debate over Russia's troubled transition to a market economy.
The final composition of the lower house, and its variance with President Yeltsin, will not become clear until it is known how many political parties garner 5 percent or more of the total vote, which is the threshhold for inclusion in the legislature.
Dr. Harvey D. Balzer, director of the Center for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies at Georgetown University, agreed that the outcome so far did not pose a threat to the Administration's relationship with Moscow. "Overall, it probably deserves a sigh of relief," he said.
Mr. Burns, who previously served as a Russian affairs specialist in the National Security Council, offered another reason for the relative calm with which the Administration accepted the election news. When the nationalists under Mr. Zhirinovsky made gains in the first parliamentary elections in 1993, Mr. Burns recalled, "there was pretty much shock" inside the White House. This time around, he said, it was expected that perhaps a third of the Russians would not be reconciled to change.

HEADLINE: CLINTON, GINGRICH AND DOLE PLEDGE A DEAL ON BUDGET

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
In the first sign of a break in the budget impasse, President Clinton and the Republican leaders of Congress agreed today that they would personally negotiate an agreement to balance the Federal budget in seven years. After the White House made a concession the Republicans had sought, the Congressional leaders said they hoped to reach the agreement before the new year.
Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, said they would meet with Mr. Clinton on Wednesday to try to work out the framework of an agreement for balancing the budget. "It's a big step," Mr. Dole said. "We're serious about this now." 
 Mr. Gingrich said that if further progress occurred in Wednesday's meeting, Congress would consider a temporary spending bill to end the partial Government shutdown that left 260,000 Federal workers idled for a second day today. And the White House chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta, made clear tonight that negotiators were trying to pave the way for such a bill to be passed on Wednesday.
Mr. Dole said that such a measure could finance the Government through Dec. 27 or 28, putting off the possibility of any further upheaval at least until after Christmas.
The Republican leaders painted Mr. Clinton's pledge of personal involvement as an important turn in the yearlong budget dispute. "We know there are some major decisions that the President, the Speaker, the majority leader are going to have to make," Mr. Dole said.
Yet, despite the optimistic talk, it was not clear that the two sides had reached any substantive understanding on the issues that divided them and there was even some initial confusion between the White House and the Republican leaders over what occurred in the two-hour meeting today.
Mr. Gingrich said the President had agreed to use the economic assumptions of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in the negotiations, a concession that the Republicans had been seeking. Those forecasts are less optimistic than the White House projections and would require deeper cuts to reach a balanced budget. Mr. Gingrich also said that the two sides had pledged to try to conclude a budget agreement by New Year's Day.
But Vice President Al Gore, who attended the Oval Office session, said that there was a "slight misunderstanding" and that there had been no pledge to use the Congressional Budget Office's assumptions. He also said no timetable had been set for an agreement.
"If it is possible to do that by the end of the year, we'll do that," he said. But minutes later, Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, amended Mr. Gore's remarks and said that the President had agreed that when any individual part of the budget was discussed, the parties would use Congressional Budget Office estimates of how much it would save or cost.
The meeting was the first time that the President and the Republican leaders had sat together since mid-November, when they made an unsuccessful effort to avert the first partial Government shutdown, which lasted six days.
Mr. Panetta met tonight with Congressional budget negotiators to develop a framework for Wednesday's talks. Leaving Capitol Hill midevening, he said the group was "making good progress."
Mr. Panetta said the President would not put forth a new budget proposal to Congressional leaders on Wednesday, but that a range of proposals would be examined.
Besides the competing budget plans already drawn up by Mr. Clinton and by Congressional Republicans, plans have been drafted by conservative Democrats, by Senate Democrats and by a bipartisan group of Senators.
In addition, the White House and a task force of Congressional Democrats have been working behind the scenes for days to draw up a plan that could hold the allegiance of both liberal and conservative Democrats.
Senate Democrats said today that that plan would hold firm on Mr. Clinton's proposals to slow the growth of Medicare benefits by only $124 billion and Medicaid by $54 billion -- as measured under the economic assumptions of the Office of Management and Budget, the White House budget office. Democrats said it would include a tax cut ranging from $40 billion to $69 billion, compared with the Republicans' latest proposal for a $240 billion tax cut over seven years.
The Democrats also want $80 billion less in other domestic spending cuts than the Republicans and they are seeking $31 billion more in cuts from programs that provide Federal benefits to private corporations. Yet it was far from clear that such a proposal would be acceptable to Republicans or even some conservative Democrats. And White House officials said tonight that they did not plan to present it on Wednesday.
Showing how skeptical some Republicans would be to any plan that stuck to Mr. Clinton's own Medicare and Medicaid numbers, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority whip, said that a seven-year balanced-budget plan containing those figures would be "no deal at all," even if it used Congress's preferred economic assumptions.
In November, to end an impasse that left the Government partly shut for six days, Mr. Clinton agreed to embrace the Republican goal of balancing the budget in seven years, and to use updated assumptions about national economic performance made by the Congressional Budget Office, in consultation with his own budget advisers. The agreement also said the budget must "protect future generations, ensure Medicare solvency, reform welfare and provide adequate funding" for programs ranging from Medicaid to the environment.
Since then the talks have foundered on several points. One has been on what assumptions to make about national economic performance. The Republicans have insisted on using the predictions of the Congressional Budget Office, which are slightly more conservative than the White House budget office. The conservative assumptions mean that millions of dollars more in budget cuts have to be made to reach a balanced budget by 2002.
An even more difficult question for negotiators is the fate of Medicare, the health care program for the elderly, and Medicaid, which provides health benefits for the poor. Democrats have been vowing to protect these programs.
Republicans in their latest budget proposal are seeking $202 billion in savings in Medicare, and $117 billion in savings in Medicaid, over seven years. Mr. Clinton is seeking $124 billion in Medicare savings and $54 billion in Medicaid, over the same period.
In a sign of how difficult it may be to reach a budget agreement despite the best intentions, Mr. Clinton earlier today acknowledged that disputes remained on "80 or 90 issues, policy issues that we have some differences on."
Also earlier today, before the late-afternoon agreement to go into high-gear negotiations, both sides in the dispute sent stinging messages to each other and demonstrations of their power to hold the other side hostage in negotiations.
Shortly before Mr. Clinton huddled with Mr. Dole and Mr. Gingrich, the President underscored the stalemate by vetoing the third Republican spending bill in two days.
Flanked by Attorney General Janet Reno and uniformed police officers, Mr. Clinton rejected a spending measure for the State, Justice and Commerce Departments and the Federal judiciary because it would convert a police hiring program that was a centerpiece of the 1994 anti-crime legislation into a block grant to states. The grant would allow the money to be used broadly for crime-fighting and not necessarily on new officers.
Mr. Clinton said the bill's failure to pay for more police would "turn back the clock" on efforts to fight crime in America. House Republicans forced a floor vote on Mr. Clinton's most recent budget offer -- sending it to bipartisan defeat by a vote of 412 to 0.
Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, a Republican from upstate New York, argued that Mr. Clinton was trying to pawn off an unbalanced budget as a balanced one.
"Just as a rose is a rose is a rose, a balanced budget is a balanced budget is a balanced budget," Mr. Solomon said. "And just as a rose by any other name smells sweet, an unbalanced budget by any other name smells rotten."
In a fiery speech, Representative Harold L. Volkmer, Democrat of Missouri, denounced the Republicans for allowing the partial Government shutdown to continue.
"You're not a patriot when you're willing to shut down Wall Street, when you're willing to shut down the bond market, when you're willing to tell investors that your money isn't worth anything when you get to the bond market," Mr. Volkmer said.
Despite the hard-line poses, both sides have come under increasing public pressure to strike a deal.
The chief executives of some of the nation's largest companies and financial houses today took out a two-page advertisement in leading newspapers, including The New York Times, urging the sides in the budget battle to strike a deal.
The advertisement said: "Without a balanced budget, the party's over. No matter which party you're in."

NEW YORK CITY
 
Gunman Kills 5 in the Bronx
A would-be robber who relatives said had a history of mental illness walked into a shoe store on a busy commercial strip in the Bronx and opened fire, leaving five people dead, the police said. The dead included a 12-year-old boy and a mother and her two young sons. The shooting also left three people seriously injured. [Page A1.] 
 "She was very decent, very nice," said a neighbor of Maria Carrasquillo, one of five people killed by a man in a shoe store in the Pelham Parkway section of the Bronx. [B6.]
The man accused of slaying five people in a Bronx store was described by relatives as a paranoid schizophrenic who spent the last two years in and out of mental hospitals. [B6.]
On Pelham Parkway, clusters of neighborhood residents shook their heads and tried to sort out the mayhem. About New York by David Gonzalez. [B6.]
 
Child Welfare Hearing Derailed
A City Council hearing on the child welfare system was derailed when the Giuliani administration refused to let the head of the Child Welfare Administration testify because she would not be speaking first. In response, councilmembers voted to subpoena Kathryn Croft, the agency head, to force her to appear. [B1.]
 
Tracing Santa Back to Chelsea
As a new exhibition at the New-York Historical Society makes clear, Santa Claus as a jolly symbol -- complete with reindeer and sleigh -- was imagined and born in Manhattan. "Santa Claus, as we know him, is a New York creation," said the curator of the exhibition. [B1.]
 
Largess and Computer Literacy
For educators in New York City schools, it takes entrepreneurial drive to get technology into the hands of eager students. The Board of Education has not made a systemwide purchase of educational computers since 1985; forget about the color-and-sound goodies that excite home computer enthusiasts. In these circumstances, educators rely on hustling grants. [B1.]
 
Blood Center Found Liable
A Manhattan jury found the New York Blood Center liable for providing H.I.V.-infected blood to a 4-year-old boy during a transfusion 11 years ago, and awarded him $1.5 million in damages. [B1.]
 
Giuliani Signs Pay Raise
Mayor Giuliani signed legislation that gave him and New York City's 63 other elected officials pay raises of up to 28 percent. As he signed the legislation, the Mayor threw his support behind a proposal by Dr. Rudy Crew, the Schools Chancellor, to raise the salaries of 370 top managers at the city's school system. [B3.]
 
Some Relief for Cabbies
With cabdrivers in mind, the Parks Department has opened the restroom in St. Vartan's Park, near the Queens-Midtown Tunnel's Manhattan entrance, 24 hours a day for a monthlong trial. [B3.]
 
Protester Denies Charges
The protester who has been accused of making anti-Semitic statements and threatening to burn down Freddy's clothing store in Harlem denied that he made any racist or threatening remarks and insisted that the protest was about economic issues. [B4.]
 
Man Sentenced in Bomb Plot
A New Jersey man who pleaded guilty to conspiring with a group of militant Muslims convicted of a terrorist-bombing plot in the New York region was sentenced to the 29 months he had already served in jail and placed on three years' probation. [B5.]
 
3 Charged in Queens Deaths
Three men have been arrested and charged with killing four people in a Queens bodega last month, thanks in part to a survivor who managed to pick out their mug shots from his hospital bed. [B6.]

A Wintry Finale to Autumn
A pair of snowstorms rolled into the New York region, delivering a one-two punch that closed schools and offices, disrupted airports, complicated holiday shopping and guaranteed what meteorologists said would be the first white Christmas in 12 years. [A1.]
In Kearny, N.J., the snow came with frantic activity: plowing streets, shoveling driveways and sledding on Bunny Hill. [B9.]
Even with such a snowy climax to autumn in New York, meteorologists said they were holding to predictions of normal precipitation and mild temperatures for the winter. [B9.]

HEADLINE: Tory Skepticism on Europe Brings Major Another Defeat

BYLINE: By JOHN DARNTON 

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
A specter is haunting Conservatives the specter of Europe.
Once again the Tory Party is showing its divisions over Britain's ties to the European Union, the issue that has vexed Prime Minister John Major for most of his five years in office. 
 This evening Mr. Major narrowly lost a vote in Parliament on the Government's fishing policy, which adheres to fishing quotas set by the European Union. New quotas, to be adopted in Brussels on Thursday, are likely to reduce Britain's share of the catch by allowing 40 Spanish vessels in rich fishing grounds in the Irish Sea.
The outcome of the vote, 299 to 297, was humiliating for the Government. Enough Tory dissenters on Europe and representatives of coastal fishing areas joined the opposition to hand it a defeat. During the debate critics accused the Government of not defending the rights of Britain's fishermen vigorously enough.
The outcome was largely symbolic since the language of the motion made clear that it was expressing Parliament's opinion and not mandating a change in policy -- roughly the equivalent of an American Congressional resolution. So the Government will not fall or have to submit itself to a vote of confidence.
Nonetheless it showed how tenuous is Mr. Major's hold over his own party, which is trailing the opposition Labor Party by some 30 points in public opinion polls. In Parliament, the Conservative majority has shrunk to five and that could be reduced further by two off-year elections scheduled before the next general election, which must be held by the spring of 1997.
Mr. Major's stature among the party's right-wing "Euro-skeptics," who oppose allowing more power to slip away to Brussels as provided by the Treaty on European Unity, had already been damaged by events on Friday at the European Union summit meeting in Madrid. Leaders of the 15-country group resolved to press ahead with plans for a single currency beginning in January 1999, and to call it the euro.
The Prime Minister sought to apply the brakes to the single currency, arguing in Madrid that such a momentous step should not be taken precipitously and that the economies of many member nations were not yet ready. But his efforts were brushed aside by the other leaders, especially by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany. Britain and Denmark have negotiated the right to opt out of the single currency, which Euro-skeptics see as a final capitulation that would lead inevitably to political union.
The Tory right wing wants Mr. Major to promise that he would rule out British membership in the single currency for the life of the current Parliament, meaning through 1996. He has refused, arguing that to do so would relegate Britain to the sidelines and remove any influence he might have during critical talks next year about Europe's future.

HEADLINE: Reserve Board Cuts Key Rate; Markets Climb

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Nudged along by a slowing economy and nervous financial markets, the Federal Reserve lowered a key interest rate today by a quarter of a point.
The cut in short-term rates, which the Federal Reserve said was justified because of the lack of any threat of inflation, allowed the stock and bond markets to regain some of their big losses on Monday. But it left considerable uncertainty about whether Wall Street would be cheered by President Clinton's agreement with Republican Congressional leaders this afternoon to come up with a framework for a budget accord that would be concluded by the end of the year. The announcement at the White House came after the markets closed. 
 The Federal Reserve action, trimming to 5.5 percent the rate at which banks lend each other money overnight, marked the first time in five months that the nation's central bank has yielded to the perception in financial markets that interest rates were too high. [Page D1.]
But in a quirk of the interplay among the Federal Reserve, the markets and the budget negotiators, the small cut in interest rates and the resulting 34.68-point increase in the Dow Jones industrial average may actually ease some of the pressure for a quick compromise on a balanced budget.
The sharp drop in the financial markets on Monday provoked considerable finger-pointing in Washington this morning. Fear spread among politicians in both parties that they might be blamed for reversing the huge run-up in the stock and bond markets over the year. But it was unclear how big a role those fears played in the agreement reached this afternoon among President Clinton, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, to try once again to settle their differences -- this time by the end of next week.
"A hundred-point drop is not big enough to force anyone to make concessions they view as unwise," one senior Administration official said today. "But it certainly is big enough to get your attention."
Consumers are likely to derive only limited benefits from today's cut. The Federal Reserve left unchanged at 5.25 percent the discount rate, which it charges banks for short-term loans. Only one bank, Banc One of Columbus, Ohio, responded to the Fed's action today by cutting its prime lending rate, which helps determine the rate on a variety of consumer and small business loans. Others may follow soon. Markets also drove down longer-term rates that influence the cost of home mortgages, but they remained above levels prevailing earlier this month and any savings to consumers would be modest.
In Washington, though, symbolism is often more important than substance, and the symbol of a rate cut at a time of a Government shutdown and a possible budget deal is a particularly strong one. The Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, has waded into the middle of the balanced-budget debate several times, predicting to Congress that a balanced budget accord would prompt the markets to cut long-term rates even further. Several analysts viewed the Fed's rate cut as a carrot dangled in front of White House and Congressional leaders as the nation moved into a critical election year.
To no one's surprise, Mr. Greenspan mentioned none of the political maneuvering on the budget in his terse statement announcing the Fed's cut in rates. "Since the last easing of monetary policy in July," he said, "inflation has been somewhat more favorable than anticipated, and this result along with an associated moderation in inflation expectations warrants a modest easing in monetary conditions."
While the Federal Reserve was concerned about some indicators of a slowing economy -- weaker retail and auto sales, an erratic housing market and some signs that the worldwide demand for semiconductors is winding down after a frenetic year -- it clearly does not view a recession as a real danger. Economic growth, in fact, was not even mentioned in Mr. Greenspan's statement.
What gave the Fed a bit of room to operate was the low inflation rate. Curbing inflation is the Fed's chief mission, and with the Consumer Price Index rising only 2.6 percent so far this year, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee could initiate a modest reduction without any fear of adding any fuel to the inflationary embers.
No sooner had the Fed acted today than the Secretary of the Treasury, Robert E. Rubin, declared that the economy was in fine shape. "We believe that the current expansion has considerable room to run," Mr. Rubin said in a statement that was released jointly with Joseph E. Stiglitz, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers.
But privately, Mr. Rubin has been warning Administration officials that the markets have built into their current high levels the assumption that a balanced budget deal will be reached. And his warning was borne out on Monday, when the specter of budget impasse was enough to touch off a correction that seemed simply waiting for an excuse to set it off.
The unresolved question is whether the slightly better prospect of a budget deal will be enough to sustain the rebound that began this afternoon. While the Fed's cut buoyed the market, that move is not likely to be repeated soon. As one White House aide put it late today: "Next week Alan Greenspan isn't going to be able to put his finger in the dike."
The Federal Reserve will not meet to consider interest rates again until the end of January, and it is unlikely to act any earlier unless economic conditions change markedly..
So the markets may be riding out the end of the year on the ups and downs of the budget talks, at once reflecting their progress and influencing their outcome. It is a situation that leaves many analysts and fund managers uneasy.
"When you look at the effect the budgets they are talking about have on the economy, it doesn't amount to a hill of beans," said Allen Sinai, the chief global economist at Lehman Brothers. The shrinking of the Federal budget, Mr. Sinai has calculated, could cause a $20 billion to $25 billion "drag" on economic growth next year. In a $7 trillion economy that rolls ahead as relentlessly as the Mississipi River, that is a small drop in the stream.
One crucial piece of information that the Federal Reserve is supposed to rely on -- the latest estimate of growth of the gross domestic product for the third quarter -- may not have been available to its policy makers today. That is because of the continuing shutdown of many corners of the Government, including the Commerce Department, which compiles the statistic. It will not be released publicly until a continuing budget resolution is passed, allowing the department to reopen.
The Federal Reserve's action today concludes a year in which it received an enormous amount of scrutiny for doing relatively little to interest rates. The last change in the Federal funds rate came in July, when the Fed lowered it by a quarter of a percentage point to 5.75 percent. Just as it did today, the Fed left the discount rate unchanged at 5.25 percent.
Seven increases during the 12-month period beginning on Feb. 4, 1994, pushed the Federal funds rate up to 6 percent from 3 percent. The Federal Reserve Board also raised the discount rate in four stages, to 5.25 percent from 3 percent, beginning on May 17, 1994.

HEADLINE: New Group Trying to Nudge Both Parties Toward Center

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: MINNEAPOLIS, Dec. 19

 BODY:
A group of centrist politicians met for a second day today to refine its message but acknowledged that it has no Presidential candidate to carry it. And two of its most prominent members, including Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, have distanced themselves from the group.
"We've got the right ideas," former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts said on Monday. "We just don't have a vehicle." 
 Mr. Tsongas, former Gov. Richard D. Lamm of Colorado and former Representative Tim Penny of Minnesota presented a paper, "Road to Generational Equity," on Monday that criticized Democrats' and Republicans' handling of the national debt. But Senator Bradley, a Democrat, and Gov. Angus King of Maine, an independent, distanced themselves from the centrist group hours before it released the paper.
"For me, the rising economic security of people who work every day and worry about their future is the most pressing issue our country faces," Mr. Bradley said in a statement from Washington. "The balanced budget is important, but it is only a part of a larger set of challenges."
Mr. King said he was dropping out of the discussions because they were taking too much of his time.
The position paper supported free trade and called for no tax cuts until the budget is balanced, a consumption-based income tax to promote savings and managed care for Medicaid and Medicare recipients.
Mr. Penny said the group's goal was not to field an independent Presidential candidate, but "to challenge one or both of the major parties to move to the center."
Mr. King said he had regarded Senator Bradley and former Gov. Lowell E. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut as the group members most likely to enter the 1996 race, but now perceived both to be "backing away."

HEADLINE: Clinton Vetoes Bill Restricting Securities Suits

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Ending weeks of suspense for several of the nation's powerful interest groups, President Clinton vetoed a bill late today that would have made it more difficult for shareholders to bring fraud suits against underwriters, corporate officers and accountants.
The legislation would have fundamentally altered the system, in place since 1933, that was designed to discourage fraud in the securities market by relying on a blend of private and government sanctions. While the measure preserved all the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission to pursue fraud claims, it would have placed formidable obstacles before individual investors seeking to have their claims heard in court. 
 Both chambers of Congress had approved a compromise measure early this month. The President's prolonged and very public indecision about whether he would sign the measure produced a flurry of lobbying at the White House from groups lined up on either side of the issue.
Congress is expected to attempt to override the President's veto. Because the House has shown greater enthusiasm for the measure, it is likely a vote would succeed there. A vote to override would be a much closer contest in the Senate.
Mr. Clinton's veto also leaves him in the awkward position of asking some Democratic Senators to publicly reverse their positions. Some had voted in favor of the measure earlier this month in part because Mr. Clinton gave no sign that he disapproved of it.
The legislation was fraught with conflicting political elements for the President, and his closest aides had been engaged in an intense debate about what position Mr. Clinton should take. Mr. Clinton's senior economic advisers -- including Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who heads the National Economic Council, and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin -- had argued that the legislation was a measured and appropriate response to complaints about frivolous lawsuits brought against corporate officers and others when a company's stock price dropped suddenly.
The push for the change was initiated by the nation's major accounting firms and by stockbrokers who act as underwriters and could be liable when a company does not perform as well as expected. But that coalition had been greatly strengthened by the support of high-technology companies that say they are especially vulnerable to such costly lawsuits because their stocks are inherently volatile.
But the technology industry, particularly in California, has been an especially vigorous financial supporter of the President and the Democratic Party. Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who was a principal sponsor of the bill and is also the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, pressed his arguments in favor of the legislation on the President in a meeting on Monday night.
On the other side, Mr. Clinton was warned by aides to be wary of an anticonsumer message in the bill. "He's unwilling to sign legislation that would have the effect of closing the courthouse door on investors who have legitimate claims," a White House statement said.
Consumer groups, as well as many securities regulators in state governments, warned that the legislation would hurt small investors who had been defrauded.
A major focus of the legislative compromise had been an effort to allow companies to make predictions about their performance without fear that such statements might be used against them.
Because shareholders now may sue by arguing that they were misled by glowing company predictions, corporate officials complain that they are counseled not to offer any meaningful information about future performance. The bill included a provision for a so-called safe harbor that protected a company from liability for forward-looking statements. Under the bill, those statements could not be used in litigation if they included cautionary language identifying all important factors that could change the outcome. In addition, a plaintiff would have to show that someone knowingly made a false statement.
Under the bill, a judge would have been obliged to determine whether a lawsuit was brought frivolously and then fine the plaintiff.
Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican who opposed the bill, had asked Mr. Clinton to veto it on the grounds that it would "choke off many important suits to protect innocent investors."

HEADLINE: Mayor Signs Legislation Raising Pay of Officials

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani signed legislation yesterday that gave him and New York City's 63 other elected officials pay raises of up to 28 percent, formally ending a political struggle that has already undercut Mr. Giuliani's labor strategy, created new tensions at the Board of Education and subjected the Mayor to a dose of populist outrage.
Brushing aside much of the criticism over the last month as "a shame," Mr. Giuliani said he wanted the raises -- including his own $35,000 increase -- primarily because they cleared the way for increases for scores of deputies, commissioners and other managers who have toiled without raises for at least four years. Salaries for those appointed officials are linked by law to the pay of the Mayor. 
 And even as he put down his signature, the Mayor threw his support behind a proposal by Dr. Rudy Crew, the Schools Chancellor, to raise the salaries of 370 top managers of the city's school system, a proposal modeled on Mr. Giuliani's. The Mayor's support made it more likely that a majority of the board's seven members would approve the raises at a meeting tonight.
The Mayor declared that the raises he was approving would make the city's sprawling government more efficient and improve services by rewarding those who oversee their operations.
The Mayor then rattled off a list of the city's accomplishments -- from the sharp drop in crime to the redevelopment of 42d Street in Manhattan -- that he said already warranted awarding raises.
"I'm happy to do this," he said as he prepared to sign the legislation in City Hall's Blue Room, where he was joined by three members of the City Council, whose salaries would rise by $15,500 a year, to $70,500. "I feel that we're doing the right thing."
And as for any angry citizens out there, he added, "Even if they can't understand this now, as they see improvement in services, then they'll understand this is the right thing to do."
The Mayor signed the legislation, which the City Council approved on Dec. 7 by a vote of 38 to 10, a day after school officials said that Dr. Crew would propose granting raises of roughly 7 percent. Dr. Crew's proposal appeared to raise concerns among at least some members of the board. It also prompted renewed criticism from Sandra Feldman, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, the teachers' union, whose members two weeks ago rejected a tentative contract negotiated with the Mayor that offered no wage increases for two years.
Ms. Feldman called the Chancellor's recommendation "mind-boggling."
"Isn't it just so common-sensical that you don't do this kind of thing now?" Ms. Feldman said, noting that the teachers' union has been calling on the board and the Mayor to return to the bargaining table, so far unsuccessfully.
The Chancellor's aides, however, said Dr. Crew was obligated to propose the raises because of a 1990 board resolution that links raises for its senior officials to raises for managers at City Hall. In tandem with the legislation giving raises to elected officials, the Mayor issued an executive order giving increases of 7 percent to managers and a 21 percent increase for his deputies and commissioners.
Those officials have already begun receiving their raises -- including lump sums retroactive to July 1 -- in their paychecks, even though the Mayor approved the legislation clearing the way for them only yesterday.
The Mayor's signature ended, at least formally, a process that has generated considerable outrage and a stubborn defense from Mr. Giuliani, who has repeatedly accused his critics of misrepresenting the raises for political gain.
The pay increases grew out of a report issued in October by a mayoral commission that every four years, by law, considers the politically sensitive issue of raises for the Mayor, the Comptroller, the Public Advocate, the 51 members of the City Council, the five borough presidents and five district attorneys.
Once the commission submitted its report, the Mayor had 30 days to accept the recommended raises, modify them or defer them. Mr. Giuliani, however, agreed to submit them to the Council as proposed.
The proposed raises came just as Mr. Giuliani cemented tentative contracts with the teachers' union and the unions representing 140,000 nonuniformed workers that included no raises in the first two years, although they offered 13 percent increases in wages and benefits over the following three years.
Yesterday, Mr. Giuliani once again rejected the notion that the raises should be linked to the union contracts. The city's elected officials, he said, have not had raises in eight years, while unionized employees have received raises in each of those years. The commissioners and most managers, he added, have not received raises in four or five years.
In addition to the raises for the Mayor and Council members, the Comptroller's salary rises by $28,000, to $133,000; the borough presidents' pay grows by $19,000, to $114,000; and the district attorneys' salary increases by $10,000, to $125,000. The Public Advocate's salary increases by $20,000, to $125,000, but Mark J. Green, a potential rival of Mr. Giuliani's in 1997, has said he will not accept it.
Beyond the impact on union negotiations, a recent poll in The Daily News showed voters opposed to the raises. And the Mayor has had to defend them to angry citizens on the radio and at town hall meetings.
Frank Llewellyn of the Same Boat Coalition, which represents more than 100 advocacy groups and social service organizations, said the raises would increase "dangerous cynicism" about politicians.
"Clearly, the economic situtation for most New Yorkers will not improve this coming year," he said. "Why, then, should the salaries for our leaders improve?"

HEADLINE: Rates Are Rising on Policies That Cover Gaps in Medicare

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Adding new fuel to the budget debate, the largest suppliers of private health insurance supplements to Medicare said today that their premiums would rise by an average of about 30 percent next year.
The increase was disclosed by the American Association of Retired Persons and the Prudential Insurance Company of America, which provides supplemental coverage to 3.1 million members of the association. Other companies are also raising premiums for these policies, which help fill gaps in Medicare by paying hospital charges, doctors' bills and other expenses not covered by the Government program. 
 The higher charges for these Medigap policies come on top of premium increases that Republicans in Congress and President Clinton have already proposed for Medicare itself. The Republicans want bigger increases than the Administration will accept, and some of the most intense arguments in the budget debate involve this and other Medicare proposals.
More than two-thirds of the 37 million Americans covered by Medicare have Medigap insurance. Average premiums for the Prudential policies range from $51 to $151.75 a month, depending on how much the policies cover.
Much of the rise in premiums is attributed to increased use of outpatient services. Medicare pays the full cost of much in-hospital care, but beneficiaries pay at least 20 percent of the cost of outpatient services.
Jerry Carey, a spokesman for Prudential, said: "Our premiums are dictated by our claims experience. The biggest reason for the higher premiums is that we saw a big increase in claims volume nationwide, especially outpatient claims. We've seen a big increase in utilization of outpatient services."
The increase in claims started in the second half of 1994, when President Clinton's ambitious plan to remake the nation's health care system was dying. The connection between the two events is unclear, but some health care experts suggest that doctors and other health care providers began limiting the number and complexity of services while the debate over the Clinton plan was raging.
There are 10 standard Medigap policies, covering items like prescription drugs, skilled nursing care and the 20 percent of doctors' bills not covered by Medicare.
Discussing Medigap premiums, Wayne F. Haefer, membership director of the association of retired persons, said: "The rates will rise, on average, 30 percent. The size of the increase will vary according to the specific plan and the state where the policyholder lives."
Nationally, premiums for the most basic Medigap coverage sold through the association will average $51 a month next year, and the average monthly premium for the most extensive Medigap policy will be $151.75. In general, Prudential charges the same premiums to residents of a particular state or geographic area, regardless of their age or medical condition. Other companies charge higher premiums to older people, and their rates can exceed $300 a month.
Prudential said its Medigap premiums would rise an average of 40 percent next year in Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Ohio, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming; 37 percent in California, Kansas, Missouri, New Hampshire, Vermont and Wisconsin; 35 percent in Rhode Island, and 34 percent in South Dakota.
The increases will average 17 percent in New York, 29 percent in Connecticut and 30 percent in Pennsylvania. Prudential is waiting for a decision by New Jersey regulators.
Outpatient services, provided at hospitals, clinics and doctors' offices, have been increasing for a variety of reasons. Many patients like to avoid overnight stays in the hospital when possible. Hospitals have financial incentives to discharge patients as quickly as possible. For example, Medicare pays hospitals a set fee for each patient admitted with a given condition, regardless of how long the person is hospitalized. Medicare, health maintenance organizations and private insurers have encouraged the use of outpatient services, hoping to save money.
New technology permits doctors to perform many more services on an outpatient basis. As H.M.O.'s and private insurers limit payments to doctors, some doctors may try to maintain their income by doing more procedures on an outpatient basis.
Susanne C. Bowman, director of insurance services at the A.A.R.P., said that Prudential paid $12 million to $13 million a day in claims for members of the association. Because of higher claims and costs, she said, the company is paying $1 million a day more than it anticipated.
"We had an independent actuary review Prudential's pricing calculations," Ms. Bowman said. "We concluded that the increases were justified. State insurance departments also reviewed the rates and concluded they were justified."
The association said last month that it would end its exclusive arrangement with Prudential when it expires at the end of 1997, but Peter L. Ashkenaz, a spokesman for the association, said this decision was not related to the increase in premiums. Prudential and other companies will be allowed to bid for the right to sell health insurance products to members after 1997.
The association has insisted that Prudential offer the same Medigap rates to all subscribers in a given area, regardless of age, so that older members will have access to affordable coverage. President Clinton recently proposed that all Medigap insurers follow this practice, known as community rating.
Increases in Medigap premiums may encourage more Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in H.M.O.'s, which accept Medicare fees as payment in full for coverage. But, health policy experts say, if H.M.O.'s attract large numbers of young, healthy Medicare beneficiaries, the sicker and older people may be left in the standard Medicare program, and Medigap rates will then rise faster.
"Many elderly people live on fixed incomes," said Gail E. Shearer, a health policy analyst at Consumers Union. "Without community rating, Medigap costs increase much faster than inflation, and people over 75 or 80 can no longer afford the high premiums."

HEADLINE: Harlem Protester Denies Racist Remarks

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

 BODY:
The protester who has been accused of making anti-Semitic statements and threatening to burn down Freddy's clothing store in Harlem denied yesterday that he made any racist or threatening remarks and insisted that the protest was about economic issues.
But even in defending himself, the protester, Tracy Ligon, pointed to the religion of the Jewish clothing store owner, whose plans to expand drew the protests because they would force out a longtime black-owned record store. 
 "I felt that it was wrong that here's a business, Freddy's, which is owned by a Jew, so to speak, who came into the community, had been there no more than three years," said Mr. Ligon, who was a part-time employee of the record store owner, Sikhulu Shange. "Our money, black people's money put Freddy's in business. Freddy built up such an economic stature in the community that he wanted to force Mr. Shange out of business."
Mr. Ligon had been accused in court papers of making several threatening gestures toward the clothing store and its customers and employees during the weeks of protests that preceded the fatal fire at Freddy's, in which eight people, including the arsonist, were killed. At one point, according to the court papers, Mr. Ligon, who goes by the street name Shabazz, was accused of bursting into the clothing store and shouting: "I will be back to burn the Jew store down. Burn, burn, burn."
But yesterday, in an interview at his lawyer's office, Mr. Ligon insisted that there were no racial overtones to his actions. "Let's just dismiss the issue of racism," he said. "We're not talking about racism."
Also yesterday, a senior police official said the Police Department had begun an inquiry into the performance of the Harlem precinct responsible for monitoring the boycott of the store on 125th Street. The inquire comes after Police Commissioner William J. Bratton bluntly said he regretted not having responded more aggressively to the protests taking place daily outside Freddy's.
On Dec. 8, one protester, Roland J. Smith Jr., opened fire inside the store, set the building ablaze and then shot himself, killing seven store employees and himself.
Mr. Ligon, a regular on the picket line, who sometimes protested during his work shift, said yesterday that he had seen Mr. Smith only once, when he showed up on the picket line three or four days before the massacre.
"He seemed to be just like all the rest of the picketers," Mr. Ligon said. "He was just boycotting, saying, 'Boycott, boycott, close Freddy's.' "
Mr. Ligon, a 37-year-old man who has lived off and on in a homeless shelter and spent 12 years in jail for armed robbery and credit-card fraud, was identified and interviewed by the police on Saturday. As one of the three people who made up the core of the demonstrations, Mr. Ligon has been of interest to the police as they try to determine if anyone knew about Mr. Smith's plans to attack Freddy's. The other two protest leaders were Mr. Shange and Morris Powell, the leader of a Harlem vendors' association who made racially charged statements supporting the protests.
Mr. Ligon said yesterday he had known Mr. Powell for years and was one of a group of street vendors who clashed last year with city officials who ultimately succeeded in driving the peddlers off the sidewalks of 125th Street. Mr. Ligon also said he had attended many rallies and meetings led by the Rev. Al Sharpton, who also made racially tinged remarks about the boycott.
Mr. Ligon also acknowledged that he had used the word "bloodsucker" to refer to the clothing store.
Mr. Ligon also said that on the day before the deadly assault, protesters were chanting "Freddy's Dead." But he said that phrase referred to signs that Freddy's had put up saying it was going out of business.
"At no time under any circumstances did I make any threats or gestures, at not time did I go into Freddy's and light a match or pretend to light a match," said Mr. Ligon, who was smoking a cigarette and wearing a Malcolm X sweatshirt during the interview. He said the protesters were also angry at the black Pentecostal church that was the landlord for both Freddy's and the record store.
Yesterday, the senior police department official said investigators from the department's bias unit have spent the last week questioning members of the 28th Precinct in an effort to determine who knew what and when, and if the precinct had failed to adequately deal with the volatile daily scene outside the clothing store.
Also yesterday, Fire Department officials yesterday refuted a claim that 911 operators handling calls from several of the store workers trapped in the basement of Freddy's had not relayed the calls to Fire Department dispatchers.

Clinton and G.O.P. Leaders To Negotiate on Budget
President Clinton and the Republican leaders of Congress agreed to negotiate personally an agreement that would balance the Federal budget in seven years.
It was the first sign of a break in the budget impasse, and the Congressional leaders said they hoped to reach agreement before the new year. "We're serious about this now," Senator Bob Dole, the majority leader, said. "The President is serious." [Page A1.] 

Fed Cuts Key Interest Rate
The Federal Reserve lowered a short-term interest rate one-quarter of a point, trimming to 5.5 percent the rate at which banks lend each other money overnight. It pointed to the lack of any threat of inflation. [A1.]
 
The price of the 30-year bond rose 110/32 to 11015/32 in reaction to the cut, recovering nearly all its Monday loss. The yield fell to 6.11 percent, from 6.20 percent on Monday. [D15.]
 
Japan to Rescue Mortgage Lenders
The Japanese Government decided to use $6.85 billion in taxpayers' money to rescue the nation's troubled mortgage companies, ending months of bitter wrangling. [D2.]
 
Natural-Gas Futures at Record
Natural-gas futures prices surged to a record as cold-weather forecasts threw traders into a panic over supplies. [D6.]
 
Warner-Lambert Buys Glaxo Drugs
Warner-Lambert agreed to pay $1.05 billion to buy full rights to six popular over-the-counter drugs from Glaxo Wellcome, ending their joint venture. The two will continue their agreement to market a nonprescription version of Zantac, an anti-ulcer drug. Separately, the F.D.A. approved a version of Zantax as a heartburn rememdy. [D4.]
 
USA Waste to Buy Western Waste
USA Waste Services said it would buy Western Waste Industries for $510 million, creating the nation's third-largest trash hauler. [D18.]
 
Paper Customers Going Green

HEADLINE: A Rate Cut, and a Fistful of Reasons

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
For the second time this year, the Federal Reserve's top policy makers met in the face of substantial market pressure for lower rates and decided to cut -- by the smallest amount possible.
The decision is another example of the way the Fed can use its powers over interest rates not only to change the cost of money, but also to send a reassuring signal to investors and politicians alike. 
 Today's statement by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, announcing the rate cut emphasized the low inflation of recent months while not mentioning any concern about a possible slowdown in economic growth. The result was a clear signal to financial markets that the central bank expects a fairly healthy economy with low inflation -- a good environment for stocks and bonds alike, and a signal that investors responded to today by bidding up share prices and bonds.
"I think they probably made this move more to reassure the markets than to send any signal of concern about the economy," said John P. LaWare, a Federal Reserve governor until his retirement last spring. "I think that they have always been concerned about the effect of a move, or the lack of a move, creating undue alarm in the market."
To be sure, there are as many explanations for today's action by the central bank as there are economists. While the need to reassure markets about the direction of the economy was almost certainly important, other explanations fall into three broad categories.
One explanation is that the Federal Reserve acted on the basis of the economic indicators it generally insists are its only guide to action. Recently, those figures have shown little inflation and some slackening in the pace of economic growth. Retail sales showed some signs of recovery in October but remained lackluster this Christmas season. Factory investment spending is faltering. And consumer prices were unchanged in November, although prices paid to factories and other producers did rise.
"We can well afford to cut interest rates because inflation remains nearly nonexistent and growth has slowed precipitously," said Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers here.
Another explanation is that after months of pushing for a balanced budget deal, the Federal Reserve took a step back today -- but only a small step.
Mr. Greenspan put the central bank into the budget debate by calling repeatedly for a balanced budget and even suggesting a way to cut spending and reduce taxes. And it was Mr. Greenspan who effectively took the central bank out of the budget debate today, cutting short-term interest rates while issuing a statement that ignored budget issues entirely.
But today's one-quarter of a percentage point reduction in the Federal Funds rate, which banks pay each other for overnight loans, was the smallest step that the central bank could take today. The Federal Reserve also left unchanged the discount rate, which it charges banks for short-term loans.
That leaves the Federal Reserve with room to cut interest rates further if a budget deal is struck. Some economists argue that based on the current levels of short-term market interest rates that investors believe the Federal Reserve could reduce short-term rates by up to a full percentage point in the coming months without rekindling inflation.
A third school of thought says that today's decision was at least partly motivated by the politics of an approaching election year and the approaching expiration of Mr. Greenspan's second term as chairman.
The Federal Reserve tries to keep as low a profile as possible during election years, and today's meeting of the Fed's top officials was the last until Jan. 30 and 31. Given a choice between cutting rates now and reducing them in January, today's move helps the Fed avoid the appearance of playing politics too close to the beginning of the primary season.
Today's rate cut is also likely to please President Clinton, who was already expected to reappoint Mr. Greenspan as chairman and possibly Alan S. Blinder as vice chairman when their terms expire early next year. First appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1987 and reappointed by President George Bush in 1992, Mr. Greenspan is a longtime Republican who has nonetheless managed to woo Mr. Clinton and his top aides with advice and strong support on Administration initiatives like last winter's bailout of Mexico.
Mr. Blinder, a Clinton appointee, was on the verge of leaving the Federal Reserve last summer and returning to his position as a professor at Princeton University when he thought that his influence at the central bank would always be limited because of Mr. Greenspan's many allies on the Federal Reserve's main interest-rate policy committee. But he has now successfully led two efforts, last July and this month, to bring about lower interest rates, and said in an interview earlier this month that he had become undecided on whether to stay.
But the strongest explanation for today's outcome appears to lie in the Fed's reluctance to alarm the stock and bond markets, which had already rallied on the assumption that a cut in short-term interest rates was in the offing.
Mr. LaWare recalled today that when the Fed's top officials met on Feb. 4, 1994, and raised short-term interest rates for the first time in five years, he and some colleagues wanted to start off with a half-point increase in the Federal funds rate. But it was Mr. Greenspan who led the objections to such a move and called instead for only a quarter-point adjustment.
When a decision was needed, Mr. LaWare said, "The phrase the chairman used at the time was 'We don't want to crack the markets.' "

HEADLINE: Japan to Use Tax Revenue To Rescue Housing Lenders

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Dec. 20

 BODY:
The Japanese Government ended months of bitter wrangling today by deciding to use $6.85 billion in taxpayers' money to rescue the nation's troubled mortgage companies.
The decision may ease some foreign concerns about the Government's resolve to deal with Japan's banking problems, for in some ways the resolution is reminiscent of the American Government's rescue of savings and loan institutions. 
 But unlike in the United States, where the Government stepped forward to clean up the problems, Japanese taxpayers have been reluctant to pay for the mistakes of bankers who lent recklessly to real estate projects in the boom years of the 1980's. Many Japanese fault the bankers for the nation's current economic troubles.
Consequently, the rescue plan, announced at a televised midnight news conference, is likely to set off fierce public criticism.
"Please understand," Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama said at the dramatic and acrimonious news conference. "It was a decision filled with bitterness."
"It is natural for anger to be voiced," he said, taking questions from selected Japanese reporters. "But this problem is related to the international financial system, and since the financial system is an artery of the economy, it is necessary to establish the credibility of the system. If we postpone a decision any further, there would be chaos."
The mortgage companies, now on the brink of collapse, went on a lending spree in the 1980's. They made loans for giant property deals, some of which went bust when the economy stagnated. Some experts say the Finance Ministry is partly to blame because it exempted these companies from controls imposed on other financial institutions, and Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura apologized to the Japanese people for the Government's decision to use public funds.
Nonetheless, for several years now, the bad loans of the eight mortgage companies have been a nagging headache for the entire banking industry. Liquidating seven of these ailing companies will result in losses from unrecoverable loans estimated at $64 billion. That problem now is being solved with the Government funds, loan forgiveness by the big Japanese money-center banks, new loans by farm cooperatives, and assistance by other financial institutions.
Beyond the $64 billion, there is $12 billion in bad loans that will probably also be unrecoverable.
And these losses are only part of at least $182 billion that is unrecoverable from more than $400 billion in bad debt that plagues the broader Japanese financial system. It is not clear that the Government and financial institutions are ready to deal with this larger problem.
With the mortgage companies, the hope was that the Government would not have to turn to the taxpayers for help, and that instead, the institutions that had stakes in the mortgage companies would divide the losses.
But the Government did finally agree to play a part. It said it would set up a special agency that will use loans and taxpayers' money to help dispose of all the bad loans.
This package is the result of a sharp battle between two main creditors of the mortgage companies: the commercial banks and the agricultural cooperatives, which had the lion's share of bad loans.
The agricultural cooperatives had apparently supported the mortgage companies' lending, but they, too, have been ailing. For awhile, they resisted classifying some of their loans to the mortgage companies as bad debt, maintaining that they would be repaid.
These cooperatives have enormous influence in Japan, and politicians were reluctant to force them to pay. The result is that the co-ops will be asked to give only grants and low-interest loans of about $5.3 billion to the new special agency in exchange for a guarantee that all their claims -- about $5.5 billion -- on the mortgage companies will be repaid.
When asked why the agricultural co-ops were being favored, Prime Minister Murayama replied that it was a political judgment. "Agriculture is a very important industry which produces the people's food," he said, visibly awkward.
The money-center banks, which originally founded the mortgage companies, will provide both capital and low-interest loans to the new agency. They will also be forced to assume the biggest losses, forgiving more than $35 billion in loans now extended to the mortgage companies. Japan's 21 largest banks are expected to record high operating profit this fiscal year, which ends in March 1996. But disposing of these unrecoverable loans is likely to force some of them to report overall losses for the year.
Other financial institutions, which lent funds to the mortgage companies but did not help establish them, will abandon $17 billion currently owed them and provide capital and loans to the new agency.
On average, Japanese citizens will pay about $55 to foot the bill. That amounts to $220 for a family of four. But that amount is likely to be only the starting point.
Costs, or the amount of bad debt, could rise in the process of liquidation. And if the economy worsens and real estate prices fall further, the burden on taxpayers could be several times greater.

Fed Rate Cut Spurs Prices Of Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rebounded sharply yesterday as the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 1 10/32, to 110 15/32; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, dropped to 6.11 percent, down from 6.20 percent on Monday. The benchmark issue lost a point and a half on Monday on fears the cut would not occur while Federal budget talks were stalemated. Before rising, bonds faltered in early trading on follow-through selling generated by Monday's steep drop. 
 "Inflation has been somewhat more favorable than anticipated," the Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, said in a statement, "and this result along with an associated moderation in inflation expectations warrants a modest easing in monetary conditions."
The Fed move trimmed the Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.50 percent. It followed a string of statistics showing the economy softening after a rise in the third quarter.
 Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said, "In addition to the subdued, benign and nonthreatening pace of inflation it is certainly true that some recently released economic statistics indicating a slower pace of business activity entered into the equation as well."
The Federal Open Market Committee's rate cut yesterday, in its last meeting of the year, followed a similar cut five months ago.
Expectations of what the Fed would do yesterday had been divided, with half of the market seeing at least a cut of 25 basis points in short-term rates and the other not expecting any change because of the stalled budget talks. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Nerves, though, remained a bit frayed over what budget compromises will be made to reach an accord. Traders said the early losses were pared after President Clinton and Congressional leaders agreed to meet at the White House at 3 P.M. on a seven-year deficit reduction plan. "People are seeing that politicians are actually sitting down to talk," said Gerald A. Guild, head of fixed- income trading at Advest Inc.
After the meeting in Washington, both sides said that there had been progress. Republicans said that if a another high-level budget meeting went well today, they would consider a stopgap spending bill to end the partial shutdown of the Government. They also said they hoped talks would lead to a budget agreement by the end of the year.
 Elsewhere in the market, the Treasury plans to sell $18.25 billion in new two-year notes today and $12 billion in new five-year notes tomorrow. In when-issued trading ahead of the auctions, the twos were being offered at a price to yield 5.27 percent and the fives at 5.50 percent.
In municipal bonds, where New York City's huge $1.3 billion offering weighed on a market already flush with new issues, the bonds offered yields higher than Treasury securities to make them more attractive to investors and easier to compete with existing issues.
Traders said the sale was also helped by the fact that the settlement date -- that date buyers must pay for the bonds -- falls a few days after Jan. 1, when investors normally are receiving cash from interest payments on other investments.
Goldman, Sachs & Company was the senior manager in the sale, which was made up of bonds maturing from 1997 through 2025, with a maximum yield of 6.32 percent for the longest maturity, about 14 basis points more than a comparable Treasury security.
Serial bonds with shorter maturities offered yields from 4.10 percent for an issue due in 1997 to 6.27 percent for bonds due in 2014 and 2015. Other long bonds were priced to yield 6.30 percent for those due in 2019 and 2020.
Though the issue was priced at a precarious time for the markets, as the market awaited the Fed's decision, traders said the deal went well. By borrowing money at lower interest rates the city has reduced its debt service payments.
"The key thing," said Alan L. Anders, director of financing policy for New York City's Office of Budget Management, "is that the city realized a $47 million savings for the current fiscal 1996 budget, only a little less than what we expected."

HEADLINE: Fabian Linden, Creator of Index Of Buyer Confidence, Dies at 79

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Fabian Linden, the economist who developed the widely quoted consumer confidence index of the Conference Board, died at his home in Manhattan on Monday. He was 79.
The cause was cancer of the colon, his wife, Anita, said. 
 Mr. Linden joined the Conference Board, a worldwide business research organization, in 1957 and was active in his post as executive director of its Consumer Research Center until a few weeks ago, his wife said.
He was one of the first American economists to examine consumer behavior as a means of divining shifts in the American economy.
In 1967, he developed the Conference Board's consumer confidence index, which measures consumer attitudes and buying plans. Today, it is one of the two major consumer indicators used by economic forecasters, competing with one developed at the University of Michigan, and it is considered a leading economic indicator by the Federal Government.
The board's index, issued monthly, is also widely watched by business executives and by Wall Street, and is often cited by financial analysts to explain swings in stock and bond prices.
As developer of the index, Mr. Linden became a national authority on consumer behavior patterns. He often told business audiences: "Consumers are better forecasters than economists because they are closer to economic reality. They are the first to feel significant economic change. They are the first to know when they and their neighbors are being hired or fired and first to know whether business activity is expanding or contracting."
Mr. Linden wrote more than 40 books or major studies for the Conference Board, many of which were widely used by business and quoted in the media. His most recent, "How We Spend Our Money," was published this year. Others include "Consumer Affluence: The Next Wave," "Baby Boomers in Mid Passage: A Demographic, Economic and Social Profile," and "Working Women: A Demographic, Economic and Social Profile."
Before joining the Conference Board, Mr. Linden was in the Foreign Service, first in Vienna as an economic attache and later in Paris as a member of the United States delegation to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
He received a bachelor's degree in economics from New York University and a master's degree in economics from Harvard University.
In addition to his wife, Mr. Linden is survived by a daughter, Livia, of Costa Rica; a stepson, Neil, of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Stocks, Bonds Surge After Fed's Action

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
For financial markets, it was almost as if Monday never happened.
Following one of the bigger one-day selloffs in recent years, stock and bond prices both snapped back smartly yesterday after the Federal Reserve lowered a key short-term borrowing rate by a quarter of a percentage point. 
 Bond prices had already started to recover before the Fed released its decision in midafternoon. But stocks, which were hammered on Monday, were falling again. Just before the Fed announcement, which came around 2:15 P.M., the Dow Jones industrial average, which had plunged 101.52 points on Monday, or 1.96 percent, was down another 20 points.
But the Fed's decision to lower the overnight Federal funds rate to 5.50 percent from 5.75 percent -- the second time it has cut the closely watched rate this year -- prompted a sharp reversal. By the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow was up by 34.68 points, to 5,109.89. Despite a snowstorm in New York that gathered force as the day wore on, trading volume was very heavy, at 479.8 million shares, up from 426.3 million on Monday.
The gains were by no means limited to the 30 blue-chip issues that make up the Dow. The Nasdaq composite index, heavy with high-technology issues, rose 23.85 points, to 1,026.41, nearly reversing its Monday decline of 27.92 points. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks gained 5.12 points, to 611.93, and the Big Board's composite index rose 2.05 points, to 325.71.
On Monday, the yield on the 30-year Treasury, which moves in the opposite direction of the bond's price, had risen by 11 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. But the yield came down almost that much yesterday. Late in the day, the Treasury's benchmark issue was quoted at a price to yield 6.11 percent, compared with 6.20 percent on Monday. [Page D15.]
Much of Monday's deep price decline in the stock and bond markets had been attributed to worries that the Fed, despite signs of softness in the economy and positive news on inflation, would delay any cut in rates until the impasse over how to balance the Federal budget had been overcome and an agreement had been reached.
Analysts said that if that thought had been on the minds of Fed governors before Monday, the sharp selloff might have shunted it aside.
"The financial markets may have had an influence," on the timing of the rate cut, David Wyss, research director at Data Resources Inc., said. "I think the Fed knew it had to cut rates, and Monday's reaction in the markets was an impetus not to put it off."
Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities Inc., said that "the Fed should conduct monetary policy on the basis of what the economy is doing. The budget is part of the economy, but it is only part of it, and at some point we will get a budget accord. But it could be an extremely long wait, and in the meantime you cannot expect the Fed to stay frozen."
The cut in the funds rate led one big commercial bank, the Banc One Corporation of Columbus, Ohio, to lower its prime lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 8.50 percent. Mr. Wyss said other banks would likely follow, but probably not until after the new year.
While the rate cut provided reassurance to stock traders and investors yesterday, some analysts argued that the move carried more symbolic weight than real significance for financial markets.
"The cut is strictly cosmetic, and is designed more to reassure people than to have a real impact on the economy," said E. Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company.
Mr. Metz, who has been bearish on the stock market for some time, said that in his view the cut "does not give us another leg upward. I think it represents a selling opportunity.
"To me, interest rates are not a problem," he added. "There is a financial mania going on, with too much money being thrown at financial assets. I think the Fed is throwing a little gasoline on the flame."
Despite Mr. Metz's concerns, there were no apparent signs yesterday that mutual fund investors, who have been buying stocks on any signs of weakness for the past five years, are beginning to cash out.
"On Monday we had very thin net sales of mutual funds, only $7 million," said Tom Taggart, a spokesman for the Charles Schwab Corporation in San Francisco. "On a normal down day the spread might be $30 million to $40 million. But a lot of people are reshifting their portfolios for tax reasons at this time of year. And I am not hearing anything unusual about today's activity."
Most of the biggest gains recorded in yesterday's stock market advance were by high-technology companies. But interest-sensitive issues, like banks, also gained.
Among computer makers, shares of Dell Computer rose $6.125, to $35.625; those of Compaq Computer gained $3.50 to $49.125, and those of Hewlett-Packard were up $6.625, to $83.875. Intel, the world's leading maker of computer chips, rose $3.125 a share, to $60.375, and Microsoft, the software manufacturer, was up $3.875 a share, to $90.875.
"Technology stocks have been under a lot of pressure for the last month or two, with Monday being one of the biggest selloffs," said Todd D. Bakar, a technology analyst at Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco.
"At some point, people are going to be more selective about this group," he said. "But it seems as if we are still in the mode where people are either buying them all or selling them all."
Among big banks, shares of BankAmerica advanced $1.75, to $64.75. And the Fleet Financial Group, which yesterday announced its second multibillion-dollar buyout in less than a month -- the latest is of the National Westminster Bank's American bank operations -- rose $2.125 a share, to $41.125.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Fleet buys NatWest cheap, in a deal that's widely applauded.

BYLINE: By Saul Hansell 

 BODY:
EVEN bankers sometimes can live well shopping at the bargain basement. Fleet Financial Group confirmed yesterday that it had agreed to buy NatWest Bank, the New York and New Jersey operation of National Westminster Bank P.L.C. of Britain, for $3.26 billion.
That price represents 1.05 times the book value of NatWest and 12.3 times its earnings. It is far less than the multiples in other bank deals this year, especially the sky-high premiums paid in New Jersey by First Union, which bought the First Fidelity Bancorporation for $5.6 billion, and the PNC Bank Corporation, which bought the Midlantic Corporation for $3 billion. 
 To be sure, NatWest's franchise is smaller and less well positioned than these other banks and a third of its assets are in low-yielding securities. But many analysts said Fleet's shareholders were coming out ahead. "We think the deal is a winner," said Thomas F. Theurkauf of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. He raised his estimate of 1997 earnings to $5 a share from $4.65, and his rating of the stock to attractive from hold.
Fleet's shares rose $2.125 yesterday, to $41.125, on the New York Stock Exchange, a faster pace than other bank stocks, which were all buoyed by the Federal Reserve's interest-rate reduction.
"Strategically it's a natural for them because it moves them out of New England," Mr. Theurkauf said, noting that Fleet would deepen its penetration of New York City and Long Island, and move into New Jersey. "But often the strategy is easy," he said. "The hard part is making the numbers work."
Many analysts had expected that it would be hard for a buyer to structure a lucrative deal for the NatWest unit, mainly because the British parent company needed to be paid largely in cash.
Fleet, however, has come up with an innovative financial structure that gets around the two pitfalls of cash acquisitions, the need to raise additional equity capital and the charges from accounting good will.
Like any good bargain hunter, Fleet will pay for part of the purchase over time. It will give NatWest $2.7 billion in cash up front, with the remaining $560 million paid over a period of up to eight years.
The delayed payouts will be based on the earnings of NatWest's franchise in downstate New York and New Jersey, which will remain a separate legal entity until the $560 million is paid. Fleet will keep the first $100 million of its earnings; NatWest gets the second $100 million, and the excess, if any, is split. With the operation earning about $200 million a year, and cost savings to come from the consolidation, Fleet estimates it will pay the $560 over four to five years.
The delayed payment has benefits from the time value of money, which makes the deal in effect cost $100 million less than if paid up front.
Moreover, the stretched-out payment delays the pain from the good will costs. Fleet will incur $625 million in good will up front, which will be written off over 20 years. As the delayed payouts are made, more good will charges will be added. But since Fleet already has about $1 billion in good will from previous deals, the additional liability will be offset, keeping the level constant.
Fleet will avoid issuing new stock by selling $13 billion of NatWest's bond and mortgage investment portfolio, and $18 billion of its own investments, freeing $1.7 billion in capital. Its assets will grow only to $90 million from the current $84 billion, but the composition of its portfolio will shift toward higher-yielding loans.
The final part of the purchase price, amounting to $1 billion, will come by selling $400 million in debt and $600 million in perpetual preferred stock, $300 million of which will be bought by NatWest.
Fleet figures it can save $200 million a year on expenses, mainly by eliminating 1,800 jobs and closing 30 branches, most on Long Island.
As for quality, a perpetual concern of those who frequent the remainder bin, Fleet has arranged for return privileges. NatWest's British parent will take back $375 million in problem loans and repossessed real estate before the sale, and has agreed to put $80 million more into the subsidiary's reserves to cover any future problems.

HEADLINE: Largess Vital To Literacy In Computers In New York

BYLINE: By SUSAN BRENNA 

 BODY:
It's not just chip designers, CD-ROM authors and other wizards of the supply side who score entrepreneurial triumphs in the world of technology. For educators in New York City schools, it takes entrepreneurial drive to get technology into the hands of eager students.
The New York City Board of Education has not made a systemwide purchase of educational computers since 1985, when the Municipal Assistance Corporation committed $32.5 million to in-school technology. But that was the electronic equivalent of biblical generations ago. Forget talking encyclopedias and other color-and-sound goodies that excite home computer enthusiasts. Many teachers are still trying to acquire basic hard drives. 
 In these circumstances, educators and their nonprofit partners say, the key to staying, if not current with technology, then at least generationally near, is hustling grants.
"It's a typical New York thing," said Robert McClintock, director of the Institute for Learning Technology at Columbia University Teachers College, which is helping several city schools connect to the Internet. "Who hustles gets it, and who doesn't, doesn't."
Businesses, foundations and all levels of government from President Clinton to borough presidents are financing experiments in educational technology. In the first half of this school year, according to records of the State Department of Education, 22 technology corporations gave city schools $1 million in equipment and training. Tapping corporate largess is Chancellor Rudy Crew's strategy for school upgrades, said his spokesman, David Begel.
But the grants are competitive and spending follows no obvious pattern, with private money bypassing the murky citywide pool to feed single-school tributaries. The result is a scrambling of typical school economies, and a systemwide patchwork of radical contrasts. Mr. McClintock said: "I think it's fairly documentable that the rich-school-poor-school kind of assumption is not really what determines who's got a lot of stuff and who doesn't. It's much more the vision or lack of vision of the key people working on site."
That is how Intermediate School 252, attended by 800 poor and immigrant children in East Flatbush, achieved high quality computer instruction in math and science. Since 1989, the school has competed for and received $1.6 million in Federal demonstration grants, and has more coming for five years.
Overall, New York City, which 10 years ago was considered a leader in computer-assisted teaching, is falling behind national standards, according to statistics collected by Quality Education Data, a Denver educational research firm. Nationally, schools have 1 computer for every 10.5 students. New York has 1 for every 16. Yet that is a better showing than the next two largest school systems, Los Angeles and Chicago, with ratios of 1-to-17 and 1-to-20 respectively.
New York's equipment is also older than the national average. The workhorse of city schools remains the Apple II, designed in 1977 and discontinued in 1990, with newer-generation Macintoshes and I.B.M.'s in about one-third of city classrooms. This year, the board closed computer teacher-training centers in all five boroughs.
Still, to watch the kindergartners at Public School 76 struggling to type C-A-T on their keyboards without removing their thumbs from their mouths is to imagine that city children are chasing the technological edge. The Long Island City computer magnet school, richly endowed with demonstration equipment by I.B.M. and the state, has a linked internal network of one computer for every five children.
Although only 3 percent of schools nationally are linked to the Internet, some students in Harlem, including Angel Ortega, a sixth grader, practically live on line. He attends the Ralph Bunche Elementary School, the recipient of many small grants and outside assistance, including a partnership with the Institute for Learning Technology. At this school, 10-year-olds not only use the Internet, the students themselves installed the Netscape browser that lets them take advantage of the net's hottest feature, the World Wide Web.
Mouse in hand, Angel Ortega haunts the computer labs before and after school, catching up on his electronic mail correspondence with students in Japan. Melinda Robinson, a fifth grader, stays late to send suggested plot lines via E-mail to the producers of "The Simpsons."
At P.S. 20 on the Lower East Side, two fifth graders, Vickiana Rosario and Xavier Jimenez, arrive 45 minutes early most days for lessons in navigating the Internet. Community School District 1 recently received a $555,000 Federal grant to link its elementary schools, including P.S. 20, to the World Wide Web. Part of that paid for a teacher, Adam Baskin, to spend his summer training on school equipment. Now he expects Vickiana and Xavier to help him initiate their classmates.
They are confident.
"If we push a wrong button," Xavier said, "we just find out something interesting."
Scores of other city schools use new technology creatively, but many are simply not equipped, their laboratories virtual personal-computer museums. "Our problem is not that we don't do some of the greatest things in technology in our schools," said Peter Stoll, manager of technology partnerships for the state Department of Education. "Our problem is that it's not universally available."
Only now, by direction of the previous Chancellor, Ramon C. Cortines, is the central administration beginning to write its first comprehensive plan for integrating technology into classrooms. Joseph Eaione, the director of instructional technology, maintains that it is time to give computer literacy "the imprimatur of the box on the report card." But another significant motivation for the plan is financing. Foundations willing to underwrite systemwide improvements ask, 'Where's your vision?' " Mr. Eaione said, meaning they want to know the educational principles involving the technology.
Amy Poorandatt, a senior who hopes to study pre-med in college, complains that she almost never gets her hands on a keyboard at Richmond Hill High School. A state survey showed that last year, two-thirds of the students at her school received no computer-assisted instruction. "I think a lot of students would like computer skills for jobs and to go to college," she said.
The school is just barely too well off to qualify for Federal Title I antipoverty money, which many eligible schools use for technology. So it has only four computer labs for its 3,100 students, and all have equipment 8 to 10 years old. "We've gotten a few mini-grants, but nothing that would help us with a whole roomful of equipment," said Susan Feldman, the principal. But the school squeezes the most from its hardware, publishing student magazines on the art room Macintoshes.
But Richmond Hill also finds itself forced to buy software of increasingly limited usefulness for its old machines. New York State gives schools $20 million annually for hardware and software purchases, but prohibits schools from combining the funds. Few computers at Richmond Hill are sophisticated enough to run the best of the newer multimedia programs that fill three double cabinets.
Even wealthier schools find it hard to integrate educational applications that seem to improve monthly. "It's like trying to catch water in your fingers," said Rita Sherman, acting principal of P.S. 76.
The barriers to upgrading are numerous. Old buildings lack the wiring to support computer networks and classroom outlets are too few. Schools are still charged commercial rates to have Internet-ready phone lines installed, as much as $600 a line in some buildings.
Some educators say that city children especially benefit from electronic links to a larger scholarly universe. "It's not ideal, but at least it gets them out into the world," said Judy Zornberg, director of District 1's Web project.
Even at schools at which the computer picture is the brightest, the reality of city school life intrudes. The labs at Ralph Bunche had to be closed twice last year and again in September because of leaks from the roof. And in a situation common in schools, there is only one teacher who understands the complicated workings of the internal network, and he is mostly self-trained. That computer teacher, Paul Reese, is known as perhaps the champion computer grant-grubber in the city, collecting equipment and doing the wiring, installation and repair himself.
"One of the things we worry about is, if Paul goes, what happens?" says Mr. Eaione. "None of this is institutionalized."
Such abstractions do not concern Mehmet Cokgoren and Corin Erby, fifth graders and best friends in Long Island City. They just do not want to log off. The two spend their daily half-hour of computer time racing through assignments so they can surf the in-school network.
"We like to experiment," Corin said. "And we're going through the whole CD-ROM encyclopedia of mammals together."
Little do they know how precarious classroom technology can be, though, when it's built on a foundation of grants.
Last year the computer coordinator at P.S. 76 painstakingly assembled donations from three corporations to link up to the Internet. Nynex installed a demonstration-model high-speed phone line, AT&T donated an expensive digital modem and an I.B.M. subsidiary produced the last piece: a central server computer developed for school use. Corin and Mehmet were connected to the net.
Then, just as the school lost $25,000 in Federal magnet funds and its grant hustler, Steve Wills, left on a medical leave, I.B.M. sold its subsidiary to a company that took back the file server. For lack of $6,000 to buy the file server, Mr. Wills said, "The kids lost the Internet."

Still Worlds Apart on Air Fares;
eUROPEAN tRAVELERS sEE fEW bENEFITS OF dEREGULATION

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Anyone who flies regularly within Europe knows that air fares are breathtakingly high. Never is that clearer that when some upstart emerges to take on the entrenched carriers.
Consider this: for a midweek economy-class round-trip ticket between Brussels and Rome recently, Sabena and Alitalia both charged $1,600. From Brussels to Vienna and back, Sabena and Austrian Airlines charged around $1,400. On the Brussels-Madrid round trip, Sabena and Iberia charged $1,450. 
 For a striking contrast, consider this: a low-cost, no-frills upstart called EBA Express charged just $195 on all three routes. The only real difference is that EBA offers no meals and requires a day's notice of any change in reservations. And while Europe's high-cost national airlines struggle financially, EBA -- which started flying only last year -- is already profitable and is adding new flights and destinations.
"Intra-European flights are too expensive," said Victor Hasson, managing director of EBA Express, which is owned by City Hotels S.A. of Brussels. "The market demand was there to make a no-frills, low-fare operation successful. We get people to fly where in the past they couldn't afford to fly."
Within Europe, though, innovative carriers like EBA Express remain the exception.
Nearly three years after the European Union lifted most restrictions on the routes airlines could fly within Europe and on what they could charge, many carriers, like Air France, remain state owned and are just starting to cut their operating costs. Few have expanded to new routes, leaving travelers in many cases with a choice between carriers with the same high fares.
A recent study by American Express found that fares within Europe are roughly twice as high as those for comparable distances in the United States. For example, the average one-way fare paid by a business traveler between Boston and La Guardia Airport in New York, a 187-mile journey, was $106, including discounts negotiated by big companies. To fly one-way from London to Paris, a trip of 211 miles, costs $214 using a discount economy fare, the study found.
"I am concerned that consumers have not benefited as much as expected from more choice and lower fares," said Neil Kinnock, the commissioner in charge of transportation policy for the European Union and a former leader of Britain's Labor Party. "Apart from the busiest routes and the simplest of point-to-point journeys, fares are still at levels considerably above what could reasonably be justified by cost levels."
Indeed, the stubbornly high fares are clear evidence that Europeans have so far seen nothing like the upheaval that airline deregulation brought to the United States during the last two decades.
Doug Nordlinger, an American lawyer working in London who travels frequently around Europe, said: "Does the quality of the service merit the higher prices? No. Do I think it's outrageous to pay for a business-class ticket and get what amounts to a coach seat? Yes."
But with the European Union scheduled to remove the remaining barriers to competition on European routes in 1997 and a growing number of small but determined new carriers springing up to grab a piece of the busiest routes, the need to get into fighting trim and bring fares down is finally being taken seriously by Europe's big airlines.
"The European markets were very protected for many, many years and there was no opportunity for the level of competition that has existed in the U.S.," said Bob Harrell, an air fare consultant with American Express in New York. "The system is evolving, but like anything involving government or corporate bureaucracy, it doesn't go as fast as people want it to. It doesn't happen in a year or two, any more than Southwest Airlines in the U.S. magically materialized overnight."
The stakes for European airlines are high. Many analysts say that only four or so of the dozen biggest European carriers will survive in their current form once deregulation is completed, throwing state-owned airlines into the rough-and-tumble of the private sector.
Lufthansa of Germany and British Airways lead the list of those likely to prosper, because both have been privatized and are considered efficient by worldwide standards. Air France is a big question mark, as is Alitalia of Italy, while Iberia of Spain faces a bleak future in the view of many analysts.
For carriers from the United States, the upheaval in Europe is of intense interest. The big American carriers have alliances with European partners that allow them to feed passengers onto each other's flights, giving the American airlines a stake in the industry's health.
And in the long run, a deregulated Europe could allow airlines from the United States to begin carrying passengers between European cities, a practice that is largely banned now. Delta Air Lines, for example, has no plans for a big intra-Europe business, but might be interested in particular routes, especially if they helped to feed its large trans-Atlantic traffic, said Dean Breest, a Delta spokesman.
The list of problems facing European airlines is long.
Many dominant national carriers, especially those like Air France and Iberia that remain state owned, are burdened by high costs and overstaffing. A recent study for Air France, for example, found that compensation costs for the carrier's flight attendants were 1.4 times those of their counterparts at Lufthansa.
The high-cost carriers have survived until now only with government aid. Iberia won approval from the European Union last week for $705 million in new subsidies from the Spanish Government. Air France is in the middle of a $4 billion Government-subsidy program. But the European Union has promised to crack down on further subsidies, and eventually disallow them.
Unions representing airline employees, militantly protecting their pay and working conditions, are quick to strike, hurting service, reputation and profits. The strike-plagued Scandinavian Airline System said work stoppages cost it about $45 million in the first nine months of the year.
Governments, worried about being blamed for further job losses at a time when unemployment across Europe is already high, have proved reluctant to push job cuts among state-owned carriers.
Few carriers have expanded aggressively into new routes. Only 7 percent of European routes that cross borders are served by more than two airlines, according to a recent study by Britain's Civil Aviation Authority.
There are some big exceptions to the trend. Britain, Ireland and Germany have gone much further than other nations in deregulating their domestic airline industries and have pushed their airlines to become more competitive. British Airways, for example, has become Europe's most efficient carrier largely because it must compete at home with a well-established domestic competitor, British Midland, and a growing number of start-ups.
Another British carrier, Virgin Atlantic Airways, which now flies to the United States and Asia from London, is considering offering flights within Europe.
Moreover, even those airlines that have long enjoyed political and regulatory protection from their governments are now being forced to consider serious changes to survive.
Despite a history of vehement opposition from its unions, Air France, for example, has proposed hiring new cabin crew members at lower pay than current employees, and its chairman, Christian Blanc, has sought to stimulate a more entrepreneurial management environment by breaking the company's operations into 11 units, each responsible for its own performance.
The most efficient airlines in Europe are starting to move onto their rivals' home turf, creating further competition. British Airways is already competing in the French and German domestic markets, and a 10-year-old Irish airline, Ryanair, just entered the London-to-Scotland market.
When Ryanair began competing with Aer Lingus of Ireland between London and Dublin a decade ago, annual traffic on the route was about one million passengers. It is now up to three million. On the Scotland-to-London routes, Ryanair has undercut the established airlines, offering round-trip tickets for $100 to $160, compared with about $350 for an unrestricted seat on British Airways or British Midland. And a Greek-owned start-up called Easyjet has come in and undercut Ryanair.
"What we have now is a good old-fashioned price war," said Tim Jeans, a Ryanair director. By making the trip affordable to people who otherwise would not fly, Mr. Jeans said, the annual number of passengers on the London-Scotland route should double to 3.4 million within four years.

Chart: "Flight Patterns"
 Deregulation has driven down fares on many air travel routes in the United States. But in Europe, despite goading by the European Union, there are still only the first stirrings of price competition. The result is that fares for trips of similar lengths are typically twice or more as expensive in Europe as in the United States.

Natural Gas Surges on Concern About Cold Weather Forecasts

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Natural gas futures prices surged to a record yesterday as cold weather forecasts threw traders into a panic over supplies.
Wholesale natural gas for January delivery soared 36.4 cents, to $2.868 for 1,000 cubic feet, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It traded as high as $2.90, a record for a near-term futures contract, surpassing the high of $2.80 set on April 23, 1993. 
 Natural gas futures prices have been traded only since April 1990. Cash prices for immediate delivery were as high as $9 for 1,000 cubic feet in the early 1980's, when petroleum prices were at their peak.
Analysts said winter storm warnings and cold weekend forecasts for the Northeast prompted heavy buying by companies holding so-called short positions, or futures contracts obligating them to deliver natural gas at a set price.
"There is a large hype element in the market, but any situation like this is going to panic anybody who is short, and you create a kind of stampede effect," said Tom Knight, a trading manager for Fina Inc., a Dallas-based oil and natural gas producer.
Heating oil futures also rose, but crude-oil and gasoline futures ended mixed.
On other commodity markets, soybean and corn futures extended their gains on forecasts for more hot, dry weather in South American growing areas. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 commodities rose 0.40 point, to 245.44.
Gas consumption is up because outside temperatures have been down, said Bruce Henning, chief economist for the American Gas Association, an industry trade group in Arlington, Va. Mr. Henning said average weekly temperatures nationwide from mid-October through Dec. 16 were 4.1 percent below normal and 14.6 percent below last year's readings for the corresponding period.
Natural gas inventories were 10 percent below the level a year earlier as of Dec. 13, the gas association reported last week. The group will release another weekly report today.
Heavy snow was forecast for last night and today in the Northeast, to be followed by cold temperatures.
Mr. Knight said heating oil futures did not respond as dramatically as natural gas to the forecasts because traders were awaiting weekly inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute. The institute's report, which was released after the close, showed American stocks of heating oil and other petroleum distillates down 3.4 million barrels from last week at 131.2 million barrels.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Modest Interest-Rate Cut by Fed Helps to Move the Dollar Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar moved higher against other leading currencies yesterday after the Federal Reserve's interest-rate cut was seen as a token measure.
Typically, lower interest rates would hurt the dollar, but the Fed chose to cut a short-term rate by a quarter of a percentage point rather than a half and left alone the more influential discount rate. 
 In light of other rate cuts that began last week in Europe, the American cut had minimal effect.
"They treated it like it was a no-cut scenario," so the dollar rose, with traders selling German marks and Japanese yen, said Dan Ascani, editor and publisher of the Global Market Strategist, an advisory firm in Gainesville, Ga.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.4410 marks, up from 1.4290 late on Monday. The dollar was also changing hands in New York at 101.96 yen, just up from 101.52.
Other late dollar rates in New York were 1.1565 Swiss francs, up from 1.1465; 4.9555 French francs, up from 4.9200, and 1,595 Italian lire, unchanged. The British pound was quoted at $1.5415, up from $1.5403 on Monday.
The dollar was already climbing before the Fed announced the cut, and while the dollar rose on the news, it remained within its recent trading range.
Within recent days, market participants had become less sure that the Fed would ease rates, given contradictions in recent economic data and the discord in Washington over the budget.
But two items made traders more bullish yesterday. The President and Congress said they were ready to negotiate on the budget. And numerous European central banks have been cutting their interest rates since late last week, reducing the risk that an American cut would hurt the dollar.
When a country cuts rates to spur lending and growth, its currency can suffer because the country's assets and investments are less desirable.
The Fed has "given the markets a token cut to let them know they are listening," Mr. Ascani said.

HEADLINE: Who Will Rule Haiti?

 BODY:
Sunday's presidential election in Haiti marked a milestone for democracy there and a success for United States policy. Next February, for the first time in nearly 200 years of Haitian independence, one democratically elected President can yield power to another. That was one of President Clinton's main goals when he dispatched more than 20,000 American troops in September 1994.
The winner, by a large margin, was Rene Preval, who ran with the powerful endorsement of the incumbent, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. While the polling was generally free of the disruptions that marred recent parliamentary elections, voter turnout was low and the campaign was disappointingly short on serious debate. 
 Mr. Preval, who served as Prime Minister during the chaotic first months of Mr. Aristide's presidency before the 1991 military coup, is known as a strong Aristide loyalist. But he has a credible record of his own and need not simply be a conduit for the outgoing President's orders. Mr. Preval's credentials as an opponent of dictatorship go back almost a decade.
But Mr. Preval's own views may be irrelevant. Mr. Aristide gives every indication of intending to rule indirectly through him, perhaps by having himself designated prime minister. That would be unfortunate. The formal achievement of a democratic passage of power would be meaningless if Mr. Aristide continued ruling behind Mr. Preval.
Haiti's transition from decades of abusive government and economic stagnation has a long way to go. Excessive concentrations of political and economic power and a culture of arbitrary policing remain largely in place. The next President will face severe challenges, beginning with the departure of the United Nations forces only weeks after Inauguration Day. To govern effectively, Mr. Preval will have to demonstrate early that he can take hard decisions on his own.

HEADLINE: Welfare in the Real World

BYLINE: By James T. Fleming; James T. Fleming, a Republican, is majority leader of the Connecticut Senate.

DATELINE: HARTFORD

 BODY:
Can states be trusted to administer basic welfare programs fairly and equitably, or will they simply embark on a wholesale "race to the bottom," as President Clinton suggests? Congress might look to Connecticut for an early answer to this important question.
Last spring, the Connecticut Legislature overwhelmingly adopted a welfare reform package that imposes the nation's shortest time limit on benefits -- 21 months -- and reduces payments under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program by an average of 7 percent. Does this mean Connecticut is shredding the social safety net? Hardly. 
 A typical three-person welfare family in Connecticut can expect to receive benefits totaling $16,832 a year, according to a recent analysis by the General Assembly's Office of Legislative Research. This includes not only direct cash payments ($6,600), food stamps ($2,436) and energy assistance ($212) but also Medicaid ($5,580) and housing subsidies ($2,004). By comparison, a working poor family not receiving welfare would have to earn the equivalent of $9.11 an hour just to keep pace with its neighbors on public assistance.
Welfare recipients are no different from anyone else: they act in their own economic self-interest. In Connecticut they have a fundamental choice to make. Welfare parents can stay home with their children full time knowing that they will be subsidized by the taxpayers to the tune of nearly $17,000 a year. Or they can enter the labor market and risk earning less than the welfare equivalent of $9.11 an hour. No wonder so few welfare parents work.
 Connecticut's contribution to the "race to the bottom" has been to reduce a typical welfare family's benefit from $581 a month to $543, a $38 cut. For some families this may be a burden. But it might also push parents into jobs to make up the loss of income. In fact, this is precisely what has happened. The percentage of A.F.D.C. parents who report earned income has jumped 30 percent since benefits were reduced in July. No small coincidence in my mind.
But President Clinton is adamant about not turning welfare programs over to the states in the belief that the governors will shirk their responsibilities to the poor. He should know. As Governor of Arkansas, Mr. Clinton presided over a welfare system that had one of the nation's lowest monthly benefits. I doubt very much that the governors need a lecture from him about compassion for the poor.
Maybe the President has Connecticut in mind when he suggests that states will slash and burn the social safety net. After all, our cut in the A.F.D.C. benefit and strict time limit are being called the toughest in the nation. Very deliberately, they are.
But this is only part of the story. Our reforms also permit parents to earn income from a job up to the poverty level without losing a penny of their welfare payment. Child-care financing has increased 64 percent, all families are guaranteed medical care and businesses are encouraged to hire welfare parents through a new $1,500 tax credit. All of these changes will work to shift our welfare rolls to payrolls while saving the taxpayers $133 million over the next two years.
But these steps aren't good enough for the Clinton Administration, which has put so many conditions on our 21-month time limit that it may be rendered ineffective and useless. The Administration has also refused to permit our two-tier payment system, which discourages welfare migration to Connecticut by paying newcomers a lower cash benefit.
The Administration desperately clings to the discredited theory that "Washington knows best." But Connecticut's experience under Republican Gov. John G. Rowland suggests that we can count on other states to be fair, reasonable and compassionate in carrying out welfare reform. Even with our benefit reductions factored in, a typical welfare family can expect to receive an array of benefits that place them at 137 percent of the Federal poverty level.
For too long we've had to take a back seat while Federal bureaucrats called the shots in administering basic welfare programs. They've failed. It's time for Washington to step aside and vest this responsibility where it belongs: in Hartford and the 49 other state capitols.

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW;
Scheming Italian Entrepreneurs in Troubled Albania

 BODY:
"Lamerica" was shown as part of this year's New York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 4. The film opens today at Lincoln Plaza Cinema, Broadway at 63d Street, and Angelika Film Center, Houston and Mercer Streets, Greenwich Village.
Gianni Amelio's magnificently humane "Lamerica" takes place in 1991 in an Albania visibly coming apart at the seams. After nearly 50 years in isolation under the Communist dictatorship headed by Enver Hoxha and his successor, Ramiz Alia, Europe's poorest country is in turmoil, led by a Socialist Government that will hold power for only one year. Meanwhile, the streets are strewn with rubble and the populace is volatile and anarchic. It is either a scene of devastation or a land of opportunity, depending on one's point of view. 
 "Lamerica" begins with two Italian entrepreneurs who hope to turn Albania's misery into a private windfall. The prosperous Fiore (Michele Placido) and his slick assistant, Gino (Enrico Lo Verso), expect to start a dummy corporation, open a bogus shoe factory and exploit the economic possibilities. Fiore and Gino's idea requires the use of an Albanian figurehead for their company. And it is here that the fiscal plans start collapsing, and this spare, supremely eloquent film takes flight. From a labor camp that once housed political prisoners, they commandeer the most helpless-looking wretch they can find. This old man (Carmelo Di Mazzarelli) is named Spiro and is lost in the past. When asked his age, in one of the film's most profoundly startling moments, he signals with his hands that he is 20. Fifty years in prison have slipped his mind.
What happens next becomes a potent reminder of Mr. Amelio's equally astonishing "Stolen Children," in which Mr. Lo Verso played a carabiniere reluctantly forced to escort two children on a journey across Italy. Directed in the same lucid, simple, beautifully refurbished neo-realist style, "Lamerica"' sends Mr. Lo Verso on another spiritual journey. Separated from Fiore and sent off to watch Spiro, he is gradually stripped of everything that identifies him as a wealthy Italian carpetbagger. Instead, Gino is forced to become part of Albania's upheaval and to discover the world anew.
Albania is an inspired setting for "Lamerica," a film that proceeds matter-of-factly until it raises the stakes to capture a far-reaching poetic vision of immigrant experience. (The title is meant to be an illiterate Italian immigrant's spelling of America, to which Mr. Amelio's grandfather immigrated from Italy after World War II.) The film makes a clear connection between Albania in the 1990's and postwar Italy: both nations were economically devastated and reeling from the effects of dictatorship.
These were the postwar conditions from which Italian neo-realism emerged, exposing the personal hardships wrought by political strife and finding hope and bravery in the daily struggles waged by ordinary people. So this time Mr. Amelio reinvents neo-realism with an especially acute sense of history. A young Italian like Gino, interested only in new-found prosperity and oblivious to the lessons of the past, has a lot to learn from Albania's troubles.
The film's synthesis of fact and fiction is gracefully achieved, as in placing Gino on a jampacked truck transporting would-be immigrants to an Albanian port city. The scene is galvanized by the sad, dramatized fate that befalls one passenger, but its conversation and impossible crowding seem real.
Mr. Lo Verso once again shows himself to be a touchingly naive Everyman, a mournfully handsome actor whose face seems effortlessly revealing. Without a false note anywhere, he also establishes the right prickly intimacy with Mr. Mazzarelli, an 80-year-old retired Sicilian fisherman with no acting experience.
Mr. Amelio's earlier films (including the arid 1990 "Open Doors") have been well received without reaching a large audience. He deserves to become more widely known.

HEADLINE: OVERHAUL BACKED IN COMMUNICATION

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
House and Senate negotiators agreed tonight on a sweeping bill to rewrite the nation's communications laws from top to bottom, clearing the way for Congress to pass a final bill before the weekend.
The agreement came after Republicans capitulated to Democrats on a wide variety of issues, and it means that the bill is virtually assured of passing Congress and being signed into law by President Clinton. 
 The new measure is likely to reshape the landscape of the entire communications industry, eventually bringing new competition for local telephone and cable-television monopolies and almost certainly provoking a wave of mergers and new alliances in the media and telecommunications industries.
The essential purpose of the measure, and ultimately its most profound effect for both consumers and the communications industry, is to knock down regulatory barriers that currently separate the industry into protected fiefs for local telephone, long-distance and cable-television service.
Advances in technology and rapid change in the marketplace have made those barriers increasingly outdated and, many experts believe, have been harmful to competition and consumers.
The bill would also impose tough new restrictions -- bitterly opposed by civil liberties groups -- against transmitting material considered "filthy, lewd or indecent" over the Internet and commercial on-line services. And the bill would require television manufacturers to install a new chip aimed at letting parents block out violent programming.
The agreement won ringing support tonight from the Administration. President Clinton had been threatening for months to veto the bill if Congress did not retreat on a long list of issues.
"This is a great Christmas present," said Vice President Al Gore in an interview tonight, adding that the agreement satisfied "every single one" of the White House's objections. "This will unleash a new era in the telecommunications revolution, and speed completion of the information highway," he said.
Despite a frenzy of lobbying and political contributions by giant telephone and entertainment companies, the bill that emerged today is substantially more moderate than the one passed by either the House or the Senate and is likely to be less jolting for consumers.
But telephone and cable customers, particularly those in bigger cities, are likely to encounter choices and changes that will be far more bewildering than those that occurred after the Justice Department broke up the old Bell System in 1984. Local and long-distance telephone companies will start attacking each other's markets with new packages of services, and both sides are likely to offer cable television and other video services as well.
If the possibilities are exhilarating, the complexity is likely to be infuriating.
In marathon negotiations behind closed doors, Republicans softened numerous provisions in the bill that would have greatly increased the number of television and radio properties a single company could own.
Under pressure from Democrats, moreover, lawmakers had already backed away from provisions to eliminate most regulation of cable-television prices and agreed to keep most price restraints in place until March 1999.
The most politically significant compromise -- and the most unexpected -- is a deal cut today that appears to resolve the most intractable dispute in the entire measure: provisions to rewrite the antitrust consent decree that broke up the old Bell System and let the regional Baby Bell companies compete in the long-distance market.
The AT&T Corporation and other long-distance carriers had bitterly opposed both the House and Senate bills, arguing that the Bells should not be allowed into the long-distance market until they faced greater competition in the local phone market.
Tonight, executives of both AT&T and some Bell companies said the bill would be acceptable. To placate the long-distance industry, lawmakers agreed today to give the Justice Department at least a partial role in deciding when to let a Bell company enter the long-distance business. Lawmakers also gave long-distance companies a handful of more technical concessions, which could give them a temporary advantage over the Bells in offering a combined package of local and long-distance service.
Local telephone and cable television companies are already upgrading their networks so they can attack each other's markets, although both industries have discovered that what seems simple in theory is turning out to be difficult and expensive in practice. Long-distance carriers like AT&T, MCI Communications and Sprint, meanwhile, are spending billions of dollars to build new capacity for offering both wired and wireless local telephone service.
The political battle has not been over any of the bill's core goals. Indeed, Democrats produced the original bill more than two years ago and almost passed a measure last year.
The main disputes have been over issues about the concentration of media ownership and about the details under which local telephone companies would be forced to open their networks to competitors.
Today's agreement came after weeks of negotiations, mostly between a handful of key lawmakers from both parties. Republicans were led in large measure by Representative Jack Fields of Texas, chairman of the House Commerce Committee's subcommittee on telecommunications, who had been among the most hawkish legislators about abolishing restrictions on media ownership. The Democrats were led by Senator Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina and Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan -- both skilled practitioners of power politics.
Senator Hollings adamantly refused to go along with Republican proposals to relax media ownership rules, and Republicans ultimately had to defer to him in order to avoid a crippling filibuster in the Senate.
The original House and Senate bills would have greatly increased the number of television stations a single company can own nationwide, allowing a company to own any number of stations that reach as much as 35 percent of the audience. At present, the limit is 12 stations that reach no more than 25 percent of the national audience.
The House bill would have gone further, allowing a single company to own two television stations in the same market and many radio stations.
In closed-door negotiations today, Republicans retreated on several key points. They abandoned provisions that would have locked in regulatory loopholes that effectively allow a company to push beyond the remaining ownership limits. They also dropped provisions that would have relaxed local ownership restrictions, agreeing to leave that issue up to the Federal Communications Commission. And they dropped provisions that would have allowed a company to own both a broadcast television station and a cable television system in the same market.
"This bill is both pro-competition and pro-public interest at the same time," said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts. "It's the one gift for consumers in an otherwise dismal Christmas season."
Perhaps the biggest surprise today was the deal struck between local and long-distance telephone companies. It was not immediately clear whether all the Bell companies would support the newest concessions to long-distance carriers, but the deal won the support of the Nynex Corporation and of AT&T.
"Based on what we understand, there have been significant improvements in this legislation," said Herb Linnen, a spokesman for AT&T. "Most importantly, the Congress appears poised to enact landmark legislation that would break down the remaining barriers to full competition in this industry."
Tom Tauke, head of government affairs at Nynex, which owns local telephone companies in New York and New England and faces some of the most intense competition of any local telephone operator in the country, said: "This legislation looks like a major step forward for consumers, the economy of the country and those companies providing telecommunications services. It gives Nynex what it needs to compete."
Even consumer groups, which have been most suspicious of deregulation, were guardedly supportive. "There has been much progress," said Gene Kimmelman, a lobbyist for Consumers Union.
While lawmakers and industry groups have focused on business issues, public attention has been more riveted on concerns about depictions of sex and violence.
Provisions that would impose fines of up to $100,000 and prison terms of up to two years on people who make "indecent" material available to minors over computer networks are now part of the final bill and could pose big problems for companies that provide on-line information services.
The "cyberporn" issue was championed by conservative religious groups, including the Christian Coalition, and senior Republicans viewed the issue with concern. But conservatives largely achieved their agenda, and the issue is certain to provoke a new courtroom battle over Constitutional rights to free speech. Indeed, the measure includes a provision that requires a Federal court in Washington to take up the issue almost as soon as someone challenges its legality.
Liberal Democrats, led by Representative Markey, prevailed on their own social issue: curbing violence on television. Overcoming passionate objections by television broadcasters, Mr. Markey and other Democrats won support for a mandatory V-chip to block TV programming that will now become law as well.

PREDICTIONS GONE SOUR
Chart: "What a Vetoed Bill Would Do"
Provides a "safe harbor" for predictions companies make about their expected performance. Companies would be safe from legal liability for such statements as long as they were accompanied by "meaningful cautionary statements" identifying all important factors that could affect the prediction.
 
PROTECTING OUTSIDE FIRMS
Protects accountants and securities underwriters from being sued by private investors for "aiding and abetting" fraud, thus denying those deep pockets as a target for plaintiffs.
 
TIME LIMITS
Sets the statute of limitations for filing fraud claims at three years after a violation occurs and one year after it is discovered. The Securities and Exchange Commission had asked for a five-year statute of limitations.
 
FRIVOLOUS SUITS
 Requires judges to make a determination if a suit was brought frivolously or abusively. If such a finding is made, the party bringing the suit would be liable to pay the other side's costs.
 
JUDICIAL DISCRETION
Allows judges to select as the lead plaintiff in a class-action suit, the one with the greatest financial stake, this avoiding the so-called "race to the Courthouse" in which a lawyer may seek a compliant stockholder as a client to control the lawsuit.

HEADLINE: Dow Tumbles After Break in Budget Talks

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Stock prices of some of America's biggest and best-known companies plunged in the last 15 minutes of trading yesterday, a slide that some analysts attributed to the latest snag in Washington's budget impasse.
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 50.57 points at 5,059.32. Traders and analysts said that a wave of computer-driven sell programs in the final quarter-hour of trading pushed the Dow down by more than 30 points. 
 "The very aggressive sell programs were the ribbon on the package," said Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates Inc., a market research firm in Greenwich, Conn. Mr. Birinyi said one program of close to $300 million involved almost 400 stocks in the Standard & Poor's index of 500 issues.
The late selloff cast a pall over what had been a fairly good day. The Dow, as well as broader market indexes, spent much of the session on the plus side, as the positive momentum continued from the Federal Reserve's decision on Tuesday to cut a key short-term interest rate.
As a result of the Fed's move, many of the nation's biggest banks, including Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and Chemical, said yesterday that they had lowered their prime lending rates to 8.50 percent from 8.75 percent.
Indeed, despite the sharp decline in the Dow, advancing issues led decliners by a margin of about 3 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange. At 444.4 million shares, trading volume was heavy.
Among broader market indexes,the Nasdaq composite index fell 1.14 points, to 1,025.27, and the S.& P. 500 declined 5.99 points, to 605.94. The Big Board's composite index fell 2.10 points, to 323.61.
As the day progressed, disquiet grew about the budget talks, which on Tuesday had seemed back on track. By late afternoon, it became increasingly apparent that negotiations had been stalled by differences between the White House and House Republicans about whether Government offices that had been shut since the weekend would reopen before an agreement on a budget was reached.
In a televised appearance in the White House briefing room at 3:30 P.M., President Clinton accused "the most extreme" House Republicans of reneging on a deal that could have ended the partial shutdown.
"Clinton made a hardball statement, and we don't want that," said Albert Goldman, director of market research at A. G. Edwards in St. Louis. "The market would like to see progress toward a balanced budget made now. We didn't get it today."
The bond market did not care for developments in Washington either, but traders there were more restrained. Bond prices, which had been up early in the day, softened later, and long-term interest rates inched a bit higher.
Analysts said the negative reaction in the fixed-income market probably fed the stock market.
"At current prices, it is almost impossible for stocks to be up when bonds are down," said Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers.
Of the 30 Dow stocks, Philip Morris shares took the biggest tumble, falling $3.50, to $86.375. The company was named in a lawsuit filed on Tuesday by the State of Massachusetts, which is seeking as much as $1 billion that the state said it had spent on health care for poor people afflicted with tobacco-related illnesses.
But other blue chips also suffered. Coca-Cola fell by $3 a share, to $74.25. I.B.M. was off $2.50, to $89.375. And General Electric lost $2, to $70 a share.
Transportation stocks bucked the downward trend, led by airline shares. Those stocks rose smartly after a positive reading on earnings from the USAir Group. USAir's stock was up 12.5 cents a share, to $13.25. Much better gains were posted by AMR, the parent of American Airlines, which increased by $2 a share, to $76.125. Shares of Delta Air Lines rose $1.875, to $77.
Based on what he described as a "nasty close," Mr. Goldman said he expected some further weakness when equities begin trading today. Given the downward move in prices since Dec. 14, though, he said any further declines should be viewed as a chance to step in.
"From its intraday high of 5,260 on Dec. 14, the Dow has traded down to a low of 5,025, which we reached on Tuesday," Mr. Goldman said. "That is a fairly big move, and did a lot to correct the 500-point rally we have had in the past seven weeks.
"If the market gets sloppy at the opening, I may advise aggressive accounts to be buyers."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Who counts budget beans best, Congress or the White House?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
WHEN the bean counters at the Congressional Budget Office disagree with their counterparts on the President's Council of Economic Advisers, whom do you trust?
The question has emerged as the issue of the hour in the political duel over deficit reduction. 
 On Tuesday, President Clinton agreed that the budget office would manage the accounting for deficit scorekeeping. But the White House insists that the President has not agreed to negotiate a balanced budget on the basis of the relatively pessimistic economic assumptions built into the budget office's projections.
And while those who follow the arcana of budget-making usually side with the Congressional Budget Office because it has a better record at forecasting and a well-founded reputation for nonpartisanship, this time around the White House numbers apparently rest on equally firm technical ground.
"On many points I find myself sympathetic with the Administration," said Laurence H. Meyer, a respected private forecaster in St. Louis.
President Clinton has agreed to wipe out the deficit in seven years. But last week the Congressional Budget Office took a critical look at the President's proposed budget and pronounced it $115 billion in deficit -- not $2 billion in surplus, as the White House projects.
Some $39 billion of the difference reflects budget office skepticism about the likely savings from the Administration's proposed spending cuts and tax changes. But two-thirds of the $117 billion gap mirrors differing economic assumptions.
For one thing, the White House expects technical fixes in inflation accounting to remedy biases that in the past pushed up Government outlays far faster than revenues. The budget office is more conservative -- an assumption that adds billions to its projected deficit. Yet more significant, the White House assumes that the economy will be operating at roughly the current rate of unemployment rather than the more conservative 6 percent assumed by the budget office.
Forced to choose between the forecasts without the luxury of a leisurely examination, most budget watchers would no doubt go with the Congressional Budget Office. Indeed, in newspaper advertisements this week, corporate chief executives proclaimed their collective trust in the "realistic projections" offered by the budget office.
One good reason is that its forecasts have been more accurate in the past. Stephen K. McNees, a vice president and economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston documented this winning record in the July/August 1995 issue of The New England Economic Review.
He found that while the Congressional Budget Office and the White House council had both done respectable jobs in predicting average two-year inflation rates, the budget office was the clear winner at predicting economic growth between 1976 and 1995. The budget office missed on two-year predictions by an average of just eight-tenths of 1 percentage point, while the White House was off by 1.1 percentage points. The difference was even greater on four-year projections: the budget office's average error was nine-tenths of 1 percentage point, compared with 1.3 percentage points for the Council of Economic Advisers.
Why, then, does Mr. McNees lean toward the White House projections? One way of explaining the superior performance of the Congressional Budget Office is that its forecasts have more closely tracked the commercial forecasting services. And this time around, the White House is somewhat closer to the private consensus.
The budget office is projecting the average growth of national output in current dollars at 4.9 percent through 2002, while the White House projects growth of 5.4 percent. Robert J. Eggert, the editor of Blue Chip Economic Indicators in Sedona, Ariz., says that the consensus view of 45 forecasters is 5.2 percent through 2001 and slightly faster thereafter.
Much of the difference lies in the budget office's assumption that unemployment will rise from the current rate of 5.6 percent to 5.9 percent in 1998 and to 6 percent in 1999 and beyond. In essence, Mr. Meyer says, the budget office is guessing that the Federal Reserve will prevent the high employment levels needed to deliver fast-growing tax revenues to fill Government coffers.
If there is a one grand moral to this tale, it's that the budget negotiators' time horizon is too long. The one thing forecasters ought to agree about, says Robert D. Reischauer, the former director of the budget office, is that "what you predict won't come to pass."
No one knows whether the economy will grow at 2 percent, 2.5 percent or even 3 percent over the next seven years. That's why no one really knows whether the Republican Congressional package or President Clinton's plan will leave the budget in comfortable surplus or painful deficit in 2002.
There is probably no way for the negotiators to acknowledge this reality and to redefine the terms of the budget battle. But that should not stop the rest of us from focusing on the real economic issue of how well the new budget reflects national priorities.

HEADLINE: Doctors Say H.M.O.'s Limit What They Can Tell Patients

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
Doctors across the country say that health maintenance organizations routinely limit their ability to talk freely with patients about treatment options and H.M.O. payment policies, including financial bonuses for doctors who save money by withholding care.
In interviews over the last three weeks, many doctors said such restrictions interfered with their ethical and legal duty to provide patients with information about the benefits, risks and costs of various treatments. 
 Ill feeling over the restrictions is growing as more and more Americans join H.M.O.'s and employers encourage their use to control costs. Typically, H.M.O.'s offer a wide range of services in return for a fixed monthly premium. They recommend a select list of doctors and hospitals, and patients must pay more if they go outside that network.
H.M.O.'s may limit access to certain tests and treatments and require doctors to obtain permission from the H.M.O. to offer them. Doctors may receive bonuses or other financial rewards from the H.M.O. if they control costs and help restrain the use of health care.
But patients are often unaware of these financial arrangements because many contracts between doctors and H.M.O.'s prohibit the doctors from disclosing them. Increasingly, doctors are objecting to these confidentiality clauses, which they call "gag clauses," and they say that patients are entitled to such information.
For their part, health maintenanace organizations say that some of the restrictions are intended to protect trade secrets and proprietary information. Susan M. Pisano, a spokeswoman for the Group Health Association of America, which represents managed care companies, said another purpose was to "discourage doctors from disparaging H.M.O.'s and encourage them to discuss their concerns about payment and treatment policies with doctors and physician managers in the health plan, rather than with patients."
Dr. Christine K. Cassel, president-elect of the American College of Physicians, which represents 85,000 internists, said: "Managed care can be beneficial for patients, but patients need to understand the financial arrangements. To my dismay, gag clauses are becoming more common."
Whitney North Seymour Jr., a lawyer for the League of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, said the confidentiality clauses muzzled doctors who wanted to be advocates for their patients.
A typical clause is found in the contract of Choice Care in Cincinnati, which says, "Physician shall take no action nor make any communication which undermines or could undermine the confidence of enrollees, potential enrollees, their employers, plan sponsors or the public in Choice Care, or in the quality of care which Choice Care enrollees receive."
U.S. Healthcare, which describes itself as the largest operator of H.M.O.'s on the East Coast, has an almost identical clause in its agreement with doctors. David F. Simon, senior vice president of U.S. Healthcare, said the purpose was to protect patients, to make sure they were "not put in the middle" of economic disputes between doctors and the company.
A recent notice to doctors working for the Kaiser Permanente H.M.O. in Ohio says, "Do not discuss proposed treatment with Kaiser Permanente members prior to receiving authorization" from an outside company that sets guidelines for the treatment of patients. In addition, it says that doctors should not discuss the procedure by which they get such authorization.
Asked about this instruction, Jenny M. Hovinen, a spokeswoman for Kaiser Permanente of Ohio, said, "It's a very unfortunate statement, isn't it?" But she said it was part of an elaborate effort to guarantee high-quality care by making sure doctors were aware of the best treatments before discussing them with patients.
Sometimes doctors want to recommend a treatment not covered by the H.M.O. in which a patient is enrolled. Sometimes they want to refer patients to specialists not affiliated with the plan, because they believe that the best care is found elsewhere. Their ability to do so may be severely limited by a confidentiality clause.
"These gag clauses intimidate physicians and discourage them from talking openly to patients about the need for specialty care and the role of managed care companies in limiting tests and treatments," said Neil Weisfeld, deputy executive director of the Medical Society of New Jersey. "It's more like managed silence than managed care."
Doctors who obey such restrictions run legal risks and may be sued for malpractice. Carol L. O'Brien, a lawyer at the American Medical Association, said: "A physician can be held legally accountable for a patient's injury or death if the doctor provides substandard care because of financial constraints imposed by an H.M.O. Juries have awarded hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages in cases where doctors failed to put the patients' interests first."
The association's ethics authority, the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, declared recently that doctors should inform patients of "all relevant financial inducements," including incentives to limit care.
Doctors in New York have filed a lawsuit challenging a confidentiality clause, on the ground that it "destroys the physician's liberty to convey needed information to patients concerning H.M.O. operations." The lawsuit, by the League of Physicians and Surgeons, says the restriction "stifles discussion of quality of care issues and H.M.O. practices that are harmful to patients." The case was argued last week before a state judge, who has yet to issue a decision.
Other contracts say that doctors may not make "disparaging remarks" or "derogatory remarks" about H.M.O.'s. Some contracts say that if doctors are dropped from a particular health plan for any reason, they may not contact their patients to inform them of that fact. The H.M.O.'s apparently fear that such doctors will encourage patients to leave one health plan and follow the doctors to another.
The doctors' complaints illustrate the tension between them and H.M.O.'s as health plans try to monitor and regulate the doctors' behavior.
Dr. Daniel A. Gregorie, president of Choice Care in Cincinnati, defended the confidentiality clause as a way to prevent doctors from sharing their frustrations with patients.
"Physicians are angry, frustrated and, to some extent, depressed because the world as they've known it is changing rapidly and radically," Dr. Gregorie said. "But physicians should not take out that frustration in a nonconstructive way by sharing it with patients. That does not help the patients. It just makes them more anxious about the care they are receiving."
An editorial being published on Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine says that some H.M.O.'s use financial rewards and penalties to force doctors to skimp on care and then try to prevent them from speaking out. A co-author of the editorial, Dr. David U. Himmelstein, had a contract to treat patients of U.S. Healthcare in the Boston area, but the company terminated the agreement "without cause" last month. The doctor had criticized the H.M.O. at an industry conference a few weeks earlier.
Dr. Himmelstein, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard, is a founder of Physicians for a National Health Program, which advocates a Government-financed system of national health insurance like the one in Canada.
Mr. Simon, who works at the headquarters of U.S. Healthcare in Blue Bell, Pa., said: "This is a tempest in a teapot. Dr. Himmelstein was not dismissed because of his political views, which have been known for many years. His services were no longer necessary to serve our members in New England, given the expansion of our network of doctors in the last year."

HEADLINE: Orange County Sues Marwick For $3 Billion

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., Dec. 20

 BODY:
Orange County sued its former outside auditor today for $3 billion, accusing KPMG Peat Marwick of failing to detect and warn of the risks to investments that resulted in the nation's biggest municipal bankruptcy.
Peat Marwick, the nation's second-largest accounting firm, denied wrongdoing and said the county was blaming others for its own mistakes. 
 The suit opens a second front in the county's battle to blame brokers and other professionals for a $1.64 billion investment loss. It has a $2 billion lawsuit pending against Merrill Lynch & Company, the main investment house used by the former county treasurer, Robert L. Citron. Merrill Lynch also denies wrongdoing.
Today's lawsuit said Peat Marwick, which billed itself as pre-eminent in municipal audits, had been specifically asked to evaluate Mr. Citron's investments because internal county auditors lacked the expertise.
Peat Marwick completed audits for 1992 and 1993 and had nearly completed its 1994 review of county books when the county disclosed its huge investment losses and filed for bankruptcy-law protection on Dec. 6, 1994.
Despite many "red flags," nowhere did the firm warn that Mr. Citron had violated the state's Constitution and laws and his own investment guidelines by transforming a portfolio of taxpayer funds into "a massive wager on interest rates remaining low or falling further," the lawsuit says.
John R. Miller, director of Peat Marwick's government assurance practice, said the county's problem was its own failed investment strategy, not an accounting lapse.
"This is a continuation of the county's pattern to blame others for its investment decisions," Mr. Miller said.
He said investigations by a State Senate committee, the State Auditor and the county grand jury had yielded no accusations of wrongdoing against his firm, and he expects none.
"We're not financial advisers," Mr. Miller said. "Our role was to attest to the financial statements of the county and insure that they comply with generally accepted accounting practices. I'm very comfortable with those disclosures."
In its suit against Merrill Lynch, the county contends that the company devised and encouraged the huge borrowings and reinvestments in interest rate-sensitive securities.

The partial Government shutdown has begun to take a toll on the Government's statistical system, delaying publication of various reports that affect securities markets and denying Federal Reserve policy makers full economic information in setting the nation's monetary course for the next six weeks.
But officials at the Labor and Commerce Departments, which produce the bulk of nonagricultural data, say they see no immediate threat to the integrity of the figures themselves once the Government fully reopens and can process and publish what they have collected. 
 "I don't think we yet face the prospect of gaps in the system," Everett M. Ehrlich, Under Secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs, said. For such irreparable damage, he added, "we'd have to go into January" without gathering data.
About 260,000 Federal workers, including most in the Labor and Commerce Departments, have been furloughed this week as a result of the budget stalemate in Washington.
But unlike the situation in the Government's partial mid-November shutdown, which occurred during data collection for the employment and other reports, the current furloughs come after most of the monthly numbers have been obtained.
"We got lucky this time," said William G. Barron Jr., the Deputy Commissioner of Labor Statistics. "These data have all been captured."
Still, officials expressed concern about what would happen if the legions of Federal statistical workers, virtually all of them deemed to be nonemergency workers and thus subject to furlough, do not soon return.
The most "vulnerable" set of statistics, according to Mr. Ehrlich, is the Current Population survey, a monthly tally conducted by the Census Bureau and used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to compute the nation's unemployment rate. If furloughed employees are not back by Tuesday, the first broad reading of economic performance for December could not be published as scheduled on Jan. 5.
And according to a Labor Statistics memo, a two-week interruption that ended Jan. 2 would bring "severe delays" in publishing figures on consumer prices for December and in collecting prices for January. The December Consumer Price Index report is scheduled for release on Jan. 12.
Already, this round of furloughs prevented the Commerce Department on Tuesday from issuing its revised estimate of gross domestic product for the third quarter along with a mass of updated historic G.D.P. data and its compilation of housing starts data for November.
These normally would have been factored into deliberations of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's policy-making panel, which met later that day and decided to cut short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point.
The figures were not supplied to the Fed in any form, though economists said they doubted the missing data would have been decisive.
Bob Moore, a Fed spokesman, commented, "I think we have everything we need."
Today, the Commerce Department did not publish as scheduled its compilation of exports and imports for October, a report that often has political as well as economic repercussions. On Thursday, the Labor Department will not issue its weekly tabulation of first-time claims for unemployment insurance, an erratic indicator but also one of the most current.
Department officials said they have fielded scores of inquiries from Wall Street analysts and corporate executives about the delayed figures, which in most cases can be issued within a day or two of a return of furloughed workers.
But beginning next week, the situation becomes more serious, with the labor statistics bureau due, among other things, to start mailing surveys to companies for January's Producer Price Index.
Mr. Ehrlich said that while larger businesses were likely to be able to respond accurately to late inquiries, smaller companies might find this difficult, thereby impairing the integrity of the data.

HEADLINE: Man Gets 10-to-20-Year Term for Raping Wife

 BODY:
Declaring that "there are too many places on this earth where wives are considered chattel," a judge sentenced a Washington Heights man to 10 to 20 years in prison yesterday for beating and raping his estranged wife.
Marital rape convictions are rare, often because women are too afraid to pursue charges or because of societal ambivalence toward their plight -- factors that Justice Franklin R. Weissberg of State Supreme Court in Manhattan alluded to before sentencing 37-year old Jose Santos. 
 "There are far too many places on this earth where the rape, assault and battering of a wife by her husband is considered acceptable, or at worst, a trivial offense," he said. "Unfortunately for this defendant, this state and this courtroom are not such places."
The victim, a 35-year old home-care attendant whose ankle was broken in the May 9 attack in her apartment, was not in court. In statements included in the probation report, she said she had suffered not only physical injuries but also mental trauma because Mr. Santos had invaded the "sanctity" of their marriage.
The woman had testified that Mr. Santos burst into her apartment, threatened her with a knife, choked her and knocked her down. As she fell, her ankle broke.
"Despite her terror and pain, he cold-bloodedly raped her," Justice Weissberg said. "He then kept her prisoner for almost three hours while she begged him to take her to the hospital for treatment."
A jury of seven men and five women deliberated only three and a half hours Dec. 4 before convicting Mr. Santos, an unemployed guitar teacher, who testified that his wife had attacked him with the knife and delayed going for treatment while she dressed and put on makeup.

HEADLINE: Israel and Syria Agree to Renew Peace Talks, Secluded in Maryland Under U.S. Auspices

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
Meeting under United States auspices, Israel and Syria will renew their efforts to negotiate a peace agreement in the seclusion of a rural resort in eastern Maryland next week, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today.
The intensive new phase of negotiations, which the two countries agreed to undertake when Mr. Christopher visited the Middle East last weekend, will start next Wednesday at the Wye Plantation on Maryland's Eastern shore, a conference center an hour's drive from Washington. 
 After three days, the negotiators will adjourn over the New Year's holiday and resume again in early January for three more days, allowing the Israeli and Syrian delegations a week's time to return to their respective capitals for consultations. Secretary Christopher will later go back to the Middle East on Jan. 10 for further talks.
"I believe that the environment, the location will make it possible to intensify the talks and create an opportunity for more progress than we've made up to this point," Mr. Christopher told reporters.
The Maryland negotiations invite comparison with the format that the Administration used last month in Dayton, Ohio, in talks that led to the peace agreement on Bosnia. But in Dayton, the heads of state of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia came to work out a peace agreement, but left it to American negotiators to shuttle among them thrashing out the details. At the Wye Plantation, lower-level Syrian and Israeli negotiators will meet face-to-face, but are not expected to achieve an immediate breakthrough.
The talks will be closed to the press, as they were at Dayton.
Mr. Christopher provided details of the talks during a year-end news conference at which he enumerated the Clinton Administration's foreign policy successes this year and spoke of its goals for 1996.
These included persuading the Syrians and Israelis to sit down once more to revive a mutually suspicious dialogue that was suspended six months ago because of continuing disagreement about Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel wrested from Syria during the 1967 war and has since annexed.
Israel, which made peace with Egypt in 1979, has reached more recent peace accords with Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization. But Syria, the most intransigent neighbor, has long made any peace conditional on Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a windswept, barren mountain plateau that dominates both northern Israel and southern Syria and provides an important source of water. Syria also exerts hegemony over Lebanon, where Islamic militiamen are left to pursue a mostly ineffectual guerrilla struggle against Israel.
"The circle of peace will not be complete until Israel has peace with Syria and Lebanon," Mr. Christopher said.
In announcing the talks in Jerusalem last Saturday, the Secretary of State said President Hafez al-Assad of Syria and Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel both wanted to make rapid progress toward a peace treaty. But then, as today, Mr. Christopher would not predict when such a treaty might be concluded.
The first formal peace negotiations between Syria and Israel opened in Madrid in 1991, and promptly foundered. Two subsequent attempts over the last year to reopen the talks also failed. But Mr. Assad has shown greater seriousness about reaching an agreement with Mr. Peres, who came to power last month after the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
But the issue of the Golan Heights continues to appear intractable. Israel has said the "depth" of its withdrawal is contingent on the depth of peace agreed to by Syria, including trade and tourism ties. As a condition of normal relations, Syria insists on the return of the entire heights, including strategic terrain occupied by Israeli surveillance stations.
Mr. Christopher counted among the Clinton Administration's other foreign policy successes the brokering of the peace agreement on Bosnia, the restoration of democracy in Haiti, the unconditional extension of an international treaty preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and the stabilization of the Mexican economy after the peso's collapse a year ago.
He said the Administration could continue pursuing its policy of engagement with China, even though its record on human rights, which included a recent prison sentence for that country's most prominent dissident, Wei Jingsheng, was "not satisfactory to us."
Mr. Christopher played down the resurgence of the Communist Party in Russia's parliamentary elections, saying the results proved that "democracy has taken strong root in Russia." But he expressed the hope that the parties favoring economic reform would unite behind a common candidate for the Russian presidential elections next June.
He also said the Administration that took "a very important step" in freezing North Korea's nuclear program, and that it was "constantly vigilant" about the latest reports of North Korean troop activity.
At a separate news conference, Defense Secretary William J. Perry said that the North Korean military has increased the pace of its regular winter training exercises this year, but that reinforcement of American troops in South Korea was not necessary at this time.
"It's always been on our watch list," Mr. Perry said of North Korea, which has two-thirds of its million-member army within 60 miles of Seoul. "Perhaps it's a little higher now than six months ago. But not high enough to call for extra military deployments."

HEADLINE: New Mexico's Indian Tribes Vow to Defy Move to Close Casinos

BYLINE: By GEORGE JOHNSON 

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M., Dec. 15

 BODY:
Since July, when the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled that the state's Indian-run casinos were operating in defiance of the law, United States Attorney John J. Kelly has been under pressure from legislators and gambling opponents to close the lucrative operations. The Indian tribes, insisting that they have the power of sovereign nations, have refused to stop voluntarily, since gambling has become their economic lifeblood.
So on Thursday, Mr. Kelly announced an ultimatum: By Jan. 15, the 10 tribes operating casinos must shut down or face legal action. 
 Tribal leaders said they were shocked by the edict and would do everything they could to oppose it. They say pacts that they signed with Gov. Gary E. Johnson, and that were approved by the Federal Department of the Interior, give them the right to run the casinos.
The issue, as they see it, is just whose law they are beholden to. The dispute is over how much leverage tribal sovereignty gives the Indian leaders when they come into confrontation with the Federal Government and state governments.
"We're not going to let anyone come onto our reservation and shut us down," said Randy L. Jiron, First Lieutenant Governor of Isleta Pueblo, south of Albuquerque. "If it comes to going to jail or prison or dying on the line, we have to make a stand. Otherwise, we might as well kiss sovereignty goodbye."
Mr. Jiron said gambling revenue was crucial to pay for projects like a proposed $4.8 million building for the pueblo's young people. The casino employs about 600 people, he said, most of them non-Indians.
Mr. Kelly is allowing the casinos to stay open through the holidays, and has said he will not bring law-enforcement officers onto the reservations to enforce the edict. Instead, he said, the Government will begin legal proceedings to force disobedient tribes to forfeit their gambling equipment. He has not said what he will do if they refuse to comply.
In a letter to the tribes on Wednesday, Mr. Kelly raised the possibility that the Legislature would amend the gambling laws soon after its 1996 session opens on Jan. 16, so the shutdown might last only a few days.
In the 10 months since Governor Johnson, a Republican, signed gambling pacts with the tribes, keeping a promise he made in his 1994 campaign, the corridor along the Rio Grande has shown signs of becoming an elongated Las Vegas strip, with pueblos competing to see which one can build the glitziest casino.
The building boom has continued even though the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled in July that the pacts were illegal because the Governor did not consult with the Legislature. Last month the court went further, ruling that state law did not allow casino gambling.
Under the Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, tribes can negotiate agreements allowing them to offer any form of gambling permitted elsewhere in the state. Since New Mexico has historically allowed charity casino nights along with raffles and bingo games, Mr. Johnson and the tribes used this as justification to allow full-blown, Las Vegas-style casinos on the reservations.
Mr. Kelly has given the tribes until next Friday to respond to his letter. Meanwhile, the tribes and their lawyers are wondering why they were allowed to go for so long, investing millions of dollars in new casinos, and why the United States Attorney could not have waited another month, when the Legislature would again be in session.
"It's senseless," said Mr. Jiron of Isleta Pueblo. "They let us go all this time and gave us all this rein, and all of a sudden they're trying to stop us."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: The Risks of Cutting Too Far;
Toyota Learns Customers' Limits With the Corolla

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
The Toyota Corolla has been Japan's best-selling car for 26 years. So when Toyota introduced a fully remodeled and lower-priced version of the car in May, it expected a big lift in sales.
But sales have been disappointing and Tsutomu Kusaka, a Toyota dealer in Yokohama, thinks he knows why. The new Corolla not only is cheaper than the old one, it also "looks cheaper," he said. Instead of painting the bumpers, Toyota left them black. And "the interior has become much poorer," he said. Toyota heard the complaints and five months after introducing the car, the Corolla was reborn with power windows and locks and nicer seats. 
 The tale of the new Corolla has raised a warning flag for Japan's automobile industry. Faced with a prolonged economic slump at home and a strong yen making it more expensive to export, Japan's car manufacturers are racing to cut costs and lower prices to make their products more competitive.
But as the fate of the Corolla shows, cutting costs too much -- or too obviously -- can backfire, turning consumers off. Indeed, there is a danger that if Japanese companies handle cost-cutting poorly, they could jeopardize their hard-won reputation for superior quality and customer satisfaction.
"That is like walking on the tightrope," Louis R. Hughes, executive vice president of the General Motors Corporation, said during the Tokyo Motor Show in October. "It's a very fine balance."
The Nissan Motor Company had the same problem as Toyota when it introduced its remodeled subcompact, the Sunny, in 1994 minus some features that had been available in the previous model.
(The equivalent American models have not been greatly affected by the scaling back in Japan. The American Corolla, manufactured in the United States and Canada, is somewhat different from its Japanese counterpart and is not due for a remodeling until 1997. And Nissan's American division left the equipment on the cars it sells as Sentras virtually intact.)
So far, experts agree that cost-cutting by Japanese companies has not led to any visible deterioration in the fundamental quality of the cars, as measured by the number of defects or the frequency of breakdowns.
"The Japanese won't take the risk of hurting their quality image," said Chris W. Cedergren, senior vice president of Autopacific Inc., a consulting company in Santa Ana, Calif. "That's going to have a much more debilitating effect on their business than higher prices."
Rather, the problems of the Corolla and the Nissan Sunny came from the removal of standard features and luxury appointments, including power windows, vanity mirrors, elegant upholstery and the like. In industry jargon, this is called de-contenting, or taking the content out of the car.
Removing standard features is the simplest way to cut costs and prices but is not very effective in the long run. More savings can be gained by designing the car to be less expensive to manufacture, by speeding up development time or by improving assembly line efficiency.
"What we're trying to do is take cost out where the customer doesn't see it," Henry D. G. Wallace, executive vice president of the Mazda Motor Company, said of the cost-cutting efforts his company is making on all of its cars.
Analysts say the new Honda Civic, introduced in September, shows how costs can be cut without hurting customer perceptions of quality or luxury. In Japan, the new Civic is about 5 percent less expensive than the old one. In the United States, because of the effects of the strong yen, the price of the new Civic is about 1.5 percent higher than the old one.
Honda did eliminate some frills. It replaced the rear disk brakes with cheaper and less technically advanced drum brakes. And, it used fewer threads in the fabric on the back seat.
But Honda got much of its savings by lowering development costs and using more American materials. It also designed the new Civic with an improved, quieter engine and more interior space, so critics said that over all the new model was better than the old one.
Toyota is normally a master of this kind of hidden cost-cutting. In its 1994 annual report, it boasted how it had trimmed overall costs by $1.5 billion in a single year. It used more common parts and fewer model variations, and reduced excessively complicated automation in its factories.
Both Japanese and American executives agree that Japanese cars have been built with excessive quality and luxury. Places would be painted that no one could see. Some of the fabrics used even on economy cars "were so high cost we would shake our heads," said one American auto executive who asked not to be identified.
But the changes on the Corolla were apparently too visible. Since the model change, sales of the Corolla sedan and coupe together have been averaging about 15,000 a month, below Toyota's target of 17,500. The shortfall has contributed to a decline in Toyota's market share in Japan this year to below 40 percent, from about 42 percent in the past couple of years.
This is the second slip-up for Toyota with what is supposed to be its "people's car." The previous Corolla, introduced in 1991, turned out to be too luxurious and expensive for people's tastes.
That Corolla had been designed during the "bubble economy" of the late 1980's when soaring land and stock prices made people feel extravagant. But the bubble burst just as the new Corolla reached the market.
So in designing the new Corolla, Toyota hoped to adapt to a new consumer frugality. The base price was reduced to under 1 million yen, or $10,000, a decline of about $1,000 from the older model.
Still, it appears that once consumers get used to things, even excessive quality or features, they notice when they are taken away.
"The interior design ranked down a bit," said Norio Shibata, a 58-year-old engineer who bought a Corolla in 1992 but decided on a Nissan Sunny this August. "The material they used for the inside of the door looked obviously plastic." However, Mr. Shibata said it was mainly a matter of engine horsepower that made him switch to a Nissan.
Bob Sliwa, a Japan-based automobile writer, said the doors of the new Corolla rattle when they are shut. And while Toyota put in a simplified engine that gets better mileage, "simplifying the engine makes it less smooth," he said.
Other features of the older Corolla are also missing. In one model, the AM-FM stereo radio was replaced by an AM monoaural radio. In another model, the self-adjusting air-conditioner was replaced by a manually controlled model. Instead of full fabric seats, some versions of the new Corolla had seats made partly of vinyl.
Akihiro Wada, executive vice president of Toyota, said the sales problem of the Corolla was not from cost-cutting per se. "It was a mis-design, to tell you the truth," he said, indicating the new design was simply not pleasing to customers. He added that other Toyota models, the luxury Crown for example, were selling well despite similar cost cuts.
He and other Toyota executives said the new Corolla offered better mileage and a roomier interior than the old one. Much of the cost reduction in the Corolla, they argue, came from reducing the number of parts by about 25 percent, not from removing content.
Another factor in the disappointing sales, company executives said, is that Japanese consumers are turning away from sedans like the Corolla toward mini-vans and sport-utility vehicles.
Still, in October, only five months after introducing the new Corolla, Toyota added some standard features. These included a driver-side air bag, full-fabric seats, power windows and automatic door locks. The base price of the car was raised 49,000 yen, or about $490, to 1.04 million yen, or $10,400. It is still too early to tell whether the changes will make a difference.
Nissan had a similar problem with its Sunny. "We made a mistake in the Sunny," said Tadao Takei, executive vice president of Nissan.
The new Sunny was introduced in Japan in January 1994. It, too, had a manual air-conditioner instead of a self-adjusting one and manual windows. The rear of the car had a rounded look that, it turned out, did not appeal to consumers.
Sales quickly fell more than 20 percent below the levels of a year earlier. By May 1994, Nissan restored the power windows and self-adjusting air-conditioner as standard features, without raising the price.
This September, somewhat early for a midterm face lift, Nissan rushed out a new Sunny with a square rear for a "grander, more orthodox look," according to Nissan's news release.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
U.S. Bonds Fall on Snag Over Budget

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Treasury prices gave up their early gains yesterday, as the bond market was weakened by a poorly received Treasury auction and yet another setback in Washington budget talks.
By the end of the day, the price of the Treasury's 30-year bond dropped 9/32 of a percentage point; its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, edged up to 6.12 percent, from 6.11 percent on Tuesday. 
 The 30-year bond initially posted moderate gains as investor enthusiasm lingered from Tuesday's market rally that was set off by the surprise interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
But prices retreated in the afternoon. Adding pressure to prices was a drive by brokers to sell securities and thus push down their prices ahead of the Government's afternoon auction of two-year notes. The hope was to draw more investors to the auction by wooing them with cheaper prices.
But even at the lower prices, the auction failed to attract a big turnout. The Government sold $18.25 billion in two-year notes at a yield of 5.29 percent. That was more than market expectations of about 5.26 percent, suggesting that weak demand gave investors leeway to demand higher rates.
Demonstrating the poor turnout, the bid-to-cover ratio, which compares the number of bids submitted with those accepted, was 2.18 to 1, weaker than the average of recent two-year note sales.
The soft auction results helped drive down prices in the broader secondary market, where newly auctioned securities are traded.
Elsewhere in the market, prices of short-term Treasury securities fell 4/32 of a point, and intermediate maturities ranged from 3/32 to 5/32 of a point lower.
Analysts said market prices also were hurt by news of a collapse in Washington budget talks as a meeting between President Clinton and top Republican leaders was scuttled.
Republicans and White House officials had Mr. Clinton would meet again with the House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, and and the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, to discuss terms for ending the partial Government shutdown.
But the President strongly rejected a Republican demand to keep the Government partly closed until a balanced-budget agreement is reached.
"The headlines coming out of Washington that budget talks are not going anywhere gave a good excuse to sell prior to the auction," said Kathleen Stephansen, senior economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "But it turns out the auction didn't go well."
Investors and traders in fixed-income securities fear that the breakdown in negotiations endangers chances for a balanced-budget agreement. Prospects for such a deal have helped fuel a powerful market rally in recent months.

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook;
Homesick for Communisim

BYLINE: By PHILIP TAUBMAN 

 BODY:
Many Russians, to rephrase Winston Churchill, apparently believe that Communism is the worst form of government except for all the other forms.
That seems astonishing, especially to an American who lived in Moscow in the last years of the Soviet Union. After enduring all those endless lines in the Arctic winter to buy a stunted head of cabbage, after quietly suffering all the grandiloquent nonsense about Lenin's ideals and studying Marxism-Leninism until the mind went numb, after watching your country sink into an economic and political stupor, how could someone vote for the Communist Party? 
 Millions of Russians did in Sunday's parliamentary election, raising the Communist Party from the dead and making it the most powerful political organization in Russia. The resurrection is disturbing, yet at the same time intriguing.
In one sense, the vote seems to be the political version of the Stockholm syndrome, the phenomenon common in hostage cases when terrorized victims begin to identify with their captors. Russia is still recovering from more than seven decades of Soviet tyranny, and many Russians apparently still identify more closely with the dictators who controlled their lives than with the democrats who freed them.
But something else seems to be at work. Many Russians, particularly the elderly and those still living in rural areas, appear genuinely nostalgic for the security blanket that came with Communism. For all the terrible pain it inflicted, and the millions of lives it destroyed, Soviet Communism provided a crude safety net that gave citizens the illusion that the Communist Party was looking after their interests. The development of a free market has ripped away the net.
The Communist system was suffocating, patronizing and calculated to keep the country obedient. Some Russians recognized it as a narcotic, and fought to overcome it. The internal security forces were always there to silence them. Most Russians chose not to take that risk, or ceased to care what the purpose of the system was as long as bread was cheap, jobs were plentiful, education was universal, health care was free and vacations were subsidized. The bread was excellent, but many people now seem to have forgotten that lots of the jobs were pointless, education was politically contaminated, health care was atrocious and Soviet vacations were Spartan.
The whole enterprise was ideologically dressed up as a workers' paradise. Though some Russians were true believers, most were smart enough to see through the pseudo-science. But the system still enveloped them.
Now that people have had a taste of unemployment, inflation, crime and other problems that have come with democracy, it is shrewd politics for the new Communists to suggest that the old days were actually pretty good. The party, at least for now, has distanced itself from the most brazen practices of the past, including one-party politics, censorship and repression of dissent.
The reporting and the polling data from Russia show the Communists gained from discontent about an uneven economy and upheaval in Russian life. Voters in Moscow, St. Petersburg and some other urban centers -- where the benefits of reform have materialized most quickly -- voted for reform candidates. Nearly everywhere else, Communists and nationalists did well, singing from essentially the same page of promises about restoring order and economic stability, shorthand for the Communist safety net.
Reform in Russia is far from dead, but it has run into a formidable obstacle -- the past. To prevail in the months and years ahead, the reformers will have to convince millions of their countrymen that the uncertainty of freedom is preferable to the security of Communism, as deadening as it was.

HEADLINE: Make a Budget Deal Now

 BODY:
As budget talks floundered in Washington yesterday, President Clinton angrily blamed the band of fire-breathing conservative Republican freshmen in the House for preventing Speaker Newt Gingrich from negotiating seriously. The President was not wrong in his assessment, but he was not wholly right either. The negotiations are at an impasse at least as much because Mr. Clinton has not shown his own hand on where he wants the budget to go. With a substantial part of the Government still shut down in the week before Christmas, both sides need to take the process more seriously and make concessions to get things going.
The budget talks come at an extremely fluid time on both sides of the aisle. On the Republican side, the first signs of disagreement are emerging between Speaker Gingrich and Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader. After the first budget shutdown of a few weeks ago, Mr. Dole was not the only one to recognize that it was the Republicans, not Mr. Clinton, who got the public's blame for intransigence. He has made it clear that he did not agree with keeping the Government shuttered in this second round. The President slyly went out of his way yesterday to drive a wedge into the G.O.P. camp by praising Mr. Dole for making a good-faith effort to negotiate, as opposed to Mr. Gingrich. 
 But on the Democratic side, the divisions are even deeper. Many liberal Democrats were dismayed when Mr. Clinton boxed himself in last month by promising to balance the budget according to Congressional scorekeeping. They feared that in order to get a deal, he would scrap key parts of his agenda, including programs that protect poor children. But if Mr. Clinton refuses to move toward the Republicans, he risks losing the support of dozens of moderate and conservative Democrats. Among these is a group of lawmakers calling themselves the Blue Dogs, a parody of the old term "yellow dog Democrats," whose party loyalty was so great that they would vote for a yellow dog over a Republican. Right now it is the conservative and moderate Democrats and some moderate Republicans in the House and Senate who are waiting for Mr. Clinton to sit at the table and deal.
In face-to-face negotiations with Republican leaders, Mr. Clinton has been stalling. He effectively reneged on his promise to show how he would balance a budget in seven years, using the more conservative economic assumptions of the Congressional Budget Office. In fact, his plan fell at least $300 billion short. Tactically, it may have been shrewd of him to hold back. The public opinion polls show that the White House has captured the high ground politically, with growing numbers of Americans viewing the President as resolute in protecting programs that help children, the poor and the elderly. But now Mr. Clinton should move. He should seize on some of the ideas of the centrists and try to forge a unified Democratic position that modifies the White House's original proposals.
Specifically, Mr. Clinton should continue to demand that the Republicans modify their cuts, preserving federally guaranteed Medicaid, food stamps and nutrition programs. In exchange he should radically scale back, if not drop, his proposed middle-class tax cut. The blue dogs favor no tax cut at all until the budget is balanced, a position that might give the President some cover if he moves toward it. Mr. Clinton would also move the talks along by signaling a willingness to raise the heavily subsidized premiums that the elderly pay for Medicare. Republican leaders have gone first on this proposal, and it has won some support among the moderate Democrats.
The deal that could emerge from this process is probably not one that liberals would swallow. Nor is it one that the cadre of true believers breathing down Mr. Gingrich's neck would accept. But with the right mix of concessions and demands, Mr. Clinton might be able to break the current impasse, get a better deal than he could get from endless delays and preserve a broad set of principles on which he can run for re-election.

HEADLINE: Take This Job. Please.

BYLINE: By Warren B. Rudman; Warren B. Rudman, a New Hampshire Republican, is the author of the forthcoming "Combat: 12 Years in the United States Senate."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The voluntary retirement of 12 senators at the end of this term, including the exceptionally able Sam Nunn of Georgia, Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas, Alan Simpson of Wyoming and David Pryor of Arkansas, has caused speculation and distress.
These are people at the top of their game -- people who were likely to be re-elected. How could they walk away from the power and prestige of a Senate seat? Consider a typical day for a typical senator, based on my experience and that of colleagues. 
 6 A.M. You head to Capitol Hill for breakfast with constituents. You find they have been shocked by an editorial that morning in the largest paper in your state. It accuses you of driving the children of America into the arms of atheism. Why? Because your view of the Constitution obliged you to vote against a bill to require prayer in the public schools.
8 A.M. You discuss the day's agenda with the staff. An aide brings in hundreds of letters that arrived yesterday. You read as many as time permits, then dictate the message you want conveyed to constituents' various concerns.
9 A.M. You have three committee hearings going on simultaneously, and you attend parts of all three, knowing you are spread too thin. Your press secretary slips you a note: 20 reporters have called about your criticism of the President last night. You return some of the calls between hearings.
12 P.M. Your state party chairman calls to say that a handsome golf pro who recently married a very rich woman has decided he wants to be a senator. You think you can defeat him, but will have to raise $10 million in the next two years, instead of $5 million for a normal race.
12:15 P.M. You take prominent businessmen from your state to lunch in the Senate dining room. They agree on the urgency of a balanced budget -- of course, only if it does not mean higher taxes or reduced benefits for them. You pick up the tab.
1 P.M. to 6 P.M. Bells start calling you to votes on the Senate floor. They ring all afternoon. Many are on amendments relating to abortion, flag-burning, pornography and school prayer. None will pass, but their sponsors are eager to make statements for the papers back home. New senators, the ones obsessed with protecting the flag, don't seem equally concerned about protecting the economy. The number of votes, in committee and on the floor, has nearly doubled since 1980, when I entered the Senate.
You go to your party's campaign office (on the Hill) and get a list of people to ask for money. You have to call from there: it's illegal to call from your office. You hate asking strangers for money, but you have the golf pro to worry about.
6 P.M. You attend fund-raisers for two colleagues. Several people call you Gramm because you co-sponsored the Gramm-Rudman Balanced Budget Act. One fellow says, "Gramm, are you really in favor of atheism?" You choke down peanuts and two small sausages for dinner.
8 P.M. You are back on the Senate floor for debate on major budget amendments. The mood is angry, people are bitter, ideologues on both sides reject compromise. Some people won't speak to each other.
1 A.M. The majority leader gives up and adjourns. Late nights have become the rule. You wonder if you'll be able to leave the next afternoon to spend the weekend in your home state. It will be filled with meetings with constituents, fund-raising, town meetings and press conferences.
1:30 A.M. You're home. The family is sleeping. You ask yourself, "Who needs this?"
I have long opposed term limits. For one thing, life in the Senate will increasingly result in self-imposed term limits. When you look at life there, the rush for the exits isn't surprising. I left in 1992. I am 65 years old. I felt 75 in the Senate. I feel 35 now.

Dollar Weakens After Clinton Cancels Meeting on the Budget

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar weakened against most leading currencies yesterday after budget negotiations between President Clinton and Congressional Republicans crumbled late in the day.
Efforts to rejuvenate the budget talks fell through when the White House dropped plans for the second meeting in two days of President Clinton and top House and Senate G.O.P. leaders. Optimism had risen following Tuesday's meeting that the two sides would resolve the impasse. 
 Stock and bond prices, which had been higher earlier yesterday, turned tail and sank after the talks collapsed. The dollar followed as investors looked to other currencies for more lucrative investments.
"That tipped the dollar down a little bit toward the end of the day, but it wasn't a massive selloff, just a little bit of a drift-off," said David Glowacki, senior trader at the NBD Bank in Detroit.
Trading was light, exaggerating moves in the dollar. "We're really in the holiday trading mode," Mr. Glowacki said.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.4400 German marks, down from 1.4410 marks late Tuesday. The dollar also slipped to 101.90 yen, down from 101.96. The British pound was quoted at $1.5360, down from $1.5415 on Tuesday.
The Mexican peso gained sharply against the dollar as traders continued to react to the Federal Reserve Board's decision on Tuesday to cut a key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point.
The cut improved the peso as an investment vehicle vs. the dollar, pushing the dollar to 7.52 pesos vs. 7.63 on Tuesday. The interest rate decline did not affect the dollar significantly against European currencies because central banks there have also cut interest rates recently.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday, were: 1.1545 Swiss francs, down from 1.1565; 4.9415 French francs, down from 4.9555; 1,594 Italian lire, down from 1,595, and 1.3669 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3754.

HEADLINE: THE POP LIFE;
Michael Jackson's Sound of Silence

BYLINE: By NEIL STRAUSS 

 BODY:
The latest chapter in the Michael Jackson tale ended last week when doctors advised him to take the rest of the year off after his collapse during a rehearsal at the Beacon Theater on Dec. 6 for an HBO concert special. (Mr. Jackson, 37, was taken to Beth Israel Medical Center North and found to have a gastrointestinal ailment; he is recuperating at EuroDisney.) This is a medical-related withdrawal reminiscent of the one that caused him to cut short his last tour, in 1993, to seek treatment for an addiction to prescription painkillers. Both times there was widespread speculation on the truth about Mr. Jackson's medical problems. Their seriousness aside, these ailments have resulted in Mr. Jackson's retreat from singing into silence.
On Dec. 4, two days before he collapsed, Mr. Jackson tried to promote the HBO special with a news conference at the Beacon. The many members of the news media in attendance begged him for a comment. Their attempts ranged from the cold-hearted ("Are you still married?" one person yelled out) to the harmless ("Say hello!" shouted another). All questions received the same response: silence. 
 Instead of speaking, Mr. Jackson brought out the special guest who was to join him during the concert. His guest was not a musician but a mime, Marcel Marceau. The two clowned around together onstage, with Mr. Jackson imitating the old mime routine of being trapped in an invisible box, an apt metaphor for his life off the stage.
This pairing was a perfect one, because Mr. Jackson seems to be transforming himself into a mime. He likes to whiten his face, as mimes do. (After Mr. Jackson's collapse, a medical technician said there was so much makeup on his face that medics had to lift his shirt to check his complexion.) But more significant, the axis of Mr. Jackson's career has been turning away from his singing and toward his body.
As the lead singer of the Jackson 5 in the 1960's and 70's, it was his astonishing young voice that commanded attention; in the 80's, he shifted the spotlight to his feet and his style with the moonwalk, the choreography of "Thriller" and other video spectacles. In the 1990's, the focus has been on other anatomical parts as talk of plastic surgery and allegations of child molestation have hounded him.
Mr. Jackson's reaction to the news media circus around him has been one of silence, of retreating deeper into Neverland, as he calls his California ranch. Two summers ago, he answered those who doubted his heterosexuality by marrying Lisa Marie Presley. Last year, he responded to those who still doubted his heterosexuality by kissing his wife on the MTV Music Awards. These are the noiseless moves of a mime.
On the few occasions when Mr. Jackson did break his silence, it was to ask for quiet. The two interviews he granted in the last year were to extinguish scandal, not to talk about his music. And most of the new songs on "HIStory" are pleas for silence, directed at the news media ("Scream" and "Tabloid Junkie") and at those who would destroy the world ("Earth Song" and "Money"). The album closes with a tribute to a fellow mime, "Smile," with music composed by Charlie Chaplin for his film "Modern Times."
Unlike Mr. Chaplin and Mr. Marceau, Mr. Jackson's pantomime never ends; he can no longer remove his painted face. If it is a mime's silence that Mr. Jackson seeks, it is so he can experience the childhood freedom and irresponsibility that a lifetime in the public eye has never allowed. "Michael has the soul of a mime," Mr. Marceau said in an interview after their news conference.
The soul of a mime is a complex one, part child and part artist, part clown and part tragic figure. "I've seen Michael on TV for years, and I think that he is a poet," Mr. Marceau said. "But now he is in the tradition of French poets like Verlaine and Rimbaud because his subject is the lost childhood."

 
 
A Romantic, Darkly
 When asked whether he thinks any of his European solo albums will be released on an American label, Scott Walker just laughs and says "no chance." He's being a little pessimistic, and that is in line with his reputation as a dark and morbid romantic.
Mr. Walker, 51, was born in Ohio, and moved to England in the mid-1960's to seek glory with his beautiful baritone in the Walker Brothers, a band that achieved superstar status there with hits like "The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine (Anymore)." But the pop machine soon wore Mr. Walker down. A singing idol on the surface, he longed for privacy and to be taken seriously as a songwriter. In the solo albums he has released since the group broke up in 1968, he has slowly turned from crooning pop to brooding French chansons to minimal art songs, growing more morbid, cerebral and intense with each new record and influencing such musicians as David Bowie, Elvis Costello and Julian Cope.
"You use whatever comes up," Mr. Walker said of his dark side, speaking by telephone from London. "And that side flows for me more than another side does. Unlike other artists, I don't have a constant dark side, and I don't think I had it when I lived in America. You don't have time to develop it much in America, unless you experience something really extreme, because the speed of life there is just too fast."
In England, life moves a little slower for Mr. Walker. This year, he released his first album in 11 years, "Tilt" (Fontana/Mercury U.K.), with sparse, orchestrated pieces sung in the upper register of Mr. Walker's voice. Its lyrics are slippery and complex, ranging from quotes from the trial of Adolf Eichmann to a soliloquy to the corpse of Che Guevara. Mr. Walker demands a lot of his listeners. "I had to work at the lyrics, so they should too," he said.
"In the studio I was trying to find things that weren't related to anything anyone had heard before," he said of the music. "I picked a group of musicians very carefully so that we could make a song that related to the lyrics. We worked as economically as possible, using no frilly or superfluous sounds. I let the words create each track for me."
Mr. Walker let a decade elapse before recording "Tilt" because he could not find a record company that would agree to release his music without making him submit a demo tape. Mr. Walker says he believes that the first time he sings a song is the truest and most representative version.
"I have a terror of singing," he said. "That's one of the reasons I don't perform. I want to do my vocals as quickly as possible, because that's going to be the one that's closest to the vocals in my dreams. If I get it wrong when I try it, it drives me insane. I even had an arrangement with the studio so that I could call up on the day I felt like singing it and go in."
"I don't even own any of my own records, and I would never listen to them," he continued. "They would drive me crazy. They drive other people crazy, but not for the same reason."

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW;
The Joys of the Flat Tax, Excluding the Equations

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
About halfway through tomorrow night's "Firing Line" debate on a flat tax, Jerry Brown says, "What we have here is a real muddy discussion."
That's not exactly the problem, since the two-hour give-and-get does clarify the motives of both proponents and opponents, but the encounter is disjointed and at times perplexing. 
 "It is absolutely true," says a proponent. "It is factually untrue," counters an opponent. "I think that's factually wrong," says an opponent. "It's factually correct," responds a proponent. "I did my math right," says a proponent. "You didn't do your math right," says an opponent. At one point in a discussion of interest income, one of the experts says, "Oh, excuse me, I think I got it backward." Viewers may find themselves calling their accountants.
The presence of Mr. Brown among those who favor the evening's proposition, "Resolved: The flat tax is better than the income tax," complicates matters. His three presumed allies -- William F. Buckley Jr., our host; Pete Du Pont, a former Governor of Delaware, and Dr. John Goodman, president of the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative think tank -- extol a bill being offered by Richard K. Armey, the House majority leader.
Mr. Goodman displays a blown-up postcard to show how simple the tax return would be without the mountain of I.R.S. provisions that only lawyers and accountants can climb. Even more appealing to the yeasayers is the prospect that by charging the same rate on all levels of income and easing the bite on the well-to-do, a flatter tax would encourage individual enterprise and national growth.
For his part, Mr. Brown is not wild about the Armey bill, which would spare recipients the reporting of income from dividends, interest and capital gains on the ground that corporations have already paid taxes on them. Showing less hair than when he was Governor of California and having exchanged tie and coat for a populist denim shirt over a black T-shirt, Mr. Brown favors the idea of a flat tax because, he maintains, it would do away with the fat-cat lobbying of a contribution-hungry Congress. For him, anything would be better than the present "banquet feast of corruption."
Opposing Mr. Brown but joining him in the principle that the well-to-do ought to pay a bigger percentage of their income than the less fortunate or enterprising are Lester Thurow, a professor of economics at M.I.T.; George McGovern, who ran for President when the country was still young; Dr. Steven C. Mann, a professor at Texas Christian University, where the debate is held, and Robert Kuttner, a prolific writer on economic matters. "The more you get out, the more you ought to pay," says Professor Thurow. The antis predict that if dividends and interest are exempted, corporation biggies will promptly begin taking their salaries in stocks and bonds.
However, their defense of progressivity has its limits; with varying degrees of enthusiasm, they would retain deductions for health, mortgage payments and charitable contributions, which also favor the well-to-do and which friends of the flat tax would abolish. But the progressives would put a cap on the deductions so that the very, very rich wouldn't get away with too much.
Mr. Buckley scorns such hedging and celebrates the joys of unprogressive taxation, which would treat all Americans, rich and poor, equally. In a giddy flight, he acclaims Picasso, that un-American Communist, as an exemplar of talent that should be unconstrained.
I cannot promise that these two hours will enable you to decide whether a flat tax would be boon or boondoggle or just not worth worrying about, but credit "Firing Line" for even taking on so unsexy a subject. And keep in mind, for the moment you are still entitled to a tax deduction for contributions to public broadcasting.

HEADLINE: AT HOME WITH: Dr. Ruth Westheimer;
The Bible as Sex Manual?

BYLINE: By BOB MORRIS 

 BODY:
MENORAHS always make Ruth Westheimer a little sad.
Hanukkah of 1938 was the last Jewish holiday she spent with her Orthodox family in Frankfurt before she was sent off at age 10 to the safety of a Swiss orphanage. Her parents and all her relatives died in concentration camps. 
 Last Sunday, Dr. Westheimer, known, of course, as Dr. Ruth, the outspoken sexologist, was sitting in the cluttered three-bedroom apartment in Washington Heights where she raised her two children and became famous, in that order. The sky was going pink over the Hudson River. A Steuben glass menorah was on the table. Hanukkah would be starting in an hour.
"Yes, for me Hanukkah is very sad," she said. "But the life force that's in me makes it a wonderful holiday, too."
Along with the clutter in her very lived-in living room, menorahs and other Jewish objects were everywhere.
"I believe my soul isn't entirely German," she said, serving some brownies she didn't make (she doesn't cook -- later she would order in Chinese food for dinner), "because my home is so disorderly. All my German friends here keep very neat homes." Fortunately, her husband, Fred (Freddy to her), is also disorganized. "If one of us would be very neat, that would be very bad," she said. "And I like all this stuff. I like the doll houses friends give me. I like all my little tchotchkies and fancy stuff from Switzerland and China. It's nice to be Dr. Ruth and have nice things, even if my Chagall is just a $150 reproduction."
She poured coffee. Her shoes (size 4) clicked across the kitchenette. "Dr. Ruth could live on Park Avenue," she said, finally sitting down with a copy of "Heavenly Sex: Sexuality in the Jewish Tradition," her latest book.
"I come from Nazi Germany," she said. "And the one thing I've learned is that you must stand up for what you believe. That's why I wrote this book.
"I hope that Jews and non-Jews alike, anybody interested in family life and the idea of 'shalom bayit,' or 'peace in the home,' will want to read it."
"For years," she continued, "I wondered why I could talk about the things I talk about so openly. Now I know. For us Jews, sex was never a sin."
Dr. Westheimer, who commands hefty lecture fees, teaches at New York University, has 13 books in print (here and abroad), is the host of a series of Playboy instructional videos called "Making Love" and writes a column distributed by the King Features Syndicate.
She has not moved to Park Avenue, she explained, because her synagogues (she belongs to two) and Y.M.H.A. (she's been president for three years) are in the neighborhood, a still sizable community of German Jewish World War II refugees.
"Because of my experience with the Holocaust," she said, "I don't like to lose friends. And I think I have a pretty good life here. Look at the size of this!" She stopped at a big box containing a castle for her grandson.
"Yesterday, I ordered it from a small store on Madison Avenue and had it delivered," she said. "It's nice to call, and on the same day -- boom -- it comes! When my own kids were growing up, I couldn't afford this." Her son and daughter, both with doctorates in education like their mother, live in New York.
"I'm a very lucky mother," she said. "And it's not that I didn't shout enough either."
P EACE in the home, according to the tradition-oriented "Heavenly Sex" (written with Jonathan Mark and published by New York University Press), comes in large part from good sexual relations. "The great rabbi Simeon ben-Halafta called the penis the great peacemaker of the home," she writes in the book.
Not the sort of thing that sits well with everybody.
For instance, Rabbi Robert Hirt, the vice president of Yeshiva University's affiliated Orthodox theological seminary, who has not read the book, said: "The flaunting of intimate things in a public way takes away from their intimacy. Judaism has a tradition of tzniut, meaning modesty or appropriateness."
Dr. Westheimer (whose Upper East Side practice attracts some Orthodox and Hasidic clients) doesn't want the book to offend. "The very Orthodox won't read it," she said. "They don't read secular books. And there will be people who will tell their students not to touch this book because it's so explicit. It touches on issues of homosexuality, abortion and the Song of Songs as sexually arousing. But there are also many issues we did not touch."
Still, in less than 200 pages "Heavenly Sex" manages to find in the Torah, Talmud and other religious sources some very explicit passages to support the book's thesis that "God is the ultimate sex therapist" and that the Bible is the "wisest guide to sex ever written." Among other things, it cites the Book of Ruth as an encouragement for single women to initiate sex, providing the relationship leads to marriage.
And that's not all. She includes a Talmudic specification that an unemployed man must make love to his wife every day and the writings of a 12th-century rabbi who suggests couples use different positions while having sex.
"Judaism," the book contends, as it covers everything from Adam and Eve to Onan and a husband's responsibility for his wife's sexual pleasure, "is a tradition that appreciates the weakness of the heart."
Recently, Dr. Westheimer (who speaks every year to the graduating class at the Jewish Theological Seminary) was a guest on CNN, where she said that Prince Charles should have kept his mouth shut about his unhappiness with the Princess of Wales. "If they were Orthodox Jews, he could not have said publicly that he never cared for her," she said as she cleared the table. "And you know what else? He could have given her a divorce decree."
Dr. Westheimer does not shy away from divorce. After all, it took two before she hit gold with her present marriage, which has lasted 34 years. "He's an engineer and very quiet," she said. She and the German-born Mr. Westheimer met on a ski tow in the Catskills -- he was short enough to share it without knocking her off. "This household could not have two people in it like me," she added.
Suddenly, things got very noisy and nonsexual. "Ari!" she yelled to her 5-year-old grandson, who came in with her husband. In a flurry, the two of them lighted one menorah and packed another to take to her Reform synagogue for a community lighting ceremony.
"They're all German Jews there," Dr. Westheimer said. "They always start right on the dot." She and her husband, their grandson and Mr. Mark, her co-author of "Heavenly Sex" and an editor at Jewish Week magazine, made a commotion in the lobby as they greeted the doorman and an old friend in a housecoat who wanted to know which bulb to light on the lobby's menorah.
"Is it left or right?" she asked.
"Yes!" Dr. Westheimer said, bolting out into the cold night.
"Do you have the menorah?" Mr. Westheimer yelled.
"Yes, I've got it, Freddy," yelled his wife, who was already ahead of him on the sidewalk, clutching her grandson in one hand and a little Bloomingdale's bag in the other.
"It's a good thing we're both fast walkers," Mr. Westheimer muttered cheerfully as Dr. Westheimer, who wasn't even wearing an overcoat, raced some of the five blocks to the the Hebrew Tabernacle of Washington Heights, where she waved hello to some dignified elderly friends and marched straight to the front of the synagogue.
"There are so many kids here," Dr. Westheimer said, adding: "It's like a miracle to see all these grandchildren of Holocaust survivors! Hitler didn't intend for us to have any grandchildren."
When it came time for her to help her grandson light their menorah, her face glowed almost as brightly as the candle flames.
Later, she pointed to a stained-glass window she gave in memory of her family, and read aloud the Hebrew on it. "It means 'I don't want to die,' " she said. " 'I want to live.' "
After a riot of kisses, she was out the door, tearing up the street with her rambunctious grandson and pointing out menorahs in windows.
"Hold this," she said to her husband, pushing her shopping bag at him. "I have to run with him."
She did.

Authority Bond Rating Drops

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK

 BODY:
The day after the New Jersey Turnpike Authority announced a three-year cost-cutting plan to avert a toll increase through 1998, Moody's Investors Service yesterday downgraded the authority's bond rating a notch from A -- the third best -- to Baa1. 
 Moody's said the authority's plan lacked "immediate measures" to insure a balanced budget in the absence of a toll increase. It also chastised the authority for using nonrecurring revenue sources like surplus construction funds to pay operating costs. The downgrade could mean higher interest rates for the authority. Edward Gross, acting executive director of the authority, called the move "unjustified."

HEADLINE: Racism That Led to Harlem Tragedy Must Not Be Ignored;
Economics Isn't Excuse

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Attempts to downplay the evils of racism by citing economic factors and motives can be heard regarding the tragedy on 125th Street in Harlem, but also about every other horrific and genocidal course of racist conduct from the institution of slavery to the Holocaust. 
 "Economics" is still used as a justification for excluding blacks from white neighborhoods ("they'll bring our property values down"), and for anti-Asian bigotry ("they're taking all our jobs away").
Many people seem relieved when they hear that a particularly repulsive racist act can be explained away by pointing to economic factors. Why?
Racism is a moral evil, not a rational economic reaction. Racists are not "persons disabled by economic pressures" (to coin a politically correct term); they are evil people who do incredible harm to others.
At a time of economic stress and increasing racial tensions, we should not permit economic factors to mute our outrage at racist activity.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Still Drained By Snapple, Quaker Sees A Big Charge

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 21

 BODY:
Still bleeding from its acquisition last year of Snapple, the Quaker Oats Company warned Wall Street today that earnings in the quarter ending Dec. 31 would fall short of expectations. Quaker also announced plans for a $40 million pretax charge against earnings in the quarter, mostly to cover the cost of getting rid of overcapacity in Snapple's bottling operations.
Shareholders were apparently more disappointed than shocked. Quaker's shares slumped 75 cents, to $34.875, in trading on the Big Board. Analysts said a steeper decline had been prevented as the result of buying by investors who saw Quaker as a takeover candidate. 
 "For takeover players, bad news is good news," said John McMillin, who follows Quaker for Prudential Bache Securities.
Snapple, the tea and fruit-beverage company Quaker bought last December for $1.7 billion, is operating at a pace that suggests it will pile up losses of about $55 million in the quarter, the result of weak sales and the cost of junking inventories that do not have the new labels and packaging Snapple will introduce next year. The loss marks the end of a disastrous year in which Snapple lost $75 million as revenue fell more than 10 percent.
"The bottom line is that Snapple has not sold well in Peoria," Mr. McMillin said. "Although Quaker's strategy was to make it a national and then a global product, it remains an East Coast-West Coast yuppie brand."
Analysts said the problem with the takeover talk was that it was hard to see who would be interested in buying a food company as big as Quaker Oats. The most frequently mentioned possibilities have been Cadbury Schweppes and Nestle, but there have been no indications that either of those European-based companies is eager to make such a deal. At its current stock price, Quaker is valued at almost $4.7 billion.
Because of Snapple's rocky start, it will take Quaker years to recoup its investment, even if in the future Snapple grows as robustly as Quaker projected when it made the deal. After buying Snapple, Quaker spoke of the company's achieving "annual earnings growth of at least 10 percent after inflation."
Most of the $40 million restructuring charge will go toward freeing Quaker from production agreements that Snapple signed with bottlers before Quaker acquired it. Those contracts were signed in anticipation that Snapple would continue to grow rapidly.
About $10 million of the charge will go toward two problem regions for Quaker: Europe and the Pacific Rim. The company has invested heavily in Europe over the last decade with limited results, as it tried to make its Gatorade sports beverages a global brand. And in the Pacific region, Quaker is trying to build up its food businesses.
Quaker, which is based in Chicago, said that the restructuring would save $15 million annually in future years. It will lead to a reported loss for the current quarter as high as $60 million, rather than a profit just under $7 million, or 5 cents a share, as Wall Street had expected in earnings to be released in February.
Some analysts doubted that the restructuring and inventory charges represented a clearing of the decks that marked Snapple's low point. The moves were the first announced since William D. Smithburg, Quaker's chairman and chief executive, became more closely involved, after the departure in October of Philip Marineau, formerly the president and chief operating officer.
"I think it's just another piece of bad news coming on the installment plan," said David Rabinowitz, who follows the company for Smith Barney.
The changes announced will not overcome the distribution and marketing disadvantages Quaker faces in competing with Coca-Cola and Pepsico, Mr. Rabinowitz said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ebbs vs. Mark and Yen; Traders Await Budget Progress

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
As Washington continued to dither over the Federal budget yesterday, the dollar continued to waver in foreign-exchange markets before finishing lower against other leading currencies.
The dollar started the day stronger as hopes rose for a resumption of stalled negotiations between President Clinton and Congressional Republicans over a plan to balance the budget in seven years. 
 As the day wore on, and no firm strategy emerged to revive the talks, the currency weakened, finishing slightly lower against the German mark and the Japanese yen.
"People still expect a deal," said David Solin, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in New York. "I think there's no two ways around that, but the question is: When exactly is it going to get done? As time drags on and they continue to have difficulty even setting up meetings, some people get discouraged."
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.4377 marks, down from 1.4400 late Wednesday, and at 101.79 Japanese yen, down from 101.90.
Traders say the dollar would be likely to strengthen on news of a balanced-budget deal, because that would decrease the possibility of higher inflation. Indeed, even though the deal might lead to lower American interest rates -- something that tends to make dollar-denominated investments less attractive -- that would be more than offset by the prospect of scant inflation.
With governments in Europe lowering rates to stimulate their own sluggish economies, a further rate cut in the United States would be less likely to hurt the dollar's value.
Some other late dollar rates in New York yesterday, compared with late Wednesday, were: 1.1576 Swiss francs, up from 1.1545; 4.9320 French francs, down from 4.9415; 1,587 Italian lire, down from 1,594, and 1.3620 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3669. The British pound was quoted at $1.5417, up from $1.5360 on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Hartford Remembers Better Days;
G. Fox Display Recalls a Once-Proud Store and City

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 21

 BODY:
On a recent afternoon, Jerry Orfitelli introduced his two granddaughters to an old friend he thought they would never get to meet: the G. Fox & Company department store, a Hartford institution that closed three years ago.
Together they walked into "Winter Wonderland" -- a six-floor smorgasbord of Christmas displays, children's attractions and December kitsch set up in the otherwise vacant building to benefit charities -- and the memories rushed over him. 
 There were Mr. Orfitelli's annual visits to buy his Easter suit; the day he and his schoolmates had cookies and milk in the penthouse office of the store's president, and his stint as an employee in "Toy Land," leading nervous children to Santa Claus.
"To go through those revolving doors again and see that big grand escalator that I must have raced up at least a thousand times, it's a joy," said Mr. Orfitelli, 55, a retired insurance consultant. "This place, the magic, it's still here."
The 11-story building has been largely empty since its final business day, Jan. 22, 1993. But thanks to Winter Wonderland's creator, the son of a Holocaust survivor, it has been transformed into a combination exhibition hall and fantasy land that has attracted more than 70,000 people since Thanksgiving.
The event has provided a brief reprieve for a city that was devastated by the store's closing and that has suffered one economic blow after another as its main industry, the insurance business, has scaled back. What makes Winter Wonderland's success even sweeter is that it comes as some have declared the 78-year-old Art Deco building a white elephant and a symbol of a downtown that has seen better days.
Nostalgia is the lure for many vistors, But others are drawn by the lavish displays: a forest of shimmering Christmas trees that use enough power to light a typical Hartford block; a floor filled with mechanical figurines like bubble-blowing bears and Martians landing on the North Pole; an indoor race track where toddlers can putter about on battery-powered jeeps; the displays of electric trains and ornate Victorian doll houses, and 16 Santa Clauses for children to visit.
It is a wild homespun mix of private toy collections (several hundred Barbies), finely made miniatures and Christmas glitz. Tour buses have come from as far as New Hampshire and New York City.
Still, it is clear that G. Fox has become a place with little for sale besides dreams and memories.
"Imagine New York City without Macy's," remarked Mickey Hernandez, a native of Hartford who was taking her 2-year-old niece to see Santa Claus. But in Hartford, the store meant even more.
"G. Fox was the only game in town," she said. 'Going to the mall isn't the same thing."
The mastermind behind Winter Wonderland, now in its second year, is Arnold L. Chase, 44, executive vice president of Chase Enterprises, a family-owned real estate and communications company. He was tired of looking out his office window at the building's boarded-up windows and frustrated that downtown Hartford was so often deserted at night and on weekends.
For years, Mr. Chase had been staging an elaborate haunted house at his home. He is an electronics wizard who grew up taking apart and putting together radios and other mechanical gadgets.
To Mr. Chase, the G. Fox Building was a giant toy that would allow him to play on a grand scale, with the proceeds going to charity.
At first, the city, the building's owner, resisted, but two years ago it offered free use of the building for Halloween and winter events.
The Halloween venture is clearly Mr. Chase's first love.
This year, it featured a subway car that rumbled out of control, giant tarantulas that dropped from the ceiling, an hors d'oeuvres plate of finger stumps, and bodies and skulls that gushed fake blood. The ticket lines stretched several blocks, and Mr. Chase had an ambulance regularly rushing up to the curb, to receive a decapitated body that would be carried out on a stretcher with its arms flailing. He would then follow with the head.
"It contributed to the mood," he said.
Winter Wonderland has a different effect on visitors. At first glance, Mr. Chase, an observant Jew, would appear to be an unlikely architect for the project. "I personally can't relate to the holiday," he admitted sheepishly.
Still, it is Mr. Chase's distinctive imagination that infuses the project, and before embarking on it last year, he researched what sort of feelings he wanted to evoke, even videotaping customers at F.A.O. Schwarz in Manhattan. "I asked everyone, 'What does Christmas mean to you?' " he said.
He is clearly delighted with the results.
"Look at that," he said, pointing out a family that had just got off the escalator. "Three generations -- grandparents, parents and kids. Where else could they all go out and have fun together?"
Mr. Chase estimates that the events at G. Fox have raised about $80,000 over two years for the American Diabetes Association and other charities and brought a quarter million people into the city. He said that at least $1 million had been invested, though he declined to identify his personal stake. This year's event is also sponsored by McDonald's.
Tickets cost $8 for adults and $5 for children, with the event running through Dec. 31.
But the future of the building is uncertain. Mr. Chase has asked the city to let him transform it into a year-round entertainment center, with the profits going to charity. But city officials have held onto hopes that the building can be sold. A few weeks ago, Mayor Mike Peters said two developers were interested, and the building has been shown recently to potential buyers.
Mr. Chase said he would try to move his events to another city, perhaps New York, if G. Fox were no longer available.
Since the city bought the building for $1 in 1993, it has deteriorated. An escalator hand rail is so severely cracked that visitors are told not to rest their hands on it. The walls are smudged, the floors scuffed, the bathrooms not sparkling.
Still, those who visit Winter Wonderland do not notice the flaws. "It is beautiful," Ms. Hernandez exclaimed.
Mr. Orfitelli sat his granddaughters, Rachel, 2, and Jordan, 5, at the winding 1950's lunch counter that was reopened on the third floor and told them, "You don't see anything like this anymore."
A little later he added, "I just wish someone would buy it and keep it this way. Everyone wants to go back to department stores at Christmas, and there are none left."
"This lets a grandfather show his grandkids, 'This is what it was like when I grew up,' " he said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices End Day Mixed

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed yesterday, with the long bond modestly higher in lackluster trading.
With the future release of many economic reports on hold because of the partial Government shutdown, many dealers and investors remain focused on the budget talks, with few venturing to take strong positions before the outcome is known. 
 The benchmark 30-year bond rose 9/32, to a price of 110 24/32 to yield 6.09 percent, down from 6.12 percent on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, the short end of the market did reasonably well because of seasonal factors, with the rate for the three-month issue down ten-hundredths of a percentage point, to 4.89 percent.
Strong buying was also helped by the expectations of some that there will be more rate cuts by the central bank, and a flight to safety of investors moving away from longer maturities to the short end of the market because of the uncertainty surrounding the budget talks.
Traders say the market views the week's lack of progress on the budget deficit as reducing the chances of a quick settlement. There were no top-level meetings scheduled in Washington yesterday.
Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston, said trading was thin yesterday, with most participants choosing to watch news wires for headlines about the negotiations. He said that for the most part, long bonds were confined to a less than a half-point move, before ending slightly higher on the day.
He also said that the day's five-year note auction went pretty much as expected, following a less than stellar two-year note auction on Wednesday. The $12 billion sale of the new five-year issue is done in a so-called Dutch auction format, meaning that all the notes are sold at one yield, which is the highest needed to sell all the debt. At yesterday's auction that yield was 5.550 percent -- the lowest in almost two years.
In the day's only big report, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its general business conditions index rose sharply for December even though price pressures moderated.
Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said that "over all the report was higher because shipments and orders were up," but looking behind those figures, she added, there was some underlying weakness. "
She said most of components were down, including number of employees, the average workweek and prices paid and prices received. "The declines are extremely noteworthy," she said, "as they suggest that the employment report for December will continue to indicate a weak labor market, and that inflationary tendencies remain very favorable."
These data, she added, will set the tone for Government reports for January and February and perhaps play a role in the next Fed decision on interest rates.
The Public Securities Association has recommended a 2 P.M. close today, instead of the normal 5 P.M., for the holiday weekend.
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new five-year notes:

HEADLINE: For Big Broadcasters, Communications Bill's Big Issues Are Settled

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER 

 BODY:
For the big national broadcasters, the unsettled status of the telecommunications bill was not totally unsettling because none of the issues they care about remain in dispute.
The bill, whenever it is passed by Congress, will give the largest station owners, such as the broadcast networks, the right to increase their television station ownership up to a level equal to 35 percent of the television homes in the country. 
 The provisions for radio are scheduled to be loosened even more, with no limits set on the number of stations any one broadcaster can own nationally, and a sliding scale on the number they can own in one city.
The prospect of such a change in radio drove up the stock prices yesterday for big radio station owners such as Infinity Broadcasting, which saw its shares rise $3.75, to $36.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The only reason television station owners did not experience the same bounce, said Derek Blaine, an analyst for Paul Kagan Associates, a firm that specializes in media companies, was "broadcast valuations are already sky high in anticipation of this bill being passed."
One senior network executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that renewed haggling over the bill between Democrats and Republicans yesterday was not likely to affect anything in the bill important to broadcasters, other than timing. "An awful lot has been resolved," the executive said. "I suspect even if this were to carry over until next year, it would still come out pretty much this way on the major issues."
The major issues for the broadcast networks have been the lifting of the current cap on ownership -- from stations that reach up to 25 percent of the national television homes to stations that reach up to 35 percent -- and how much of a station a company must own to have that station count against its 35 percent total.
The latter issue, called attribution, would have the most impact on Rupert Murdoch's Fox Broadcasting Company, because Fox has taken a minority percentage in a number of recent station deals. Fox had wanted the new telecommunications bill to include a provision that would keep intact the current complicated attribution formula. Current rules have allowed Fox to buy a 20 percent stake in stations owned by New World Communications without having that investment count in the total number of stations attributed to Fox.
The Federal Communications Commission has already given notice that it will conduct a rule-making procedure on the attribution rules, and the commission is widely expected to toughen those rules. If the New World stations are forced to be counted as part of the total attributed to Fox, that network would jump immediately to the 35 percent national limit. That development would endanger other deals Fox has made for minority interests in companies such as Savoy Broadcasting and Black Star Broadcasting.
The question of the timing of the passage of the bill is most important to the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, which gained a waiver from the F.C.C. when it completed its deal to acquire CBS last month. The combination of stations owned by Westinghouse and stations added in the CBS deal means the CBS/Westinghouse stations now reach 33 percent of the country.
That deal was concluded in anticipation that the station limit would grow to 35 percent. If the telecommunications bill is delayed, CBS will be forced to ask for an extension to its waiver. "We expect to get it," a senior CBS executive said. "But it could get ugly. We'd much rather have the bill passed."
If the bill passes in the next week or even sometime next year, the immediate result is likely to be a renewed buying frenzy in television stations. Broadcasters will seek to expand their station base, "knowing that economies of scale are especially good in the broadcast business," said Sharon Armbrust, a senior analyst with Kagan Associates.
David Westin, president of ABC, said if the bill passed, "We'll be looking for television stations, though prices are certainly going to be a challenge." He noted that station prices have soared since the television marketplace was roiled by Fox's investment of $500 million for its 20 percent stake in New World two years ago. That set off a long roundelay of affiliation switches, which led to a further round of defensive moves by broadcasters.
The most significant of those moves was the signing of long-term affiliation contracts between networks and affiliates.
Mr. Westin said those contracts would affect whatever station purchases were made by networks in the wake of the bill. "Because of things like 10-year affiliation deals, networks will necessarily look first to buys stations already affiliated with them," Mr. Westin said. "You can look for some deals that result in affiliation swaps. But as a practical matter we'll be looking first to ABC affiliates."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Rains in Brazil and Argentina Send Soybean Prices Plunging

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Soybean futures prices plunged yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade as rains aided parched crops in Brazil and Argentina, relieving drought conditions that threatened to severely hamper world supply.
Analysts cautioned, however, that predicted rainfall of up to 1.5 inches would provide only temporary relief to the region, which has seen virtually no rain in two months and stifling hot temperatures. 
 "There's really only one story in the soybeans market, and that's the South American weather," said Dale Gustafson at Smith Barney in Chicago. "But forecasters continue to suggest the temperatures are going to stay quite hot, and these rains, while useful, will be soaked up very quickly."
On other commodity markets, grain futures also retreated, while natural gas futures again surged to record highs. The Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 commodities rose 0.59 point, to 246.02.
Soybeans for January delivery retreated 14 cents, to $7.18 1/4 a bushel, falling for the second straight day from two-and-a-half-year highs.
Unexpectedly strong rains fell overnight in dry soybean and corn-producing regions of Argentina, and the weather system was headed for the Rio Grande do Sul region in southern Brazil. That area produces about 30 percent of Brazil's soybean crop, the world's second largest behind the United States'.
Wheat and corn futures retreated in sympathy with soybeans, but losses were limited by continued strong export prospects. Wheat for March delivery fell 2 1/2 cents, to $4.99 a bushel. March corn fell 2 cents, to $3.52 1/2 a bushel.
Natural gas futures soared to record highs for the fourth straight day on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid continued cold temperatures in the Northeast at a time when supplies are tight. United States inventories of natural gas are 12 percent below levels a year ago, the American Gas Association, an industry trade group, said.
January natural gas rose 27.9 cents, to $3.350 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Natural gas futures prices climbed 70.7 cents in the first three days of trading this week, and yesterday rose 64.9 cents, to $3.720 for 1,000 cubic feet, before falling back on profittaking of the expiring January contract.
Tim Evans, an analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group in New York, said the rally was likely to continue because cash market prices also continued to climb. "The only question for this rocket ship now," Mr. Evans said, "is how far out of the solar system is it going to go?"

HEADLINE: Real Estate;
Lower interest rates are causing another surge in refinancings of home mortgages.

BYLINE: By Tracie Rozhon 

 BODY:
THE wave of home-mortgage refinancing of three years ago is back, though not quite as strong.
"There's a real surge," said Ellen Bitton, president of the Manhattan Mortgage Company. "Normally the week before Christmas is dead, but it hasn't abated at all. We're crazed." 
 Mark Schwabber, president of Skyscraper Mortgage, mortgage brokers with offices in Connecticut and New York, said 28 percent of his business was now refinancing, compared with 5 percent a year ago. Toward the end of 1993 -- considered the height of the refinancing market -- he said refinancings made up 35 percent of his business.
Within the last few weeks, bond yields, to which many mortgages are keyed, hit the lowest they have been in 24 months. And a drop in short-term interest rates this week by the Federal Reserve, followed by lower market rates, contributed to the public's perception that the timing might be right to take another look at the terms of home mortgages.
These rate drops are "setting the stage for a New Year's gift" for consumers and mortgage lenders alike, according to Paul Havemann, vice president of HSH Associates, an organization that tracks the mortgage industry.
Currently, Mr. Havemann said, refinancing makes up about 25 percent of all mortgage loans. Last year, he said, refinanced mortgages were "negligible, trivial, hardly anything" statistically.
And more refinancing business is expected, he said, echoing the voices of others in the mortgage business. "It's a real possibility that rates could come down more," Mr. Havemann said.
He pointed out that the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in January 1995 stood at 9.33 percent -- while this week the national average was 7.23 percent.
Today's upswing in refinancing is coming not only from people who missed the last wave of refinancing. Some other homeowners refinanced last time with 30-year mortgages carrying rates that are adjusted ever three years -- and the three years are up. Another group of customers refinanced only a year or two ago, but are trying to get an even better deal.
"The conventional wisdom," Mr. Schwabber said, "was that it pays to refinance only if your new rate will be at least two percentage points less than your current rate. That thinking is now out the window. There are people refinancing with only one point lower -- and saving money."
As an example, Mr. Schwabber said a homeowner might have received a mortgage for $100,000 at 8 percent interest earlier this year. The mortgage rate for the same loan is now at 7 percent, he said, and if the person refinanced now, he could borrow $110,000 -- for $2 less a month.
Increasingly, buyers are taking advantage of a procedure called Consolidation Extension and Modification, he said. Under this procedure refinancers can switch to a lower rate mortgage and pay only $300 in lawyer's fees and $500 for a title update. For a $200,000 mortgage taken out a year ago for a percentage point higher, the homeowner now could save $1,656 a year. Even with the refinancing costs figured in, the homeowner could break even in less than a year and start saving money, the mortgage broker said.
"Customers with mortgages over $500,000 are refinancing with one- half percent difference," Mr. Schwabber said.
Nevertheless, mortgage brokers and lenders point out that rates are still higher than they were for houses or apartments bought or refinanced at the end of 1993. While a home buyer who closed on a house at the beginning of January 1994 might have gotten a 30-year fixed-interest loan at 6.75 percent, in today's market, that same loan would be almost a full percentage point higher. And while one-year adjustable loans were written back then as low as 4 percent, the same loan now averages 5.64 percent interest.
Yet Abe Eisner, executive vicepresident of GFC Mortgage Bankers Inc., a company lending in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Florida, still sees a definite boom right now and predicts "it will continue into 1996 as rates are projected to come down even more."
While there appears to be a boomlet in refinancing, mortgage brokers also report more new purchases, which they say reflects an upturn in the residential real estate market.
But whether they are buying or refinancing, mortgage brokers say customers seem to be more creative than ever in shopping for deals. And they suggest that banks are becoming more flexible in accommodating consumers' needs.

HEADLINE: Ghosts of Christmas Past At the City's Historic Houses

BYLINE: By DINITIA SMITH 

 BODY:
IF you want to get away from the glitter, the pressure and the noise of Christmas, you might visit New York City's historic mansions during the holidays. They are seldom crowded; the Van Cortlandt House, set in the romantic, wintry landscape of Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, has only about half a dozen visitors a weekend. The Merchant's House Museum, a beautifully restored late Federal house, is tucked away nearly out of sight, next to a vacant lot on East Fourth Street in Greenwich Village. These and several other great houses are oases of calm in a city frenzied with Christmas revels. Indeed, they are among the secret treasures of New York. But they are simply decorated, and there will be no lavish parties inside. For -- not to be a Scrooge -- in old New York, there were few Christmas Day celebrations as we now know them.
The story of how Christmas came to New York is part of the social history of the city itself, one that is reflected in a chronological tour of its historic houses. From the Morris-Jumel Mansion in Washington Heights to the Abigail Adams Smith House on the Upper East Side to Historic Richmond Town on Staten Island, these houses represent the city's various eras, including Colonial New York and the Victorian Age. 
 To understand the evolution of Christmas in New York, you must look to Europe in pre-Christian times. There have always been celebrations in northern countries during the period now called Christmas week. The harvest was over; it was the winter solstice. The typical pre-Christian was on layoff. He would kick off his proverbial wooden shoes, have a drink, kiss his mate and engage in general licentiousness. In the fourth century, church fathers wisely chose Dec. 25, near the time of the solstice, as the birth date of Jesus. That made pagans more likely to incorporate the Christian liturgy into their ceremonies.
Still, Christmas Day as we know it was not widely observed. There were no decorated trees. There might be parties on St. Nicholas Eve, Dec. 5. But the tradition of St. Nicholas arriving on a white horse with candy and gifts was a later invention. Until the 1800's, Christmas and New Year's were interchangeable terms. And the month of December, generally, was a time of revelry, not necessarily connected to Jesus' birth.
During the Reformation, the Puritans banned Christmas celebrations as pagan and Pope-ish. The Puritans brought their traditions to the New World, and Christmas festivities were banned in Massachusetts. In Dutch Calvinist New York, holiday parties would have been frowned upon, though this didn't stop the lower classes from getting drunk and shooting guns and behaving noisily in general.
But at the start of the 19th century, New York began to change. There were new immigrants, new industries and unemployment. Christmas week revels became rowdier, with parades of callithumpians, as they were called, or drunken vagabonds, begging for money.
 
Merry Modern Christmas
In a way, the story of modern Christmas begins in 1810, with John Pintard, a member of the gentry and founder of the New-York Historical Society. Pintard hated the rowdiness of Christmas-New Year's parties. He was woken up at night by bands of callithumpians. The season, he thought, had become divorced from its spiritual origins.
In his forthcoming book, "The Battle for Christmas" (Alfred A. Knopf, 1996), Stephen Nissenbaum, a professor of history at the University of Massachussetts at Amherst, writes that Pintard and his patrician friends invented Christmas to control the noisy immigrants who disturbed the peace during the Christmas week. Pintard first campaigned to make New Year's Day a holiday of family visits, an alternative to nighttime revelry. Upper-class men visited, and women stayed home and provided food. But the disturbances continued. Pintard turned to St. Nicholas Day, then to Christmas Day itself, trying to create formal celebrations.
In 1810, Pintard paid for a broadside published by the New-York Historical Society with a picture of St. Nicholas and a poem. In 1819, a fellow member of the historical society, Washington Irving, published "The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.," promoting Christmas as a family occasion. Two years later, another friend of Pintard, Clement Clarke Moore, wrote "A Visit From St. Nicholas."
Mr. Nissenbaum has a social historian's explanation for Moore's poem. Moore was a Hebrew scholar and slaveholder who owned much of Chelsea. He watched in horror as the city filled with foreigners and the pastoral world he had known as a child was transformed. In 1818, Ninth Avenue bifurcated his entire estate; Ninth Avenue became a metaphor in Moore's mind for the hordes of immigrants who threatened the established order, Mr. Nissenbaum writes.
Moore's poem "A Visit From St. Nicholas" sought to create an ideal Christmas of domestic family festivities. It represented a nostalgia for a Christmas, notes Mr. Nissenbaum, that never existed. "The household visitor Moore portrays," writes Mr. Nissenbaum, "has come neither to threaten his genteel host, nor to make any demands on his generosity." Charles Dickens's "Christmas Carol" was a further embellishment of the Christmas legend.
 
Such Tranquilizing Trees
The Christmas tree didn't arrive in New York until probably the mid-1800's, introduced perhaps by German immigrants. Mr. Nissenbaum says he believes that the Christmas tree tradition was spread through popular literature, a further effort to shift festivities from drunken street scenes to domestic observances.
Christmas celebrations came to a peak in New York in the 1890's with the building of big department stores. The invention of plate-glass windows and electric lights made lavish displays possible. In "Land of Desire" (Pantheon, 1993), a history of department stores by William Leach, the merchant princes of the city laid claim to Santa Claus "and the imagery of Christmas holidays" to lure shoppers and clamoring children into their grand emporiums.
To experience the holiday in old New York, you can visit the city's historic mansions, some of which are open during Christmas week. But take note of a new emphasis among curators for accurate historical interpretation: some houses held Christmas activities earlier this month, in keeping with St. Nicholas Eve. And for historical truth, houses that reflect New York before the Victorian era are not elaborately decorated at all.
 
Perhaps the Oldest
The Morris-Jumel Mansion, at 65 Jumel Terrace, is probably the oldest house in Manhattan, a grand Palladian structure atop Harlem Heights. It was built in 1765 for a British colonel, Roger Morris, and eventually owned by Stephen Jumel and his wife, Eliza, who married Aaron Burr after Jumel died. The house is decorated minimally, appropriate for old New York. On Dec. 29, there will be a wreath-making workshop "as a traditional symbol of community and connection," says a brochure.
Another way to experience Christmas in early New York is to take the subway for an easy ride to the Van Cortlandt House. The house, built in 1748, is decorated for the year 1820. The house is hung with garlands of beauty berries and boxwood. On the main stairway is a wreath with a pineapple, pineapples being a traditional symbol of hospitality, often brought from far away by merchant seamen. The four apples on the wreath represent the four points of the compass.
Hanging in the hallway is a kissing ball, a tradition from late-18th-century England made with boxwood from the Van Cortlandt grounds. There are two spheres, with a Nativity figure and mistletoe inside, an interesting blend of the sacred and profane in Christmas decorations.
The West Parlor is set up for holiday punch, with a huge china bowl. Typically, the punch would have the juice and rind of lemons, limes or oranges, and sugar, rum and brandy. The concoction was allowed to blend for several days.
The dining room is decorated for the "second dessert" course; people of the time loved sweets. Food is the principal decoration in this room, with delicacies stacked and pyramided in the center of the table. There is a tower of cream puffs encased in spun caramel like a golden web, and a tower of cherries and strawberries, out of season; in the old days, they were grown in hothouses for wealthy families. There are glittery candy mints, sugar-coated Jordan almonds and pfeffernuesse stacked in a tower. On the sideboard are brightly colored jellies surrounding a shimmering blancmange decorated with sugared fruits. (None may eaten by visitors.) Be sure to visit the upstairs nursery with the oldest doll house in the country, from 1744, with two sides separated by slats, so little girls playing together could see each other.
In the Dutch chamber upstairs, straw and carrots are stuffed into a wooden shoe for St. Nick to give to his horse.
Upstairs, the East chamber has been decorated as if for a visiting family, as the season was a time for holiday guests. Note the lead pewter baby bottle that has been set out.
 
An Unlikely Setting
The Abigail Adams Smith Museum, at 421 East 61st Street, is a jewel of Manhattan, a house constructed of Manhattan schist, surrounded by parking lots, warehouses and practically underneath the Queensboro Bridge. It has been restored to the way it was in the 1820's and 30's when it was the Mount Vernon Hotel, a resort on the East River. Even in its modern setting, this house has a peaceful feeling. There are greens and candles but no Christmas tree. In the entryway, a table is set with nuts and marzipan sweets. There are kissing balls, and a towered arrangement of apples, a pineapple and greens on the dining table. The fireplaces are decorated with fresh fruits and greenery. There are garlands of pine and cones on the stairway. In the tavern room and kitchen, gourds are piled in wooden bowls.
For a more urban experience, visit the Merchant's House Museum, once the home of the Tredwell family. The house has been "frozen in time," to 1870, when the Tredwells did their last major redecoration. With its red damask furnishings, the house is festive.
In the parlor is a tabletop tree reproduced from an 1850 Godey's Lady's Book. There will be a traditional New Year's visiting day, with hot cider, dips and cookies served in the kitchen downstairs.
To remind yourself of the historical development of Christmas, you might visit the New-York Historical Society's exhibition on Clement Clarke Moore, and the Pierpont Morgan Library at 29 East 36th Street, Murray Hill, which owns the original manuscript of Dickens's "Christmas Carol," on display during the holidays with rare Dickens memorabilia.
 
A Victorian Celebration
But to experience Christmas in its full, Victorian flowering, you should journey to Historic Richmond Town on Staten Island, where there will be traditional Victorian holiday celebrations. In the courthouse, built in 1837, is a big Christmas tree with candles and documented reproductions of late 19th-century Victorian decorations made from tinsel, paper and bits of scrap. On Dec. 29 there will be a doll and teddy bear party, to which children can bring their own toys to meet other dolls and stuffed animals. There will be games, contests, prizes and refreshments.
Some houses on the grounds will have docents in period costume. The Stephens House is hung with holly and boxwood and has a tabletop tree. There is a reproduction of a pine cone Santa from 1860.
The Bennett House also has a tree with replicated and authentic Victorian decorations, including glass beads, and tin brilliants made from the original Staten Island molds. There is to be a magic lantern show with glass slides from the 19th century.
The tavern, built in 1820, is decorated with evergreen, and the cast-iron wood stove will be lighted for Christmas. Cider and homemade pound and gingerbread cake will be for sale.
The climax of the celebrations will be the Christmas Cotillion in the courtroom on New Year's Eve. There will be 19th-century dances, and a midnight "collation" in the boardroom with 19th-century recipes from "Mrs. Beeton's Cookbook," including lobster salad, sausage-and-beef pies, tipsy cake and Christmas pudding. Visitors are encouraged to wear Victorian ball gowns. This is a popular event, and prepaid reservations are required.
When you leave Richmond Town, take the Staten Island Ferry back to Manhattan if you can. Chances are, the light will be darkening and the mist rising on the waters. Standing on the deck, bundled up against the cold, you will have the sense, as the foghorn sounds, of returning from a journey back in time.

Partners Half a World Apart
The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Foundation for the Arts in Nagoya, Japan, have finally consummated their relationship. It took a lot longer than anyone anticipated. Four years after signing a letter of intent, the two signed a 20-year agreement last week establishing a museum in Nagoya that is to be called the Nagoya/Boston Museum of Fine Arts. 
 For a while it seemed that it would never happen: the deal was complicated by the shaky economy in Japan and by political battles within the foundation. Originally the museum was to have opened next year; now it is scheduled to be completed by fall 1998.
If it all works as planned, the new museum will give the Museum of Fine Arts another venue in which to exhibit works from its collection. But that's only part of the story.
There are also considerable financial benefits for the cash-strapped Boston institution. Money for the new museum will come from the foundation, the city of Nagoya and from the Aichi Prefecture, in which Nagoya is situated. The foundation will provide $1 million a year for the Boston museum's operating budget, as well as three $5 million grants.
Brent R. Benjamin, deputy director of curatorial affairs at the Museum of Fine Arts, said the first $5 million was delivered when the letter of intent was signed in 1991, and was used to pay off bonds. "We haven't formally decided what the rest will be used for," he added. "It will probably go toward building our endowment." The foundation is also to reimburse the museum for expenses it incurs in mounting shows in Nagoya.
It is not the first time the Museum of Fine Arts has derived a financial benefit from working with a Japanese institution. "Over the last 15 years we have been sending shows to many different parts of Japan, which have generated funds for our annual operating expenses," Mr. Benjamin said. "One of the ideas behind the Nagoya project was to institutionalize this practice so that we wouldn't be dealing with lots of different places. We wanted to find one place where we would have an ongoing relationship."
Under the agreement, the new museum will present two shows a year from Boston as well as one five-year loan exhibition. The first six-month show will be "Monet, Renoir and the Impressionist Landscape" and the first of the long-term exhibitions will be "Art of the Ancient Mediterranean World," with works from the Museum of Fine Art's Egyptian, Greek and Roman collections. The new museum is to occupy three floors of a new building that will also include a hotel and city offices.
 
 
 
Less (Hoopla) Is More (Substance)
 All the recent fuss about celebrity auctions has left some art connoisseurs feeling a bit queasy. It sometimes seems that the more famous a seller's name, the more lavish the publicity and the poorer the taste and quality of the goods being sold.
The arrival of Christie's catalogue of art and objects belonging to Sir John Pope-Hennessy comes as a relief after the glitz surrounding the auction of works collected by Frank Sinatra and the announcement of the forthcoming spring sale of property belonging to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
Sir John, a major art-world figure who died a little more than a year ago, was the former director of two London institutions: the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. He was a leading authority on the Italian Renaissance, and headed the department of European painting at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan from 1977 to 1986.
Known in the art world as "the Pope," Sir John once wrote that "object-based relationships are more constant than human ones (they never change their nature and do not pall)."
This passion makes his collection of Old Master paintings and drawings, prints, sculpture, illuminations, furniture and decorative objects particularly interesting. Most of the works offered in the Jan. 10 auction in New York are to come from Sir John's home in Florence, where he retired in 1986.
Christie's expects the auction to bring $1.3 million to $2 million.
"The whole sale gives you an idea of how fascinating his eye was," said Anthony Crichton-Stuart, head of Christie's department of Old Master paintings in New York. "He was quite a discerning collector, but since he didn't have unlimited resources, he bought carefully and the collection grew over time."
Among the highlights are Franceschini's "Last Communion of St. Mary of Egypt From the Hermit Zosimus" (circa 1680), which the artist painted on copper. Christie's estimates that it will sell for $100,000 to $150,000.
Another painting, "Lake Geneva From the Slopes of Cologny Looking Toward Eaux-Vives, With an Artist Sketching Seated on a Bench With His Companions" (1778), by Simon Malgo, is intriguing because it is not typical of Sir John's taste. He inherited it from his mother, Dame Una Pope-Hennessy. Christie's estimates it will bring $70,000 to $100,000.
Another work he inherited from his mother, Piaggio's "Marriage of the Virgin" (1520), estimated to fetch $60,000 to $80,000, was only recently attributed to the artist. "If it belonged to someone else I would have found long ago who painted it, but since it is my own I feel no interest in the problem," wrote Sir John in his 1991 autobiography. "It is nonetheless a satisfying picture."
 
 
 
. . . It Was a Very Good Year
 Sotheby's and Christie's are ending the year on a positive note. Both companies announced their year-end figures this week, and both had good news to report.
Sotheby's 1995 auction sales totaled $1.7 billion, a 25 percent increase from the $1.3 billion it reported in 1994. "We've had the strongest year since 1990," said Diana D. Brooks, the auction house's chief executive officer. "The reasons were the strong sales in Impressionist and modern art and jewelry and the strong single-owner sales."
Christie's rise in sales stemmed from exactly the same areas. Its sales totaled $1.5 billion, a 17 percent increase from the $1.3 billion it reported a year ago. While neither auction house came close to posting the high figures they did at the height of the market (in 1989, Sotheby's sales were $2.9 billion, and Christie's were $2.1 billion), both houses sold goods at higher prices than they had in six years.
"We sold 108 lots for $1 million or more this year" said David Tyler, Christie's commercial and finance director. "That's the most since 1990."

HEADLINE: Stocks Rise, Broad Indexes Eclipsing Dow

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks closed sharply higher yesterday on hopes that new talks planned between the White House and Congressional leaders that are scheduled for today will end the dispute about balancing the Federal budget in seven years.
The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 37.21 points to close at 5,096.53, nearly recovering a 50-point loss in the previous session. In the broader market, advancing issues led decliners, 1,417 to 951, on Big Board volume of 419.9 million shares. 
 The Nasdaq composite index did better yet, jumping 15.37 points, to 1,040.64, propelled by strength in technology stocks. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.55 points, to 610.49, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.00 points, to 325.61.
The American Stock Exchange index rose 2.99 points, to 537.49. And the Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of Big Board, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 5,988.45, up 45.39 points, or 0.76 percent.
"We had a nice snap-back from yesterday's late selloff and managed to hold gains," said Ron Hill, research director at Brown Brothers Harriman. "The fact we'll see continued budget talks is a positive here after they broke off acrimoniously yesterday."
The Senate's Republican majority leader, Bob Dole, said he thought there had been some progress, but he called it "process progress."
On Wednesday, President Clinton detailed the latest budget impasse at an afternoon news conference, which led to a computer program-assisted selloff in stocks.
Wall Street also seemed to bet that the Federal Reserve would again lower interest rates early next year, given continued signs of a slowing economy. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said that manufacturing activity increased in parts of the Northeast in December, but that the outlook for the next six months was not as bright as it was a month ago. The Philadelphia Fed, one of 12 regional banks of the Federal Reserve, said its index of current manufacturing activity rose to 21.5 in December from 7.9 in November.
On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve lowered the Federal funds rate, the rate at which banks lend one another money, by a quarter of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent, in an effort to bolster the economy.
Yesterday, shares of biotechnology companies, and to some extent, drug makers, soared on news of positive results in a clinical trial for Centocor's drug Reopro, which breaks up blood clots. Centocor surged 7 1/16, to 32 1/8. Eli Lilly Centocor's marketing partner for Reopro, rose 4, to 55 1/4.
"The hot group was biotechs," said Frank Gretz, a technical analyst at Shields & Company, "and when you get a new leadership group that's positive."
Other biotechnology stocks gaining included Biogen, which rose 4 3/4, to 63; Chiron, up 7 1/4, to 109 1/2; Amgen, up 3 5/8, to 55 1/2, and Cephalon, up 3 7/16, to 37.
"There was good news for Centocor seeping through to the rest of the group, reminding when new drugs have success in trials it can do wonders for the valuations of these companies," Mr. Hill said.
Kmart was the most active stock, rising 1 5/8, to 7 5/8, on volume of nearly 15.5 million shares. The struggling retailer eliminated its dividend on Wednesday, and said it had reached an agreement with creditors that would prevent mortgage debt holders from seeking early repayment.
Coca-Cola lost 1 1/2, closing at 72 3/4, after issuing a fourth-quarter forecast on international sales that fell short of analyst expectations.
UAL, the parent company of United Airlines, tumbled 17 7/8, to 180 1/8, after forecasting disappointing fourth-quarter earnings. American Airlines' parent, the AMR Corporation, lost 2 3/8, to 73 3/4, and Boeing fell 1 1/4, to 76 3/4. An American Airlines flight crashed in Colombia late Wednesday night, killing most of the 164 people aboard. The accident involved a Boeing 757 jet.
In Nasdaq trading, Avid Technology tumbled 10 5/8, to 19, after the company warned about its fourth-quarter performance. Unitech Industries fell nearly 80 percent, or 8 1/2, to 2 1/4, after it forecast a significant loss for the year. The company, which also trades on Nasdaq, said it believed its financial results for previous quarters had been misstated, and several top executives resigned.

HEADLINE: Police Investigate Threats Against White and Korean Store Owners

BYLINE: By GARRY PIERRE-PIERRE 

 BODY:
At least 10 white or Korean store owners in Harlem have received racially charged threats since the arson attack on Freddy's clothing store that left eight people dead, police officials said yesterday.
Though officials say they do not know whether the threats are dangerous or merely harassing, police officers have been posted outside several stores on West 125th Street, the police said. 
 In one incident, a caller telephoned the Sneaker City shoe store on Wednesday and asked if the store was Korean-owned, said Christopher Walker, a store clerk. When Mr. Walker replied that the shoe store was indeed owned by a Korean, the caller said: " 'You see what happened at Freddy's -- your store is next,' " said Mr. Walker, who began working at the store more than a month ago.
In another case, said a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, a black man walked into the Electronic Outlet at 200 West 125th Street and said, "This store sells used merchandise and we're watching you." The man also complained that the business, owned by David Betesh, who is white, was not hiring black employees.
Mr. Betesh's brother, Stephen, who owns another electronics store called Kiss, at 230 West 125th Street, received an anonymous letter making ethnic slurs and threats to physically harm the owner and the store, said Tom Kelly, deputy police commissioner for public information.
The postmark shows that the anonymous letter was mailed on Dec. 9, a day after Roland J. Smith opened fire inside the nearby Freddy's clothing store, set the building ablaze and then shot himself in the chest; killing seven store employees and himself. Mr. Kelly would not detail the slurs enclosed in the letter.
A third case involved Bargain Land, a discount store on West 145th Street, which the law enforcement official said had also received anonymous telephone threats.
Mr. Kelly said that detectives were investigating whether the various incidents were related, and whether they were serious threats or pranks. But given the charged atmosphere, he said, the police were not taking any chances.
"This thing kind of feeds on itself," Mr. Kelly said. "We're investigating them all. You take them all seriously."
Mr. Smith had been among a group of protesters who had picketed Freddy's, complaining that the Jewish-owned clothing store was trying to evict a black-owned record store from the building. While protest leaders have contended that the dispute was economic, not racial, workers at Freddy's said the protesters frequently used racial slurs and threats.
Law enforcement officials are still investigating whether anyone else knew of Mr. Smith's attack or helped him plan it. A high-ranking official in the Manhattan District Attorney's office said investigators were also aware of the subsequent threats to other stores, but said there was no evidence at this point that they were linked to the earlier deadly blaze.
Michael A. Hardy, a lawyer representing Morris Powell, one of the leaders of the protests at Freddy's, said that he knew nothing of the reported threats and that the police had not questioned his client about them.
In investigating the arson and deaths at Freddy's, the police have reviewed videotapes of the protests, identifying demonstrators. Officials have even begun an inquiry into the performance of the 28th Precinct to determine whether the precinct responded aggressively enough.
One of the regular protesters, Tracy Ligon, known by the street name of Shabazz, had been accused in court papers of making several threatening gestures toward the clothing store and its customers and employees during the weeks preceding the fatal fire.
In the court papers, Mr. Ligon was accused of bursting into the clothing store and shouting: "I will be back to burn the Jew store down. Burn, burn, burn." In an interview earlier this week, however, Mr. Ligon said the protest was economic, not anti-Semitic, and he denied making threatening gestures or remarks at the protests.

HEADLINE: Let C.E.O.'s Heal Budget and Themselves

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Aesop could never have written this fable: A hundred chairmen of the board, virtuosos of a bottom line that threw millions of the middle class on the trash pile, ran a two-page advertisement (Dec. 19) warning us the party's over if we don't balance the budget. These guys would be amazed to learn that an equated budget is not a magic elixir, or finding the Holy Grail. It doesn't fix crime or increase family values.
Let the C.E.O.'s heal themselves and offer a plan with the Government to retrain workers. Better still would be fair-share income tax. For a $270 billion shortfall in a $7 trillion economy isn't as obscure as locating a needle in a haystack. 
 What happened in America is that wealth is stacked in the hands of 20 percent of the people. Republicans stand guard over this abundance. They want the "have-nots" to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. The Democrats concur but want to supply the boots. Hence the baloney of balancing the budget.
The G.O.P. wants the disenfranchised to pay for the Great Society. There are no funds that can be squeezed from the middle class and the poor. To think otherwise is nonsense.

HEADLINE: No Break in Impasse Over Balanced Budget

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
Unable to reach agreement on reopening the Government or virtually anything else, the White House and Congressional Republicans nevertheless pushed on today and started examining a sheaf of proposals to balance the Federal budget by 2002.
After 32 days in which the bargainers had traded more accusations than offers, that in itself was progress. Republican leaders and President Clinton are to meet at the White House on Friday to see whether today's review uncovered any common ground. 
 Mr. Clinton's lead negotiator, Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said with apparent hesitance today that he was feeling better about the talks than on Wednesday, the day of their most recent collapse. The Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole, said he hoped to strike a deal with Mr. Clinton on Friday that would both balance the budget and reopen closed Government agencies.
But he added, "I'm not sure I'll succeed."
Nor was anyone else. By most indications, a thunderhead has settled over the balanced-budget discussions and shows few signs of quickly passing over. Republicans in the House said they were told in a closed meeting this evening that the talks were at a standstill and that one of their chief bargainers, Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, was both pessimistic and deeply frustrated.
In a reflection of that, the House voted to take a Christmas break of at least five days starting on Friday. Although the members will be on call for summoning back to Washington if there is a budget agreement, the vote was a clear sign that many of them believe no accord is in sight.
The six Cabinet agencies that except for essential services have now been idled for six days -- tying a record for a Government shutdown set only last month -- have almost no prospect of resuming operations until after Christmas at the earliest. That means 260,000 Federal workers will continue to be furloughed.
Both sides said this was a revolting state of affairs, and each said the other was to blame.
"We believe they really don't want to balance the budget," Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the head of the House Republican Conference, said of the White House. "Frankly, we're not used to people who don't deal in good faith."
The Democrats laid responsibility on Speaker Newt Gingrich and his charges in the House, who are taking by far the hardest line in the budget talks. "I don't know what, if anything, could move the House Republicans," said Pat Griffin, the chief lobbyist at the White House.
In fact, there is adequate responsibility to go around. Republicans could easily vote to give closed Federal offices a temporary stipend, thus ending the shutdown. But they believe that the shutdown is a lever that will pry Mr. Clinton into serious budget negotiations, and so they have refused to reopen the Government until a balanced-budget accord is in hand.
For its part, the White House is the only player in the talks -- and the number of those players has grown to at least five with the addition of various Congressional factions -- that has refused to present a balanced-budget plan that uses the Congressional Budget Office's economic forecasts as a base line. As a result, the Administration's seven-year proposal differs from the others by hundreds of billions of dollars. Republicans cite this as evidence that Mr. Clinton prefers to prolong a standoff that so far has been politically damaging to the Republicans.
Republicans in the House today presented a study that rebutted one of their opponents' central contentions: that although the Republican budget plan would achieve fiscal balance in 2002, it would bring huge deficits thereafter. The new study, by the Congressional Budget Office, predicts that the Government would actually run a $10 billion surplus in 2003 and that the annual surplus would grow, reaching $50 billion by 2005.
Mr. Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said in a statement that it was the Democrats who had asked the budget office to conduct the analysis.
In today's negotiating session, Mr. Kasich and the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, met with a Democratic team that included Mr. Panetta; the White House budget director, Alice M. Rivlin, and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. The bargainers pored over three plans, one offered by a group of conservative House Democrats who call themselves the Blue Dogs, another by a group of Senate Democrats, and the third by a group of Senate moderates of both parties.
The three plans differ chiefly in how much of the $240 billion tax cut in the Republican plan they would preserve, and in how the reduction in that cut would be divided among various Federal programs that the Republicans' budget would pare back. One proposal, from the Blue Dogs, would forgo the tax cut entirely and funnel much of the savings to Medicare and Medicaid. So would another, offered by Senate Democrats. The third proposal, offered by the bipartisan group of Senate centrists, contemplates a $130 billion tax cut.
The White House and the Republicans issued a three-sentence statement tonight calling the day's work "constructive." They pledged to meet again on Friday.
But the talk outside the meeting room was positively fetid.
Vice President Al Gore, honing the White House's message of recent days, summoned reporters to say that the White House could deal with Mr. Gingrich but that the more conservative Republicans in the House were "an extremist wing" with an "extremist ideology."
Republicans took offense. Thirty-two self-proclaimed moderate Republicans in the House sent Mr. Clinton a letter professing solidarity with their colleagues. "It serves no one to resort to the rhetoric of extremism," the letter stated.
And the main targets of Mr. Gore's wrath, the House's large class of freshman Republicans, held a news conference to defend themselves. One of them, Representative William M. (Mac) Thornberry of Texas, said, "For some people, it may be extreme to truly believe in something, then speak openly and then keep your promises."

Budget Stalemate Goes On, But With Quieter Tone
There was one bit of progress in the talks on ending the stalemate over the Federal budget: The negotiations between the President and the Republican Congressional leaders ended without the usual rancor.
But little else appeared to change, as the principals said afterward that they would not meet again until next Friday, making it almost certain that many Federal offices will remain closed at least until the New Year. People on both sides said the talks had touched on the barriers to an agreement, including spending for Medicare and Medicaid. [Page 1.]

The Senate gave final approval to a Republican plan to overhaul the nation's welfare system, ending a guarantee of cash assistance for poor children. The vote cleared the bill for President Clinton, who has said he will veto it. [1.]

CBI Gives In to Praxair
Ending a two-month battle, CBI Industries accepted a $2.2 billion bid from Praxair after it was unable to find a rival bidder. The companies are two of the world's leading producers of industrial gases. [41.]
 
Stake in Hospital Chain Sold
Richard Rainwater, the Fort Worth-based financier who made a fortune in hospital investments, has agreed to buy a stake in Charter Medical, a troubled chain of psychiatric hospitals that is moving into managed care. The company said that Mr. Rainwater and his wife, Darla Moore, would pay $69.7 million in cash. The shares of Charter Medical, which changed its name to Magellan Health Services Inc., jumped 16 percent. [41.]
 
Rate Vote Was Near-Unanimous
Federal Reserve policy-makers decided in November not to wait for resolution of the Federal budget stalemate to cut interest rates, if economic conditions warranted such a move. The Fed's Open Market Committee voted 10-1 to cut a key rate by one-quarter percentage point, minutes show. [43.]

Taking Citicorp Threat Seriously
John Reed, the chairman of Citicorp, has often talked of moving the company's headquarters from New York. But it appears that the Giuliani administration is listening more closely now, and officials said it had begun talks to try to insure that Citicorp stays. [32.]

Anheuser to Sell Cardinals
Anheuser-Busch has reached an agreement to sell the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team for $150 million to a group of investors who say they will keep the team in the city. [38.]

Dow Nearly Flat After Early Surge
After rising more than 30 points early in the session, the Dow Jones industrial average finished up only 1.44 points in light trading before the Christmas holiday. Biotechnology shares continued to soak up money pulled out of information technologies earlier in the week. [43.]

The yield fell on the 30-year Treasury bond to 6.06 percent, the lowest in nearly two weeks, from 6.09 percent. Trading was thin, exaggerating the price movement. [40.]

The dollar rose against leading currencies as the market's shifting sentiment on the Federal budget negotiations turned positive. [42.]

Corn Futures at 11-Year High
Corn futures prices climbed to an 11-year high as South American crops faced a return of hot, dry temperatures after a scant rainfall. Soybean futures also rose. [42.]

Receivers to Monitor Waste Haulers
Justice Walter M. Schackman of New York State Supreme Court named nine receivers to monitor the finances and assets of 18 waste-hauling companies that are charged with being part of a Mafia-dominated cartel that used arson and threats to control New York City's commerical garbage business for more than half a century.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises as Trader Sentiment On a Budget Deal Turns Positive

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against leading currencies in New York yesterday as the market's shifting sentiment on Federal budget negotiations turned positive.
President Clinton and his Republican opponents in Congress negotiated to balance the budget in seven years at the White House yesterday, prompting hope that the stalemate would soon end. 
 The dollar also drew strength from rising stocks and bonds early in the day. Foreign investors interested in buying American securities need dollars to pay for them.
The dollar finished with a strong gain against the Japanese yen and closed slightly higher against the German mark.
In New York trading was abbreviated ahead of the Christmas holiday on Monday, the dollar was quoted at 102.70 Japanese yen, up from 101.79 late Thursday. The dollar was worth 1.4380 German marks, up from 1.4377 on Thursday.
The mark was supported by a comment from a Bundesbank official who indicated another interest rate cut in Germany might not be forthcoming soon.
The German central bank cut two interest rates by half a percentage point a week ago. Lower interest rates generally weaken a currency as traders look for countries where currencies pay higher yields.
After the comments, the German Government said preliminary western German inflation numbers showed prices 1.4 percent higher than a year earlier in the 30 days ended in mid-December. The inflation numbers were in line with economists' expectations; with inflation rising, central banks are generally reluctant to cut rates.
The dollar wavered against major currencies during the day in New York where volume was thin, allowing individual trades to have an exaggerated effect on the price.
It was higher in the morning, helped by strength in overseas trading, then turned lower after noon before turning up again.
"It was thought some major players who were long on dollars were taking profits before the Christmas holiday," said David de Rosa at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York.
While Friday's budget talks prompted no breakthroughs, both Mr. Clinton and the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, sounded upbeat about the prospect of reaching an agreement.
The British pound was quoted at $1.5400, down from $1.5417 on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Tackling a Crucial Highway to Keep Skiers Happy

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SILVER PLUME, Colo., Dec. 21

 BODY:
 On a mountain slope, 23 feet of snow is a skier's blessing. On a mountain highway, it is a skier's curse.
Interstate 70, which climbs through here and is the nation's highest stretch of Interstate, winds past sheer cliffs and deep gorges. 
 But it is not merely a scenic tourist road. In the two decades since this stretch in the Rockies opened, the highway has become the main street for the busiest ski areas in Colorado, the busiest skiing state.
In the 100 miles between Denver and Vail, the Sunday-afternoon traffic crush at the Eisenhower Tunnel, just west of this tiny old mining settlement, can look like a commuter's rush hour -- above the tree line. The annual traffic at the tunnel has tripled in 20 years, hitting 8.5 million vehicles this year.
Last winter, when 281 inches of snow fell on the road, the results were predictable. Trucks jackknifed, skiers' four-wheel-drive vehicles slithered, and the state police closed the highway a record 35 times. The closings cost "tens of million of dollars to Colorado's ski industry, the backbone of the tourism economy," said John Frew, president of Colorado Ski Country USA, a resort association.
This year, with planeloads of skiers' disembarking hourly at Denver's new airport, the authorities are marshaling high and low technology to keep traffic flowing over the Interstate, which peaks at 11,165 feet.
The techniques include computer-controlled message signs, strict enforcement of tire-chain laws for trucks and raising the wages of snowplow drivers to entice more people into the job. Widening the four-lane highway would help, of course, but experts say it would be prohibitively expensive.
With the impetus from the state's $2.5 billion ski industry, Colorado's assault on snow and ice may point the way for other snowbound sections of the nation.
"Colorado is one of the leading states in appropriately applying technology to problems, as opposed to the brute force of widening highways," said Christine Johnson, director for Intelligent Transportation Systems at the Federal Transportation Department.
Trying to make Interstate 70 here a "smart highway," Colorado authorities last month enlisted cellular-telephone technology to help install 9 message signs and 12 emergency roadside telephones. By next month three low-powered highway radio stations are scheduled to broadcast traffic conditions at 530 kilocycles.
Last month, highway officials started a statewide telephone information network. Running through a menu, callers can hear up to 25 messages. After 10,000 people called the number -- (303) 639-1111 -- in one 24-hour period, the state Transportation Department moved to increase the number of phone lines to 50 from 38.
To keep skiers off the Interstate when traffic slows to a long snake of red tail lights, the department has started using a fax system to warn ski areas along the highway. Ski areas now have chalkboards at the tops of lifts to post road conditions.
"Yesterday was first time the fax worked to our satisfaction," a spokesman for the Breckenridge Ski Resort, Jim Felton, said, referring to a snow-and-ice storm that closed the Interstate for the fifth time this season. "Only 45 minutes after a report of an accident, we got faxes that I-70 was closed in both directions."
Few resort operators want customers to remember three-hour waits in cold cars at 11,000 feet as the unpleasant finale to their last ski vacations. "We want to give people the option to do a little shopping, to get a bite to eat, whatever it takes to keep them off the road," said Joe May, manager of government affairs for Vail, the largest ski resort in Colorado.
Rough driving conditions have led some skiers to abandon the sport.
"I don't want to play bumper cars on I-70," said Daniel Pincher, a political economist in Denver. "Or you ski all day and then get in horrendous traffic jams on the way home. Just stop and go."
Last season a shortage of snowplow drivers prolonged many delays, as the ski season stretched into June. Reflecting the labor shortages and high rents at resorts, half of the snowplow drivers assigned to Interstate 70 had left by March.
"Last year in Vail, McDonald's was paying $10 an hour, and that's a lot less stressful than plowing highways," said Dan Hopkins, a spokesman for the Transportation Department. "We found it impossible to hire drivers."
To make the job more attractive this year, the state has raised drivers' salaries 15 percent, extended health benefits and offered low-rent apartments.
"We are into the beginning of winter with a full staff," Mr. Hopkins said. "This should help us maintain a constant, consistent response to the storms."
Adding horsepower, highway workers will start using next month two trucks that are new to the Rockies. A de-icer truck will spread a solvent to prevent ice on the asphalt, and a "pusher" will push stalled cars and tractor-trailers onto shoulders to open traffic lanes for the plows.
Last year truck accidents helped to raise closings of Interstate 70 to double the level of past winters. Viewing the problem as a threat to the state's financial security, the Legislature is expected to approve next month a bill to increase sixfold, to $252, the penalty for truckers who try to cross the Continental Divide on snowy days without tire chains. Points would also be assessed against violators' licenses.
To enforce the existing law on chain use, the state started roadside inspections last month. and budgeted extra money to insure that the highway patrol checked for violators on weekends and holidays.
"I think the word will spread pretty quickly about Colorado," Mr. Frew of the resort group said. "Our biggest problem has been truckers who don't live here, who don't know the mountain, who don't respect the weather."
Last season a third of the one million out-of-state skiers arrived with limited snow-driving skills, because they were from warmer areas.
Although highway technicians are drawing up plans to post weather advisories on the World Wide Web, there is little that computers can do in face of an ill-timed blizzard. On Nov. 26, the Sunday after Thanksgiving Day, a major storm hit Vail Pass, and the police closed the pass for nine hours just as tens of thousands of drivers were returning to Denver from the holiday weekend.
"People just abandoned their cars," recalled Laura Bishop, a freelance writer from Denver who was on a family visit and who took refuge in a hotel in Breckenridge. "It was wall-to-wall traffic. The snowplows couldn't get through."
As motels filled up, the overflow of snow refugees went to shelters that the Red Cross improvised.
"That day it was 70 degrees in Denver," Ms. Bishop said. "But up in the mountains it was totally different."

HEADLINE: Judge Says Budget Impasse Could Shut Nation's Courts

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
A senior judge who represents the policy-making board of the Federal judiciary today warned that the budget stalemate might force the nation's courts to shut down shortly after New Year's Day.
Gilbert S. Merritt, the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, said in an interview that "a breakdown in constitutional order" could occur if money was not authorized soon. 
 His warning came as an additional 20,000 workers were ordered off the job today, bringing the total number of furloughed Federal workers to 280,000, about one in seven people on the Government's nonmilitary payroll. The partial shutdown reached its seventh day today, surpassing the six-day shutdown that involved 800,000 workers in mid-November and making it the longest on record.
The White House and Congress are trading accusations over who is more to blame for the deadlock. The shutdown results from their inability to agree on several spending bills needed to finance Government operations in the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. Meanwhile, they are also arguing about legislation to balance the Federal budget by the year 2002.
The White House has issued a six-page list of Government functions suspended by the budget deadlock, ranging from granting farmers special permission to use restricted pesticides on crops to the reimbursement of banks for Government-guaranteed loans that have defaulted.
Judge Merritt's warning came in a separate statement. The 840 Federal judges would remain available for work, he said, but it is unlikely that the courts would continue to be staffed by clerical, probation and security personnel.
"The judges cannot run the court system alone," said Judge Merritt, who sits in Nashville. "And if the judiciary shuts down, you can't arrest people for Federal crimes because you can't bring them to court."
Republicans said the White House was to blame for the problems. "President Clinton shut down the Government," said Michele Davis, spokeswoman for Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader. "He vetoed three bills last week that would have reopened" national parks, museums and monuments and restored the missing services, she added.
The shutdown of the national parks forced the cancellation today of the first of the annual Bracebridge dinners at Yosemite National Park in California. Bracebridge, an Ahwahnee Hotel tradition since 1927, recreates a Renaissance feast and includes an eight-course meal.
About 1,650 guests, picked by lottery from among 60,000 requests, were turned away after park rangers closed the gates to Yosemite on Wednesday.
Although the Clinton Administration cited various aspects of law enforcement among its examples of lapsed activity, it did not mention the threat Judge Merritt found to the judiciary.
"If this goes into the first week in January, we are going to have a serious problem," the judge said in the interview. He spoke as the chairman of the steering committee of the Judicial Conference, the policy-making body for Federal judges.
William H. Rehnquist, the Chief Justice of the United States, has long urged Congress to consider a separate financing bill for the judiciary, but there has been no response so far, the judge said. The judiciary is now running on funds it gets from fees, which are not allocated to any specific year's budget. But this money will soon run out, Judge Merritt said.
The White House list included such highly visible examples of service loss as 23,000 passport applications not being accepted on the average day, 383,000 daily visitors affected by the closing of the national parks and 92,400 people in Washington denied admittance to the Smithsonian museums, the National Zoo and the National Gallery of Art.
Among other effects of the shutdown listed were these:
*Suspension of activity involving sales of timber from national forests.
*No processing by the Federal Housing Administration of 2,500 home purchase loans and refinancings.
*Suspension of civil enforcement actions by the Environmental Protection Agency, except for Superfund cases, that yield an average of $3 million a day in fines or injunctive relief against polluters.
*No processing of 20,000 applications a day for student loans or Pell grants.
*Blockage of more than $92 million a day in foreign sales because of the closure of the center that licenses exports of military items and sensitive technology.
In a related development, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said that publication of the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index, scheduled for Jan. 11 and Jan. 12, respectively, would be delayed about a week even if furloughed employees returned to work by Tuesday. And employment figures for December, scheduled to be made public on Jan. 5, will be delayed if workers do not return by Tuesday.
"The absence of this information potentially could create a degree of short-term paralysis in decision making with resulting long-term adverse effects on the nation's economic well-being," said Commissioner Katharine G. Abraham. "For example, companies could delay investment or hiring decisions, causing a decline in output and national income."

HEADLINE: Peres Says Israel, With Regional Pact, Would End Atom Effort

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Prime Minister Shimon Peres said today that Israel would be prepared to close its nuclear program if there was a regional peace in the Middle East, though he stopped short of confirming that Israel possesses nuclear weapons.
Mr. Peres made his comments at a lunch with Israeli journalists in Tel Aviv, after one of them asked whether his new priorities include a change in nuclear policy. 
 "Yes," he said. "Give me peace and we'll give up the nuclear program. That's the whole story."
Mr. Peres used a word in Hebrew, "garin," that means "nucleus," and in the context was a reference to Israel's nuclear program at the Dimona station in the Negev, where Israel has long been suspected of developing nuclear weapons.
"If there will be a regional peace, I think we can make the Middle East free of the nuclear threat," Mr. Peres continued.
But when a reporter tried to pin him down on whether he meant that he would dismantle the Dimona station, Mr. Peres became evasive. "We've never said Dimona deals with what you attribute to it," he said. "What I'm saying is that after peace arrives, we'll be in a Middle East free of nuclear weapons."
The subject of nuclear weapons was broached by the reporters, not by Mr. Peres, and it remained unclear whether he was presenting a new policy or talking generally of future options.
He also left unclear how broad a regional peace he had in mind before abandoning the nuclear option. Israel has negotiated peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan, and will begin new talks next week with Syria, but none of these countries is known to have any nuclear capacity.
The only countries in the Middle East that have demonstrated an interest in developing nuclear weapons are Iraq and Iran. In 1981 Israel bombed a reactor under construction in Iraq, evidently to deny President Saddam Hussein any possibility of producing weapons.
At the lunch, Mr. Peres reiterated Israel's deep distrust of Iran, noting that it was developing a nuclear capacity despite large reserves of oil and natural gas as power sources. He had reportedly raised the issue with President Clinton at their meeting in Washington last week.
"It is not a rich country, and it goes and invests hundreds of million of dollars in nuclear power," he said of Iraq. "For what, if not for grave, horrible intentions?"
Although Israel has never confirmed possession of a nuclear weapon, the United States and other governments have long suspected that this was the purpose of the Dimona nuclear reactor that Israel built with French help in the 1960's. Mr. Peres was instrumental in building the plant. This week, the Israeli daily Haaretz reported that a study by the Rand Corporation, commissioned by the Pentagon, concluded that Israel had enough plutonium to make 70 nuclear weapons.
Israel has never agreed to sign the treaty to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
Mr. Peres noted that as long as its neighbors suspected that Israel had a nuclear weapon, "that in itself can act as a deterrent." He added: "Let them suspect. I don't see any reason to allay their suspicions."

HEADLINE: Talk of Move By Citicorp Alerts Mayor

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Citicorp has long been one of the anchors of New York City's economy, but in recent years, the company's chairman has often spoken of leaving, wondering whether a mammoth financial institution with such global reach would perhaps be better off if it were not so rooted to one place.
Lately, these musings of the chairman, John S. Reed, have begun to attract the attention of the Giuliani administration, which has started talks with Citicorp to insure that it stays put, officials said yesterday. If Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company, were to move, it would be a blow to the city's reputation and its ability to retain other large corporations. 
 Citicorp, the parent of Citibank, has more than 20,000 workers in New York City, but Mr. Reed has never spoken about pulling all of them out. What he has said is that the company might move its top officials -- from 50 to 400 senior managers who are its brain trust -- to a place like Boston or Palo Alto, Calif.
John M. Morris, a spokesman for Citicorp, which was founded in New York in 1812, emphasized yesterday that no decisions had been made on relocating any workers.
Mr. Morris said Mr. Reed believed that New York has become too insular for its top managers. The city is known for securities exchanges and capital markets, which may have been Citicorp's focus in the past but are not necessarily what it wants to concentrate on in the future, company officials have said. In recent years, Citicorp has begun shifting toward consumer products and business in other countries.
Mr. Reed has said that if the top people in the company were based in a city with a technological orientation, like Palo Alto, they might be better prepared to compete in the financial services industry in the next century. And Palo Alto also has lower costs than New York.
"John thinks that you have to look out for what business is going to be like in the future," Mr. Morris said. "He is saying that if we were in a different milieu, there would be more thinking about the future, instead of being caught up in the day-to-day operations."
Mr. Morris said that Mr. Reed's thoughts on moving are nothing more than that. But the Giuliani administration is taking no chances.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson had met with Citicorp officials in recent weeks, though he declined to describe the talks.
"We've had discussions with him and with Citibank," the Mayor said, referring to Mr. Reed. "And it's probably better if we do those confidentially rather than negotiate them in the newspapers."

HEADLINE: ...but G.O.P. Falters on Pro-Business Laws

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Republicans took control of Congress last January armed with a sweeping agenda to undo decades of regulation and in many cases tilt the laws toward industry and away from consumers, workers and even investors.
Why, then, has it been so hard to enact pro-business laws? To the dismay of many giant media and telephone companies this week, quarreling among House Republicans has jeopardized a bill that would overhaul decades of outdated regulations. 
 And that is hardly the only ambitious Republican initiative that has hit a roadblock. Bills that would slash environmental regulations, reduce the bargaining power of labor unions and make it harder to sue companies over defective products have all run into obstacles -- both expected and unexpected:
*The House passed a measure in the spring that would block Federal agencies from issuing new regulations on environmental, health or safety issues without first documenting that the costs to business would be exceeded by the benefits, but Senate Republicans have been unable to bring the measure up for a vote.
*Tort legislation that would make it far more difficult for people to sue companies accused of making defective or dangerous products or to file malpractice suits against doctors has been stopped for now. The House and Senate both passed separate bills months ago, but the measures differ so much that the chambers have not even tried to reconcile them yet.
*The House has passed a bill that would require the Federal Government to compensate landowners if the value of their property declines as a result of new environmental rulings, but the Senate Judiciary Committee is still working on its version.
Some conservatives are plainly vexed. "To recall Shakespeare, there has been a lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing," said Edward Hudgins, director of regulatory policy at the Cato Institute, a conservative research group in Washington.
So far this year, Congress has sent only one major business bill to President Clinton -- a securities measure that would make it more difficult for investors to sue companies on charges of fraud and misrepresentation. President Clinton vetoed the measure on Tuesday, but the House overrode the veto on Wednesday, and the Senate followed suit today.
Despite unusual intramural bickering among Republicans, many lawmakers still predict that Congress will pass a telecommunications bill early next year.
If enacted, the huge bill would knock down regulatory barriers that prevent local telephone, long-distance carriers and cable television companies from invading each other's markets. It would also relax many ownership restrictions on television and radio stations and is almost certain to touch off a new wave of giant media mergers and alliances.
But that measure is unusual, in that Republicans inherited the bill from Democrats and both political parties agree on many principles. And even there, Republicans seemed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory this week by attacking a House-Senate conference agreement their own leaders had negotiated.
Why so much struggle?
Some of the gridlock was inevitable. Senate rules make it hard to pass bills without at least 60 of 100 votes, and the Republicans have a majority of only 53 to 46.
That, in turn, has created a fissure between Senate Republicans, who often have little choice but to compromise with Democrats, and the more fiery House Republicans who often need only a simple majority.
But Republicans have also run into unexpected problems. One of them is business itself. The most powerful opponents of the telecommunications bill this year were long-distance telephone companies, which opposed provisions that would give the regional Bell telephone companies fairly easy access into the long-distance market.
Likewise, it was Wall Street securities firms and insurance companies that helped kill a bill to repeal the Glass Steagall Act and allow banks to enter their markets.
On top of all that, many Republicans were startled at the criticism over environmental deregulation. It turned out that affluent suburban Republican voters -- an important constituency -- were as protective of nature as many liberals.
And some business lobbyists admit they were not quite prepared for the new era of Republican dominance in Congress. "For 40 years, we have basically been a reactionary force trying to stop the liberal majority," said Bruce Josten, senior vice president at the Chamber of Commerce. "Now we have to learn how to shape and frame the debate, how to move the ball down the football field."
And as the team learns, the list of big bills that have stalled is growing longer. Lobbyists for industry contend they have made progress this year, and they never expected many of their favorite bills to pass immediately.
"We're only at halftime," said Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
"If you look at the range of legislative items, you realize it's very broad," Mr. Jasinowski continued. "It's a lot of stuff, with a great deal of complexity and a lot of substantive issues. I never had expectations that these things would pass quickly."
The ideological zeal of freshmen Republicans may have contributed to the logjam. This fall, the House passed a sweeping bill to make it far more difficult to sue companies over defective products and services and to limit punitive damages that a court can award. It would also make it harder to recover money from companies that are tangentially related to the suit and would cover litigation over services as well as products.
The Senate, unable to win support for so broad a measure, passed a bill that would limit only lawsuits over actual products. The two bills were so different that a House-Senate conference committee did not even hold its first meeting until last week. No progress is expected anytime soon, and few people believe that a final bill will go beyond the Senate measure.
The feuding over telecommunications law stemmed from fissures both within industry and within Republican ranks.
By essentially knocking down regulations that currently separate local telephone, long-distance and cable television into separate and protected fiefs, the communications bill has always involved bitter fights among rival segments.
That fighting had ebbed in the last two years as almost every group became more interested in raiding new markets than in protecting its own. But the fighting did not end between local and long-distance telephone companies, and companies like AT&T have waged a bitter and thus far unsuccessful battle for significant change.
Just as it seemed that House Republican negotiators had worked out a compromise, however, they found themselves under fire from their own right wing.
Conservatives outside the conference committee were furious on Thursday that Republican negotiators had agreed to Democratic demands to keep many current ownership restrictions on television and radio broadcasters.
Many Republicans were also angry that Vice President Al Gore had been boasting that Democrats had gotten their way on "every single one" of their demands.
"What you've got is a lot of guys with buyers' remorse," said one Republican operative who is trying to soothe ruffled egos.
Another G.O.P. lawmaker said, "There's a masculinity issue here."
But the upshot was a strange scramble by many of the biggest communication and media companies to build up Republican support. Industry executives say Gerald M. Levin, the chairman of Time Warner Inc., called Speaker Newt Gingrich to plead for the bill even though the final agreement would extend regulation of cable television prices until 1999. The Bell companies and many individual television broadcasters mobilized as well.
In the end, many experts predict, Congress will pass this bill and perhaps others. But nobody has any illusions that it will be easy.

HEADLINE: Fed Panel Voted in November By 10 to 1 to Hold Rates Level

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers decided in November that they would not wait for resolution of the Federal budget stalemate if economic conditions warranted to lower interest rates.
A summary released today from the Nov. 15 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee showed the panel voted 10 to 1 to keep rates unchanged but set the stage for a future reduction. 
 On Tuesday, the central bank lowered a key short-term rate to 5.5 percent from 5.75 percent.
In a brief statement after this week's private meeting, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said he and his colleagues had determined that inflationary pressures were even milder than expected and that lower rates were appropriate.
The minutes of the Nov. 15 meeting said, "The members agreed that the committee could not freeze its policy options while it awaited the outcome of a prolonged Federal budget debate nor could it commit itself to a specific response to a particular fiscal policy agreement."
The outcome of the budget fight between President Clinton and Congress -- still unresolved and the cause of a partial Government shutdown this week -- was only one of many considerations in determining the course of interest rates, the summary said.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Fed governor, was the lone dissenter at the Nov. 15 meeting.
Members of the open market committee agreed that most signs suggested the economy was growing at a slower pace, but they said the surprisingly strong expansion during the summer pointed to a cautious approach toward lowering rates.
But Mr. Lindsey said he favored lowering interest rates because the economy was becoming too sluggish.
Before Tuesday's reduction, the Fed cut rates by a quarter percentage point, to 5.75 percent, on July 6. From February 1994 to February 1995, it had increased rates seven times to stifle inflation.
The panel is composed of 7 Fed governors in Washington and 5 of the Fed's 12 regional bank presidents. One of the governor positions is vacant.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Turn Higher In Slow Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities turned higher yesterday in thin trading during an abbreviated pre-Christmas session that exaggerated movements of prices.
In the shortened session, which ended at 2 P.M., the price of the 30-year bond rose 14/32 , to 1116/32 , and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.06 percent from 6.09 percent on Thursday. That was the lowest yield in nearly two weeks. 
 Traders said the market was buoyed by optimism that an agreement to balance the budget could be achieved before the new year.
The market rose despite a stronger-than-expected final reading of 91 points on the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index for December, up from 88.2 in November.
The consumer sentiment index, which had been predicted to come in at 90.3, was higher than the preliminary reading of 90.5, traders said. Increases in consumer confidence are generally considered inflationary by the bond market because they signal higher spending.
"The market is anticipating that short-term rates are going lower, to which I fully agree," said Charles Roden, the managing director at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross.
But Mr. Roden added that increased business acitivity would put pressure on securities with longer maturities.
"The increase in business activity," he said, "will also raise inflation fears and stimulate the demand for money, with rates increasing as demand begins to exceed supply, both negatives for the market. And it is for that reason that I do not believe long-term rates will go much lower. That is why I'm keeping my inventories of debt securities, especially in the long end, very thin."
Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said it would be interesting to watch the market's response next week to the budget negotiations between the White House and Congress, particularly if Congress approved a measure financing Government operations temporarily.
"This would allow both the Commerce and Labor Deparmments to start producing their economic statistics as early as next week," Mr. Fine said.
The markets will be closed Monday for the Christmas holiday.
In the futures market, the March bond contract ended firmer in dwindling volume.
Robin Mesch, fixed-income analyst with Thomson Research of Boston, said she expected the market to rise next year.
"A modest target price on the bond contract future is 123," Ms. Mesch said, "but we really think 127 is achievable. That may seem grandiose, but that's what the technical charts are saying.
"The question in our minds is, What will tell us we are wrong? One might be if the futures contract breaks below 117. Then we'd have to re-evaluate, but our strategy would be to continue to buy into dips in market prices."

HEADLINE: Black Faith Healer Helped the Oppressed

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Harlem Church Is Outpost of Empire" (news article, Dec. 17), on the United House of Prayer for All People, which became a crucial player in a racially charged dispute involving its tenant, Freddy's clothing store in Harlem, the site of the recent tragedy: 
 It is not enough to say that in the 1920's and 30's the church's founder, the preacher Sweet Daddy Grace, won supporters because of his "charismatic preaching and claims of miraculous healing powers."
In the North, Mr. Grace appealed to many black people who migrated from the South and who experienced not only white racism in the "promised land," but also discrimination by black denominations because of their "country ways."
In the South, Sweet Daddy Grace similarly found supporters among those who arrived from the countryside.
Sweet Daddy Grace gave hope to hundreds of thousands whose living conditions were especially perilous: when urban areas, already overcrowded, were becoming even more so; when unemployment figures were staggering; where white-led violence was part of everyday life in many rural counties; where poor sanitation in black neighborhoods caused public health problems, and where segregation policies and economic barriers often obstructed black people from getting medical care.
Faced with a choice between the promises of a faith healer and no medical attention at all, many chose the faith healer.
Finding salvation in a heartless world was one of the ways that many African-Americans found sustenance to continue to struggle against so many odds.

A FEW MONTHS AGO THE Economist carried an impressive full-page advertisement for a New York management consulting firm called Towers Perrin and, specifically, its "People Strategy." The ad made no real attempt to explain what that strategy was. Instead, the Towers Perrin ad offered an intriguing little graph. Five words -- "surplus," "alignment," "gaps," "performance" and "importance" -- appeared within the graph, and a single line of text beneath it described it as "a new way to look at organization capabilities." That was it. There was no further explanation. The reader was left tointerpret the little graph on his own. Here it is, at left:
A handful of words and a couple of straight lines, you may say. Not worth troubling over. But then you do not fully understand the strange world of management consulting. Consultants earn their living by dreaming up concepts that people who actually do business feel that they cannot live without. Often these concepts are deceptively simple. In the60's a Boston consulting firm stood corporate America on its ear with a square divided into quadrants containing tiny pictures of a dog, a cow, a star and a question mark. Otherwise intelligent people spent a lot of valuable time classifying their businesses as animal, mineral or punctuation. 
 Not since then, I think, has a diagram held as much mystery and allure as the Towers Perrin graph. Towers Perrin employs 5,600 people and currently advises 700 of America's 1,000 largest companies. Its ability to sow its concepts into the collective corporate mind should not be doubted.
AT THIS POINT YOU MAY WISH TO STUDY THE graph more closely. I did. Given that it is associated with something called People Strategy, it seems most likely that it has to do with people. If so, the graph would appear to divide people into three basic states of human existence. People with a great deal of performance but no importance (for instance, the man who excelled in rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic) enjoy a "surplus." People with a great deal of importance but scant performance (Sylvester Stallone? King Hussein of Jordan?) suffer "gaps." People whose importance is perfectly consistent with their performance are aligned. Alignment would seem to represent people's ideal state, a sort of Aristotelian mean. But maybe you see it differently.
Sadly, my own naive reading of the graph raises as many questions as it answers. Which is worse, gaps or surpluses? How do you know when you are aligned? Is there any justice in the world when someone who holds his performance steady falls out of alignment simply because he rises in importance? Certain I had failed to get to the bottom of the matter, I decided to call Towers Perrin.
The man who answered the phone was helpful and efficient -- fully aligned, I would say. He told me that what I was failing to understand was known around Towers Perrin as "gap analysis." He sent me a package of information about gap analysis. It contained many larger but equally indecipherable graphs. In the midst of these loomed a colossal version of our little graph, with the following explanation:
 
In the "real world," a team of managers knowledgeable about different aspects of the organization gather and evaluate an array of data. This iterative process involves identifying and analyzing essential capabilities, which the team then evaluates and "scores" in terms of importance and performance. The results are captured in a graphic, like the one that follows, that highlights strengths and weaknesses. The goal is to align importance with performance -- the red "alignment" band running through the center. Anything out of sync falls into the "gap" band or "surplus" band.
Leave aside for the moment the carpet-bombing approach to the English language. The careful reader will now see the point of the little graph. It can be summarized in plain English: if a job is important, a company should do it well. If a company does important jobs badly, or wastes a lot of time on unimportant ones, it will not make as much money as it could.
This is an important truism, no doubt often ignored by corporate executives. But does the graph truly help them to grasp it? Apparently so. According to Pat Milligan, the Towers Perrin expert on gap analysis, "If you interviewed a C.E.O., he could tell you whether or not he was aligned, but he can't communicate it to the people below him in the organization. This is the one tool the clients have really glommed on to. They love to be able to use a graphic representation to do the analysis and to measure on an ongoing basis how well they are closing the gap." Hence its prominence in the Towers Perrin ad campaign.
NOW, THE POINT OF MOST GRAPHS IS TO simplify complicated information. The supply and demand curves in economics, for example, are elegant summaries of entire markets. The Towers Perrin graph is just the reverse: it takes a simple idea and makes it very, very complicated. The graph itself is an example of "surplus." Had it been created not by a management consulting firm but by, say, the Labor Department, Newt Gingrich would have held it up to ridicule as an example of government waste. And rightly so.
Then again, I may be missing the point all over again. Businesspeople have special needs. Anyone who has ever sat beside a corporate executive on a transatlantic flight knows that businesspeople often cannot explain clearly what they do for a living. Usually this is not because what they do is complicated. It is because they want to believe that what they do is complicated, and they want you to believe it, too.
Perhaps the little Towers Perrin graph satisfies this desire, and that is why it has been so warmly received in corporate America. That is, it was never really meant to be understood. It was always meant not to be understood. It succeeds on its own terms. It is, you might say, fully aligned.

European Soccer
Q. My husband and I would like to attend the 1996 European soccer championships in England. How can we buy tickets? -- Claudia Genna relli, Brooklyn

A. It's a complicated business.
The first of the 1.3 million tickets for the event initially went on sale by mail in England last year to season-ticket holders at English clubs. This year they were made available to the general public in England, with application forms distributed through the Midland Bank. 
 Tickets on sale this way are intended for the English market. But if you have friends in England you could try asking them to pick up a form and mail it to Euro 96, Post Box 1996, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffs. ST5 1LE. The telephone line for ticket information in England is (0178) 274-1996. Tickets cost from $24 to $208 each, calculated at $1.60 to the pound. Credit cards are accepted.
The championships will be held from June 8 to 30 in eight English cities. Each of the 15 other countries that qualifies for the competition will be allocated 7,000 tickets, plus 11,000 for each of the two teams in the final.
Once Europe's demands are satisfied, governing bodies in countries that are not taking part in the championships and have expressed an interest in getting tickets can apply. Among them is the United States Soccer Federation, which is referring all inquiries to the official inbound tour operator for Euro 96, Gullivers Sports Travel, which is based in England but has offices in Vista, Calif.
Gullivers is offering two packages, although it will not know for certain how many tickets it will have available until Feb. 28. The company says refunds will be made if enough tickets are not available.
Its top package, called the Grand Finale, for which the company says tickets are assured, includes round-trip economy air fare from New York, six nights' accommodations in luxury hotels, seats at a semifinal game at Wembley, London, and the final game, also at Wembley. The price is $5,995 a person for two people sharing a room.
The Affordable Euro 96 Package includes six nights' accommodation in either rooms with private bath at the Kingswood Halls of Residence, part of London's Royal Holloway College, or in three-star or four-star London hotels. Accommodation prices at Kingswood start at $699 a person. Three-star accommodation costs $895 a person for a double; the four-star option is $995 a person.
Air fare is extra, and tickets are made available through a $395 add-on package, which includes round-trip transportation to Wembley Stadium for the semifinal on June 26 and the final on June 30.
More information: Gullivers Sports Travel, 973 Vale Terrace, Suite 202, Vista, Calif. 92084; (800) 235-3158, fax (619) 941-2997.

Traveling to Vietnam
Q. I plan to visit Vietnam in January. Is it true credit cards are not accepted there? And that payment for hotels and travel by an independent traveler there cannot be made in advance? What is the status of traveler's checks? -- J. S. French, Franklin, Mich.

A. The age of plastic has reached Vietnam.
American Express, Mastercard and Visa credit cards are accepted in some of the leading hotels in Hanoi and Ho Ci Minh City, according to the Vietnamese Embassy in Washington. And traveler's checks are beginning to make inroads.
However, if you are an independent traveler who is not part of a package tour, or traveling with a group, hotel bills and travel costs within Vietnam must be paid in Vietnamese dong or dollars.

Ramadan in Egypt
Q. Please tell me how Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting, will affect my independent visit to Cairo and Luxor next February. Are there days on which major sites, including bazaars, are closed? -- Barbara Pierson, Bellport, N.Y.

A. Museums and other tourist sites might close an hour early during Ramadan, from Jan. 21 to Feb. 21 next year, but according to the Egyptian Tourist Authority, travelers are encouraged to visit during that time. The streets tend to be less crowded during the day, and at night a festive mood takes over.
The first meal of the day for Muslims is served at sunset, so from 5 to 7 P.M. people tend to be at home. At 7, however, they take to the streets until about 2 A.M., after consuming the second meal of the day, the tourist office said.
Because Ramadan is a period of charity as well as fasting, many of the rich in big cities provide banquets in the streets for the poor, with some families trying to outdo their neighbors in generosity.
Ramadan is followed by a three-day period of feasting and entertainment called Eid. TERENCE NEILAN

HEADLINE: TELEVISION VIEW;
Yugoslavia's Disintegration, From All Angles

BYLINE: By Roger Cohen; Roger Cohen, a correspondent for The New York Times in Paris, covered the Balkan wars and is writing a book about them.

 BODY:
THE BODIES LIE SCATTERED. A woman's leather purse is discarded on the road. The corpses and the bag have equal value in this small town in eastern Bosnia because these Muslim bodies are now no more than objects. Serb men pass by, loading them onto trucks, one body after another, like sacks of produce. It is arduous, unappealing work. They puff; they grimace; they seem just a little uneasy. But the job must be done. This is Zvornik in April 1992, at the start of the war in Bosnia. There were 49,000 Muslims in the town. Now there are none.
The camera cuts to Vojislav Seselj, an extreme nationalist Serbian politician who led paramilitary forces in Bosnia at the beginning of the war. Yes, he concedes, the "ethnic cleansing" of Zvornik and other Bosnian towns by Serbian "special commando units" happened. He talks in a matter-of-fact way, recalling the details. "Milosevic was in control," he continues, referring to the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, "and the operation was planned in Belgrade." 
 Again the camera cuts, now to Mr. Milosevic. His jaw juts. His skin is so closely shaven as to appear raw. His eyes have an impenetrable gleam. "There is no one who can believe what is mentioned as organized genocide, even organized from Belgrade, even organized by me!" he says, his voice rising as he dismisses accounts of the eviction and killing of Muslims on the 70 percent of Bosnian territory seized by the Serbs at the start of the war. "It is really out of all consideration."
This remarkable sequence illustrates the unusual power of "Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation," a series of five one-hour documentaries made by Brian Lapping Associates in London for BBC Television. The series, already shown to acclaim in Britain and several other Western European countries, is to be broadcast in the United States by the Discovery Channel this week, Tuesday through Saturday, at 10 each night. So vivid are the images, so extraordinary the access granted by all the chief protagonists of Yugoslavia's destruction, that the impression is often one of watching a state unravel, stage by gruesome stage, through the very eyes of those whose decisions precipitated the Balkans into more than four years of bloodshed.
The achievement, by a team that in 1994 made an Emmy-winning documentary series on the Watergate scandal, is an important one. The wars of Yugoslavia's destruction have already been much obscured. Serbs, Croats and Muslims all have their own versions of the truth. Western governments, concerned to justify their hesitations, have often portrayed the conflict in whatever way suited their policies. When, for a long period, the war was intractable to the Clinton Administration, "genocide" became a "problem from hell" with its origins in the 11th century.
But here, through videotape never previously seen in the West, and through the words of those who took more than 200,000 people to their deaths, the facts are allowed to speak for themselves, and responsibilities are made clear. For the future of the Balkans, an area where violence feeds on a much-obfuscated past marked by savage conflict, the documentary may conceivably provide a solid basis for reasoned debate in the place of renewed killing. "Death of a Nation" has already been shown in Serbia, where it was widely vilified by the authorities, and it is about to be broadcast in Croatia and Bosnia.
"I'm interested above all in how big decisions are made," says Norma Percy, the producer of the series for Lapping Associates, "because I believe things are generally dictated by a few people or one man. So we try to speak to everyone involved, which is a very good research technique, in that you check statements against each other. Social sweep and history are not really our focus." A diminutive woman, she speaks in a mild, almost distracted way, but there is also a sudden intensity about her at times that suggests she is not easily shaken from an idea or the scent of a story.
When she made "The Second Russian Revolution," an acclaimed series on Soviet perestroika, she asked Politburo members to tell her what happened inside the Kremlin in the same way they told their wives when they arrived home in the evening. The bosses of the Soviet empire were initially aghast. "I guess they never told their wives," Ms. Percy says. But as glasnost grabbed them, they talked. In the same way, the leaders of the former Yugoslavia open up, often with a shocking frankness, almost as if their consciences have been racked by the wars they unleashed and a catharsis on camera is welcome.
THEIR EVIDENT FASCINATION with Western television is intriguing. Throughout the wars, all sides have tried to use television, particularly CNN, to get their points across. Most members of the Bosnian Government became sound-bite masters; the Croats were also proficient; the Serbs, generally inept. No doubt each of the parties saw an opportunity in a long documentary to establish its case. But in these five programs, researched and made over a two-year period, different views are juxtaposed with such immediacy that the viewer has the sense of being a witness with constant access to all sides of a case.
It is terrible to watch the tragedy unfold. In one split second in 1987, it is possible to see what might have been the first germ of the horror. Mr. Milosevic is in Kosovo, the then-autonomous southern area of Serbia whose population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian. He is addressing a crowd of Serbs, who say that the mainly Albanian Communist Party authorities and police have beaten them. Mr. Milosevic hesitates. For a moment he seems to be at a loss. As a Communist apparatchik, he must side with the party. But as a Serb, his instinct is to side with his people. At last, he opts for the call of his blood and takes the plunge. "Nobody has the right to beat you," he says, rebuking his own party and thus the one authority that has held Yugoslavia together since World War II. "It will not happen again."
This fascinating piece of videotape was found in Belgrade by Michael Simkin, a researcher for the series, although the authorities in the Serbian capital had said that no shots of the 1987 visit to Kosova existed. Similarly, the videotape of the ethnic cleansing of Zvornik was found lying around in Reuters' Belgrade office by Paul Mitchell, a director of the series. A Serb cameraman from Reuters Television had been invited to watch the killing by the paramilitary leader known as Arkan, who led the rampage. Other remarkable shots of secret meetings of the highest Yugoslav authorities were also unearthed.
"The amazing thing about the Yugoslavs is they film everything," Mr. Mitchell says. "They filmed it because they believed they would thus be able to show who had allowed Yugoslavia to be destroyed." The advent of the hand-held video camera, widely used by all sides during the wars, clearly helped produce this stunningly complete archive.
After Kosovo, Mr. Milosevic is transformed into the hero and chief vehicle of a resurgent Serbian nationalism. Yugoslavia, always a delicate mosaic of nations and religions, cracks under this pressure. First Slovenia, then Croatia, begin to go their own way. The Serbian President explains his actions in an interview. Kosovo, he says, is not just another Serbian region, it is "all our history." Moreover, the Albanians were practicing a "Nazi policy" of persecution of the Serbs.
These phrases are very telling. They point to the way history, even of the medieval period, will be used by all sides, but particularly the Serbs, to justify often barbaric acts, and how language will be debased during the wars in the interests of propaganda. There are indeed many beautiful Serbian monasteries in Kosovo, and it was an important center of the medieval empire. But that does not change the fact that 90 percent of the population is now ethnic Albanian, just as Hebron, in the West Bank, once a Jewish city, now has a population that is overwhelmingly Palestinian. To call these Albanians Nazis is simply to stir hatred with blind invective.
The documentary also illustrates vividly how the Croats fanned the sparks of war. Croatia's extensive arms-smuggling program before its secession from Yugoslavia in mid-1991 and the outbreak of war is explained with great frankness by the people who organized the traffic. Again, remarkable videotape made at the Hungarian border confirms the smuggling. The role of Gojko Susak, the Croatian defense minister, in starting the fighting in Eastern Slavonia by attacking a mainly Serb village with a grenade is revealed. Over all, Croatia's insensitivity to the fears of its Serb minority becomes clear.
What is less clear is the roots of these Serbian fears. There is scant allusion in the documentary to the impact on the Serbian psyche of the genocidal attack on Serbs by Croatian Fascist Ustashe forces during World War II. This was certainly a factor in the outbreak of the war in Croatia.
But Ms. Percy prefers to focus intensely on the personalities and the decisive meetings behind Yugoslavia's implosion. The agonized history of the area, the backdrop of economic depression that allowed nationalist leaders like Mr. Milosevic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to exploit resentments, the ideological vacuum that went with the fall of Communism in Europe -- all these broad issues in Yugoslav society are treated only glancingly. The result is a documentary of sometimes claustrophobic intensity but also one that might have benefited from a few more voices of ordinary people.
Still, the voices of the protagonists are amazingly revealing. Thus Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, says quite simply that 10,000 NATO troops, deployed at the start of the war, would have stopped the conflict at once. "Five thousand troops in Zvornik, five thousand in the Posavina corridor, and we Serbs were finished," he says.
But this was not about to happen. Arriving in a besieged Sarajevo in December 1992, Lord Owen, the European mediator, tells the exhausted population: "Don't, don't, don't live under this dream that the West is going to come and sort this problem out. Don't dream dreams." The disarray of the European Union and the United States before a resurgence of war in Europe is captured in these words. It was a disarray that would lead to tragedy after tragedy, culminating with the massacre of Muslims from Srebrenica last summer. In fact, the West did not get decisively involved until August 1995, when NATO embarked on a concerted bombing campaign against the Serbs: then the war was quickly ended, albeit on terms that appear tenuous.
Alija Izetbegovic, the President of Bosnia, emerges as a mild-mannered man, given to an indecisiveness that led his people into a war for which they were not prepared. One rather labored section on his capture early in the war by Serbian forces suggests how close the ragtag, Muslim-led Bosnian forces came at that moment to outright defeat.
The makers of "Death of a Nation" worked with an unusual technique. They began with a series of "research interviews" in which major themes were thrashed out and a certain familiarity established. Only some time later did they move on to filmed interviews. Often, they would ask all the people who had been present at a meeting the same question. Thus when Mr. Milosevic denied that a crucial meeting with Mr. Tudjman had taken place in 1991, a meeting in which they discussed how Bosnia would be carved up between them, the interviewers could simply tell him that Mr. Tudjman had revealed details of the meeting. Mr. Milosevic then conceded that the encounter had indeed happened.
The programs -- accompanied by a good book, "Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation," by Laura Silber and Allan Little, two of the wars' veteran journalists -- contain several scoops. Borislav Jovic, the senior aide to Mr. Milosevic, reveals how the two men decided to "pull a fast one" and arm the Serbs of Bosnia and Croatia in preparation for war. That way, Serbia's role was less clear, Mr. Jovic points out with disarming openness.
Another almost unbelievable piece of film shows the Yugoslav State Council debating in March 1991 whether to stage a military coup to stop the disintegration of the country. Gen. Veljko Kadijevic, the federal defense minister and a Serb, argues passionately for the military action, saying Croatia is leading the state to disintegration. But the cumbersome collective body, in a labored voting procedure, finally opts by a single vote to reject the coup. Seldom, if ever, has such a moment, replete with all its curious banality and intense poignancy, been revealed on camera in such a way.
Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Jovic then expected, and encouraged, General Kadijevic to act alone and stage a coup. But the general, bound by the addiction to procedure of many lifelong Communists, hesitates to override the constitution. The rest, so to speak, is history.

In Westchester, Office Space Is Less Wide Open

BYLINE: By MARY McALEER VIZARD 

 BODY:
REPORTS on the 1995 office market in Westchester County have just been issued, and brokers are sounding celebratory about an overall strengthening of the market and a greater interest in Westchester buildings from outside developers.
Three of the four reporting companies show a decrease in the county's office vacancy rate and all point to improvements, especially in downtown White Plains, which is considered a linchpin of the county's economic health. 
 In one report by Rostenberg-Doern of Purchase, the county's overall vacancy rate this year is 18.7 percent, down from 22.3 percent at the end of 1994.
"I think this year represents that our time has finally come," said John Rostenberg, principal with the firm. "For so long we've lagged behind everyone in the tri-state area. We're finally catching up."
He pointed out that Fairfield County, Conn., which has had a much faster recovery than Westchester, absorbed less space this year than Westchester. "Total absorbtion in Westchester this year was 720,000 square feet," Mr. Rostenberg said. "In Fairfield, it was 445,000."
Mr. Rostenberg attributes much of Westchester's improvement this year to Oxford Health Plans, a major managed-care company that signed a lease in the third quarter for 267,000 square feet of space in downtown White Plains.
"That deal alone represented a pickup of 14 percent of the vacancy in the entire county," Mr. Rostenberg said. "In one fell swoop, one deal can make an enormous difference." Of course, that difference was felt most keenly in the White Plains market, where the vacancy rate dropped to 26 percent this year, from 30.6 percent last year.
This is the third year in a row in which vacancy rates have dropped, according to Rostenberg-Doern. After spiking to 26.9 percent in 1993, largely because of I.B.M. consolidations, Mr. Rostenberg said, rates have declined by 8 percentage points since then. "I think people are starting to realize that Westchester has more Class A space available and better values than neighboring counties," he added.
Other reporting companies release varying figures, based on the use of different criteria. For instance, some companies include owner-occupied buildings, while others do not.
According to the Edward S. Gordon Company's White Plains office, the overall vacancy rate this year is 16.6 percent, compared with 16.8 percent last year, while Cushman & Wakefield reports a rate of 17.6 percent, down from 18.6 percent last year.
Only CB Commercial, in White Plains, reported an increase, of 23.2 percent from 22.6 percent, last year. "Due to our use of different criteria our statistics are different," said Frank Tomassulo, first vice president of CB Commercial. "But our report shows an overall strengthening of the market. For instance, there was 9 percent more leasing activity in White Plains this year than in 1994, and that's one of the most significant markets in the county."
Michael H. Siegel, executive director of Edward S. Gordon's Westchester/Fairfield office, said: "Oxford impacted the numbers as much as 3 percentage points. It's going to take another big transaction for the market to really see a rebound back to its previous levels before the downturn in the real estate market in the late 1980's and early 1990's."
EVEN though big deals are still needed for the market to fully recover, Mr. Siegel said that would not be the trend. "Westchester's market is fundamentally changed from what it had been in the boom years of the 1980's," he said. "Now it's a market made up primarily of small transactions."
Of the 431 transactions recorded by the Gordon company this year, 337 were for less than 5,000 square feet of space. And the leasing amounted to almost two million square feet without Oxford, Mr. Seigel said.
According to brokers, another sign of Westchester's recovery was the announcement this quarter of the purchase of six office buildings and a majority stake in two others by the Reckson Associates Realty Corporation, a real estate investment trust based in Melville, L.I. There was also the purchase of a vacant building by another Long Island concern and a decision by an Italian developer, SCI S.p.A., to complete construction of an office building that was stalled in 1990.
Halpern Enterprises, one of the last family-owned developers in Westchester, agreed to sell most of its office portfolio, representing 940,000 square feet, to Reckson for $83 million. The Long Island company, which was once a family-owned business, reorganized as a publicly held trust in May. Jon L. Halpern, president of Halpern Enterprises, will head up Reckson's new Westchester division.
"This is a recognition of the changing face of real estate," said Carl Austin, president of Austin Corporate Properties of White Plains, which brokered the deal. "It brings to the table an institutional presence with a pro-active entrepreneurial approach to real estate."
Mr. Austin predicts more such mergers and consolidations. "Real estate companies will continue to evolve to meet the market," he said. He also predicted the conversion of some office buildings, which have been languishing on the market. "Some could become residential condominiums," he said.
Another major deal in the fourth quarter was the purchase of 2900 Westchester Avenue, in Harrison, a 97,000-square-foot building, which had been vacant for several years. It was bought for a reported $3.6 million by the 2900 Westchester Company, of Hicksville, L.I.
The new owner plans to refurbish the building, including redesigning the lobby, building a cafeteria and doing significant rewiring, according to Jim Baranello, the company's director of operations.
He said he was hoping to attract the "high-end client," like law firms and investment companies. "We think the time is right," Mr. Baranello said. "Westchester has done a slow improvement. And we feel that many of the people who live in Westchester now and commute to Manhattan are getting sick of it. If they had the option of moving into a refurbished building that met their needs, they would."

HEADLINE: At a Riverdale Co-op, Resident Owners Take Hold

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
AS a builder, the late Alfred Kaskel never promoted his name, so it never became as familiar to the public as Levitt, Lefrak or Trump. Instead, he named his company after his daughter, Carol, and Carol Management came to be one of New York City's largest residential builders during the booming 50's and 60's. It built about 18,000 apartments in the city, in all boroughs except Staten Island, and a few thousand more in the wider metropolitan area.
But after his death in 1968 the company gradually sold these buildings, either by converting them to co-ops or by selling them to companies planning conversions. Among these was the ambitious Skyview development in northern Riverdale, built in the early 60's. Skyview consists of three 20-story buildings with 1,300 apartments and indoor parking for 1,050 cars, plus tennis courts and a freestanding health club with an outdoor pool. It stands on 32 acres of high ground along Arlington Avenue, and offers residents views up and down the Hudson River. 
 Coronet Properties bought Skyview in 1984 to convert it to a co-op, but like many others who bought at 80's prices for conversion, Coronet was forced eventually to turn back its unsold apartments to its lenders, having sold about 40 percent of them before the market collapse of the late 80's.
Last year Skyview began yet another phase in its history. The sponsor's unsold apartments went into the hands of a new investor, the debt burden on all shareholders was lightened by a restructuring of the underlying mortgage on the property, and control of the board of directors passed to the resident shareholders themselves.
Accordingly, Skyview stands now as a leading example of a major ex-rental property in the city that was a "late converter" in the 80's: it has an occupancy of 36 percent longterm rent-stabilized tenants who never bought, mixed with newcomers or former renters who did buy, plus a smattering of sublessees from the sponsor or former owner-occupants. Its major holder of unsold shares has begun to benefit from the stronger rental market. And the board is embarked on a 10-year improvement plan that it hopes will strengthen its position in the so-far dreary sales market as well.
"There is a lot of potential here if you renovate," said one recent buyer, Scott Hoenig, 38, who bought a studio apartment two years ago with his wife, Karen, for $58,000. They proceeded to spend over $6,000 in a do-it-yourself upgrade job, and now use the apartment during the week to be close to their jobs in the city. They also own a house in Pennsylvania.
Another recent buyer is Ramona Perez, who works in the credit department of a paper company in Purchase, N.Y., and bought a 19th-floor one-bedroom from the sponsor for $74,000 in May after living in the building as a renter for two years. "Since I'm paying about the same as I was when I was renting, I thought I might as well buy," she said.
It is that philosophy, common enough among apartment seekers though notably absent among people who have already lived for years in a building as regulated renters, that Benjamin Orbach is convinced will in due time build the level of resident ownership at Skyview.
Mr. Orbach is a former Bank Leumi lending officer who joined The El-Ad Group, based in Fort Lee, N.J., and backed by Israeli investors, after it acquired the unsold sponsor-held shares at Skyview. El-Ad also owns unsold apartments in other properties for a total of 2,000 throughout the metropolitan area, Mr. Orbach said.
At present, he usually rents out rather than sells his vacancies, he said, typically getting rents of $725 to $750 for studios; $950 to $1,100 for one-bedrooms; $1,250 to $1,400 for two-bedrooms; $1,450 to $1,600 for three-bedrooms, and $1,900 to $1,950 for the occasional four-bedroom.
But as rents strengthen and interest rates hold steady or decline, he says, the economic case for purchasing grows stronger. A vacant two-bedroom apartment that would rent for $1,300 a month, for example, would have a monthly maintenance charge of about $800 as a co-op.
If the $500 difference were applied to debt service rather than rent, it would "buy" a $71,000 fixed-rate co-op loan (30 years at 7 1/2 percent), or even more with an adjustable-rate loan. Every additional $100 that the buyer has available for debt service would purchase an additional $14,200 in loan.
Such an apartment might be sold by El-Ad for $90,000 to $110,000 in the current market, Mr. Orbach said. With about $20,000 to use as a down payment, the apartment seeker could own rather than rent. The buyer will lose the taxable interest that might have been earned on a bank deposit of the cash needed for the down payment, but will have gained the opportunity to recover the investment when the unit is sold. If prices rise, the buyer may find that the original investment has appreciated significantly once the loan balance is repaid.
Meanwhile, during the period of ownership, interest on the loan and on about half the monthly maintenance cost is tax-deductible, saving about $3,600 a year for the buyer of the two-bedroom apartment who is in a 30 percent bracket.
Current prices are about 20 percent lower than they were seven years ago, said Jean Morrison of Morrison Associates, who was the sales broker in most of Coronet's conversions and is still the on-site sales manager at Skyview. However, the board of directors has taken a more relaxed view about subleasing during a weak sales market than some co-op boards, so that about 8 percent of the apartments have been subleased out by people who have moved.
OF the total 1,300 apartments, 49.8 percent have been sold to individual shareholders. It is close enough to the 50 percent figure that usually opens bank doors for co-op financing to have made it easier for sellers to sell and buyers to buy, the management says. Loan availability is also important to buyers who took 10-year sponsor financing in the mid-80's and now need to refinance.
Buyers who came into the building expecting to stay for the long term naturally have the greatest stake in its future. Brian J. McCarthy, 32, who became president of the board a year ago, and his wife, Peggy, bought a one-bedroom apartment in 1989 and combined it with another one-bedroom two years ago, so they and their young daughter and son now have a three-bedroom, two-bath apartment. Mr. McCarthy estimated his total purchase and reconstruction cost at $150,000.
A burst of about 25 sales to longterm renters occurred a few years ago when banks holding unsold shares were offering bargain prices to lift the ratio of owner-occupancy and thereby make the remaining unsold shares more valuable to an investor. One of the renter buyers was Ellen Wholey, assistant principal at P.S. 8 off Mosholu Parkway, a 21-year renter who was able to buy her own two-bedroom, one-bath apartment for $49,500. The sponsor's initial prices were too high for many renters, she said. "I have no intention of moving," she said, so ownership seemed more desirable than renting.
The building has to overcome a stigma left by the unpopularity of Coronet Properties, the original sponsor, with many nonpurchasing renters before its default. It invested a reported $12 million to improve its public spaces, but it also sought to deprive renters of the use of a clubhouse on the property, the Sky Club, to which renters had long grown accustomed. A tenants committee filed a successful diminution-of-services claim with the state rent office, and a rent reduction was ordered for 400 tenants.
Eventually the case was settled, and the atmosphere has improved. "At this point we have reached a good rapport with the management and things are working pretty well," said Jeanne Seelav, president of the Skyview Tenants Association.
The principal in Coronet Properties, Norman Dansker, also was the target of a 42-count criminal indictment brought by the New York State Attorney General, alleging fraud through the concealment of essential financial information from buyers. Most of the charges were dismissed before the trial in State Supreme Court. Last March a jury acquitted him on the remaining charges.
On the management side, the Skyview board has brought in Blue Woods Management Group, headed by Donald E. Wilson, who formerly managed the property for John J. Grogan & Associates of Manhattan, and now is stationed at Skyview. "Skyview has gone through many lives, many phases," he said. "It's got financial controls now, it's making physical improvements, and it's got a strong board. I think it's on the right track."

HEADLINE: Support for Reich

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Instead of reviewing Charles A. Reich's "Opposing the System" (Nov. 26), Francis Fukuyama presented an ideological essay attacking what he views as the counterculture of the 60's and its corrosive remnants. Mr. Reich's forward-looking book argues that corporate control of our political economy is worsening and has subordinated human values to shortsighted commercialism, which has largely corporatized government in the same devolutionary direction. 
 Since Mr. Fukuyama refuses to recognize the effect of large corporations in eroding our democracy by their power of money over politics, their flight abroad over domestic labor, their maintenance of a large corporate welfare state while the social safety net for children is being torn apart and their weakening of legal systems governing the protection of workers, consumers, environment and competition in an era of giant mergers, his essay became an op-ed piece, bypassing Mr. Reich like a ship passing another in the night.
There are serious economic deprivations and abuses for which welfare mothers and other people fallen on hard times cannot be blamed. Given the gross inequalities of wealth (the top 1 percent have wealth equal to the bottom 95 percent in the United States), an unabated corporate crime wave dutifully documented in the business press and a thriving corporate welfare system, Mr. Reich sees more declining living standards for most Americans. Unless Mr. Fukuyama sees that a society rots from the head down and that corporate power needs analysis, he will never understand Mr. Reich's thesis in order to review it.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Wall St. Shedding Its Budget Blinders

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
All year, the markets blithely ignored Washington's budget histrionics.
No matter how strident the warnings -- Newt Gingrich's prediction a few weeks ago of a "market crash" if the White House failed to give way to the Republican agenda, and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin's admonition about the danger of playing political games with the debt limit and the prospect of national default -- investors just kept buying. Wall Street was convinced it understood the odd theatrics of Pennsylvania Avenue, and had seen it all before. When the table-pounding ended, investors were certain, a plan would emerge to balance the budget by early in the next millennium. 
 But somehow the market's immunity to political impasse wore off last week. When hopes of a budget deal suddenly faded on Monday, the Dow plunged 101 points. When the Federal Reserve trimmed interest rates by the slightest possible margin on Tuesday, and President Clinton and the Republicans seemed serious about talking to each other, the news touched off a 34-point rally. And when, predictably, the deal started falling apart again the next day, a selloff swept the market, followed by hourly gyrations as one side or the other snarled, feinted toward negotiating or went home for Christmas.
So what changed? Why was the market suddenly spooked? And after reacting too late, is it now overreacting?
The first change, of course, is in the market itself. Ever since the Dow broke the 5,000-point level, brokers and analysts have been poised for an excuse to sell. Now the bad-news rule is fully in effect: Bad news that everyone ignores when optimism reigns and the markets are on an upswing seems world-shattering when everyone is on edge.
The second change came in the gradual dawning on Wall Street that political negotiations in Washington for the last year have been driven by dynamics different from those at any other time in recent memory. Anybody looking merely at the figures -- a few hundred billion dollars here, a few hundred billion there -- might be tempted to think that the obvious solution is to split the difference and move on.
But this is a fight about ideology, not numbers. And in such battles, adversaries may well calculate that no deal is better than compromise. Some of Mr. Clinton's political advisers are counseling exactly that strategy.
"In my old life, I probably would not have understood what is driving this process," Mr. Rubin, a former investment banker, said the other day. "On the Street, we would have closed this deal a few weeks ago." So one way to explain the market's sudden volatility is that it has finally realized that it may have misread the political cues about the likelihood of an accord.
In strictly economic terms, investors have little to fear. Clearly, the deficit is on the way down -- it has been heading south for three years, and the Republicans are only accelerating the process. Right now, everyone is just arguing about the details.
But perceptions often trump reality in this town, so the real lesson of the week is that Republicans and Democrats can no longer squabble endlessly, confident that Wall Street will impose no external discipline on the process. Though most politicians here are loath to admit it, nothing would bring about the semblance of an agreement faster than a few hundred points of "market correction," especially in a new year in which a Congress with a shaky mandate and a President with shaky polls all face the voters.

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
Borrowing Time to Pay Back Student Loans

BYLINE: By ANNA D. WILDE 

 BODY:
JEANNETTE GALANIS was not worried freshman year when she started the process of borrowing $21,000 to attend the University of Colorado.
Nine months after her 1994 graduation, she changed her mind. She had just received her first bill, for $70, from one lender. Then she got another bill, for $50, on a different loan. Within days, two more bills from two more lenders arrived. 
 From her $17,500 annual salary, or $1,050 a month after payroll taxes, she owed a total of $325 monthly to four lenders. That was 31 percent of her take-home pay.
"I was completely panicking," said Ms. Galanis, who is 25. "I thought, 'What can I get rid of in my life that I don't need to be paying?' "
The first things to go were the vegetables. Ms. Galanis, president of the United States Student Association, a student lobbying group based in Washington, cut her grocery bill to $40 a month, eating mostly pasta and crackers. She turned down the heat in her apartment, took in extra roommates and cut out long-distance telephone calls. But she missed two payments, despite emergency loans from friends.
Desperate to avoid default, she sought to reduce her monthly payments and settled on a form of refinancing that is becoming increasingly popular with former students. Ms. Galanis consolidated her loans through the United States Department of Education, refinancing them with one large loan at a lower interest rate, but with a longer repayment schedule.
Although the consolidation will end up costing her more over the 25-year life of the loan, it allowed Ms. Galanis to send all her money to one lender and slashed her monthly payment. She now pays just $100 a month. "My parents are happy I'm now eating vegetables," she said.
As student debt loads have risen, more and more recent graduates are struggling to make heavy monthly payments, often to a confusing variety of lenders. The average amount of the most common Federal student loan grew by 41 percent, to $3,313, from 1985 to 1995, according to a report from the College Board. Education experts say the amounts have risen because of increasing college costs, a general shift from education grants to loans, and a higher ceiling on the amount of money each student can borrow.
Consolidation can ease the monthly payment burden and give students more flexibility to pay high-interest debts like those from credit cards, advisers say. It also gives breathing room to graduates who are just starting their careers.
Another benefit is less paperwork. Students can take out a different loan for each year of school, and lenders often sell those loans on the secondary market. By the time students graduate, they could owe money to several lenders. The Education Department estimates that 98,000 students consolidated Federal loans in the 1994 fiscal year, up more than fourfold from 1987.
Most lenders will consolidate Federal student loans. The Student Loan Marketing Association, known as Sallie Mae (800 524-9100), the largest servicer of those loans, is a major consolidator. The Education Department also offers a consolidation program (800 848-0982), and its interest rates are likely to be lower than at private lenders.
While consolidation can help, it can be costly. Rates may be higher for the consolidated loan because private lenders determine the new interest rate by figuring the weighted average of the smaller loans, rounded up to the next whole percentage point.
And because the term of the new loan is often longer than those of the individual loans, graduates ultimately can pay thousands of dollars more.
"The advantage is better cash flow," said Raymond D. Loewe, president of Educational Planning Systems in Marlton, N.J. "The disadvantage is that you're going to pay more over the life of the loan."
Financial aid advisers at the Stanford Law School use a computer to show students how much they will pay if they consolidate or if they keep their original loans.
"When they see the actual figures, they're like, 'There's no way I'd be willing to consolidate,' " said Ruth Burciaga, assistant director of financial aid at the law school.
Mary Erikson, a 1989 Stanford Law graduate, said she regretted not checking before she consolidated her loans.
"As soon as I did it, I wanted to slit my wrists," said Ms. Erikson, who is now 47 and a defense lawyer in Atlanta, but "I was caught between the devil and the deep blue sea."
She had borrowed about $49,000 to get her law degree, but as a low-paid public defender, she could not make the $750 monthly payments. She also had to pay off about $7,000 in high-interest credit card bills she accumulated "just to stay alive and dress" in law school. So she consolidated her loans in 1990.
Now Ms. Erikson, who went to law school after years as a newspaper reporter, is paying $620 a month on her student loan. But the lower payment has not made her finances any easier. She still cannot afford to buy a house and has fallen behind on scheduled contributions to her individual retirement account.
"I panicked," she says of her original monthly payments. With the consolidation, she will pay about $186,000 over the 25 years of the new loan. Her original loan, which would have been paid off after only 10 years, would have cost her about $90,000.
"Once I realized what I had done," she said, "I was just horrified."
MS. ERIKSON could have tried several other options besides consolidation. Financial aid advisers say debts can be restructured without the higher interest rates or the longer repayment periods that consolidations often entail. Sometimes lenders will allow students to delay payment until they are financially stable.
Borrowers who want to avoid the headache of complex repayment schedules can give lenders permission to withdraw monthly installments directly from a checking account. For a simpler overall loan structure, graduates can ask one lender to buy all their loans, merging the payments without changing the terms of any of them. In most cases, borrowers would not pay a fee for this service.
Dr. Nancy Gnizak-Wiley, an orthodontist in Coral Springs, Fla., graduated from Columbia University's dental school with about 15 different loans totaling $180,000 and two five-inch-thick folders of loan materials. "It was a whole mumbo jumbo," she said.
To simplify the payments, she brought nearly all the loans together with one lender, but did not consolidate them. Now, she makes a payment of $1,200 a month.
Whatever option borrowers choose, financial aid advisers say, they must above all avoid default, which can stain their credit ratings. The Education Department estimates that the default rate on student loans was 15 percent in 1993.
Consolidation can cost more over all, but that "is better than ruining their credit rating if they don't make the payment," said Julie L. Disa, director of financial aid services at Johns Hopkins Medical School.
Michael A. Roy, a manager at Automatic Data Processing in Boston, defaulted on some of his undergraduate loans in 1993. His interest rate went up drastically after the lender turned over the loans to a collection agency. And even while working for a New England bank, making about $30,000 a year and authorizing loans for customers, he couldn't get a credit card. Concerned, he ordered a copy of his credit report.
"The only bad thing on it," he said, "was my student loans."

These Figures Spell Good Times, Not Bad

BYLINE: By ROBERT EISNER; Robert Eisner, professor emeritus at Northwestern University and a former president of the American Economic Association, is the author of "The Misunderstood Economy: What Counts and How to Count It."

 BODY:
SOCIAL SECURITY will go bankrupt in 2030! Health care must be cut to save it! Our older citizens must sacrifice to save our children! These dire warnings are the sound bites of the day.
How much politicians and pundits offering the warnings of crisis -- and policies to meet them -- are really motivated by deficit paranoia is not all that clear. Many seem bound and blinded by an ideology that dictates that government do less and stop giving (the undeserving) the proverbial free lunch. That free lunches are not necessarily all that bad, and certainly better than no lunch at all, seems to escape them. 
 In fact, there is no need to pit young against old, or poor against rich. There can be and will be plenty for all if we just permit the economy to continue to grow at even the modest rates of the past. And if it grows more rapidly, the next generation will enjoy unparalleled prosperity while their parents and grandparents look on in the comfort they have earned.
We are frequently told that our elders must sacrifice -- by delaying retirement or accepting lower Social Security benefits -- because they will become too numerous for a relatively declining working population to meet its current commitments. A clear look at the numbers should bring all of us to reject that assertion.
It is true that the ratio of people who are 65 and older to those aged 20 to 64 is estimated to rise from 21.4 percent in 1995 to 35.5 percent in 2030, according to the middle projections of the Social Security trust fund. In other words, instead of almost five people working to support every potential retiree, there will be fewer than three.
But the more relevant figure is the ratio of the total population in the ages of dependency, including those under 20 as well as those 65 or older, to the working-age population. That ratio is also projected to rise, but only to 78.6 percent from 70.8 percent.
If the percentages of those working remain the same, that would mean that working adults would have to give up, on average, 11 percent more of their earnings to continue current support of parents or grandparents and children. Will not someone have to sacrifice? Should it be the working population, their children or their elders? Or do we have to demand sacrifice from some of the relatively better off to protect, as well as we can, those nearer the bottom?
The correct answer is none of the above. What has been ignored so far -- and in almost all public discussion -- is a simple fact of growth. Those in the working population will, indeed, have to give up a larger percentage of their incomes to support those not working. But their incomes will be so much higher that they will still have far more left than they have now.
The Clinton Administration and the Congressional Budget Office have differed in projections of the rate of growth over the next seven years, but let us take for starters the more pessimistic budget office assumption that gross domestic product, after adjustment for inflation, will increase at only 2.3 percent a year. If that rate were to continue to 2030, the total product would be more than twice what it is now, precisely 121.6 percent higher.
In that time, the population will grow from 273.08 million in 1995 to 343.13 million, an increase of 25.7 percent, again using the middle estimate of the Social Security trust fund. So the increase of total product would be almost 100 percentage points more than the increase in population. Output per person would therefore be 76.4 percent higher in that "crisis" year of 2030 than now. Every child, working person and retiree could have 76.4 percent more.
We get qualitatively similar results even with more pessimistic figures on growth. I have assumed implicitly that product per capita would grow at 1.63 percent a year. That is hardly unreasonable in light of history -- it has averaged 1.84 percent over the last 35 years.
But suppose that growth were only a feeble 1 percent a year. By 2030, output per person would then be 41.7 percent higher than now -- enough for young and old, rich and poor, to have 41.7 percent more.
Or we can make the even more pessimistic assumption that output for every working person grows 1 percent a year. That 41.7 percent increase from those working would then have to accommodate the larger proportion of nonworkers. This would reduce the available output per person in the entire population to 35.5 percent more than now.
WHY then change Social Security to force future retirees to work longer? Why reduce Social Security benefits when output is growing and there can be more for everybody? And why risk reducing the quantity or quality of health care in order to cut costs? As we grow richer, we can indeed afford more of everything.
And we can grow much richer still. More and more businessmen and economists are recognizing that our potential for growth is significantly more than 2.3 percent or 2.5 percent a year, if we do not have government policies -- budgetary or monetary -- to hold down that growth. Rather than insisting willy-nilly on budget balancing, we should invest more in the education and health of our people and have a Federal Reserve committed to full employment and maximum growth. A better future can then be better still.
Of course, John F. Kennedy's argument that "a rising tide raises all boats" is not entirely applicable. A continuing increase in the disparity of incomes, with real wages declining and the rich getting richer than ever, can dissipate the potential gains for many.
But that rising tide gives us the opportunity, and an easy opportunity, to make everyone better off. There is no good reason for anyone to be worse off as we proceed deeply into the next century. And there is no reason for people to start making themselves worse off now by sacrificing to reduce the supposed misery of their future.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: ROOSEVELT ISLAND;
Workers Detail Claims Against Suspended Officials

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
As state investigators probe the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation, several present and former employees have detailed their charges accusing two administrators of waste, theft and the use of employees for personal business.
The administrators, Barry Chafetz, the agency's vice president of operations, and Tom Sloan, director of facilities and grounds, denied the accusations. The State Division of Housing and Community Renewal has suspended them with pay, pending an inspector general's inquiry, 
 Six former and present workers gave interviews, including Mildred Rivera, who was fired recently after a year as the warehouse manager, and Kevin O'Connor, whose maintenance job was eliminated this year. The others spoke on the condition they not be identified. Among their claims:
* The officials bought hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of unneeded equipment, including a steamroller, a tractor, a ditch digger and a log splitter. In an interview, Mr. Sloan said he was saving money by getting equipment that enabled the staff to do special tasks instead of hiring costly contractors.
* Mr. Sloan, according to the employees, insisted that many of the packages delivered to the warehouse be held for him to open, and he often put them in his personal car and drove away. "They were never seen again," said Mr. O'Connor. But Mr. Sloan responded that he often delivered packages around the island and denied keeping any for himself.
* Employees renovated Mr. Chafetz's home in Queens, installing a counter top, sink, closets, wiring and a washer-dryer, and building bunk beds and an altarlike object to be taken to his synagogue. Mr. Chafetz said the work was done on weekends, and he paid for it. But one worker said nearly 20 days of the work were paid by the agency. Mr. Chafetz's associates deny that.
Ms. Rivera said that she was fired "because I knew too much, about things coming into the warehouse and how many things were going out." Mr. Sloan said she was fired for incompetence and lying about a parking violation.
Mr. Sloan attributed the charges to employees disgruntled about how he and Mr. Chafetz cracked down on the agency's unions, including the business service employees and Teamsters. "This is just malarkey to get Barry and myself out of the way," said Mr. Sloan, who has been at the agency a year and a half.
"I was hired to get the job done," Mr. Sloan said. "I found employees basically working only two or three hours a day, hiding on the island. I caught people sleeping in cars. These people literally didn't know how to do anything."

HEADLINE: Help for the Self-Employed

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Workers Out on Your Own, Unite!" (From the Desk Of, Nov. 26), Edith Rotkopf calls for the formation of a union to represent the interests of the self-employed. What she needs is a trade association. 
 Since colonial times, associations in the United States have promoted the interests of businessmen and businesswomen in every industry and profession imaginable.
Ms. Rotkopf cites specific obstacles facing the self-employed and suggests that a union could assist in overcoming those obstacles. With respect to each one, however, hundreds of associations are already providing help to their members.
For example, Ms. Rotkopf refers to the high cost of health and other insurance for the self-employed. Group health insurance programs have been a standard membership benefit offered by associations for decades. Unemployment and business interruption insurance, also advocated by Ms. Rotkopf, can likewise be obtained through an industry association. If there are enough interested members of an industry or profession, an association will provide the service.
Most important, Ms. Rotkopf wants an organization that will champion and help market the valuable services of the self-employed. Such industry promotion is the primary reason for the existence of many associations. By pooling resources, members of an industry can achieve vastly superior results, acting through an association as opposed to acting individually.
But these are just a few functions of trade associations. Other important tasks include lobbying, establishing codes of ethics, setting professional standards, collecting and disseminating data on industry practices and market trends, and educating customers and suppliers about important competitive issues.

HEADLINE: Retraining America Isn't Impossible Job

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "American Inequality: Its History and Scary Future" (Op-Ed, Dec. 19), Benjamin Schwarz estimates the cost of reversing the slide toward inequality by upgrading people's skills at $170 billion a year, a "politically impossible" price. 
 The estimate derives from a calculation by Prof. James Heckman of the University of Chicago, who sought to determine, based on data about income gains from additional education and job training, the cost of reducing inequality back to its 1979 level.
Because Professor Heckman's estimate included the cost to individuals of forgone income while gaining new skills, the direct cost to Government would be much smaller -- in the range of $60 billion a year. Still huge, but politically impossible?
The sum is less than a third of what families and companies spend annually on the postsecondary education and training of our economic elite.
It is less than the Federal Government's annual burden of "corporate welfare" -- tax breaks and unwarranted subsidies for particular companies and industries -- as estimated by think tanks across the political spectrum.
Political possibilities may seem limited these days, but dedicating $60 billion a year to restoring America's culture of opportunity is hardly out of reach.

HEADLINE: Mexico Still Lags on Democratic Reforms

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re Thomas L. Friedman's Dec. 17 column on Mexico: 
 While commendable that Raul Salinas de Gortari, the former President's brother, is in prison for allegedly masterminding an assassination and now for inexplicable enrichment, he is still the only one being prosecuted for such crimes by President Ernesto Zedillo.
Each recent Mexican administration has had one scapegoat at the beginning to "prove" that the new president was breaking with the dishonesty of the past. But after high-profile convictions, operating above the law continued to be a way of life.
Neither the Mexican judicial system, social security, the congress nor the electoral process has experienced the reform needed to meet First World democratic standards. Economic policy hasn't changed a bit -- President Zedillo was an architect of President Salinas's discredited "economic miracle."
It is questionable whether Mr. Zedillo himself is committed to reform. He has been part of the system and has benefited from it for a long time.
Dimetrio Sodi de la Tijera, formerly of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and now an independent, revealed this year that the president has discretion to disburse one-third of all funds the government takes in -- without accountability. This "presidentialism" has yet to be addressed by Mr. Zedillo.
Mr. Friedman is right: Americans must care. Their future is tied to Mexico's progress or the lack of it.

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
How Movies Fade Out on Politics

BYLINE: By CARYN JAMES 

 BODY:
"WHITE MAN'S BURDEN" is a muddled movie that thinks it's about race though it's really about class. Set in an America in which the black majority lords it over the white minority, this role-reversal story has a vision of race relations so schematic and outdated it barely connects to reality. Harry Belafonte plays the representative black man, wealthy and elegant. John Travolta is the typical, unemployed, uneducated white man who kidnaps him. If black means white, then this film suggests a world in every Caucasian lives in a mansion and there are no Colin Powells or Johnnie Cochrans.
 
Lines Between the Lines
 Yet buried deep in the film is a single scene with a chilling ring of truth. "So you lost your job, tough luck!" the Belafonte character yells at the white man. "Get another one! You blame everybody in the whole world but yourself!" In life only the politically suicidal would express it so bluntly, yet that explosion reflects the hidden anger politicians appeal to when they suggest that social services should be cut. With its class conflict seeping in almost accidentally, "White Man's Burden" is a prime example of the timid way that politics is revealed in current movies: through subplots, chance remarks and the potent issues the films choose to avoid. 
 There are obvious reasons for this pussyfooting around. A typical two-year gestation period from script to screen makes true topicality impossible, and the fear of offending a mainstream audience is strong.
But there is something less practical going on. Even the most overt political films, like "The American President" and "Nixon," avoid strong statements because they have been shaped in a climate of confusion and pessimism. The political atmosphere they inadvertently reflect is one in which there is little consensus about foreign policy, little hope of reducing crime, few heroes or villains for a movie to cling to. It turns out that movies, today more than ever, are most realistic about politics in the backhanded way they echo Americans' bewilderment.
In reality the average person can't tell the difference between the Bosnians and the Serbs, and Congress half-heartedly approves sending American troops to Bosnia. This perplexity emerges on screen as nostalgia for the clear-cut days of the cold war, when the Soviets were the bad guys. "Crimson Tide," one of last summer's hits, is set in the present yet offers a tortured plot that pits American nuclear weapons against Russian ones. The new James Bond film, "Goldeneye," so desperately needs the cold war that it actually has a prologue set in the bad old U.S.S.R., introducing the Soviet villains who even now haunt Bond as Russian villains. Conservative law-and-order attitudes and rampant hero-worship invade all films based on Tom Clancy novels.
Liberal political films are just as wary as conservative ones. In Rob Reiner's "The American President," the widowed President (Michael Douglas) is a Clinton-like Democrat who romances an environmental lobbyist (Annette Bening). When he is forced to choose between an environmental protection bill and a vague "crime bill" (he can't win both), the movie makes it clear that the honorable choice is to keep his promise to the lobbyist with whom he's sleeping.
 
Age of Diminished Heroes
 In this fiction, signing the environmental bill will reduce pollution drastically, though it will cost the President support from Congress and big business. The film hands its President a problem with a definite solution, and a political price that makes him seem heroic. It depicts an easy movie choice as a tough realistic one.
But it's impossible to imagine any easy, clear-cut solution to crime, even in fiction, so "The American President" frames this crucial issue as a dispensable one, first giving it equal weight with the environment and then pushing it off to the margins. The film's strongest fairy-tale element isn't its romance but the unbelievable proposition that the President will clean up the environment today and come back with an even better crime bill tomorrow. (Like the new improved health care bill promised when the last one failed?)
Crime, however, seems such an inherent part of American life that a film like "Heat" casually suggests there is no moral difference between a cop (Al Pacino) and the master thief he's pursuing (Robert De Niro). In terms of audience sympathy, the movie presents a level playing field, and Mr. De Niro's more controlled, subtle performance makes it easier to root for the robber than the cop. Movie audiences have always responded to sympathetic crooks, of course, but rarely has a good cop carried so little moral authority.
Films that address political issues head-on usually go against the grain; that's their reason for being. Tim Robbins's "Dead Man Walking" (opening Dec. 29), with Sean Penn as a murderer on death row, takes a strong stand against the death penalty at a time when more states are reinstating it and carrying out executions. But such a pointed political film is an oddity these days.
Even the most conspicuous political film of the year is most convincing in the messages it sends inadvertently. In many interviews, Oliver Stone has compared his Nixon character to a Shakespearean tragic figure. Yet the film's simplistic psychology -- Nixon was unloved and went to the wrong college -- reduces politics to the machinations of a pathetic, puny personality. That's an acceptable message for an age of diminished heroes.
Another reason for the film's hollowness becomes apparent only at the end, when the movie cuts to news tape of Richard Nixon's funeral, with all the living Presidents attending. That one glimpse is more revealing than the previous 3 1/4 hours. It suggests that Oliver Stone doesn't need to humanize Nixon. History has already started.

HEADLINE: CLINTON PREDICTS A PACT ON BUDGET WILL BE REACHED

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23

 BODY:
President Clinton predicted today that an agreement would be reached on a seven-year plan to balance the budget, saying, "I am confident we can end this impasse."
But a 67-page working document used in the negotiations and made available today reflected hundreds of disagreements that participants acknowledged could not be resolved in a matter of days. 
 In his weekly radio speech today, Mr. Clinton said, "Our talks are making progress," and he maintained that both sides shared the goal of "reaching an agreement as soon as possible." The Government has now been partly shut down for eight days, with 280,000 Federal workers furloughed, but there was no work on the budget talks in the Capital today.
Without any of the harsh words the two sides have exchanged for most of last week, Mr. Clinton did urge Congress to reopen agencies to end the financial and emotional turmoil not only for the furloughed employees, but for 460,000 more employees with emergency status who are working but not getting paid.
Lower level staff talks are to resume on Wednesday, and Mr. Clinton will meet Republican leaders on Friday. But most members of Congress have left town with no expectation of being needed here before Jan. 3.
The cold reality of what lies before negotiators was shown in the document made public today, which showed side-by-side comparisons of their plan with an alternative offered by conservative House Democrats and another reflecting Administration views, all assembled by the Republican staff of the House Budget Committee.
The paper reflected both grand and picayune differences. There is the choice between a Republican Medicare plan, with "savings" of $132.7 billion over seven years and an Administration plan, with "savings" of $37.5 billion. But there are more lines of print devoted to different plans for selling off the nation's helium reserve that would save either $47 million (Republican) or $23 million (Administration) over seven years, sums that have almost no impact on whether the budget is balanced but considerable impact on a small, profitable industry.
The document describes some proposals, like an earlier date the Administration urged for cost of living adjustments on military pensions, as costs because they would increase the deficit. But the 20 pages devoted to comparing tax cut proposals speak only in terms of "tax relief," not "costs."
The Administration has not presented its own side-by-side set of comparisons, but may do so next week. For the moment, negotiators have only one slightly tilted set of comparisons to work from, not two.
The official Republican answer to the President's radio address was meant to be low-key, since it was delivered by a second-term House member, Representative Ron Lewis of Kentucky, who has no role in the budget discussions.
Mr. Lewis complained that the President has yet to propose a plan that would balance the budget in seven years. He said Republicans asked the President to negotiate in good faith, and he called the effort to balance the budget "a historic struggle, perhaps our last great chance to stop robbing our children."
And though he accused Mr. Clinton of saying one thing two years ago, when he urged restraints on Medicare spending, and another today when he called the Republicans extremists for doing the same thing, his tone was generally mild.
Similarly, Mr. Clinton's description of his priorities today was low key. He said, "We have to balance the budget in a way that reflects our most fundamental values: increasing opportunity, asking everyone to assume responsibility, strengthening our families and the economy, and recognizing the duty we owe to each other, to our parents, our children and those who need and deserve our help."
But the seasonal amelioration of rhetoric does not remove the main obstacles to an agreement. The first is distrust. Many Republicans do not believe the President really wants a seven-year agreement on a balanced budget, and cite as evidence his failure to offer such a proposal as calculated by the Congressional Budget Office.
On the other hand, the Administration, many House Democrats, and Senators of both parties doubt the commitment of House Republicans to the sort of give and take any compromise will require. They cite the House's refusal to pass temporary spending bills that would reopen closed Government offices as evidence of a fatal rigidity.
As recently as Tuesday, both Senator Bob Dole and Speaker Newt Gingrich spoke of finishing a budget by Dec. 31. "We'd like to get it done with a budget by the end of this year," Mr. Dole said. Going further, Mr. Gingrich said, "There is an agreement that we will get this done by the end of the year." And at a Republican caucus, after being asked whether members should plan to stay, even if they had bought nonrefundable airplane tickets for a family vacation, Mr. Gingrich dismissed the faint-hearted, saying "Anyone not willing to tear up a ticket to balance the budget doesn't belong here."
By Friday, a different note was being sounded. Representative Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, chairman of the Appropriations Committee paraphrased Winston Churchill and proclaimed to the House: "We will never, never, never give in. We will stay here till Doomsday."
Of course, Congress left town within a few hours, in recognition that the end was not in reach. For, as the side-by-side comparison makes clear, the differences are not just in the numbers.
For example, when the Republican staff put the comparison together, they used quotation marks just once in 67 pages -- in a sarcastic reference to the President's proposal for more volunteers for Americorps, his prized national service program.

HEADLINE: Road Near Rain Forest Of Panama Creates Rift

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Over the objections of several senior Administration officials, the United States Army is embarking on a training exercise that will build a gravel road into the buffer zone protecting one of the most spectacular rain forests in Latin America, raising concerns among environmentalists about potential damage.
The Army's Southern Command has scheduled the exercise in the lush Valle del Risco in Panama to teach several thousand National Guardsmen and Army reservists how to construct roads during their annual duty training next year. The Army has already spent $3 million preparing for the exercise. It will cost another $2.2 million to ship National Guard engineers and heavy construction equipment to Panama. 
 The Panamanian project, part of a United States Army civic assistance operation for 1996 called New Horizons, has prompted protests by Timothy E. Wirth, the Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs, and Brian Atwood, the administrator of the Agency for International Development. This week they sent a joint memorandum to Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, asking that the project be blocked until a comprehensive assessment could be made of its environmental impact.
Unless a decision is made to cancel the project, the road will be built.
"It's probably received more reviews than any project in the history of the State Department," said William J. Hughes, the United States Ambassador to Panama, who supports the project. He said the road would alleviate the poverty and mortality rate of the valley's native inhabitants, who are Guaymi Indians.
The Panamanian Government first approached the United States Agency for International Development for assistance, but was twice rejected because it fell short of American-recognized environmental standards. Panama's President, Ernesto Perez Balladares, then turned to the Southern Command with a personal appeal, an American official said, to fulfill a campaign promise to build the road, which lies in his home district.
The current dirt track ends at Risco, a rural village two miles inside the Palo Seco Forest Reserve, which forms a natural buffer zone for La Amistad International Park, a pristine wilderness of mist-shrouded peaks and lush jungle straddling the frontier between Panama and Costa Rica. The park encompasses what is described as the largest undisturbed cloud forest in Latin America, with as many as 40 percent of its plants and animals not found elsewhere.
The new road would not encroach on La Amistad wilderness itself. But environmental experts for Conservation International and the National Resources Defense Council fear it would increase the risk of environmental degradation. Moreover, squatters could move in more easily, and clear the forest.
The Panamanian Government would like to incorporate part of the 7 1/2-mile road into a longer 46-mile highway it has been trying to build since 1983 from Almirante, a town on the Caribbean coast, to the oil-producing area of Chiriqui Grande.
Ambassador Hughes said the new road would alleviate Risco's inadequate health care, which is reflected in an infant mortality rate exceeding 40 percent, and open access to better schools and markets. He said the local governor promised to keep out squatters. The valley's indigenous population is estimated at 2,000 to 5,000 people.
In their internal memorandum, a copy of which was made available by other officials, Mr. Wirth and Mr. Atwood said the road did not qualify for funds from the Agency for International Development for lack of an internationally recognized environmental assessment.
Congressional legislation covering civilian agencies like A.I.D. makes the protection of tropical forests and biodiversity a priority in dispensing foreign aid. The Defense Department is covered by a different executive order that permits the application of local environmental laws if the host country is actively involved.
Capt. Chris Yates, of the Army's Southern Command, said the Panama Government did its own environmental assessment and concluded that the new road would have "minimal to no impact." The representatives of the Agency for International Development remained opposed.
Mr. Wirth, the State Department's ranking official on environmental issues, and Mr. Atwood, who supervises American civilian assistance to foreign countries, requested on Nov. 13 that the project be delayed.
"This remains our recommendation," the latest memo said. "In fact, our misgivings about this project have grown in the past month."
Their memo to Mr. Talbott said that "the environmental implications for the Valle del Risco and the region are even greater than previously envisioned."
Captain Yates described the road-building project as an "engineer and medical readiness field-training exercise" scheduled from January through June 1996, bringing in up to 6,000 National Guardsmen and reservists from 17 states.
Captain Yates said the Panamanian Government did its own environmental assessment and concluded that the new road would have "minimal to no impact."
But Mr. Wirth and Mr. Atwood said that any assessment must be comprehensive and internationally recognized.

HEADLINE: With Harlem at a Crossroad, Visions for Economic Future Diverge

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY and JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
The Rev. Lawrence E. Lucas, a priest at Our Lady of Lourdes Roman Catholic Church in Harlem, harbors an ideal vision for his neighborhood's economic lifeline, 125th Street. Salsa and rhythm-and-blues would sound from busy storefronts, the aromas of curried goat and shrimp-and-rice stew would spice the air -- and the merchants would be almost exclusively black and Hispanic.
C. Virginia Fields, the City Councilwoman for most of Harlem, imagines a more homogeneous environment. People would come from all over, not just Harlem, to enjoy a lunch of smothered chicken at Sylvia's Restaurant, browse at a Barnes & Noble outlet, buy a Senegalese carving and stop at the Gap before heading home. 
 The Harlem community has been in the throes of self-examination since a black gunman burned down a white-owned clothing store on 125th Street two weeks ago, killing himself and seven others in what the police said was a racially motivated attack. What many residents said they are finding, beneath the surface, are questions that center less on race than on the differing expectations for Harlem's commercial future.
In the weeks before the fire, a black merchant being pressured to move by a white, Jewish store owner helped stage protests that witnesses said turned anti-Semitic at times. But the protests outside Freddy's clothing store also seemed to tap into a more prevalent sentiment: If black merchants cannot earn a living in predominantly black Harlem, where can they look to get ahead?
Derek Q. Johnson, the acting president of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation, said that Harlem's economic condition -- reflected best by 125th Street -- was at the root of other heated episodes in the neighborhood's history, including the city's confrontations with illegal street vendors in 1992 and 1994.
"It is a community from which lots of the economic foundation has left and where jobs, particularly at the local level, are at a dearth," Mr. Johnson said. "The combination of those factors makes for a very tense environment around questions of economic development and economic growth."
Indeed, the community's economic structure is on the verge of even more debate, now that the Federal Government has designated greater Harlem, along with the South Bronx, as an Empowerment Zone. Touted as the largest renewal project in upper Manhattan's history, the zone will receive $300 million in public money over the next decade to bolster social services, finance education programs and spur economic development through job training, loans and business partnerships.
Although the program will not begin until early next year, its directors said they are questioned daily by fledgling and would-be entrepreneurs eager to submit applications. How that money is spent -- and whose businesses will benefit -- will be closely watched in Harlem, officials said, for it will determine the neighborhood's future.
There is strong support in some quarters for a Harlem commerce dominated by black and Hispanic merchants. Some residents and business owners, saying Harlem should be as true to its ethnicity as other communities controlled by particular ethnic groups, cited two Brooklyn neighborhoods as examples: Bensonhurst, predominantly Italian, and Williamsburg, predominantly Jewish.
"In terms of commercial enterprise," said Father Lucas, a former vice chairman of Community Board 10, which covers central Harlem, the area "should be 90 percent owned, operated and controlled by people of color."
But others, particularly the community's business and political leaders, said such visions are both unrealistic and counterproductive to any revitalization effort. Barbara Askins, executive director for the 125th Street Business Improvement District, said that without "anchor stores" like the Gap and Home Depot, Harlem residents would "go downtown or to New Jersey."
"We have to look at the overall participation of minorities and stop focusing on the one issue of store ownership," she said. "We don't want it so that African Americans are locked out. We want local minority entrepreneurship as well as the large anchors to pull in the traffic. One cannot be without the other."
Finding the proper balance in Harlem is a complicated task, as the city's 1994 application for Empowerment Zone designation acknowledged: "Harlem is viewed as the cultural capital of African Americans, internationally renowned for its people and their contributions to politics, literature, music, dance, sports and art."
The application continued: "It is also viewed as a dangerous place, the 'inner city,' the metaphor for urban America, the place where social pathology abounds. This duality gives Harlem its special character of opportunity and problems. Residents know both."
According to the 1990 census, 87 percent of the nearly 100,000 residents in central Harlem are black, and 10 percent are Hispanic. The annual median household income is $13,252, less than half the citywide figure of $29,283. The city's unemployment rate at the time was 9.3 percent for men, 8.7 percent for women; in central Harlem, it was 22.3 percent for men, 13.7 for women.
Although there are encouraging signs of vitality along 125th Street -- from established black businesses to Body Shop, Foot Locker and Strawberry outlets -- the neighborhood's commercial picture remains distressed. According to the Empowerment Zone application, most of the neighborhood's stores offer "a limited range of goods," prompting as many as 70 percent of its residents to shop elsewhere for clothes, gifts, electrical appliances and furniture. And as of 1994 central and east Harlem had more than 1 million square feet of vacant commercial space.
An element not referred to in the Empowerment Zone application was that of race. For decades most buildings on 125th Street were white-owned, and the stores white-operated. Today, there are more black merchants -- the 125th Street BID estimates that 158 of 322 businesses between Fifth Avenue and Frederick Douglass Boulevard are black-owned -- but resentment lingers over the sense of a business culture in the grasp of a white, absentee group.
This year, a dispute arose over a plan to build a Pathmark supermarket on a vacant, city-owned lot on 125th Street in east Harlem. The plan was bitterly opposed, principally by Hispanic merchants who argued that the giant store would endanger the more than 200 bodega owners in the area. In the end, the city approved the supermarket plan.
And last year, the Giuliani administration forcibly removed illegal street vendors from the thoroughfare, to the delight of many merchants and to the dismay of some who thought the peddlers turned the street into a bustling bazaar. To this day, the remnants of those vendors continue to stage sporadic demonstrations, often against white-owned businesses; they participated in the angry protests in front of Freddy's in the weeks before the clothing store was destroyed by fire. Their rallying cry is "Buy black."
"There is a legitimate feeling in the community that the opportunities for many residents here is blocked," said Joseph Haslip, a Democratic Party district leader in Harlem. "And many people feel that their access -- and the access of black people in general -- is blocked by certain forces in the community who represent the interests of big money. And that continues to create tension and resentment."
A manifestation of that tension could be found last week. Beneath the Christmas garland strung over 125th Street, several police cars idled in front of a few white- and Korean-owned stores that have received racially charged threats. The police said they did not know whether the threats were anything more than harassing.
Many Harlem leaders and residents said they were outraged by such incidents, describing them as isolated. But they said such episodes demonstrate the need for more communication between those with disparate views on how their community should be developed.
"What's needed now is a bridging of the gap between the two extremes," said Mr. Johnson of the Empowerment Zone.
Lloyd A. Williams, president and chief executive of the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce, agreed. "We need the people who are going to be impacted by the development plans to have input," he said. "The community board plays a critical role. But the community board, as well as the elected officials and the BID, need to become more inclusive and start talking to each other."
The goal of inclusion is more than politically correct chatter, residents said. Shortly after the deadly fire at Freddy's, Harlem's political leaders held a news conference to denounce the violence and to encourage shoppers to support 125th Street merchants. Two hours later, many of Harlem's church leaders held their own news event in which they defended the right to peaceful protests against injustice -- and expressed support for the Rev. Al Sharpton, who had figured in at least one of the protests.
"Some of us are more interested in an agenda of social change," Mr. Sharpton said. "Some, at the other press conference, are more concerned about business development."
"Many of us come from different traditions," he continued. "And until we can reconcile the two, these tensions are likely to continue."

HEADLINE: At Two Harlem Stores, Same Battle to Survive

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
John Baynes looked out on the snow falling hard on Harlem. It has been a tough year for business on 125th Street, he said, the toughest in a string of many tough years.
Down the street, Arthur Rosen also studied the snow. No question, he said, his thick forearms resting on a microwave stand for sale, this has been the toughest year of all. 
 Mr. Baynes, who is black, and Mr. Rosen, who is white, share more than a ZIP code. Both men are in their early 50's. Both inherited businesses from hard-working fathers. And both have spent more than three decades trying to make a living on 125th Street, the Harlem thoroughfare that sometimes seems richer in history than in reality.
But it is the differences separating the merchants of 125th Street, not their similarities, that have been the focus of attention since Dec. 8. On that day, in what police say was a racially motivated attack, a black gunman stormed a store owned by a white man on 125th Street, killing himself and seven others in a rain of bullets and fire.
Last week, Mr. Baynes and Mr. Rosen shared reflections on what business life is like on 125th Street, reflections shaded in part by race. But Mr. Baynes spoke for both when he said: "It's a constant fight. A constant battle."
The Rosen family has been selling in Harlem since 1938. The last 35 years have been at Bargain World, at 8 West 125th Street. In the mid-1960's, Arthur Rosen joined the business founded by his father, Abe. He stocked shelves, made deliveries, installed linoleum over the tired floors of Harlem tenements. The store did well enough to endure economic vagaries and neighborhood unrest.
But in November 1980, the business came close to collapse when an electrical fire gutted the underinsured store. Weeks later, the two Rosens were mugged in front of Bargain World; Arthur Rosen was shot and his elderly father was pistol-whipped.
"It was my decision to stay," said Arthur Rosen, who is 51. "I had a burned-out building that the family owned in the middle of Harlem and a business that had supported us all these years. So we put it all back together again."
Now the store has 25,000 square feet of retail space, almost 50 black and Hispanic employees and a reputation for largess to civic groups and churches. Its owner is ubiquitous, guiding his broad frame through narrow aisles packed with televisions and ceramic elephants, kitchen sets and portraits of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
But the bustle belies what Mr. Rosen calls "the toughest Christmas and the toughest year since I've been in business." He pointed to the day after the deadly fire at the white-owned clothing store, when protesters stood in front of Bargain World and promised to drive the store out of the neighborhood.
A week later, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani led a gaggle of aides and reporters on a shopping trip to 125th Street. He stopped at several stores, including Bargain World, where he spent $32.40 on Christmas lights and two Santa Claus dolls. "It was another show of faith by the city," Mr. Rosen said. "It was a positive approach to a negative time in 125th Street's life."
The day of the Mayor's visit, John Baynes watched as the entourage, awash in camera lights, passed by his store window.
"By virtue of him being in a black community, I could see him telling the white stores that 'you belong here and we want you to stay here,' " Mr. Baynes recalled. "But on the other hand, he didn't stop here and say, 'Mr. Baynes, you've been here 30 years and I want to thank you.' "
For three decades, the Baynes family has run Theresa Fashions, a clothing store for "mature women" at 252 West 125th Street. The shop embodies a family work ethic established 50 years ago by Milton Baynes, an emigre from the West Indies who worked long days and nights as a presser.
By the early 1950's, he had saved enough money to open two women's apparel stores in Brooklyn. In the mid-1960's, disturbances on the streets of Harlem prompted a white store owner on 125th Street to put his business up for sale. Milton Baynes bought the business, which he passed on to his son, John.
John Baynes, 53, is proud of working in Harlem. Years ago he encouraged a local artist to see the forbidding steel of the store's riot gates as a canvas; soon the likeness of a magnolia was blossoming there. Now the gate bears a mural of famous world monuments.
But Mr. Baynes said that festive paintings belie the struggles inside, particularly for black-owned businesses that do not get enough support from black consumers. "I have customers who will come in saying they need a special dress that they can't find anywhere else," he said. "They'll use me as a last resort to find it, and I'll spend a lot of time in the market, shopping, until I find it.
"What I feel is that if the community wants to keep black businesses healthy and active, go to them first! Give your black proprietors a first crack at it."
On this snowy morning, few customers came to the 1,500-square-foot store, which Mr. Baynes rents from a white landlord with a midtown business address. The unwelcome quiet allowed him time to share sometimes conflicting emotions.
He said he did not support boycotts, including those that were sought by protesters against Freddy's and Bargain World. But he admitted to yearning for a stronger black presence on 125th Street.
Mr. Baynes said he tried not to see business on 125th Street in terms of color, but he could not shake a sense of opportunities lost. "The strip went from being Jewish to Korean, without the blacks getting a handful of it," he said.
He holds the community's black leaders partly responsible for the plight of the street's black merchants. "Not one of my politicians has been inside my store in the 27 years I've been here," he said. "Not one."
A few days after the fire at Freddy's, Mr. Rosen and Mr. Baynes engaged in a mild debate on a local radio show. Several days later, they met for the first time and talked, as Mr. Rosen put it, about "how terrible it was what happened on the street."
Then the two merchants returned to their stores, where business is off like no other Christmas. Outside their windows, the snow continued to fall. And the people on 125th Street struggled to keep their balance.

HEADLINE: Overture to Damascus

 BODY:
First came a striking public overture to Damascus by Israel's new Prime Minister, Shimon Peres. That was followed up by some helpful high-level American message carrying. On the Syrian side, President Hafez el-Assad recognized the risks of waiting too long to help shape the pattern of regional peace.
So now, the long-stalled talks between Israel and Syria are set to resume this week in Maryland with a more ambitious agenda, higher-level participation and new hope for progress. Expectations of an Israeli-Syrian breakthrough have been raised before only to be disappointed. This time real progress may be possible. 
 Mr. Peres signaled a significant change in Israeli negotiating strategy when he appealed to President Assad to help bring about a comprehensive regional settlement. It is the right moment for a new initiative.
Mr. Peres's slain predecessor, Yitzhak Rabin, was inclined to let the Israeli public digest the new accords with the Palestine Liberation Organization and Jordan while he proceeded with unhurried negotiations with Syria, narrowly focused on details of territory and security. President Assad, for his part, had seemed determined to burnish his credentials as an Arab leader by resisting the kind of step-by-step bargaining with Israel that has been successively embraced by Anwar el-Sadat, Yasir Arafat and King Hussein.
Mr. Peres now invites Mr. Assad to assert his leadership in the cause of peace. Details to insure Israeli security while the Golan Heights are returned to Syria remain as indispensable as ever. But Damascus may find these easier to accept if negotiations are expanded to include issues of development, trade and regional cooperation. This would cast Syria in the flattering role of a bargainer for the broader Arab community rather than that of a humiliated petitioner for the return of lost territory.
Mr. Peres's idea of peace has long been premised on giving all countries a positive stake in reaping the potentially great rewards of economic cooperation instead of merely erecting new trip wires to provide adequate warning time in the event of renewed military conflict.
Mr. Peres's approach makes sense, building as it does on the already rapidly expanding web of agreements between Israel and other Arab states. But it can only succeed if Syria responds with imagination and good faith. The first signs are encouraging. Mr. Peres's appeal drew a quick and positive Syrian reply.
The deepening of peace on Israel's other frontiers, demonstrated by the presence of Arab leaders at Mr. Rabin's funeral, may have prodded Mr. Assad to re-examine his strategy. Israel's new peace treaty with Jordan and the negotiated transfer of West Bank cities to Palestinian self-rule put pressure on Damascus to reach a favorable agreement before its leverage evaporates.
Agreement with Syria, which also controls Lebanon's foreign policy, would at last give Israel peace on every border and open up exciting possibilities of regional cooperation in economic development, medical care and use of scarce water resources that would benefit tens of millions of people.
Syria can serve its own interests and ambitions by bringing an equally positive vision to the negotiating table when this week's talks get under way.

Buchanan For President

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: DES MOINES, IOWA

 BODY:
So I've made up my mind for 1996. I'm voting for Pat Buchanan. Really.
Well, not really. But of all the Presidential candidates, Mr. Buchanan is clearly the most interesting. It is he who has diagnosed what's troubling Americans these days -- the impact of the global economy and rapid technological change on their lives and communities, and the failure of traditional Republicans or Democrats to deal with it. 
 It is summed up in a question that you can hear all over America: If the economy is doing so well, why have I just been downsized out of a job and why do I feel like my community is eroding? AT&T's stock soars and it announces plans to buy out 77,800 middle managers. The Cleveland Browns move to Baltimore, despite selling out every home game for decades to a loyal Cleveland community, because the team needs a stadium that produces more revenue. Average U.S. wages grew last year by the smallest amount on record -- 2.7 percent. All this produces what Labor Secretary Robert Reich calls "a profound sense that economic forces are out of control -- that neither hard work nor general economic improvement will lead to higher incomes."
It does lead, though, to Buchananism. Give ole Pat credit. While other candidates are talking in abstractions about "balanced budgets," Mr. Buchanan is painting a vivid picture for people, explaining why they feel insecure: It is because Mexicans working for 50 cents an hour have taken their jobs, "faceless bureaucrats in Geneva" at the World Trade Organization are telling them how to run their communities and the combination of the two is eroding their workplace, American values, families and neighborhoods. While recently touring Iowa, Mr. Buchanan told The New York Times that he would much rather preserve family farms than see them give way to more efficient conglomerates, even though this might mean higher food prices. "I don't worship the market system," he said. "I don't worship at the altar of efficiency."
But while Mr. Buchanan has properly diagnosed our anxiety, his prescription -- raising walls of protectionism and anti-immigration -- will lead only to economic ruin and a politics of resentment.
So who has the answer? It certainly isn't the Dole-Gingrich Republicans, argued the Harvard University political theorist Michael J. Sandel, whose forthcoming book, "Democracy's Discontent," deals with this issue. "The traditional Republicans are uncritical advocates of the free market, free trade and the global economy and at the same time they pose as advocates of community and family values," says Mr. Sandel. "But it is precisely unfettered markets which are now most responsible for the breakdown of community and traditional values. Walmart, not big government, is responsible for the demise of Main Street across America. But most Republicans won't face up to that contradiction."
Mr. Clinton has one right prescription, which is investing more in job training and education, as we opt for more free trade agreements, to enable Americans to better compete in the global market. But that's not enough to blunt Buchananism, because Mr. Buchanan is not just giving voice to people's economic fears, argues Mr. Sandel. He is also giving voice to their fear that they are losing the moral anchors in their lives. When Mr. Buchanan says our schools no longer teach right from wrong, that our nation can't control its borders and that patriotism is giving way to multiculturalism, he strikes a popular chord.
"What makes this moment so volatile is the fact that the global economy and technology have not just disrupted the economic foundation of people's lives and left them feeling powerless," says Mr. Sandel. "These same changes have also created an environment in which people feel that from family to neighborhood to nation, the moral fabric of their lives, and our sense of belonging to a particular place with a shared civic life, is unraveling around us. These two fears -- the loss of economic security and the erosion of a sense of community -- together define the anxiety of our time."
Because he has tapped into that anxiety Mr. Buchanan is winning voters' trust, but for policies that promote hate and division. President Clinton's challenge is to tap into those same feelings in order to win voters' trust for policies that not only make good economic sense, but can also bind us together.

A Special Christmas Feast, Without the Shopping

BYLINE: By Nelson Bryant 

DATELINE: WEST TISBURY, Mass.

 BODY:
There are still touches of green in our snow-draped vegetable garden here on Martha's Vineyard -- leeks, kale, carrots, turnips, parsnips and next fall's garlic -- reminding me that savoring what we have grown or gathered is one of our happiest Christmastime rituals.
Christmas Eve dinner for the two of us will include a black duck I shot in Town Cove a few days ago, a turnip bigger than a softball prized from its bed of straw in the frozen earth, a parsnip as thick as a man's wrist from the same place, wild rice -- a gift from a Minnesota friend -- and a buttercup squash that was stashed with others of its kind in the coldest room in the house in late fall. 
 In other years, the turnip would have been boiled and mashed, but we recently discovered that thin strips of raw turnip, particularly one that has been left in the ground through a few frosts, are crisp and sweet in a salad. The parsnip will be cut in quarter-inch cross sections and baked for a half-hour or so after being coated with orange juice, brown sugar and butter; its nut-like flavor goes well with wild game, especially waterfowl.
This privileged intimacy with what we eat is cause for rejoicing, whether it is vegetables from the garden, the black duck taken as it made its vertical leap from the pool where 60 years ago my boyhood chum Beany Alley hooked and lost the largest sea-run brook trout I have ever seen, or the nine-point Adirondack buck that on a morning of new-fallen snow this past November stared at me from between two trees 135 yards away in the forest. I wouldn't have seen the animal were it not for the marvelous eyes of my friend and guide, Basil Cheney, and when we dine on the buck I give thanks to the animal, to Basil, to my Adirondack host, Joseph Cullman 3d, and to the gods of the hunt. I have no such rapport with a roast from the A & P.
Our holiday meal will be preceded by 20 oysters grilled on the half shell after being sprinkled with seasoned bread crumbs and dotted with butter. Ruth and I harvested a bushel of them from Tisbury Great Pond earlier this month, taking advantage of a calm, sunny day to go in our canoe to the pond's barrier beach where the bivalves would be at their saltiest.
Wearing chest waders and with a wire basket floated by an inner tube tethered to me, I raked the oysters from the bottom with a potato fork. Bright sun and no wind made it easier to spot the quarry. I have raked oysters on dark, rough days, but under those conditions most of what I get is clumps of them mixed with empty shells and other debris.
 When you can see what you are doing, you can get many more large single oysters.
Clumped oysters are just as succulent as the singles, but you have to break them apart. Separating the clumps is a job for Ruth, who chooses to remain on shore. Armed with a little billy club, she judiciously taps them asunder and when one is accidentally broken she eats it on the spot. The unbroken oysters are carefully placed, deep side down, in a basket. So stored, with a damp burlap bag or blanket over them, they will last for a couple of months if kept in a cool place.
Putting stores by is an honorable pursuit, although admittedly there are times when it would be more economical -- if the hours spent nurturing the crop had been devoted to earning a living -- to purchase what we ate.
 Our '95 potato crop was an example of this. Ravaged by drought and insects, it amounted to little more than three bushels instead of the usual eight, and most of those potatoes are so small that peeling them gives you writer's cramp. On the other hand, reaching into the warm earth under the pre-drought plants in mid-July for a batch of new potatoes, boiled with their skins on, made it worth the gambit.
Sometimes the a crop's value is essentially symbolic, like the lettuce in the Christmas Eve salad. Several years ago, I built a cold frame out of some discarded plywood and an old storm window and put it against the south side of the house. We start plants in it in the spring, and in the fall we keep a dozen or so lettuce plants in it, banking it with straw and covering it with blankets on cold nights, so that on Christmas Eve we can enjoy a home-grown salad, which will include leeks, turnip, grated carrot, slices of tomatoes that we dried last fall -- boiled for one minute to reconstitute them -- and our own white wine vinegar-raspberry dressing.
The pumpkin for this year's Christmas Eve pie was grown by someone else. While visiting her parents in Wanaque, N.J., Ruth, during a hike with her 94-year-old father, found a brace of large pumpkins left in the woods by Halloween pranksters, and being an inveterate scavenger, brought them back to Martha's Vineyard.
The cast iron stove that heats the room in which we will eat will be fed with wood from trees that were blown down or shattered in storms, mostly white and red oak and locust. Some of it was from our own trees, but most came from the woods of
others, ours for cleaning up the worst of the storm-caused shambles.
There will be a few presents to unwrap on Christmas eve, but the most important gifts will have no ribbons around them.

THE BUDGET
 
Talking the Talk
After weeks of name-calling, percolating their budget data and trying in vain to reconcile their priorities without betraying their ideologies, Democratic and Republican leaders thought they could make a deal to produce a balanced Federal budget within seven years -- and, more immediately, pass a spending measure that would end the shutdown of the Federal Government. Not so fast, said 73 House Republicans, the shock troops of Newt Gingrich's army.
 But after face-to-face talks at the White House on Friday, President Clinton and some Republicans expressed optimism, then adjourned until next Friday.
 
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
 
Off the Table and Into the Bog
It's the greatest bill in the history of telecommunications, its backers say, bringing unimaginable benefits to the telephone, broadcasting and cable television industries by allowing them to traffic in one another's markets. Maybe even consumers will benefit, if increased competition and deregulation work the way the theories say they should. The bill would, for instance, lift all limits on how many radio stations a single owner could have nationwide, which means fewer owners over all. The sponsors say that would provide more competition and program diversity. Yet just as the conferees seemed to be wrapping up their work, a group of House Republicans rebelled (sound familiar?), protesting that the bill contained too much regulation and made too many concessions to the Democrats.
 
INVESTING
 
Congress Limits Lawsuits
Overiding a Presidential veto for the first time in the Clinton Administration, the Senate and House limited the ability of shareholders to file fraud suits against corporate officers, underwriters and accountants. The law allows the Securities and Exchange Commission to continue pursuing fraud claims but places formidable obstacles before individuals who want to do the same. In his veto message, President Clinton said he was concerned that the bill would hurt small investors. The veto enraged some Democrats, including Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a sponsor of the legislation.
 
INTEREST RATES
 
A Nudge From the Fed
Saying it saw little danger of inflation anywhere in the economy, the Federal Reserve lowered its Federal funds rate by one-quarter of a point, to 5.5 percent -- its first rate cut in five months. Few banks followed suit by cutting their prime rates, and the markets seemed preoccupied with the budget stalemate and bad news on earnings in the technology sector.
 
TOBACCO
 
A Fifth State Seeks Damages
In a complaint in state court, Massachusetts sued the nation's largest tobacco companies, trying to recoup Medicaid and other health care costs for treating smoking-related illnesses. The state estimated the costs at $200 million a year. Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and West Virginia have similar suits pending.
 
BANKING
 
The Consolidation Continues
Fleet Financial agreed to pay $3.26 billion, most of it in cash, for NatWest Bank, the New York and New Jersey banking subsidiary of the National Westminster Bank of Britain. Fleet said it expected to trim 1,800 jobs and close 30 branches, most of them on Long Island.
 
GOLF
 
Bigger Is Richer
Cobra Golf, which flourished with its lines of oversized clubs, accepted a $700 million takeover offer from American Brands, which makes Titleist clubs and balls and Foot Joy golf shoes.
 
WILDCATS
 
Offensive Platoon Takes Field
As Northwestern University prepares for a rare trip to a bowl game -- it will play the University of Southern California in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1 -- the school is besieged with requests from companies hoping to license its insignia and its mascot, Willie the Wildcat. In addition to the usual caps, shirts and towels, Northwestern has licensed pasta shaped like the initials N.U. and caps and sweaters for dogs and cats. The school rejected requests to market Northwestern toilet seats and toilet paper.

TIMING
 
Soros Bets on Russia
After pulling most of his investments out of Russia, George Soros has decided it's time to go back in. Not that he likes what he sees; he describes his assessment as "cautiously pessimistic." Despite the breakdown of many governmental and financial controls, Mr. Soros said: "It is all a question of timing. Right now you have a situation where you can buy assets undervalued."
 
BEVERAGES
 
Gagging on Snapple
Acknowledging that its $1.7 billion purchase of Snapple had been disappointing, Quaker Oats warned that earnings in the current quarter would take a hit and said it would take a $40 million pretax charge to cover the cost of getting rid of overcapacity in Snapple's bottling operations. During 1995, Snapple revenue fell more than 10 percent. "The bottom line is that Snapple has not sold well in Peoria," said John McMillan, a Prudential Securities analyst. "Although Quaker's strategy was to make it a national and then a global product, it remains an East Coast-West Coast Yuppie brand."
 
TAXIS
 
Higher Fares in New York?
The cost of short trips would rise sharply, longer trips less so, under a plan proposed by the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission. The idea is to encourage drivers rainforest "to go on out and pick up fares, not sit in front of hotels waiting for airport rides," said Christoper R. Lynn, the commission chairman.

Shown here in an artist's rendering, the building is to be 137 stories, more than 2,200 feet high, and will contain a hotel, offices, restaurants and some apartments. The developer, Bruno Grollo of Melbourne, said the project would cost about $1.25 billion and would take at least six years to complete. The Sears Tower in Chicago, by the way, is 1,454 feet high; the Petronas Twin Towers, under construction in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,will be slightly higher. (Agence France-Presse)

Wall Street to Washington: May Be a Bumpy Ride Ahead

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

 BODY:
The financial markets finally woke up to the fact that the budget negotiations in Washington could easily go nowhere -- exactly what Wall Street, which has counted on big deficit-cutting, has long insisted is unthinkable. So on Monday, in a warning shot to Washington, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped an attention-getting 101 points. It recovered some when the Federal Reserve, nervous about conflicting evidence of a weakening economy, eased its short-term rate by a slim quarter of a percentage point. But for the rest of the week the Dow rose and fell with the level of oratory in Washington, suggesting that the last week of an otherwise banner year could be a bit rough. DAVID E. SANGER

HEADLINE: Economic Development Cannot Replace Public Aid

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, one of Harlem's more influential religious leaders, seems to accept at face value Republican politicians' talk of "economic development" as a way to create jobs and solve the problems of Harlem, breaking the "dependency cycle" of social welfare programs ("The Political Dance of Calvin Butts," Dec. 3). 
 Over half the people who live in Harlem make less than $10,000 yearly. Almost as many receive public assistance. Can Mr. Butts actually believe that this magic wand of economic development will significantly change this? Can he actually believe that Governor Pataki and the State Legislature or Mayor Giuliani -- the same people who have increased City College tuition, raised subway fares 20 percent and cut funding at Harlem Hospital -- are going to produce jobs to replace the programs that keep people from becoming homeless and going hungry?
The possibility Mr. Butts might become a mayoral candidate is frightening. Having influenced blacks to support Ross Perot and vote against Governor Cuomo, he might be a spoiler again, attracting just enough votes from the Democratic candidate to doom us to four more years of Rudolph Giuliani.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
For Labor, a Nation to Envy

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
JOHN SWEENEY, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s new president, was called a militant and a radical when he supported janitors from his service workers union who blocked bridges into Washington last summer to demand higher wages. So it is no surprise that Mr. Sweeney should speak with awe and envy, as he did recently, about what France's workers have accomplished.
No one is predicting an American replay of the events in France, where workers shut down the railroads, subways, buses and mails to protest planned cuts in pensions and health insurance, and hundreds of thousands of workers took to the streets in a dozen cities. But the betting among many labor experts is that American unions will begin using aggressive tactics not seen since the 1930's. 
 "There are so many potential hot spots in the American economy that when you strike the match, which Sweeney and some other people are about to do, there are going to be some explosions," said Steven Fraser, a writer and labor historian.
For many reasons, any such explosions are likely to be smaller than France's. For one thing, while public-sector employees spearheaded France's strikes, most American government workers are barred from striking and face severe penalities if they do -- something air-traffic controllers learned the hard way from Ronald Reagan.
Also, American workers do not share France's tradition of general strikes and mass unrest, a legacy that runs from the storming of the Bastille in 1789 to the worker-run Paris Commune in 1870 to the worker-student general strike of 1968 that helped push Charles de Gaulle from power.
 
Revolutionaries All
 American workers cannot count on much public support, either. The French, thinking of themselves as to-the-ramparts descendants of the Revolution, tend to sympathize with workers acting like sans-culottes, overturning buses and blocking highways; American drivers spewed unprintable epithets at the janitors on Washington's bridges. In France, the working class is taught to resent the rich, while American workers are told that, with a little luck, they too can be rich.
American labor's less-than-lustrous record on strikes is also discouraging militancy. The mighty United Auto Workers won nothing in its 18-month walkout against Caterpillar, while workers at the Detroit Free Press and Detroit News are out on the wintry streets after five months on strike. If there is any encouragement, it was the strike against Boeing, which ended this month after the union fought off concessions on health insurance and won a better pay package and protections against Boeing's sending work overseas.
Still, some labor leaders see one overarching reason why American workers may be ripe for mass protest: their wages have not kept up with inflation.
"If you take the phenomenon where the average worker's wages are standing still or regressing while the stock market is past 5000 and corporations are healthy and wealthy and C.E.O.'s are making more money than ever, if you put all this stuff together, it has the seeds for general unrest in this country," said Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
If Washington ignores labor's concerns about stagnant wages while Congressional Republicans cut new holes in the safety net, some union leaders say, labor's minions might be spurred to action. In that way, the Republicans could provoke labor militancy as the French Government unwittingly did when it moved to cut labor's privileges.
So Mr. Sweeney is straining to mobilize workers. "A lot of people might say, 'Let's have a one-day strike around the country,' " said Brian McLaughlin, president of the New York City Central Labor Council. "But if not many people join the strike and if most Americans feel inconvenienced by it, that's certainly not going to do the labor movement any good."

THE LOST CITY
Discovering the Forgotten Virtues of Community in the Chicago of the 1950s.
By Alan Ehrenhalt.
Illustrated. 310 pp. New York:
Basic Books. $24.
THE author's dedication, crisp and epigraphic as a headstone, both honors his father's memory and manifests the thesis of this provocative book. If William Ehrenhalt was born in Chicago in 1898 and died there in 1986, the dedication tells us, he "flourished 1950-1960." So, too, contends his son, Alan, did America in that decade termed "apathetic" by many of those who now long for its homely strengths of community and good order. 
 "The Lost City" is Chicago during the Eisenhower era. Mr. Ehrenhalt presents the metropolis as a polyptych, allowing our glance to rove across it or to focus on one of four major panels. At dead center is the Loop and the fabled Cook County Democratic political culture. Just south of that is the community of Bronzeville, where segregated wards restricted black ambition and achievement. Beyond that stretches the self-contained and self-nurturing enclave of a Roman Catholic parish, St. Nicholas of Tolentine. Farther west, a classic postwar suburb, Elmhurst, sprouts out of the prairie as swiftly as corn once did. Through these Mr. Ehrenhalt, the executive editor of Governing magazine and the author of "The United States of Ambition," illustrates his vision of America before the fall, an Eden against whose tranquillity we rebelled in the 60's, demanding unlimited choice and freedom and thereby exiling ourselves on the cold and morally trackless plains of modern life.
Earthly Edens are always remembered the way aging actresses were filmed in the 1930's -- through filtering gauze from a flattering angle, with a deft use of shadow. The author is well aware of the mitigating effects of retrospect, however, and factors them into his exploration of the parallel worlds of mid-century and millennium. A shrewd understanding of the chronic fault lines in the human condition informs his analysis. He has a good eye for the sins and shortfalls of the admired past as well as for the virtues that can be identified in the much bewailed present.
In the 1950's, Mr. Ehrenhalt suggests, Americans inhabited neighborhoods whose very crowdedness and circumscribed privacy contributed to an environment of easy intimacy, unlocked doors and low crime rates. Residents, raised in the Great Depression and World War II, were accustomed to deprivation and delay of gratification. Their dreams were of making something of themselves, not of "having it all," and they were realistic about the boundaries within which they had to pursue their lives, marriages and careers.
Mr. Ehrenhalt argues that "stable relationships, civil classrooms, safe streets -- the ingredients of what we call community -- all come at a price. The price is limits on the choices we can make as individuals, rules and authorities who can enforce them, and a willingness to accept the fact that there are bad people in the world and that sin exists in even the best of us."
The 60's, in the writer's opinion, addressed many of the previous decade's problems, like the moral hypocrisy and racial segregation that burned like abandoned mines beneath the surface of his Arcadian America. Yet the social uprisings of the 60's not only exposed the weaknesses of the 50's but also compromised the era's strengths, without providing alternatives to them.
The ideas of the 1960's constitute, in Mr. Ehrenhalt's words, "the manifesto of an entire generation . . . now in its 30's and 40's," and those ideas include an uncritical acceptance of choice as a self-justifying virtue, authority as a vice and sin as a function of social forces rather than personal behavior. Such notions, the negative image of the values that anchored the 1950's, have "brought us a world of restless dissatisfaction, in which nothing we choose seems good enough to be permanent . . . in work, in marriage, in front of the television set." So, too, the "suspicion of authority has meant the erosion of standards of conduct and civility," while the transformation of sinners into passive victims who have been dealt "bad cards in life" places us "a step away from deciding that there is no such thing as right and wrong."
Mr. Ehrenhalt is not just another sociological scold, however, but rather a critic who invites readers to sift through the relics of the 1950's to discover how another age can shed light on our own. Indeed, the author is countercultural himself, as when, for example, he explores what he terms "the uses of sin." The culturally correct perception of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley of Chicago has long been that of an unforgiving and unforgiven political boss. In making the 1950's more three-dimensional, Mr. Ehrenhalt presents Daley in a subtler fashion, documenting his reforms and accomplishments, and observing that his tolerance of human failure in those around him is a strength, not a weakness, for anyone who wants to govern successfully in a sinful world.
The Democratic machine in Chicago operates differently today under the old mayor's son, Richard M. Daley. Reformers have, among other things, almost completely destroyed the capacity to exercise patronage. "But," Mr. Ehrenhalt asks, in the face of this and other supposed advances, "are the schools better, the streets safer, the local government more responsive to the day-to-day concerns of the residents? Virtually everybody realizes that the answer to these questions is no. Is there a feeling of community that fosters attachment and commands the loyalty of 40 years ago? The answer to that question is equally clear."
In similar fashion, he examines the city's "bungalow people," the thousands of forgotten Chicagoans who lived in brick-faced one-story houses with finished cellars and tended lawns that advertised generally lower-middle-class Roman Catholic decency and customs. The church's parishes so dominated the city's cohesive neighborhoods that it was natural to feature them in real estate advertisements, such as "St. Nick's parish, 6 rm brick -- beautiful." Those neighborhoods, each with bankers and storekeepers who knew everybody on a first-name basis, provided strong familial and group identity as well as the pre-air-conditioning street life that promoted constantly overlapping patterns of socialization. That kind of community has disappeared, along with individuals in "the lost city" like the benign old pastor, Monsignor Fennessy, and the ex-Marine first curate, Father Lynch, who interposed himself into people's lives with a sense of mission and moral purpose.
Also gone are the cramped, Levittown-like houses that were built near the farm town of Elmhurst and finally engulfed it. They represented an Ozzie and Harriet culture, one that was cursed with a false innocence that has become a staple of ridicule for late-century sophisticates. But a closer look, Mr. Ehrenhalt suggests, reveals contentment born of striving to achieve postwar dreams of family and success that is humanly admirable and that has seldom been seen since.
Understanding the enormous risks he is taking, Mr. Ehrenhalt enters Bronzeville, the large segregated area within whose political, social and economic limitations African-Americans were contained. Yet in that universe a vibrant culture embracing and expressing family, religion, politics, music, theater and even the numbers racket flourished -- as did extraordinary political leaders like William Dawson and spellbinding preachers like Clarence Cobb of the First Church of Deliverance. The author is not blind to the evils of segregation but neither is he ignorant of the arid and dangerous housing projects that now stand, all but ruins, where Bronzeville once bloomed in the shadows cast by the skyscrapers of a white city. The substitute housing -- called "vertical ghettos" -- has failed to improve the lives or opportunities of those who must live in it.
"BRONZEVILLE'S leaders," Mr. Ehrenhalt writes, "were doing what leaders in any community are supposed to do: maintain a set of institutions that can give a semblance of order and stability to life. . . . Nor is it too much to say that the absence of functioning institutions and leaders has been a calamity for those left behind on the streets of what used to be Bronzeville in the years since then."
"The Lost City" is not an exercise in nostalgia for lost worlds. Mr. Ehrenhalt's concern is to rehabilitate the positive values of community and authority that gleam like seams of gold in the fallen structures of the 1950's. It is a goal that he sees as no less important for future generations than, say, reducing the crushing deficit. True, Mr. Ehrenhalt fails to distinguish between authoritarianism and authority, and, true, he overromanticizes both brightly lighted Bronzeville and pre-Vatican II Catholicism. Nonetheless, he cannot fail, because of his fair and engaging manner, to draw the reader into hard thinking about the social conditions and institutions necessary for truly human lives.

HEADLINE: WHO NEEDS AMERICA ONLINE?

BYLINE: By Jesse Kornbluth; Jesse Kornbluth won the 1994 award from the Computer Press Association for investigative reporting.

 BODY:
Ah, doughnuts, breakfast of champions!" Ted Leonsis exclaimed as he entered a conference room one morning in March and spotted a tray of standard-issue pastries. Leonsis is not a small man, so his quip drew a laugh. It also reassured his associates, who remembered how little pleasure Leonsis had found in his last meeting in this room.
A month earlier, two Californians traveled to America Online headquarters in Vienna, Va., to present a proposal for an on-line site dedicated to surfing, the real kind, done in water. Assuming that the members of America Online's staff would be corporate types, the two Californians, Mark
Bertignoli and Bob Wolfe, wore newly purchased suits and ties. Their presentation was equally buttoned up. Ten minutes in, Leonsis had heard enough. He turned to a colleague and fumed, "These are the [expletive] surfers?" and started reading his mail. 
 Bertignoli and Wolfe took the hint. Now, for their second-chance presentation, they strolled in wearing caps, sunglasses, Hawaiian shirts, shorts and sandals. Bertignoli's first words were, "We're back, bitchin' and bad." Before he outlined his plans for Surf Net, he gave Leonsis a T-shirt from a cult film called "Surf Nazis Must Die." Only when he had done everything but ride a wave did he segue into cyber-speak: "Check this -- we can literally beam out from the beach. We can have live chat with near-video on demand, using a 540c laptop, a PC/MIA pocket insert and a 14.4 modem connected to a cell phone. And we can upload pictures in two minutes to a folder on a Web site."
"What ABC did at the Super Bowl," said Randy Dean, head of America Online's sports department.
"And then there's the interactive stuff," Bertignoli said. "We'll have trivia contests, a fantasy league, pictures of the surf injury of the month."
The Californians showed off their graphics, then were ushered outside to await the verdict.
"A fairly small market," a skeptic noted.
"No," Leonsis said. "This isn't about surfers. It's about surf, sharks and sex -- and by sex I mean healthy bodies, pretty people, California. You saw that 30-foot wave, you took a deep breath. But you didn't really want to be there. That's the beauty of this: it's not just surfing for surfers, it's also for wannabes."
The debate was brief. Bertignoli and Wolfe returned. But before Dan Krifcher, manager of an America Online division called Greenhouse, welcomed them to the service, Leonsis had two more questions.
"You full time?"
"You bet."
"Profit or not?"
"Megaprofit."
Leonsis nodded. "Profit is cool."
COOL" IS THE HIGHEST ACCOLADE IN the Leonsis lexicon, and he has conferred it on more than two dozen presentations this year. As a result, the Greenhouse -- a unit of America Online that the 38-year-old Leonsis formed in summer 1994 to attract fresh ideas from nontraditional sources -- has introduced an array of disparate talents. There's a writer who bills himself as a 60-second novelist, a site for people of color, a Health Zone, an astrology service, a cyber free-for-all called Hecklers Online and, with midsummer fanfare, Surf Net. Leonsis, who is president of America Online Services Corporation and its chief programmer, promises much more. "Between January and June of 1996, we'll launch 70 Greenhouse sites, which is equal to all the deals we signed last year," he says. "I can't think of a movie studio that productive."
America Online can afford it. The company has grown from 300,000 subscribers in 1993 to more than 4 million today, with 250,000 members joining each month, making it the most popular on-line service in the country. As a result, the company has been a favorite of investors, who have driven up the stock price more than 2,800 percent since 1992. The Greenhouse signings are, nevertheless, necessary -- even crucial -- to America Online's future. Despite its current dominance, the company is vulnerable, and not just to its direct competitors, an increasingly aggressive Compuserve, a revived Prodigy, the yet-to-be-announced News Corporation-MCI Online Ventures service and the enormously endowed Microsoft Network.
According to conventional wisdom, the only significant destination in cyber-space is the World Wide Web; by this argument, all commercial services are doomed to be nothing more than Internet-access providers. "We see a lot of talent entering the field on the Web without the blessing of the branded services," says Edward Bennett, president of Prodigy. "And where human attention goes, advertisers will follow."
Some commercial services have already positioned themselves as Internet navigators. Leonsis calls them "Johnny-come-lattes" and scoffs at the conventional wisdom. "They all say, 'Content is king,' " he says. "But how can you argue that when there are 200,000 Web sites? The more that's out there, the better it will be for a service with strong programming." In other words, with such a huge and bewildering proliferation of sites, users will want a central starting place.
So the challenge for Leonsis is to develop compelling content that is available only on America Online. Here he has a competitive advantage: he is the first on-line executive who can make a sizable investment in talent. On most networks -- including America Online in pre-Greenhouse days -- the economics of cyber-space are attractive to only the on-line service. Typically, these services charge customers a monthly fee that covers the first 10 hours of use. Their profit lies in signing up a great many customers, and then enticing them to stay on line for more than the basic 10 hours. For the independent creators of programming, however, the reward is minuscule: 20 percent of the revenue they generate. In the first wave of on-line growth, services tended to form alliances with established media companies (@times, the on-line version of The New York Times, for instance, has been on America Online since June 1994) and to encourage user-generated content -- "chat rooms" and bulletin boards. As services began to look alike, however, it seemed that the key to growth was original programming.
The Greenhouse is the first to recognize that quality programming costs money. And so, in exchange for 20 percent of the equity, America Online invests between $100,000 and $500,000 in its partners' sites. It's no wonder, then, that two months after America Online announced the Greenhouse, it had 2,000 applications.
Suddenly, every service created its own version of the Greenhouse or found a reason not to need one (see box) or attacked America Online. Leonsis, who was mostly unknown outside the new media universe just a year ago, loves the attention and the competition. Now he is in a position roughly equivalent to head of programming at a television network or production chief at a movie studio; he finds it an apt comparison when it's suggested that he might become the Brandon Tartikoff of cyber-space.
TED LEONSIS HAS NEVER HAD A PROBLEM with high visibility. On the rare occasion in his bachelor days when he was dateless, he tended to join paired-off friends at restaurants carrying a bust of Elvis Presley and announcing to the hostess, "Table for eight -- and the King doesn't like to be kept waiting." But his taste for the dramatic obscures the fact that Leonsis is a passionate student of "new media."
An only child, Leonsis grew up in Brooklyn and Boston; he went to Georgetown University planning to become a teacher. He worked as a writer at Wang, where he learned to love computers. At 25, he started his first company by turning a data base about software products into a publishing enterprise. It's not surprising, therefore, that when Leonsis became a co-founder of Redgate Communications in 1985, at 28, he positioned it as "a new life form," not as an advertising agency. "At Wang, the basic premise was that you could take a keystroke and digitize it," he explains. "Bill Gates went a step further. He understood that once you digitize information, you change its DNA. Gates saw that anything could be software. So in '84 and '85, no matter what meeting I was in, I felt something cataclysmic was happening, that dogs would sleep with cats and the sun would set in the East."
Which led Leonsis to experiment. At Redgate, he produced the first multimedia CD-ROM. He started six personal computer magazines and was the co-author of three books. He created an all-digital multimedia service and a CD-ROM shopping program. "Every other word out of Ted's mouth was 'digital,' " recalls Bob Nicholson, a former Air Force public-affairs officer (and a 20-year veteran of the Internet and its progenitor, Darpanet) who has worked with Leonsis since 1986.
By 1994, the little agency in Vero Beach, Fla., that specialized in digitizing and redirecting information had seven offices, a staff of 120 and billings of $70 million a year. Leonsis didn't see that his future was on line. But Steve Case, chairman of America Online, had noticed that Leonsis' ability to bring buyers and sellers together through personalized digital technology was on a parallel track with his company's efforts to create an electronic marketplace. He arranged a breakfast with Leonsis; after a 90-minute conversation, he proposed that America Online buy Redgate. "Ted was coy," Case says, "but I knew he was mesmerized by the opportunity to play on a bigger stage."
Leonsis quickly developed a strategy for the next stage of America Online's growth. "People work and come home, but they also need a third place -- the gym, a bar, whatever," he says. "When they push away from the dinner table, that third place is reading or talking or TV. Right now, online is in about 10 percent of American homes. If it's going to grow, it's got to attract the big audience, which, as a reflex, settles in front of the television set at 9 P.M. every Thursday. In that sense, my real competition isn't Bill Gates, it's 'Seinfeld.' "
But in August 1994, when Leonsis joined America Online and logged onto the network in search of talent he could throw against "Seinfeld," he had trouble finding any great sites. On other networks he found the same numbing sameness. He thought he knew why: on-line services built their business on the wrong model. "Instead of developing original programming, we forged alliances with big media companies," he says. "But many of our partners look at online as an ancillary delivery system, a place to slap electronic versions of newspapers and magazines and press releases onto a medium that seems small and not terribly important to them. There's too much: online, not cable TV, is the medium with 500 channels, and it's ugly. We're all pretty pathetic."
But amid the dross, Leonsis found the Motley Fool, a stock advisory site on America Online developed by Tom and David Gardner, two brothers in their 20's. The Gardners had the finest education offered by New England prep schools and elite colleges and then found they were allergic to conventional employment. They were equally dismayed by professional stock pickers, who as a group underperform against the Dow Jones average. If Wall Street was populated by "the wise," they reasoned, they would do better to embrace Fooldom. Using $50,000 of their own money, they bought stock, went on line and began comparing notes with their fellow amateurs. They were an immediate hit, both in the market, where they were outperforming the Dow by 22 percent, and on line, where they were on their way to converting 5,000 initial customer entries a month into 300,000 a month.
"Two kids became our No. 1 personal-finance providers -- two kids!" Leonsis says. "Why? Because they tapped into the DNA of our community." Surely there must be others who could dispense knowledge and create a comfortable environment that allowed subscribers to become collaborators. A few weeks later, Leonsis and his colleagues brainstormed their way to a possible solution: a division that would transform the ultimate cyber-experts, the users, into content providers.
Some Greenhouse content is quite high-minded. When its Afrocentric site, Net Noir, made its debut in July, its first guest was President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti. The Health Zone's fitness programming includes an interactive food diary that describes the caloric, fat and nutrient content of users' diets with just a few keystrokes. And on the Better Health and Medicine Forum -- founded by Elin Silveous and her husband, Dr. Allen Douma, soon after her multiple sclerosis was diagnosed -- there are 240 support groups and bulletin boards with 1,500 topics.
Most initial Greenhouse investments, however, go to those who see themselves primarily as entertainers. Dan Hurley is a journalist who started writing "novels while you wait" on a Chicago street corner more than a decade ago and has since produced 17,254 "one minute" novels. He now conducts an on-line forum in which he interviews a member and then produces an instant story. Eugenie Diserio introduced herself to Leonsis by sending him some hostile E-mail ("I'm having trouble logging on. Did everyone in the world buy modems last Christmas? Is America Online going to be like Power Rangers?") and soon found herself starting Astronet, an interactive astrology service.
It is Hecklers Online, though, that best expresses Leonsis' view that the ideal content provider is a party host, not a monologuist. Hecklers is a site where guests are regularly roasted and audience members are invited to ask impertinent questions. "Sean Michael and Scott Davis and I are old friends from high school who spent a lot of detention time together," says Mike Ragsdale, one of the site's three founders. "One night we were sitting around drinking beer and we decided to have some fun on line, so we went into a chat room and asked, 'What is a jihad?' Someone answered, 'A holy war.' We typed back, 'Isn't that an oxymoron?' Then a bunch of us would jump into a chat room and harass the people there until we'd be the only ones in 'Gay Cops in Houston.' "
Surfers, the terminally ill, diet specialists, hecklers -- this is a ragtag band of talent. Isn't online supposed to be cutting edge, geared to the young and hip? "When I first got here, I thought we should be the MTV of the 90's," Leonsis says. "But it wasn't an accurate analogy. As I double-clicked into our community, I saw it was the American Association of Retired People, Christianity Today, military people, pet lovers -- a real Norman Rockwell picture of America. Face it, when you go to a cocktail party and America Online diskettes are being used as coasters, you know you've become mainstream."
AS IF PROGRAMMING America Online, continuing as president of Redgate, running America Online's new Internet connection and being a husband and a father of two weren't enough, Leonsis has taken on another role: point man in the propaganda war against the Microsoft Network.
Leonsis understood from the beginning that the on-line world has the potential to become significant to more than Wall Street and the current 11 million American users. And so, shortly after he arrived at America Online, he gave a five-minute talk on the subject. "This is the most important battle in the fight to stop Gates," he said. "Operating systems are episodic -- you buy them once every few years. But online is ongoing. It's bigger than computers -- it's about operating your life." The bottom line: beat Gates before Gates beats America Online. So he set the Greenhouse in motion.
That zeal was not enough to keep NBC from moving its on-line site to the Microsoft Network. This defection from America Online was widely noticed, not least because it caused America Online stock to lose 6 points in two days. Leonsis, predictably, played this as a signal that the Microsoft Network would feature banal programming from brand names. "We told NBC: 'We need to do original programming with you, not just run promotional material as news. We paid you $1 million a year. We'll give you $1.5 million if you deliver original material.' The word is that Microsoft offered NBC $4 million. If so, it says they'll have every brand in there. It will be hard for a network that broad to have a point of view."
Martin Yudkovitz, president of NBC Interactive Media, laughed at that analysis. "If Ted wasn't interested in NBC, he did a magnificent job at hiding it," he says. The Microsoft retort is even stronger. "We didn't pay tons of money to recycle NBC's old content," says Bill Miller, director of marketing for the Microsoft Network. "Microsoft as a shark buying everything -- that's wrong. If we wanted to do that, we would have announced 15 deals with names you've heard of."
Miller contends that it's Microsoft, not America Online, that's friendlier to the unknown content provider. "Greenhouse is a great program, and I wish I'd thought of it -- though I'm not sure I couldn't have," he says. "But if you're not a winner in the Greenhouse competition, it's hard, if not impossible, to get onto America Online."
More recently, Time magazine moved from America Online to Compuserve. Once again, Leonsis put great spin on what looked like a defection. "We have five Greenhouse areas that have been performing as well as Time," he explains. "If we didn't spend that money on Time, we realized we could spawn a dozen Greenhouse deals that might also perform at that level -- and we'd have equity in them. That was very compelling to us."
As with NBC, memories differ. "What Compuserve is offering isn't just money," says Barrett Seaman, special-projects editor for Time. "You hit 'News' on Compuserve, and you'll get Time -- we'll be their gateway to the news. If we had gotten that kind of exposure on America Online, we might still be there." (As America Online users well know, The New York Times icon is almost always on the service's welcome screen, giving it a visibility that makes it unequaled as a news site on that network.)
At this point, even an observer who enjoys cyber-tennis might have trouble deciding whom to believe. But that's an old-media preoccupation. This is nothing less than media war, conducted by media via media, in which all victories are measured by points of market share. All that seems clear -- for the moment, anyway -- is that the service that wins the first scrimmages will be the one that creates the first generation of on-line celebrities.
Here, at least, America Online has the advantage. As Leonsis likes to point out, the leaders in radio didn't flourish in the early days of television, and the leaders in the television business did not spawn the lucrative cable business. Rather, the pathfinders tend to come from young, small, aggressive companies with no legacy of success -- and that, Leonsis says with satisfaction, means America Online, not Microsoft.
So he takes pleasure in telling the story of Brian Henley, the creator of a golf site called I Golf: when Henley was named a Greenhouse partner, he not only quit his regular job, he also convinced the Callaway Corporation, a maker of golf clubs with no history of interest in online, to pay $250,000 to sponsor his site for one year. Leonsis is delighted that the Motley Fools have, with Greenhouse financing, moved out of their one-room office, hired a staff and opened three new sites, including an entertainment review that they've called, inevitably, Follywood. And he cackles when he considers that customers spent 80,000 hours at Hecklers Online in its first month.
But these, Leonsis knows, are the good times. "The Microsoft launch was true to form," he says. "The expectation their public relations machine creates is very hard to meet -- this was a software upgrade, after all, not an AIDS vaccine. But it's an awesome company, and they will figure it out. The challenge for America Online is to get as big as we can as fast as we can. That means more families, more minorities, more women coming to America Online. And it means getting ready for the backlash against the Internet, when the venture capitalists get burned and customers get lost and the magazines start running articles titled 'Whither the Web?' "
All that pressure drives Leonsis in one direction: to sign more talent. "But I know if we open 40 new areas, 10 will be home runs, 10 will be good, 10 will be like everyone else's -- and we'll be embarrassed by the last 10." Leonsis leans back in his swivel chair. "And when that happens," he says, sounding very much like a network programming czar, "I'm going to have to start canceling shows."
 
THE COMPETITION
 
AMERICA ONLINE'S Greenhouse has not gone unnoticed by the competition. The other commercial services have cultivated new talent or, more commonly, asserted that talent development is nothing new.
 
Compuserve
With 3.9 million subscribers, Compuserve is the second-largest on-line service, but it has been marketed so casually that it sometimes seems invisible. This year it woke up, announcing that next spring it will unveil a streamlined network -- Project Wow! -- for newcomers to on-line services and invest in Entertainment Drive (E Drive), which has been drawing an estimated 600,000 Compuserve users. But Compuserve doesn't usually invest in unknowns. "We get 150 inquiries a week from people who want to go on line," says Kevin Knott, vice president of product marketing. "Only a few can make it. We'll help anyone get up on the Internet, but we're very particular what we put on our service. It's very difficult and expensive to establish a new brand."
 
Prodigy
Prodigy, with two million members, was the first service to reach out to a family audience. Since Edward Bennett took over as president in May, Prodigy has made it a priority to broaden its audience by developing talent, producing a remarkable number of new Internet sites that can be accessed only through Prodigy: 150 in the past 60 days. "Our aim is to give people information they can use," Bennett says. "We have sites about AIDS, computer-generated music, even one run by adopted children for adopted children."
The secret of Prodigy's speed and scope is that it hires people to develop its sites in-house. "This way, we own 100 percent of our new areas," Bennett notes. "We found that classic information providers wanted too big a cut. They think their content is their brand. They don't understand the medium."
 
Microsoft
The Microsoft Network, with 600,000 subscribers, made its debut in August with enormous fanfare and modest content. "We cast a broad net and made deals with more than 200 independent contract providers from companies valued at less than $10 million," reports Bill Miller, MSN's director of marketing. "These are people who, almost completely, found us."
MSN is primarily an Internet-access link, not a commercial on-line service. "On-line services have said, 'We'll create the world and give you everything you could want,' " Miller explains. "We believe the Internet is too vibrant and strong to limit our customers to Microsoft, so we see our role as helping our users make sense of the Internet. We will invest in good ideas and good people, but the majority of people who look to us for funding will wind up on the Internet, where the barrier to entry is fairly small. We tell them, 'Do a great job on the Net and we'll promote you to MSN.' " Microsoft does occasionally skip this intermediate stage, however -- most recently when it hired Michael Kinsley, of "Crossfire," to start an on-line magazine.
 
News Corporation-MCI On-Line Ventures
In the summer, Rupert Murdoch's Delphi service (100,000 subscribers) was on the verge of a major face lift. Delphi built a 200-desk, state-of-the-art newsroom, held endless meetings with print journalists and announced a contest to name the service. Then News Corporation and MCI announced a joint on-line venture, and two staffs and many ideas had to be integrated. Five months later, the electronic newsroom already seems like an artifact; according to the latest strategy, journalists will be hired, but more to provide content for traditional on-line categories than to create original content for an on-line newspaper.
This approach, sources at News Corporation-MCI suggest, will be matched by a unique on-line environment. Despite the delay, Anthea Disney, former editor of TV Guide and now editor in chief of this new venture, sounds confident of eventual success. "I had no interest in trading 30 million readers a week for a rate base of 100,000," she says.

HEADLINE: Democracy's Trap

BYLINE: By Robert D. Kaplan; Robert D. Kaplan, a contributing editor of The Atlantic Monthly, is the author of the forthcoming "The Ends of the Earth: A Journey at the Dawn of the 21st Century."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
America needs to curb its missionary zeal to establish multiparty systems in every third world country as fast as it can. Our rote prescription for undeveloped and newly "liberated" nations -- elections within one year, followed by stability -- is more likely to lead to chaos than democracy.
This is not to deny democracy's successes, especially in some Eastern European states. But we must acknowledge its limitations, at least as a quick fix, in a world torn by exploding populations, diminishing natural resources, struggling governments and ethnic rivalries. We should shift our foreign development strategy from one of instant gratification to one of mature patience, encouraging a slower, but more realistic, route to democracy. 
 We seem to assume that our victory in the cold war has paved the way for worldwide democracy. But the demise of the Soviet Union does not necessarily justify creating political parties in, say, Rwanda, where the establishment of a multiparty system and a coalition Government in 1992 hardened ethnic divisions that erupted into civil war and genocide in 1994.
Or in Cambodia, where the United Nations spent several billion dollars on a high-profile election in 1993 that has given us an increasingly dictatorial, corrupt and brutal Government that cannot even control its army.
Or in Haiti, where we can only hope that Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whom we did not allow to run for a second presidential term, can keep the country together from behind the scenes.
States are not formed by elections. They are formed by geography, war, settlement patterns and the rise of literate bourgeoisies. Nor are countries necessarily strengthened by elections. Indeed, democracy initially weakens many states because it demands ineffectual compromises. Totalitarianism is anathema to us, but remember that Bosnian Muslims, Croats and Serbs lived together peacefully and intermarried under Tito's jackboot.
Yet even the Balkan countries -- with their high literacy rates, low birthrates and some tradition of a middle class -- are better candidates for democracy than much of the third world. When elections are introduced suddenly into societies where the poor predominate, random crime and gangsterism often fill the void vacated by tyranny.
Witness South Africa, where in the past year violent crime has increased by as much as 75 percent in some areas. Of course, this is preferable to apartheid, and political violence there has greatly subsided. But if the Government cannot eventually stabilize crime rates, a new form of tyranny, or chaos, could evolve.
Democratic elections often intensify ethnic and regional divisions rather than heal them. In the Caucasus, the collapse of the Soviet Union brought nationalist-democrats to power in Armenia and Azerbaijan. Each leader furthered his country's slide into a brutal war against the other. Only after the freely elected President of Azerbaijan, Abulfez Elcibey, had been toppled in a coup that brought a former Communist leader to power did a modicum of stability return. Some months later, the two countries agreed to a cease-fire.
Because democracy neither forms states nor strengthens them initially, a multiparty system is best suited to nations that already have an established bureaucracy and a middle class which pays income tax and where the main issues of property and power-sharing have been resolved, leaving politicians to argue about budgets. Two perfect examples are Taiwan and Greece, both middle-class, ethnically homogeneous societies that have moved fitfully but successfully toward democracy for decades. Likewise, Chile's impressive economic growth and the withering away of its military dictatorship have made it a suitable candidate for real democracy.
Sometimes an authoritarian regime becomes so odious that out of concern for its citizens (or out of worry that it will destabilize its region) we feel compelled to get involved. Thus Nigeria may be the next battleground of democracy -- and we need to be cautious there.
Nigeria has a volatile mixture of ethnic and regional divisions, and it has a long history of money laundering, drug smuggling and forgery scams. Its increasingly urbanized population is doubling every 22 years and its natural resources are rapidly being depleted. If the West were to force the reintroduction of democracy before attending to other changes, like a reorganization of the military, and leave the day after a "successful" election, Nigeria could slowly unravel.
The example of Nigeria also illustrates how hypocritical Americans can be about exporting democracy. Nigeria is far less developed than, say, Egypt, according to the U.N. Yet, with an eye on geopolitical priorities, the United States doesn't even dare to consider where a real democracy might lead Egypt.
What can we do? We should shift our emphasis in the third world from holding elections to promoting family planning, environmental renewal, road building and other stabilizing projects. We need to sponsor more bread-and-butter literacy and agricultural programs (especially those that focus on women, who in many societies are the keys to cultural transformation). Yes, some dictators may take advantage of such programs, but this approach is better than throwing up our hands and more practical than elections.
History and cultures can rarely be forced by expensive stunts like the United Nations elections in Cambodia. And each failure only provides more ammunition for American isolationists.
This is why even in the Balkans, where there has been a level of social development not enjoyed in Haiti or Cambodia, arming the Bosnian Muslims to create a regional balance of terror is a safer bet than risking NATO's reputation on elections within a year, followed by peace.

A Weak Retail Season, And Dubious Prospects
Hardened shoppers, early discounting and a snowstorm that blanketed the Northeast in the crucial final week of Christmas shopping combined to give retailers their worst holiday seasons in years, analysts, economists and other retail experts said. And things won't get better for retailers, many experts said, until more go out of business, reducing the competition.
"We will have continued store closings, continued bankruptcies and an ongoing shake-out in the industry," an investment banker said. Figures on sales will not be available until later this week, but the estimates offered were gloomy. [Page 1.]
 
Israel Overhauls Banking System
The Israeli Government approved sweeping changes in the financial industry, requiring the country's powerful banks to sell substantial parts of their assets. The overhaul has far-reaching implications for the concentration of economic power, as well as for the planned privatization of state-owned banks. [54.]
 
A Railroad Across the Seas
Carl Malamud, whose nonprofit research group, Internet Multicasting, persuaded the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Patent Office to set up public-records distribution sites on the Internet, has set out on a much more ambitious effort to extend a high-speed, multimedia version of the Internet into more than 100 countries. [56.]
 
'We Got Grottoes, We Got Angels'
A nationwide boom in religious statuary is under way. At the Coreglia Studios in North Bergen, N.J., "We got grottoes, we got angels, we've got just about every saint there is," said Walter Baldaccini, whose family company makes plaster and concrete statues of saints, religious figures and Nativity scenes. [1.]
 
An Expensive Day in Tokyo
The spread of Christmas throughout Asia is a tribute to the power of retail stores in shaping social customs. Shops pushed the concept of Christmas to peddle gifts, and now Christmas is becoming an Asia-wide festival. In Japan, it is not a national holiday or even a family occasion, but rather the most romantic day of the year for young lovers, who exchange expensive gifts. [4.]
 
Holding Hands in Cyberspace
Christmas cards, letters and phone calls, the traditional ways that families stay in touch, have been joined by voice messaging and electronic mail. Now the Trueman family, which stretches from the California coast to the Brooklyn Bridge, may be a model of what's next: They stay in touch through a family site on the Internet's World Wide Web. [55.]
 
Spiked Heels and All
Mattel is planning to develop and sell multimedia products and software based on its toy brands, which include Barbie, Hot Wheels, Cabbage Patch Dolls and Polly Pocket. [56.]
 
A Paper's Coverage
Angers Politicians
The Star-Ledger, the 16th-largest daily in the country and the largest in New Jersey, has begun to change under a new editor, Jim Willse, the former editor of The New York Daily News. His effort to inject some edge into the paper's coverage of government is a part of what may be the most ambitious effort to revitalize a large newspaper anywhere in the country. [57.]
 
santa@santaclaus.com
More children are turning to E-mail to make their needs known to Santa Claus, routing it through a site on the World Wide Web run by lawyers in Miami. And that is just one of many holiday-oriented sites on the Internet. Another is Rockefeller Center, with a real-time view of the skating rink and Christmas tree. A camera at France Telecom North America takes a new picture every time the page is viewed. Taking In the Sites. [55.]

HEADLINE: Stadiums' Last Contests Involve Their Fates

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Dec. 24

 BODY:
There is a building boom of sorts in professional sports, as peripatetic owners move their teams to new stadiums or new cities.
But lost in the usual debate over the emotional and financial costs of the moves is the question of what to do with the old stadiums. 
 That question is increasingly being asked in cities around the country where sentimentality, a sense of history and some hard economic realities are forcing the issue.
Here, the focus is Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, the home of the Atlanta Braves baseball team. Until recently, few people had disagreed with the plan to tear it down after the 1996 Summer Olympics finished using it. The land was to be turned into parking lots for the Braves after they were ensconced two blocks away in a new stadium built for the Olympics.
But a group of small-business owners and city officials are asking whether there might be a better use for the 29-year-old stadium, where Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's career home-run record.
In Detroit, the nation's oldest ball park, Tiger Stadium, would be demolished under a proposal approved by the City Council earlier this month and replaced by a new stadium a couple of miles closer to downtown. While diehard members of the Tiger Stadium Fan Club are fighting to keep the team in place, others, mainly residents of the surrounding community of Corktown, seem to have accepted the move and are about to embark on a six-month study of ways to reuse the stadium. Their suggestions include a super Little League park, a velodrome or a "total athletic-entertainment center."
Similar discussions may soon take place in Pittsburgh, Denver, Houston, Cleveland and Foxboro, Mass., where stadiums have closed, may close or are about to close.
Rick Nafe, president of the Stadium Managers Association and executive director of the Tampa Sports Authority in Florida, said a community had few uses for a building as specialized as a stadium. But his organization is studying the question.
Andrew Zimbalist, an economist who wrote the book "Baseball and Billions," about the finances of the sport, said demolishing stadiums was a waste of important economic resources that are often magically fused with great moments.
For the late A. Bartlett Giamatti, the former commissioner of baseball, the serene, almost rural setting of a ball park surrounded by urban chaos brought to mind the root of the word "paradise," which in Persian meant "enclosed green space."
But now, Mr. Zimbalist noted, "it is getting more like the Joni Mitchell song, and they are paving over paradise to put up a parking lot."
Stadiums have rarely remained standing after their teams have left. As soon as the Chicago White Sox moved across the street to the new Comiskey Park in 1991, the old park was torn down.
A similar fate was generally accepted here as city officials and organizers of the Olympics cobbled together agreements more than 18 months ago for a new stadium that would help insure that the Braves remained in the city. At that time, City Councilman Robb Pitts said, everybody was interested in "keeping peace and not picking a fight."
But two weeks ago, Mr. Pitts offered a council resolution to study how to reuse the stadium.
Alice Bussey, the owner of a florist shop here, is among a group of small-business owners who would like to see the stadium stay open for track-and-field meets, soccer games and as an incubator for small businesses. With its food preparation facilities, the stadium could house training and space for small catering businesses, she said, and its storage areas could serve as warehouse or manufacturing space for start-up businesses.
Ms. Bussey concedes that there are those in the nearby Summerhill and Mechanicsville communities who would like to see the demolition of the stadium, which, when it was built in the mid-1960's, displaced many of their neighbors and brought the regular disruptions of game-day traffic. But she insisted that the old stadium offered an opportunity that could not be passed up.
Reginald Williams, the executive director of the Atlanta-Fulton County Recreation Authority, which manages the stadium and would cease to exist if the park were demolished, agreed and said that alternative areas nearby could provide the estimated 2,500 parking spaces that were to be put on the site of the old stadium.
"It's not a life-or-death situation and the world won't come to an end if the stadium is torn down," Mr. Williams said. "But this facility has tremendous potential for the city and the whole region. There are limitations to what can be done in the new stadium, with the Braves playing 81 home games a year there. But there would be few limitations on us, whether you are talking about track and field, international soccer matches, college football or concerts and a corps of small businesses to serve all of that."
Few in Atlanta talk sentimentally about the need to preserve the place and the left field stands where Hank Aaron hit his record-breaking 715th home run. Not so in Detroit, where Bill Dow, a board member of the Tiger Stadium Fan Club, fairly aches at the thought of a Tiger Stadium without the Tigers, or no Tiger Stadium at all.
Earlier this month, a little over a year after Detroit voters passed a referendum prohibiting the city from helping to finance a new stadium for the Tigers, the City Council, with the help of state government, overturned that measure and voted to build a new stadium with amenities that would provide the team's owners with more revenue. Mr. Dow and others among the 11,000-member stadium fan club went to court and are trying to block the move.
Residents and owners of businesses in the shadow of the 83-year-old ball park have a keen interest in the stadium's future use.
For years, the community has seen the stadium as its focal point but has also seen itself as a pawn of its needs, said Steve Palmer, head of the city-financed Corktown Citizens District Council. The area's businesses and quaint Queen Anne and Victorian houses were replaced with dusty parking lots, and the neighborhood was crisscrossed with highways to bring suburbanites to the games. More than 2,000 homes have been torn down, Mr. Palmer said, and a community that numbered about 3,000 households a couple of decades ago is now down to 722 households.
So the community hopes that the team's departure will not further destabilize the neighborhood, said Mr. Palmer. "While we might be reconciled to the team moving across town," he said, "we don't make the assumption that the old stadium has to be torn down."
With the help of planners, architects and residents, the district council will begin next month to devise new uses for the old stadium. The ideas floating around range from the tame to the "pretty wild," he said. Some people have suggested that the stadium could be adapted to accommodate the growing interest in rock climbing or to have kayak runs through a series of terraced pools.
Those who hope to save the stadiums may find hope in Washington's R.F.K. Stadium, which the Washington Redskins football team is scheduled to leave in 1997 for a new stadium in Prince Georges County, Md.
"There is life after the Redskins," said James A. Dalrymple, the stadium's general manager, noting that they had begun planning for a Redskin-less future more than nine years ago. "It may not be as plush and you may have to work harder to keep the stadium booked up, but it was never a thought to demolish the stadium."
In the past few years, R.F.K. has attracted a number of world-class soccer matches and a slew of college football games and is being considered as the temporary home of a new professional baseball franchise proposed for Virginia.
"We didn't wake up two weeks ago and realize that the Redskins were leaving," Mr. Dalrymple said. "We realized that we had to be prepared, and we have worked our way through the angst."

HEADLINE: RETAILERS REPORT A SHOPPING SEASON WORTH FORGETTING

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Hardened shoppers, perpetual sales and a snowstorm that blanketed the Northeast during the crucial final week of Christmas shopping combined to give retailers their worst holiday season in years, analysts, economists and other retailing experts said yesterday.
"This is the worst Christmas since we have been keeping track of the month of December," said Richard N. Baum of Goldman, Sachs & Company, which has monitored specialty retail sales monthly since 1988. 
 Most experts say they believe that stores will be able to return to the traditional and profitable formula of retailing -- buy things cheaply and sell them for a lot of money -- only when there are fewer of them. Already, there has been evidence of consolidations and the sheer fading away of some stores: at least eight retailers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1995.
"Clearly, 1995 is one of the worst years in recent memory," said Henry D. Jackson, the principal of Peter J. Solomon, an investment-banking firm in New York. "And the outlook for 1996 is similar. We will have continued store closings, continued bankruptcies and an ongoing shake-out in the industry."
For consumers, of course, all the sales promotions meant that they could do their holiday shopping without paying full price. But good news for them was bad news for the stores, and while hard figures on revenue will not be available until later this week, the estimates offered were roundly gloomy.
"I cannot recall a Christmas that was as lackluster as this in the 37 years I have been monitoring retailing," said Kurt Barnard of Barnard's Retail and Marketing Report in New York. "And this is the only one like it not caused by a recession. The nation is clearly overstored."
Many merchants blamed consumer debt and joblessness for empty stores and clamped pocketbooks.
But other experts say that the dismal season more likely reflects larger trends in American retailing: too many stores carrying too many of the same chenille sweaters, too few shoppers who want to buy a dozen full-priced gifts for every member of their family.
"People should not be blaming the economy in an up-and-down way," said Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Company. "Right now, we are at a growth rate of about 2 percent, which is soft, but not all that bad. There are structural changes, as opposed to cyclical ones," affecting retailing now.
The images of department-store coat racks with 40 percent-off signs, and women's clothing stores where not a creature was stirring early in December, may well serve as the ghost of Christmas future.
Across the country, retailers tried to take advantage of the last week before Christmas, which this year coincided with Hanukkah and contained an extra weekend of shopping days as Christmas fell on a Monday.
But the customer seduction took the form of heavy promotion, which, even when it brought masses of shoppers, cut into profit margins.
"I'm looking around and everything is on sale," said John Konarski, vice president of the International Council of Shopping Centers, calling from a strip mall in West Springfield, Mass., yesterday. "I mean, even the candy place has a sale."
A Bed Bath & Beyond store in Los Angeles hung a sign in the front of the shop that read, "We will match any price from anyone." In Bradlees on Union Square in Manhattan on Saturday morning, a few shoppers fingered reduced-price sweatshirts. Racks of panties and bras seemed untouched. Sale signs were so prominent as to inhibit movement.
Even in popular categories like computers and their accessories, margins took a hard hit.
"We talked to a manager in a Best Buy store in Los Angeles who told us, 'Yes, they are buying, but at prices that make you wonder what will happen to the bottom line,' " said Mr. Barnard, the retailing consultant, who spent the last two weeks in California cruising malls.
As predicted all season, specialty retailers like women's clothing stores did particularly badly. While analysts were estimating sales increases starting in the mid-teen percents for chains like Staples, which sells office equipment, women's clothiers were expected to realize flat-to-3-percent growth.
Regional department stores, with a few exceptions, were expected to post similarly low increases. "Most stores are going to be flat to 2 percent ahead for December," predicted Peter N. Schaeffer, a retail analyst at Dillon, Read & Company. "And some stores will have some negative numbers."
Once the season is over, retailers will have to face hard facts about the future of the industry and the marketplace in which it operates, experts said. That includes consumer debt and the cost-cutting and layoffs at American corporations.
More fundamentally, perhaps, demographic and psychological shifts in the population have hurt retailers, as has the fact too many stores are selling the same products at a constant discount.
"People are simply not accumulating," Mr. Straszheim of Merrill Lynch said. "As the population ages, they care more about their financial futures, like Social Security and health costs. And the experience of the last decade is the later you shop, the cheaper stuff is."
A lack of fashion inspiration hurts the clothing chains, too, Mr. Barnard said, adding, "If you go to malls, you see so many stores that carry the same thing, so much so that sometimes the only way you can tell the difference between one store and another is the name on the door."
Of course, as with so many sad tales, there are winners. Luxury merchants, who sell special things for those who can afford them, like lime-green leather suits, are expected to make out smartly.
"As far as we're concerned, this was a very, very strong Christmas," said Brian Blake, president of the Gucci Group N.V., a unit of Investcorp. "We have not had to take any price reductions to any significant degree." While Mr. Blake was coy with figures, the company posted an 85 percent increase in net sales for the third quarter.
Among large chains, Sears, Roebuck was remarkable for its comeback. "The past week was the best sales week in Sears history," said John Costello, the company's senior executive vice president. He said sales for December were expected to exceed $3.5 billion.
"One of the reasons that department stores were able to come back is that they have a wide base of merchandise," Mr. Konarski of the shopping-center council said. "Shoppers want choice."
Bloomingdale's, owned by Federated Department Stores, expected to squeak in with single-digit same-store sales -- branches operating for a year or more. "Our business in Florida, where we had no bad weather, was 10 percent ahead," said Michael Gould, the chief executive. "You look at that and say, 'Jeepers, creepers, what the Northeast could have been without the snow.' "
Indeed, the heavy snowfall "took about $3 million out of our business," said Philip Miller, chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue.
A spokeswoman from Macy's East, another Federated store, refused to comment, although Michael Steinberg, the chairman of Macy's West said, "The last three days were very strong."
Some categories of merchandise -- what Mr. Baum of Goldman, Sachs called "feel-good" items -- moved well. Those include tasty, naughty snacks, fruit-scented candles and bath oils, and cashmere. Fragrances and cosmetics were snapped up at all prices throughout the season, which might indicate that women shunned apparel for perfume and makeup. "Our cosmetics business is sensational," Mr. Miller of Saks said. "It was up 22 percent."
But for small specialty stores and discounters, bad news is around the corner. "This season is going to be very hard on retailers' fourth-quarter margins," Mr. Schaeffer at Dillon Read said. "We're going to see another large group of bankruptcies in first quarter."
In future years, the result may be that those who survive will be able to sell their wares without giving away the store, as consumers learn what it is to pay full price again.

HEADLINE: Doctors Try to Master Their Fate Through M.B.A.'s

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: IRVINE, Calif., Dec. 24

 BODY:
Doctors who hope to heal their profession, or at least their portfolios, are thronging graduate business schools, a few of which have begun pampering doctors and catering to their chaotic schedules.
The most elaborate of the programs begins Jan. 7 at the University of California at Irvine, where the charter class of 60 has an average annual income of $230,000. One student made $1.5 million last year. The class, which will meet for one long weekend a month at a palm-lined hotel on the coast of Orange County, costs $48,000 for two years (laptop computer included). 
 Admissions officials at several top business schools said that while their master's of business administration programs had always drawn a few doctors who wanted to run hospitals, the students in the new crop are worried about preserving their authority and income at a time when medicine is being driven increasingly by insurers and cost concerns.
"They realize that if they don't do this, they're on the defensive," said William K. Laidlaw Jr., the executive vice president of the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, an accrediting group.
Dennis J. Aigner, the dean of Irvine's Graduate School of Management, said the doctors were quite different from the aspiring tycoons who usually fill his seats. "People ask these docs, 'You make $230,000 a year. Why would you go to business school?' " Dr. Aigner said. "This isn't about making more money. This is about survival. They're faced with a significant decline in income."
Dr. Norman F. Sokoloff, 49, an orthopedic surgeon in Sunnyvale, Calif., plans to fly down to Irvine for each four-day session in his twin-engine Cessna. He said his profit had stagnated and then fallen as managed care had increased. "Physicians can become like an ant colony -- flushed away by the rain, because they don't have the tools to deal with it," Dr. Sokoloff said. "We have to learn how to ride this tide."
Dr. Sokoloff has plenty of company. Edmund J. Wilson, an associate dean at the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University, in Evanston, Ill., said: "We're getting them for part-time, full-time and non-degree programs. They've gone from essentially zero to a very noticeable presence."
Columbia Business School in Manhattan has five doctors in its full-time M.B.A. program and 11 in its program for executives. The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia has had at least five doctors in each weekend M.B.A. class for the past five years.
The University of South Florida in Tampa has graduated 100 doctors in three years from a doctors-only M.B.A. program where the students are called "execudocs." Classes begin with continental breakfast, and a brochure says the course is "designed to accommodate the most demanding schedules."
A few young doctors are getting a head start by finishing medical and M.B.A. degrees at the same time. David Axelrod, 26, who raced sailboats as an undergraduate at Harvard, is scheduled to get both degrees in May from Duke University in Durham, N.C.
Mr. Axelrod said the biggest conflict between the fields was that doctors focus on individuals, while business people think in aggregates. "Providing a heart transplant to a 65-year-old man is perfectly clinically logical," he said. "But denying it is economically logical. I want to help physicians to feel comfortable making some of these tough choices."
The charter class for Irvine's "health-care executive M.B.A." is 90 percent doctors, including commuters from Arizona, Nevada and Taiwan. The city of Irvine, named for a family that bought three vast Spanish ranches, is filled with Jaguars, bluff-top mansions and other totems of the upper crust.
Classes will meet at The Hyatt Newporter, a retreat overlooking Newport Beach's Back Bay. The classroom has a ceramic-tiled fireplace, and the students' rooms, each with a wrought-iron balcony, overlook a pool and golf course. "They'll have lunch out here in the garden each day. Sometimes out by the pool, depending on how our weather is," the catering director, Monica Mueller Cheeks, said during a tour.
The course has a waiting list of 20.
Ann C. Jennings, the program's director, said many applicants she met were discouraged and disillusioned by changes in their profession. Indeed, some admissions interviews seem to have taken the tone of crisis counseling.
"The doctors said they are being treated as contractors by some of the health care organizations," Ms. Jennings said. "They said they're told, 'If you can't deliver X patients in a day for X amount of dollars, then we'll go down the street and get someone who can.' "
One Irvine student, Dr. Arnold W. Malcolm, 51, a radiation oncologist in Burbank, said he wanted to be able to take on bureaucratic rules -- like having to send patients across town for tests simply because a health maintenance organization has a contract with a laboratory.
"Whether they're in a wheelchair or on a stretcher doesn't make any difference," Dr. Malcolm said. "The patient is coming second."
Another student, Dr. Paul A. De Ridder, a 49-year-old urologist in Santa Ana, Calif., said doctors who cannot talk the language of spreadsheets and efficiency could become "skilled laborers" for insurers.
"Medicine was always mom 'n' pop, where every doctor had his own office, and a nurse who had been there forever," Dr. DeRidder said. "Now, we're part of an integrated delivery system."

HEADLINE: Public Housing Project in North Dallas Spurs Lawsuit and Charges of Racism

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Dec. 24

 BODY:
A plan to build a low-income housing project in a predominantly white neighborhood, part of a seven-year effort to rid public housing here of what a court called "vestiges of racism," has led to a lawsuit by neighbors and countercharges that more than a vestige of racism remains.
The 75-apartment project is the first step by the Dallas Housing Authority to put into effect a Federal court directive calling for 474 units in predominantly white areas to reduce the concentration of poor people in the inner city. 
 Last May the housing authority acquired property in North Dallas, a mostly white area of horse pastures interspersed with 200-unit apartment complexes and $150,000-home developments.
After the project was announced, 14 homeowners' groups claiming to represent 2,600 local residents formed a consortium and sued to stop the project. They maintain that their legitimate concerns about property values and overloading of schools and police and fire services have been brushed off.
"This is not a bunch of people who are against people in public housing," says Cliff Whittle, a homeowner who lives about a quarter of a mile from the site of the proposed housing project. "It's an economic and fairness issue."
Mark Wilkinson, president of the consortium, said: "They wanted real bad for us to have a problem with the people. But we don't like the process. And I do know that unless this becomes something the community can embrace, it will fail."
But Alphonso Jackson, a black man who heads the housing authority, said the neighbors had other fears as well. "First, they have a legitimate concern about the loss of property value," he said. "I think they have a legitimate concern about crime. I think the third concern is basically race."
Mr. Jackson said the housing authority had taken steps to alleviate the first two concerns. "And the third, I can't do anything about," he said.
The controversy here is being played out in courts and neighborhoods all over the country, though not always with this degree of local resistance. Henry G. Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, has vowed to reverse three decades of public housing policy that has concentrated minorities and poor people in inner-city areas.
Mr. Cisneros has promoted a policy that seeks to disperse the poor through a combination of voucher programs, block grants and discrimination suits against those who oppose particular programs. He has also scrapped several plans to upgrade large public housing projects of an earlier era. But in Dallas, the impetus came through a lawsuit against city officials.
Eight years ago, Judge Jerry Buchmeyer of Federal District Court found that Federal, state and local officials had conspired to keep black residents in the huge and poorly maintained West Dallas Housing Project. Local public housing officials were ordered to tear down most of the project, a 3,493-unit complex built in the 1950's next to a lead smelter. The replacement units, Judge Buchmeyer ordered, were to be built in the white, middle-class areas of North Dallas.
Elected officials spent the next seven years trying to reverse Judge Buchmeyer's decision. By the time city officials conceded that they would have to comply with Judge Buchmeyer's order, there was not enough land available in North Dallas to build the 3,200 replacement units that the judge ordered.
In the end, it was agreed that the housing authority would build 474 permanent units, and about 2,700 families would be moved into existing housing through vouchers and certificates. The 75-apartment project is the first to be scheduled for construction.
The North Dallas homeowners' suit listed a number of alleged wrongs: violations of the Open Records Act and of the principle of states rights; misuse of taxpayer funds by paying too much for the property; inadequate public transportation for the low-income residents, and the strain the project would put on local schools and fire and police departments.
But the biggest problem, Mr. Wilkinson says, was being told that "we've already addressed your logical concerns."
"And the emotional concerns, we can't do anything about that," he added. "Something like this is a very emotional experience. So when they said they didn't need to hear from us, that led to the lawsuit."
The homeowners do not deny that racism exists. But they say they are not racists, and neither are their concerns based on racism. Instead, radio call-in shows and letters to the editor complain of "Big Brother," "social engineering" and "socialist judges."
At one point Representative Dick Armey, a Republican whose district includes North Dallas and who is the House majority leader, threatened to hold Congressional hearings on the housing authority's site-selection process.
But a spokeswoman for Mr. Armey said she did not know where the matter stood. "He was supposed to mention it to the Banking Committee chairman," she said on Friday. "I don't know whether he did."
Indeed, Mr. Jackson appears to have won the first round. In October, Judge Buchmeyer overruled the homeowners' objections and approved the housing authority purchase, clearing the way for groundbreaking to begin next May.
Mr. Jackson contended that the time to appeal Judge Buchmeyer's order had run out, but a lawyer for Mr. Wilkinson and the homeowners, Larry Friedman, said his clients had authorized an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit "just earlier this week."
Mr. Wilkerson says he knows he "has no hope of defeating the first site," but wants to appeal anyway to "set a precedent" for future battles. Indeed, the next fight could come in two or three weeks; Mr. Jackson hopes to have a second site under contract by then.
"Henry Cisneros made a big statement by tearing down that complex in Chicago," said Mr. Wilkinson, referring to Cabrini Green, a huge inner-city project. "This is going to be a wave across the nation. But they need to get the process right, because we don't need another series of failures."

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES;
Woman Works Toward a Career and Reunites With Daughter

BYLINE: By SARAH JAY 

 BODY:
Christmas will be sweet this year for Faith Bowman and her 8-year-old daughter, Catey. They may be poor, but they are living together, and that is more than they can say about last year.
Since they couldn't afford a Christmas tree, they have painted one on the kitchen wall, taping up colored paper ornaments and a shining yellow star. They have saved a little money for food, so dinner tonight will be ham, with sides of cornbread, collard greens and candied sweet potatoes made from "Sister Pamela's Soul Food Cookbook," a 25-cent find at a used book sale. 
 A year ago, they weren't doing as well. Ms. Bowman, 26, was living in Brooklyn with six housemates, earning her keep by having conversations with male callers to a telephone sex line. Catey was living in an unofficial foster home in Pittsburgh under the care of a woman she called Aunt Cindy.
The new year began tumultuously, when Ms. Bowman fell into a paranoid depression on Jan. 10. It was sparked, she said, by two puffs from a cigar wrapper filled with marijuana. She spent 17 days in the psychiatric ward at Harlem Hospital. It was an odious experience, she said, except for one moment of clarity in which she decided to become a photographer.
February was filled with errands -- buying a camera, going to therapy, compiling a portfolio, applying for public assistance and filling out an application for the two-year photography program at Parsons School of Design. She gave up drugs, alcohol and sex.
"From the minute I hit the street from that hospital, I have not stopped," Ms. Bowman said.
Her ambition unnerved her housemates, who were unemployed actors and writers and designers. She said they took her jewelry and clothes and then kicked her out, leaving her furniture on the sidewalk and defacing it with personal insults. In desperation, she moved in with a friend from high school, but he molested her, she said.
"I spent the whole month there scheming how to get out," she said.
She made her break in the middle of March, taking only her camera, her photographs and two pairs of underwear. For the next three nights, she slept in a chair at a drop-in center for the homeless in downtown Brooklyn. On the fourth morning, Ayn Steele, the director of a center for mentally ill homeless women, spotted Ms. Bowman.
"She looked so lost with those big glasses, and she was so thin," Ms. Steele said. "She was at sea."
Ms. Steele saw something hopeful and tragic in Ms. Bowman and invited her to live at the transitional living center in East New York. The center, one of five in New York City, is run by the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. For Ms. Bowman, rallying back from mental illness, the center was a stable, nurturing place.
"She said, 'If I don't do something now, I could just end up spiraling down and down and down,' " Ms. Steele said. "And she was right. She needed to get a grip."
Ms. Bowman's drive impressed the center's staff, and they made special allowances for her, letting her keep a camera in the dorm so she could build her portfolio.
When Parsons accepted her in April, Ms. Bowman cried for 10 minutes. She called her daughter, who had made up her mind to come home. Ms. Bowman promised an August reunion.
By May, she had found a subsidized apartment in Harlem -- two rooms and a kitchen for $215 a month -- but a snag in her benefits prevented her from moving out right away.
She stayed at the center and commuted to Parsons for a summer program, where she learned how to draw, sculpture and talk about art. As a final project, she stayed up until 3 A.M. designing a wire mask and covering it with scraps of fur and cloth that she found around the shelter. By morning, her fingers were blistered and bleeding.
It was August. Ms. Bowman felt secure and confident and ready to leave. She told the center's staff. "We can't let you go," she remembers them saying. "You don't have any benefits."
"Don't worry," Ms. Bowman said. "Something will happen. That's the way this year has been."
The center gave in, and they paid her first month's rent. "She asserted herself," said Arlan Dean, the center's housing coordinator. "She made it work."
Then came a $3,000 windfall from the Internal Revenue Service, which had finally verified her earned income tax credit. Catey came home on Aug. 21, and Ms. Bowman gave her a brush and paints and told her to decorate her bedroom. She made a mural of butterflies and fish. Ms. Bowman splashed her own walls with a pattern of yellow, orange and red brush strokes.
School began in September. Ms. Bowman paid the $8,550 tuition with loans. She was given a work-study job for $5 an hour. Besides food and rent, the tax refund went toward mandatory art supplies for herself and books and school fees for her daughter, who enrolled at an experimental public school near Parsons.
October was tough. The tax money was gone, and Ms. Bowman said welfare workers told her that anyone who could afford to attend Parsons could also buy food. They were wrong, she said, and she and Catey went hungry. The contents of their refrigerator dwindled to a vegetable or two. Catey was sometimes given meals from strangers who passed through the student lounge, which had become her second home. Once, a school friend took Ms. Bowman to the supermarket and bought her $60 in groceries.
November was better because the emergency food stamps finally came through, and they celebrated with a Thanksgiving dinner that could not be beat.
A few weeks ago, Ms. Bowman's teachers critiqued her first semester work. They praised her creative eye and assured her that once she had mastered the techniques of the darkroom, her photographs would be good enough to sell.
"I should be pretty proud of myself," Ms. Bowman said. "From January to now, I said what I was going to do and I did it, and I'm good at it and I love it and I got my kid back and I have an apartment."
Sometimes it doesn't seem real. But it is, and Ms. Bowman knows how to prove it.
"Mookie," she said, using her daughter's nickname. "Get my portfolio."

HEADLINE: Digital Studios: It's the Economy, Stupid;
George Lucas Sees Technology as a Wondrous Tool and a Cost-Cutter

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: NICASIO, Calif.

 BODY:
When George Lucas began the movie industry's love affair with computer technology on his first "Star Wars" adventure in 1977, Hollywood seized on the notion that computers, like the Force, would eventually make just about anything possible.
Now, after a series of major technological improvements, the fully digital studio has finally arrived. But for Mr. Lucas and other technology experts, the new equipment is still not being used to its full potential: bringing visual wizardry to the silver screen while reducing Hollywood's bloated budgets. 
 Most of the big movie companies use digital technology either just for editing or to create dazzling but extremely expensive special effects.
In Mr. Lucas's view, the studios have missed the point. In his eyes, digital technology, by reducing the need to shoot on exotic locations, build expensive props and film certain scenes over and over, is a practical tool, a means of telling stories on as grand a scale as a director wants, but on a reasonable budget.
"They don't get it," Mr. Lucas said of the big studios. "They're about five years behind. I don't think they understand what I do here."
Sitting amid the Victorian charm and powerful technology of his Skywalker Ranch here, he added: "The idea is not creating the perfect environment. It's creating the illusion of one."
The promise of the new entertainment technology is no different than in Henry Ford's Detroit in the 1920's. Computers, Mr. Lucas said, can give assembly-line efficiency to the business of illusion and entertaining audiences.
What Mr. Lucas is suggesting, in short, is that Hollywood go back to the future. Mr. Lucas says the model on which the digital studio is based is essentially the model of the studio that created "Gone With the Wind."
Before World War II, movie companies usually filmed against the backdrop of ersatz reality created in backlots from painted mattes. In the 1960's, films were increasingly shot on location to create greater verisimilitude. A movie was no longer a series of optical tricks that created an image of Africa, but actual images of Africa. In the process, movies became extraordinarily expensive one-of-a-kind endeavors.
Computers may be bringing back the old days. But this time the scenery will come not from a set department filled with mattes of different landscapes, but from disks on which scenery of everything from European cities to Asian villages will be stored digitally. An actor gesticulating against a blue screen at a lot in Los Angeles will eventually become a young man shaking hands with President Kennedy. The next Tara might be an antebellum mansion kept on a laser disk file indexed under the heading "Plantations," and the next Atlanta (pulled from a file labeled "Cities: 19th Century") might burn in the cold light of digital flames.
Currently, the greatest use of digital technology is not at the big studios but at specialized production houses like Pixar, Digital Domain and Industrial Light and Magic, a unit of Mr. Lucas's privately held Lucas Digital.
No big studio today, for instance, could create the computer-generated dinosaurs in "Jurassic Park," which were created by Industrial Light and Magic about three years ago.
But Hollywood is catching up, spending hundreds of millions of dollars to develop in-house digital capabilities. For instance, Silicon Graphics, whose work stations are frequently a component in the digital studio, has seen the percentage of its revenue -- $1.6 billion in 1994 -- from the entertainment industry grow from 5 to 15 percent in the last five years.
"I think it will eventually become the way almost all movies are made," said Thomas Pollack, the vice chairman of MCA Inc. and a former head of MCA's Universal Pictures. "You will be able to create just about all your backgrounds on the computer."
The newest studio attempting to create both a real and digital backlot is Dreamworks SKG. It has hired some of the most experienced computer experts in Hollywood to build what will be one of the best digital studios around, and a big part of the expense will be not just generating images, but storing them.
"We're putting heavy emphasis on storing images so they can be re-used, like an old studio with a costume and set library," explained Rob C. Hummel, one of the people creating the Dreamworks digital studio. "That's a big part of what the technology is all about. The model is very old-fashioned."
For Mr. Lucas, the best proof of Hollywood's tardiness in understanding the technology was "Waterworld," the futuristic seaborne epic that reportedly cost nearly $200 million to make. He said the movie could have been filmed at about half the cost by using digital technology and manufacturing many of the elaborate battle scenes flawlessly on terra firma rather than aboard wind-tossed ships. And, he suggested, the digital version would have looked better.
"There is no aesthetic advantage whatsoever" in shooting an action movie on location anymore, Mr. Lucas said. "The issue is economics."
Robert Sullivan, a vice president at Avid Technology, the maker of one of the most widely used digital film-editing machines, said: "Hollywood is a lot like Detroit. It's probably a 60- to 70-year-old business and it still sticks to a certain way of making its products."
Sony Pictures has worked harder than most movie companies to develop technologies, and a few months ago it hired Ken Ralston, one of Mr. Lucas's experts, to build an in-house digital studio. The company has committed itself to installing 100 computer work stations; the combined hardware and software cost for each runs about $200,000. The total cost will be at least $20 million.
Still, Sony officials agree the industry has a long way to go.
"In a fundamental way this is an industry that hasn't changed the way it does business in 70 years or so," said Kenneth S. Williams, an executive vice president in charge of Sony Pictures's computer technologies. "There was surprisingly little impact by technology on the way you assembled a movie until recently. Even now half the film editors don't know how to use this stuff."
The old process of making a movie has not been replaced by new digital technology, just changed incrementally. Scenes are still shot for the most part on 35-millimeter film with traditional optical cameras, which are regarded as a superior means of capturing images. But immediately after that, the film is put through what is called a telecine, a device that puts the image into digital form.
All subsequent editing and mixing of disparate landscapes and other elements takes place on computers, including the creation of digital characters like the T-1000 robot in "Terminator 2." An editor or director can instantaneously call up multiple takes of a scene, mix together different backgrounds or special effects and combine them with the ease of someone editing sentences on a word processor.
In the end, the final "cut" is still made on film, since that is how theaters exhibit movies.
Ed Granlund, post-production supervisor for Lucasfilm, Mr. Lucas's movie-making company, recently showed how the company was using digital technology to save time and costs.
He was editing a shot for an episode of "The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles," a television series produced by Mr. Lucas. The show has not been a great ratings success, but it has been a laboratory for Lucasfilm's techniques.
In one scene, Mr. Lucas wanted to show a troop ship unloading doughboys at a quay in Africa. The shot began with something that looked ridiculous: several men dressed in World War I garb, standing on a scaffold in the middle of an empty field near Prague, where the company happened to be doing some filming.
Then a troop ship was created using computer graphics. Some shabby storefronts, filmed at a museum, were put in place digitally; clouds and crates were painted in by computer artists. A shot that would have taken days to construct, if not weeks, took 12 hours and less than $10,000, about a tenth of the cost of live-action shooting, Mr. Granlund said.
One of the first full uses of the new technologies may be the new "Star Wars" trilogy Mr. Lucas is producing, as well as a special edition of the original trilogy of films.
In the special edition, Mr. Lucas said, he will resolve some long-standing irritations by using today's superior technology to produce scenes as he had originally envisioned them. For instance, when Luke Skywalker and his friends enter the desert city of Mos Eisley, the vistas will be far broader and the streets more detailed.
In the new trilogy, Mr. Lucas will still use 35-millimeter cameras to shoot most scenes and real actors will still play the key roles.
Mr. Lucas boasted that his new "Star Wars" movies would have an epic quality but cost $60 million to $70 million each, relatively modest sums by Hollywood standards.
But digital does not always mean economical. Since digital has become a buzzword in Hollywood, many producers have demanded digital effects even when they are more expensive than traditional techniques.
"One of my favorite words is techno-lust," Mr. Hummell of Dreamworks said. "It's one of those hype things. People want digital everything even if the old methods work just as well at less money."
And there are some directors and producers who argue that actors cannot perform as well talking to the air against a blue screen than on location. Mr. Lucas disagreed.
"Actors are paid to act," he said. "That's part of the job. It's not as emotionally satisfying, but it's more the way it was done in the early '30's. I'm going back to that earlier style."

HEADLINE: Coming Soon to Computers Everywhere, a World's Fair

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
It's hard to say no to Carl Malamud.
The 36-year-old Washington-based economist has successfully pushed, prodded, wheedled and occasionally even begged powerful corporate executives, Clinton Administration officials and foreign leaders to support his crusade to transform the Internet computer network into a combination of a global Main Street and digital Library of Alexandria.
Earlier this year Mr. Malamud's nonprofit research group, Internet Multicasting, pushed the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Patent and Trademark Office -- both kicking and screaming, initially -- into establishing public records distribution sites on the Internet.
Now that both sites are considered strong successes -- the S.E.C. system distributed more than two million documents in its first month of operation -- Mr. Malamud has set out on a much more ambitious effort to extend a high-speed, multimedia version of the Internet into more than 100 countries. The first step is to begin on New Year's Day, when he will open the first Internet world's fair, to be followed in February by the start of what he is calling the Internet railroad. (A preview of the fair can be seen at the World Wide Web site http://park.org/fair.) 
 The fair itself will be a digital exhibition set up on a vast global "farm" of computer disks located primarily in Tokyo, San Francisco, Washington and Amsterdam, and created by people in more than 60 countries during the next year. Besides offerings like an interactive history of wind energy at the Netherlands' national site, and other downloadable multimedia material specially designed for the fair, there will be recorded and live events like an interview with the Dalai Lama in early January and video coverage of the 25th anniversary of the Kennedy Center in April.
"The impact of the fair is huge in Japan," said Joichi Ito, a Japanese business executive who is helping organizing the fair there. "We have everyone focusing on it."
The railroad is actually an ambitious effort to create a globe-girdling digital pipe to carry the digital world's fair, fast enough to transport multimedia information -- sound, full-motion video and computer data. While the fair is scheduled to last only through the end of 1996, Mr. Malamud hopes the railroad will become a transport medium that endures into the future.
In the last year Mr. Malamud has circled the globe seven times himself, logging 250,000 air miles, meeting with government agencies, telephone company and computer executives and raising $100 million in contributions of technology and service to start the fair.
In Japan, for example, industry and government have contributed two high-speed digital backbone networks, two terabytes of computer disk space and an I.B.M. supercomputer to help turn the Tokyo neighborhood of Harajuku into a digital city, where people on the scene can tap into the Internet from cybercafes while people around the world can log in for interactive events.
Mr. Malamud has seized on the idea for the first Internet world's fair and the global railroad as an information-age analogy to the way world fairs in the earlier, industrial era helped to usher new technologies into widespread use.
The traditional world fairs "taught people about the world around them, but they also challenged engineers," Mr. Malamud said. "Most importantly, the world fairs, because of their scale and scope, proved to business and home consumers that the technology had a place in their lives."
As he prepares to put the fair -- the Internet 1996 World Exposition -- on line, he has assembled a dedicated chain of high-speed fiber-optic links capable of sending data at speeds as high as 155 million bits a second in an arc stretching from Taiwan, Korea and Japan in Asia to Finland, Sweden and Russia in Europe. By the end of 1996 Mr. Malamud hopes to stretch the Internet railroad fiber around the entire world. Along the way he has assembled endorsements from presidents including Bill Clinton and Boris N. Yeltsin and has occasionally left some of those who have suffered his prodding a little exasperated.
"I've ended up doing more lobbying for Carl Malamud than I have for some heads of state," said a Federal official who has been called on repeatedly to help gain commitments for the project.
In an era when the Internet has become synonymous with commercialism and instant fortunes, Mr. Malamud's commitment to public service has set him apart.
"This is an individual moving companies and countries by the strength of his will and the obvious goodness of his ideas," said Larry Landweber, a computer scientist who is president of the Internet Society, an international organization that oversees the Internet's standards. "He's an evangelist."
For Mr. Malamud it is all part of the work that has been his passion since the early 1980's when he was first introduced to computer networking while studying economics as an undergraduate at Indiana University, where he subsequently got an M.B.A. A decade later he became an early volunteer helping to create the Interop conference, a computer-networking industry trade show that was one of the first venues to demonstrate the potential of the Internet.
With the financial help of Dan Lynch, an Interop founder, Mr. Malamud set out in 1991 as a self-described "Official Internet Explorer," physically traveling around the world three times in his quest to visit as many nodes on the Internet as possible and meet as many of the people who were building the network infrastructure as he could.
That project led to his 1992 book "Exploring the Internet: a Technical Travelogue," a chatty account of the then-little known elite that built the Internet, before it became a household word.
The idea of a cyberspace world's fair was hatched in late 1994 when Mr. Malamud was talking with Vinton Cerf, a designer of the original technical protocols -- communications software standards -- for the Internet. Inspired by the idea, he immediately hopped on a plane to persuade two Internet experts, Jan Murai of Japan and Rob Blokzijl of the Netherlands, whom he had met on his original global tour, to sign on to the idea.
Today Mr. Malamud maintains that there are still two ways to build the Internet. One is the high-stakes, high-visibility route of initial public offerings in the stock market, the money-raising approach being pursued by people like Netscape Communication's founders, Jim Clark and Mark Andreeson. The other route, Mr. Malamud maintains, is by soliciting funds and building viable public works projects that benefit the common good.
Mr. Malamud takes pains to point out that he hasn't organized the fair by himself. There are now hundreds of people working on the project around the world, including some of the Internet's best technical experts.
Chris Swanson, a technical advise from SSDS, a network consulting firm in Englewood, Colo., is global project manager on a piece of the project known as the World's Central Park. Marten Tepstra, a special-projects engineer from Bay Networks Inc., is global project manager on the Internet railroad, responsible for installing and maintaining the router computers that will keep the global traffic flowing over the railroad.
The effort, Mr. Malamud said, did not compete with the current rush to commercialize the Internet. "People don't move to towns without parks and roads and schools," he said. "It's a viable part of the global business."

HEADLINE: Essay;
And on Earth, Freedom

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"Peace on Earth" cannot be achieved until the other part of the Christmas message comes to pass: "good will toward men."
I read that last phrase -- with the translation of "men" dutifully updated to "one another" -- in its broadest modern sense, to mean "an embrace of the yearning of the human spirit for freedom." 
 The blessing of liberty is what a minority of Russians are reaching for today. If democracy holds its own, bringing prosperity in its wings, that lesson cannot be lost on China, redoubt of repression. But if freedom loses, Cold War III will begin.
That's what makes the Russian presidential election of 1996 even more important to Americans than our own Presidential election.
Last week, in a kind of primary, candidates of the Communist Party and its agrarian ally won almost a third of the seats in the legislature. That was more than expected, though not all that surprising, given the ire of 30 million inflation-wracked pensioners and a government fighting inflation by delaying checks to pensioners and workers.
The rest of the new Duma is divided among three groups: (1) Zhirinovsky nationalists, whose percentage was halved; (2) Yeltsin government supporters led by Chernomyrdin, vaguely reformist but more interested in retaining the presidency, and (3) reformers led by Grigori Yavlinski, the only outspoken democrat whose party is left standing.
What did last week's preliminaries augur for Russia's coming presidential campaign?
The field is narrowed to four probable candidates: the two Z's (the communist Zyuganov and the nationalist Zhirinovsky); either Yeltsin if he decides to run or his Prime Minister, Chernomyrdin, and Yavlinski.
Which two will make it to the runoff? With three movements (communist, nationalist, reformist) and four candidates, you don't have to be a Russian pollster to figure out the morning line: Yeltsin or Chernomyrdin will splinter Yavlinski's reformist vote, leaving the two Z's running in the final round.
That would face Russians with a terrible choice: backward to Lenin or further backward to the Tsar.
How can the hugely unpopular Yeltsin avert this?
One way is to follow the legislative election returns away from the privatization of land, and toward the Communist platform. "Last time, Zhirinovsky's strong showing led Yeltsin into war in Chechnya," says Grigory Yavlinski. "This time, if the Communist showing leads Yeltsin's government away from reform, that would be economic disaster for Russia."
Another way to stop the two Z's would be to postpone elections. But democracy cannot be preserved by dictatorial means. Russian voters, who turned out in greater percentages than Americans, deserve the right to make their own mistakes.
Another way to avert the two-Z choice would be for Yeltsin to decline to run, take Chernomyrdin out, and embrace Yavlinski. But that would be the kiss of death for the reformers, who must keep their distance from the regime so despised by voters angry at the predations of the government's botched reform.
The only other way I can see for Yeltsin to steer his country between the Scylla of communism and Charybdis of nationalism is to subtly help the reformers not tainted by service in his government. Reformers say that government powers in last week's election were used far more against them than against the two Z's.
A Yeltsin decision to help rather than hinder reformers would require a new fairness in coverage on government TV and an end to the relentless harassment of party organization -- as well as a way of executing new communist legislative acts so as to make the communists look foolish or dangerous.
But Yeltsin, though cunning, is hardly subtle. He is more likely to run as a semi-communist making nationalist noises, and lose, than to quietly slip the torch to reformers unable and unwilling to associate themselves with his economic failures.
That's why peace on earth faces a political test half a year ahead: its precondition, freedom for the human spirit, is in danger of a setback in Russia.

Capitalists in China, Hand Over Fist

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
Tomorrow night's two-hour visit to what the producers title "The Wild East" concentrates on the new capitalists who are running amok in Communist China. For this very small but growing group of entrepreneurs and operators -- someone calls them former Red Guards in Armani suits -- life seems to be fun and games and moneymaking. The wisecrack going around Beijing is that the Forbidden City has been turned into the for-business city. Mao Zedong, still an icon, must be spinning wherever the spirits of Chinese Marxists spin.
It's a somewhat unfocused tour, venturing here and there through time and space as if the producer, Peter Kaufman, were having difficulty filling up his own time and space. The program is most pointed when Mr. Kaufman's Chinese acquaintances tell of the persecution of the educated class during the Cultural Revolution and speculate gloomily on the consequences of the capitalist revolution. 
 Attention is drawn to old-fashioned but still current Government repression, to up-to-date forms of corruption, to the unemployment that has turned millions into itinerant job hunters and to the industrial pollution that is being permitted to foul the air in the service of development. Inhabitants of Hong Kong, which is to return Chinese rule in 1997, voice their special worries, and ethnic and religious stirrings, especially among China's big Muslim population, portend other troubles.
Yet "The Wild East" diverts as it moves somewhat eccentrically between dire news and cheery travelogue. You can see Mongolian women on horseback slam-dunking in an exhibition of horse basketball, and hear from Russian women of the night who have been imported for the pleasure of the new Chinese millionaires. You can also listen in on a discussion among young Chinese women about the virtues of sex before marriage.
Flourishing enterprises -- restaurants, stock exchanges, private clubs, religious temples, discos -- are seen in action. And in a change of pace, there is a time-warped pop singer, who learned his craft from Crosby-Hope and Astaire-Rogers movies, crooning "On a Slow Boat to China."

HEADLINE: Don't Blame Schools for Budget Pinch;
Plight of the City

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross (Op-Ed, Dec. 18) makes statistical comparisons that present a distorted picture of educational financing in New York City from 1980-1993. 
 To justify cuts in state education spending, Ms. Ross blames the misuse of public funds for the problems in our schools. She claims that school spending increased from 1980 through 1993, while enrollment remained steady. New York City spends $3,500 per pupil less than surrounding suburban districts.
It is not an accident that Ms. Ross selected 1980 as the base year for her analysis. In 1980, New York City was still suffering through a major fiscal crisis that produced sharp cuts in its education budget. Within the next few years, as the economy improved, school spending returned to more normal levels; capital improvements and routine maintenance were resumed and teacher salaries unfrozen. She represents this restored budget as if it were a funding increase.
In addition, her comparison of 1980 and 1993 hides the actual pattern of change in school enrollment. Instead of remaining steady, enrollment declined from 1980 through 1990 and increased by more than 6 percent after 1991.
Ms. Ross ignores the large amount New York City is required to spend on remedial and special education programs. Sixty percent of the educationally disadvantaged youth eligible for services in the state live in New York City. Also, the number of children in special education programs, which cost nearly five times the amount spent on regular education students, doubled between 1979 and 1994.

NEW YORK CITY
 
Is It a Taxi or a Bus?
To ease traffic congestion between 30th and 60th Streets in Manhattan, the Giuliani administration is planning to designate specially marked taxi stops as the only places for cabbies to pick up and drop off passengers between 10 A.M. and 4 P.M. on weekdays. The change could permanently alter a cherished tradition of to-the-door taxi service for many New Yorkers, though some questioned how readily it would be accepted. [Page 41.]
 
Bronx Democrats End Feud
The public end of the feud last week between Representative Jose E. Serrano and Roberto Ramirez, the State Assemblyman who is also the Democratic Party leader in the Bronx, is seen as an important step in uniting the Bronx Democratic Party as its favorite son, Borough President Fernando Ferrer, prepares for a possible challenge against Mayor Giuliani in 1997. The yearlong feud splintered the borough's Hispanic political leaders and left the Democratic Party in the Bronx in turmoil. [41.]
 
A Subway Fable, Set to Music
The experts say that David Allakhverdov is not quite ready for Carnegie Hall, but that was not the verdict of the subway commuters passing through Grand Central Terminal on the way to the shuttle. What is certain, however, is that David, who came to New York from Tashkent, Uzbekistan, 14 months ago, is on the upward arc of a remarkable odyssey. [41.]

2 Are Shot Dead at a Party
Shots rang out at a 15th birthday party in a church hall in Manhattan, leaving two men dead. Alma Miranda, who was celebrating her coming out party, said that she did not know the victims, nor had she invited them to her party. [43.]
 
Mother Held in Son's Beating
The mother of a 3-year-old boy was arraigned yesterday on charges she abused the child by beating and burning him. The mother, Judith Frade, 34, was arrested Saturday after she took her unconscious son to the emergency room of St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx and told doctors that the boy had accidentally drunk her supply of methadone, the police said. But doctors said the boy had black eyes, burn marks on his buttocks and arms and "numerous scars from past assaults." [43.]
 
Questions Resurface on Paint
A high-ranking Fire Department official said four months ago that layers of old paint thought to have contributed to a rash of stairwell fires in housing projects should be removed -- a recommendation the city rejected in favor of covering it with a fire-retardant coating. But Fire Commissioner Howard Safir has acknowledged that removing the old paint might turn out to be necessary. [43.]
 
A Supermarket Lures Crowds
The Fairway supermarket in Harlem has been luring crowds from around New York since the warehouse-style grocery opened on Dec. 19 at 133d Street and 12th Avenue. A visit provided a glimpse into just who the megamarket's customers are: many of them are from other parts of Manhattan, and relish the chance to have the best of suburban shopping a short car or subway ride away. [44.]
 
REGION
 
A Culture at a Turning Point
From New York to Los Angeles, Japanese-Americans, the most integrated of Asian-American groups, are at a turning point in their century-long history in the United States. Many fear that their culture -- which has the highest intermarriage rate of any ethnic group in the country -- is dying and that there will never be enough new immigration from Japan to reinvigorate it. [1.]
 
Final Stretch to the Holiday
If, for many, the Christmas season is a marathon -- an overtime-working, airline-queuing, all-day-shopping, hot-stove-slaving test of endurance -- then yesterday was the final sprint. By noon, the aisles of department stores were beginning to resemble rush-hour subways in places, and many a caterer was mired in giant mounds of mashed potatoes, but the sense that the relaxation of Christmas Day was just around the corner made it all more bearable for many. [1.]
 
For Retailers, Season of Woe
Hardened shoppers, perpetual sales and a snowstorm that blanketed the Northeast in the crucial final week of Christmas shopping combined to give retailers their worst holiday seasons in years, analysts, economists and other retail experts said. And things won't get better for retailers, many experts said, until more go out of business, reducing the competition. [1.]
 
The Saints Kept Marching Out
It was the week before Christmas, and at the Coreglia Studios in North Bergen, N.J., the saints -- in 12-inch, 18-inch, 24-inch and 32-inch varieties -- were marching out. Walter Baldaccini's small, family-run company, which specializes in plaster and concrete statues of saints and other religious figures, has been doing a robust business in religious statuary this year. "We got grottos, we got angels, we've got just about every saint there is," Mr. Baldaccini said. [1.]
 
In Bosnia for Christmas
The arrival in Bosnia and Herzegovina of 17 soldiers from the Second Brigade went off without a hitch. On this day that celebrates a miraculous birth, Pvt. Eric Nazario, 20, from Astoria, Queens, said he was thinking about his new bride, Lillian, 19, and the child they expect to be born by Valentine's Day. [1.]

CORRECTION-DATE: December 26, 1995, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article and a front page photograph yesterday about new taxi stops in midtown Manhattan offered apparently conflicting information. The article correctly stated that the taxi stops, to be created next month, would be in use from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. It did not mention that the city had already set up two experimental stops, in use from 7 A.M. to 1 P.M. The photograph showed one of the experimental stops.

HEADLINE: Change in Census Survey Definition Could Halve the Number of U.S. Farms

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 25

 BODY:
The nation could lose nearly half its farms before the year 2000 -- on paper at least.
Because Congress cut its budget, the Census Bureau has made plans to survey far fewer farms when it draws its next detailed profile of American agriculture, in 1997. 
 The plan, which would be part of an appropriations bill, would have the bureau count only farms that sell $10,000 or more of crops or livestock a year, up from $1,000 now. The number of farms would plunge from 1.9 million to one million as a result. Farming would be measured only as a business and not as a way of life.
But more is at stake than mere numbers. Universities receive Federal research and extension dollars based in part on the number of farms in their states. A cutoff would fall particularly hard on the Southeast. West Virginia would lose close to 80 percent of its farms, and Tennessee nearly 70 percent. The Middle West would lose the fewest farms, with the number in Iowa and Nebraska dropping by 20 percent each.
"It will have an impact bigger than just the cost savings of increasing the size of the farms," said Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
Backers say the new threshold makes economic sense -- the 900,000 farms consigned to statistical oblivion do not add that much to the farm economy. The farms, averaging 136 acres, accounted for only 2 percent of all agricultural sales in 1992, the last survey year. Most ran at a loss. Many kept horses and raised hay, more hobbies than real enterprises.
"Many of these places are not farms in a commercial sense, but rather the rural residences of people who work at nonfarm jobs," the bureau said in a paper listing the pros and cons of the change.
Although the change looks drastic, it is not really revolutionary. Counting for inflation, the $10,000 threshold would come close to the $500 set in 1890, backers say.
Selling three feeder steers or maybe a dozen hogs would push a farmer over the $1,000 edge, depending on prices and weights. The corn off five acres would do the same.
The vanishing farms add to family earnings and food supplies in many poor parts of the country, counters Ronald C. Wimberley, a rural sociology professor at North Carolina State University and member of an outside committee that advises the Census Bureau.
The farms sell important shares of some goods while buying lots of supplies and equipment. They sold 1 percent of corn and less than 2 percent of wheat and soybeans in 1992. But they raised nearly 8 percent of the tobacco, 19 percent of blackberries, 4 percent of cattle, 8 percent of sheep and lambs, 30 percent of pecans and 38 percent of persimmons. They kept more than half the horses and ponies while raising 10 percent of the hay and silage.
Agencies and researchers would have a harder time figuring out whether farms may be adding to pollution, Mr. Wimberley said in a letter to the Democratic staff of the House Agriculture Committee.
About three-quarters of farms owned by blacks would be written out of existence, the number dropping to 4,567. Farms run by women would drop to 50,292 from 145,516.
The bureau is seriously considering the proposal because Congress gave it $10 million for its farm survey in 1996, when it must start designing forms and mailing lists for the 1997 farm census. The bureau had received $13 million for 1995. Using the $10,000 threshold would save up to $3.6 million, the agency said. But the census language is in a Commerce Department spending bill that President Clinton vetoed last week, so decisions are not final.

Second Phone Lines A Sign of the Times
In the days when keeping up with the Joneses required a high-capacity station wagon, not a high-speed modem, having a second telephone line at home was a luxury, necessary only if a family had several teen-agers.
But this year, in the biggest single-year increase in new residential phone lines in the United States since the end of World War II, seven million households have had additional lines installed, as several information-age forces have ignited into a social phenomenon. And now it is often the parents who are tying up the lines, and propelling demand. [Page A1.]
 
Changes in Electric-Car Rule
California is backing away from a requirement that in about two years, 2 percent of cars sold there must be electrically powered. Critics are calling the move a capitulation to the automobile and oil industries. But some auto experts said the change was a practical one because today's technology cannot produce an electric vehicle that customers would want to buy. [A14.]
 
Russian-Italian Deal Founders
Russia's biggest privatization deal involving a foreign company stalled when the Government said that Stet, an Italian state telecommunications company, had pulled out of an agreement to buy a 25 percent stake in Svyazinvest, a Russian phone company. [D3.]
 
A Faster Youth Lane at Toyota
Toyota has abolished rules that specify how long an employee must stay in one job before a promotion. The move, intended to make it easier for young staff members to rise to junior management positions, foreshadows a possible change in the way the company chooses senior executives. [D3.]
 
Gambling Jobs in Atlantic City
As the 20th anniversary of New Jersey's vote to legalize gambling approaches, the industry's big promises -- that the casinos' wealth would spill over, enriching residents -- are beginning to become a reality. And while Atlantic City has hardly been converted into a utopia, there are now many jobs available for high school graduates. [A1.]
 
Machine-Tool Orders Rise
Orders for American-made machine tools, the devices that cut and shape metal for products ranging from toasters to tractors, fell for the first time in two months. The sharp decline suggested further weakness in American manufacturing. [D2.]
 
Not Exactly A Signature Move
With print ads for the Bradford Exchange promising that its commemorative plate honoring Michael Jordan will be "graced by a facsimile of Michael Jordan's autograph," will the next Bradford plate be covered in genuine imitation leatherette or swathed in 100 percent acrylic? It's time to ask 20 questions about advertising, marketing and the media. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D5.]
 
Relief in Sight?
After surging to heady heights through the first three quarters of the year, the shares of securities firms have fallen. They are now trading at close to the same prices they commanded at the end of September 1993, forcing investors to reach for their Alka-Seltzer. Market Place. [D4.]
 
Coca-What?
Russia has its vodka, Germany has its beer, France has its wine, but Peru has Inca Kola -- a fruity, greenish-yellow carbonated drink that many Peruvians savor almost as much as many Britons enjoy their afternoon tea. [A4.]

Bed, Bath and Beyond
Frequent travelers, used to finding the Gideon Bible in hotel rooms, are encountering a number of other religious texts as well these days, like the Book of Mormon and the Teachings of Buddha. [A14.]

Jobless Rate in Japan Reached A Record of 3.4% in November

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, Dec. 26

 BODY:
Japan's jobless rate jumped to a record 3.4 percent in November, the Management and Coordination Agency said, the highest since it began collecting unemployment figures in 1953.
The number of unemployed rose 17.8 percent on the year, to 3.3 million, the agency said. The nationwide labor force shrank three-tenths of 1 percent in November from a year earlier, to 64.39 million. 
 Economists polled by Bloomberg Business News had expected November's unemployment rate to stay at 3.2 percent, where it had remained for the last five months.
As in past months, the greatest job losses came at manufacturing companies and among young people and middle-aged men.
For those younger than 25, some 6 percent were without jobs, and for men between 55 and 64, 5 percent were unemployed, the agency said.
Manufacturers are cutting costs to offset weak demand, falling prices and the still-strong yen. Small manufacturers unable to cope are going out of business, forcing workers out of jobs.
The jobless figures cast a shadow on recent signs, ranging from profit growth to rising capital investment, that Japan's economy is recovering after a four-year slowdown.
The report showed that compared with a year ago, some 380,000 manufacturing jobs were lost, a decline of 2.5 percent to 14.62 million, the agency said. Agriculture lost some 100,000 workers, down 3 percent from a year earlier, to 3.20 million.
The service industry, by absorbing many of those workers, has become Japan's biggest employer. Service job growth slowed to an increase of one-tenth of 1 percent on the year to 15.50 million. In October, service job growth was 1.3 percent.
Employment in the construction and retail-wholesale industries -- the remaining two broad categories in the report -- also rose.Retail and wholesale employment rose eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 14.63 million. Construction jobs rose 2.3 percent, to 6.77 million, the agency said.
Among women, the jobless rate was 3.3 percent, unchanged from October. Among men, it rose to 3.4 percent from 3.2 percent.
By Western standards, Japan's jobless rate is extremely low. The United States, for example, is running a 5.6 percent unemployment rate. In Germany, the rate is 9.3 percent, and in Canada, the rate is 9.4 percent.
Japan's low rate is partly due to the nature of the Japanese labor market and a narrower definition of unemployment. Jobless workers not actively looking for work are not counted as unemployed. And those who have worked for even one hour during the month are considered employed.

HEADLINE: Elderly Couple Die in a Fire In Brooklyn

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
For four days, with ice clinging to their window sills and no heat in their apartment, an elderly couple in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, resorted to a space heater to survive the winter chill. Early yesterday, fire officials said, that Hobson's choice killed them.
Florian Teraskiewicz, 75, and his wife, Irene, 69, died when a three-alarm fire raged through their apartment, burning their bodies so badly that at first, firefighters said, it was impossible to tell their age or sex, much less who they were. Inspectors said the blaze began about 2 A.M. with a faulty wire in the electrically powered oil-filled heater that the couple were using to ward off the raw cold. 
 Other residents in the building at 43d Street and Eighth Avenue, who were forced to flee into the snow-piled street before Christmas Day had dawned and were left temporarily homeless by the fire, said they had been without central heat since Thursday. They said they had been unable to reach their secretive landlord -- a man whose last name they did not know, who accepted rent payments only in cash and who, they said, had repairs done badly, if at all.
"He doesn't care if there's no heat," said Sixto Rivera, 54, one of the tenants. "He just cares if he gets paid."
There were other fire victims around the city yesterday, including an unidentified woman who was killed in what fire officials labeled a suspicious blaze in a vacant building in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn. And another fire damaged an apartment house on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
The Sunset Park fire, at 807 43d Street, was first reported at 2:08 A.M. and was not brought under control until 3:34 A.M., said Firefighter George Semidey, a Fire Department spokesman. Before it was over, he said, 21 units and 160 firefighters were involved in the fight.
While the fire did not spread beyond the top floor of the three-story building, a river of water from firefighters' hoses soaked much of the building, particularly a vacant unit directly below the one that burned. The water knocked out electrical power, forcing residents to move in with friends and relatives.
Neighbors said that Mr. and Mrs. Teraskiewicz, a friendly but private couple, had lived quietly in their two-bedroom, third-floor apartment for more than 40 years, raising children there, including a son, Al, who lived with them. In a working class neighborhood that is now heavily Hispanic and Chinese, they were holdovers from a time when Sunset Park was largely Scandinavian, Polish and German.
The family had been touched by tragedy before, neighbors said, with the deaths in recent years of two of the Teraskiewicz's grown children. They said the elder Mr. Teraskiewicz, known as Terry, could barely walk.
It was the Teraskiewicz's son who alerted the others in the building yesterday, including the Riveras, whose Christmas Eve party was just winding down.
"He came down and pounded on our door and yelled: 'Fire! Fire! Get out!," said Mr. Rivera, a doorman at a Manhattan apartment building who lives on the second floor with his wife, Miriam, and the youngest of their six children, William, 19.
His son Sixto Jr., said, "He said, 'My parents are up there.' He said he couldn't get them out."
The elder Mr. Rivera said he ran up to the Teraskiewicz apartment and opened the door, only to be driven back by a gale of heat and flame.
The younger Mr. Teraskiewicz was taken to Maimonides Medical Center and was treated for trauma, then released. A Fire Department lieutenant was treated at the same hospital for a cut on the nose.
Residents said the building was bought five or six years ago by a man they knew only as David, who refused to give them his telephone number and whom they saw only every few months. They said they could contact him only through a clerk at Economy Discount Wines and Liquors, on the ground floor of the building. When they complained that there was no heat, they said, the store clerk told them, "Call David," and refused to contact the landlord for them, even when they protested that they did not have his number.
The tenants said they paid their rent, in cash, to the liquor store clerk, who has never given them his name. The store was not open yesterday.
Yesterday morning, the landlord appeared at the building after the fire, but left quickly when confronted by Mr. Rivera about problems in the building.
Mrs. Rivera said that when she reported the lack of heat to the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the operator said city records still had the previous owner listed as the landlord, with no mention of the mysterious David. Department officials could not be reached yesterday for comment.
There was a minor electrical fire in the building two weeks ago, and residents said it was caused by an contractor renovating the vacant apartment. "Every time we have a problem with the building, the landlord gets unlicensed people to work on it," William Rivera said. "He doesn't want to spend any money to get professionals to do it."
Hours after the fire, Mr. Rivera stood outside, still wearing the double-breasted suit he had donned for the party, his shoes crunching glass from windows that were broken by firefighters, and examined a soggy pile of debris -- mattresses, lamps, clothes -- that had been thrown from apartment windows. His own apartment, he said, would be fine with a little work. "We got lucky," he said.
The Crown Heights fire, in a vacant, three-story brick building at 1092 Pacific Street, near Franklin Avenue, was being investigated by fire marshals, who called it suspicious. The two-alarm blaze was reported at 9:18 A.M. and brought under control at 10:46 A.M.
A woman in her 40's, whom firefighters found in the building, was taken to Brooklyn Jewish Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.
Earlier, a three-alarm fire struck a five-story brick apartment building at 180 West 81st Street, at Amsterdam Avenue, in Manhattan. It started in the ceiling above a restaurant on the ground floor, but the cause was not clear, Firefighter Semidey said. The fire, reported at 12:21 A.M. and brought under control at 1:58 A.M., damaged only the first floor and caused no injuries, he said.

HEADLINE: Big Bang Hits the Johannesburg Stock Exchange

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG

 BODY:
Probably no bourse in the world is quite as naked about money worship as the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Where others have a bell or a clock, it has two huge, bejeweled chalices modeled on those in the temple of Moneta, where Rome's money was stamped. Between them is a wall of stained-glass windows representing mining, transportation and the other industries that make this the richest country in Africa.
Soon all this medievalism will be gone, though, replaced by the 21st-century version of the same cathedral: an exchange in a mainframe presiding over a far-flung congregation of computers. 
 Twenty years after Wall Street and 10 years after London, the world's 12th-largest stock exchange is in the middle of its own Big Bang.
Some critics have dismissed it as the Little Whimper, but others say that even though the changes may not be original or earth-shaking, they signal some big shifts in one of the world's most insular economies. Eventually, South Africa may be changed economically as much as it has been politically, entering the world of free-market capitalism from which it was long largely excluded.
Phase One of the Big Bang began last month, when foreigners and South African banks and insurance companies were allowed to buy seats on the exchange, no longer forced to go through the clubby group of 46 brokerage houses.
Eleven of those houses, eager to protect themselves in the free-wheeling world to come, have already allied themselves with local banks or been bought by American, British or Swiss institutions. Merrill Lynch now controls the Davis Borkum Hare brokerage. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, the Equitable Companies' securities unit, and Doley Securities of New Orleans have made overtures to others.
The more important Phase Two is scheduled to begin on March 1 with the abolition of fixed commissions. Commissions and taxes on buying and selling a 10,000-rand block of stock -- about $2,800 worth -- now add up to about $126. That will be negotiable, and discount brokers will presumably spring up.
Disclosure requirements are to be strengthened, though they won't be nearly as tough as in the United States.
And most important, the exchange floor itself, where each deal is recorded on chalkboards and scribbled down on scrip, will be replaced by a computer.
Now, "you go stand under the board and scream the name of your stock as if it were fruit and vegetables," said Colin Goldstein, a trader for Cahn Price Shapiro.
That's part of what makes the market feel like a boys' schoolyard. The cork wall tiles are a porcupine of paper airplanes. On a recent trading day -- just before the 1 P.M. lunch break -- a few brokers with ties as loud as their voices were crying their wares. A few more were squinting at the chalkboards through binoculars. But the biggest bunch was glued to television sets -- a cricket match against England was on.
Maurice Fisher, a 16-year veteran with Frankel Pollak Vinderine, said he would miss the camaraderie. But Mr. Goldstein, a trader for only two years, looks forward to computer trading. Now, he said, "a seller -- and some of them are idiots -- can mess you around. He can give his friend more than he gives you, even if you were first."
But these changes are only cosmetic if they don't lead to bigger things. The officials who run the economy are hoping the changes will lead to a more liquid market, less secrecy and more foreign capital.
Right now, nearly 80 percent of the stock of exchange-listed companies is in the hands of five conglomerates: Anglo American, the Sanlam Group, the Rembrandt Group, the Liberty Group and S A Mutual. Individual investors are rare. Most buying is done by banks, by pension funds and insurers -- which are part of the conglomerates -- and by mutual funds. There are only 70 mutual funds -- called unit trusts -- versus about 5,300 in the United States.
"The big institutions don't sell," Mr. Fisher said. If they did, he said, it could take three or four years to unwind such major positions.
In fact, South Africa's market is less liquid than most stock exchanges its size. Judging by market capitalization, South Africa ranks near Hong Kong and Australia, but based on the value of stocks that are actually traded, it ranks among such small exchanges as Austria and the Philippines.
The market's concentration, said Beth Mandel, director of Morgan Stanley's operations here, can be seen in how her firm adjusts its value. The exchange says the total value of all the companies it lists -- normally a simple figure to calculate -- is $270 billion. But because so many companies own big chunks of one another, Morgan Stanley's emerging markets index pegs its value at only about $108 billion.
This concentration has several causes. After harsh exchange controls were put in place when capital began fleeing after the 1961 Sharpeville Massacre, foreign investors, unable to take profits out, shied away. South African companies -- already big because mining has high fixed costs -- had no outlet for profits except to buy up other South African companies.
"The Big Bang is pretty marginal until you get other reforms like relaxing exchange control," Ms. Mandel said. "But it's unfair to call it the Little Whimper. It's one sign that the economy is aligning itself with international norms. Given their history, I think it's incredible how quickly things are changing."
The exchange was under reform pressure from several fronts:
*Nervous foreign investors, realizing that the nation is held together by more than baling wire and Nelson Mandela's halo, are showing more interest. Emerging-markets mutual funds, in particular, are buying South African stocks. The entire continent of Africa accounts for only about 2 percent of the world's market capitalization, but the Johannesburg Stock Exchange accounts for about 95 percent of that.
*Exchange controls are slowly loosening and were dropped entirely for foreigners in April. The central bank now allows locals to do "asset swaps" in which, for example, a South African trades stock in Anglo American to an American who has stock in I.B.M.
*Three years ago, the country's banks, frustrated over exchange rules, threatened to set up a parallel exchange rate. Now seven banks have bought into brokerages or set up trading arms.
*Nearly 90 exchange-listed companies are traded in London or through American depository receipts, so local brokers risked being outflanked and forgotten.
Brokers like Lance Coogan, asked why the changes took so long, tend to shrug and answer: "Hey -- we're in Africa."
But Roy Andersen, the exchange's president, wants a "formidable total package" of changes to be carefully managed. The advantage of being late, he said, is that "we're cherry-picking the best out of various baskets.
"We commissioned Ernst & Young to research 31 exchanges -- not only the big, sexy ones, but more relevant ones like Malaysia," he said. "Our rules for disclosure are basically London's. Our capital requirements are the European Union's. And our automated system was created by the Chicago Stock Exchange and is used by Manila and Bangkok."
Asked if he thought Wall Street and London traders will move in with sharp elbows, Mr. Andersen said, "Look -- the reality of the matter is that South Africa has to compete in world markets. I hate to use this analogy, but just as our sportsmen are learning to be world champions, our members will, too."

The Drug Enforcement Administration has agreed to help South African authorities choke off a new drug pipeline in their country created by Nigerian narcotics traffickers who want to make South Africa a transit point for Asian heroin destined for the United States.
Thomas Constantine, the agency's administrator, said he will visit South Africa in January to discuss the cooperation, which was requested by the Government of President Nelson Mandela. 
 Until now, the Drug Enforcement Administration has only monitored drug trafficking in Africa out of its office in Cairo. But Mr. Constantine said in an interview that he wanted to set up another office in Johannesburg to give technical assistance to the South African police.
"We can put people in there," Mr. Constantine said. "We can give South African narcotics authorities access to virtually all our information."
Mr. Constantine said South African law enforcement officials expressed concern about an influx of as many as 50,000 Nigerian immigrants into their country, some of whom, he said, "had a long history of running heroin in Nigeria."
During the decades of white minority rule, South Africa kept out most other Africans, with conspicuous exceptions like migrant miners from Lesotho and Mozambique. Since the dismantling of apartheid, thousands of other Africans, taking advantage of the new nonracial hospitality, have flocked into South Africa looking for economic opportunities.
Asked whether any heroin had arrived in the United States via South Africa, Mr. Constantine said there had been "nothing significant" yet. "I haven't seen any major shipments show up," he said.
Neels Venter, the head of South Africa's police anti-narcotics operation, told a local reporter back in July 1994 that South Africa was becoming a transit country for heroin smuggled to the United States and Europe.
Mr. Constantine said Nigerian gangs account for a growing share of the heroin smuggled into the United States. He described some of the couriers as "swallowers," who swallow condoms filled with heroin and regurgitate them after clearing airport customs. But he said the gangs were also hiring Eastern European and American women, who are less conspicuous, to sneak packets of heroin into the United States.
A background paper produced for a recent United Nations conference on crime prevention acknowledged the problem. "South Africa's status as an international model of political reconciliation and the new engine of economic growth for Africa is in jeopardy due to penetration by Lagos crime groups," it said.
Lee P. Brown, who resigned earlier this month as the President's director of drug-control policy, visited Nigeria and South Africa in September to discuss the flow of narcotics with officials in both countries.
"South Africa has the potential of becoming a significant transit country for Southeast Asian heroin en route to the United States," Mr. Brown reported when he returned. "Drug traffickers are taking advantage of the country's new openness to transit drugs through its poorly controlled borders, air and sea ports."
Mr. Brown said President Mandela and his ministers "fully appreciate the seriousness of the drug-trafficking threat and are already addressing it in their Cabinet meetings. They understand that once South Africa becomes a major drug-transit country it will also become a major drug-consuming country."
Until recently, drug use in South Africa was generally limited to dagga, the local marijuana, and to mandrax, a stimulant smuggled in pill form from India. Since the fall of apartheid in 1994, police officials have run into increasing amounts of heroin, crack cocaine and other drugs that were previously rare.
The South African Narcotics Bureau reported earlier this year that it had identified about 150 international drug syndicates operating in the country.

HEADLINE: Tool Orders Fall, New Hint Of a Slowdown

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools fell in November, the first drop in two months, an industry trade group said yesterday, in a report that suggested further weakness in manufacturing.
Last month's orders totaled $317.15 million, down more than 35 percent from October and 26 percent from November 1994, according to a monthly report by the Association for Manufacturing Technology. 
 For the first 11 months of 1995, the orders totaled $4.471 billion, 8 percent more than in the corresponding period in 1994.
Orders of machine tools, which are used to cut and shape metal for products ranging from toasters to tractors, are an indication of whether manufacturers are confident enough about demand to refurbish and expand their factories.
The weakening demand for machine tools is consistent with other recent evidence of a slowing economy. Government figures on demand for durable goods from American manufacturers have also shown recent declines.
Domestic orders for machine tools fell in November to $261.40 million, down 38 percent from October and 34 percent from November 1994, the trade organization, which is based in McLean, Va., said.
Foreign orders fell to $55.75 million last month, 17 percent lower than in October, but almost double the level of November 1994.
Shipments of machine tools totaled $522.85 million in November, up 4 percent from October and up 55 percent from November 1994.
For the first 10 months of 1995, the shipments totaled $4.39 billion, 28 percent more than in the same period last year.
The backlog of orders was $2.17 billion at the end of November, down from $2.38 at the end of October and $2.13 billion at the end of November 1994.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Smite The Gate Closers

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
Take in the stranger, care for him. The major religions of the world all teach that. At the time of holidays -- holy days -- that might be worth thinking about.
The above paragraph is a blatant attempt to use religion, the holiday season, emotion, compassion and sentiment in the cause of a generous American immigration policy. 
 Yes, and it is an unashamed effort to call down the words of Jehovah, Jesus, Allah, Krishna, Buddha and the great Sikh gurus to smite and warn American politicians who fight to keep narrowing the opening in the gates of America.
They struggle, with all their sour passions, to treat legal immigrants as a special caste to be deprived of rights and privileges for the offense of being foreign-born.
Well -- I really do not expect religion to move American politicians and their propaganda mentors who want to create America in their image -- America the Mingy, mean from shore to shining shore.
But when the strangers set immediately to build cities, take in crops and strengthen the country with their skills, culture and genius, we get that lovely combination -- virtue and responsibility coming together to promote our self-interest. That is what generous immigration gives us, a thought that might move Americans who sit by, not noticing its approaching demise.
As a holiday gift, I give you three particularly useful recent pieces on immigration.
Julian L. Simon, a professor of business at the University of Maryland, has put the essence of his noted immigration studies into 51 pages -- "Immigration: the Demographic and Economic Facts."
Here's a taste, backed by statistics, to answer the charges made by the gate narrowers en route to their goal of gate closing:
Despite the propaganda about America being overwhelmed with immigrants, the rate of immigration is about one-third what it was at the beginning of the century. Immigrants do not increase the rate of unemployment among native-born Americans. Total per capita government expenditures on immigrants are much lower than those for the native-born. The education levels of immigrants have been increasing every decade. Natural resources and the environment are not at risk from immigration -- in fact, they are helped by the technical knowledge it brings.
You can get this report from the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank, at 1000 Massachusetts Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20001. It is excellent for smiting.
But the immigration issue is not just about statistics. Without immigration, America would not have long existed. Now, without immigration it cannot exist as a world power. Immigration helped create the weaponry and technology, from the atom bomb to the cruise missiles of the Persian Gulf war that empowered America militarily.
Today, immigrants of genius are essential to American industry and to high standards of American life. One-third of all American Nobel winners are foreign-born and judging by mathematical doctorates, science degrees, patents, prizes and publications, one-third of American geniuses are foreign-born.
Those conclusions come from "Geniuses from Abroad" in the Wall Street Journal of Dec. 18, by George Gilder, a fellow of the Discovery Institute in Seattle.
It would be handy if the U.S. could just pick up geniuses full blown, rejecting all others at the gate. But geniuses have a way of arriving in America disguised as little kids. Or they come from the wombs of non-genius immigrant mothers. That's the way it works.
But when an immigrant or immigrant-family genius does flower, he turns out to be thousands of times more productive economically than ordinary people -- a reality ignored by too many economists.
Then, for an idea how gate closers are endangering immigration and perverting the Constitution, read the analysis of the anti-immigration measures now pending in Congress. Get it from National Immigration Forum, 220 I Street N.E., Suite 220, Washington D.C. 20002-4362. Then have a chat with your local Congress member, a lot of chats.
I wish I had a pulpit to instruct the anti-immigration types that their defiance of the religious commandments on the stranger weakens their country and, incidentally, endangers their immortal souls, but a column will have to do.

HEADLINE: Mr. Hollings Saves the Phone Bill

 BODY:
House and Senate conferees seemed ready to negotiate a damaging telecommunications compromise until Senator Ernest Hollings of South Carolina, the chief Senate negotiator, altered that destiny last week. Wielding the threat of a filibuster and a deft legislative hand, he rescued the best parts of flawed House and Senate bills passed earlier, added some good new ideas and threw out most of the rot.
His draft bill could spark innovation and set off consumer-friendly competition among television, cable and telephone companies. Its biggest flaw is a heavy-handed and probably unconstitutional effort to ban "indecent material" from the Internet. 
 The original bills sought to break down barriers that keep media companies from entering each other's markets. But three mistakes were made. The bills would have deregulated cable rates before competition by other video companies could protect customers from price-gouging cable operators. Local phone companies would have been allowed to enter the long-distance market before they faced competition from cable or other companies. Worse still, the bills would have allowed broadcasters, cable operators, telephone companies and newspapers to merge too easily. That could expose consumers to a frightening concentration of information sources.
Mr. Hollings, with the help of key Republicans like Senator Larry Pressler, fixed most of these flaws. His draft bill would hold up entry of local phone companies into long-distance service until the Federal Communications Commission says O.K. after giving weight to an antitrust review by the Justice Department. The bill leaves it up to the F.C.C. to set reasonable guidelines for mergers. It would put off deregulation of most cable rates for three years -- enough time for phone and satellite services to take on cable operators.
The one serious error is a prohibition against transmission of allegedly indecent materials over the Internet -- the network of millions of on-line computer subscribers around the world. The indecency standard is probably unconstitutionally vague and restrictive. The standard is also unnecessary. The law already forbids sending obscene materials by computer. To protect children, parents can buy easy-to-use programs that block indecent materials from any source. The draft bill threatens to trigger further Government control of electronic communication -- which has blossomed so far precisely because Government has stayed on the sidelines. Fortunately, Republican leaders like Speaker Newt Gingrich are troubled by the indecency standard. There is a good opportunity to knock the provision out before Congress takes a vote.
Some Republicans, miffed when Vice President Al Gore declared the draft an Administration victory, threatened to withhold support. But telecommunications, the heart of a high-tech economy, is too important for small-minded sparring. Congress should take up the draft bill, remove the indecency provision and put Mr. Hollings's good deed into law.

HEADLINE: SCIENTIST AT WORK: John Henry Holland;
Searching for Simple Rules Of Complexity

BYLINE: By SANDRA BLAKESLEE 

 BODY:
HE'S the man who taught computers how to have sex. And now, for an encore, he's working on a theory to explain the complexity of life and its myriad manifestations on planet earth.
In so doing, John Henry Holland poses metaphorical questions that he likes to ponder while taking his morning shower or during hours spent alone in his office. How is an economic system like an immune system? How is an anthill like the brain? How is evolution like learning? 
 If there are plausible answers to these questions, Dr. Holland is likely to find them. The 66-year-old computer scientist from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor is legendary for having invented genetic algorithms -- lines of computer code that simulate sexually reproducing organisms. This powerful technique is being used to redesign factory assembly lines and in attempts to predict stock market fluctuations.
Nowadays, Dr. Holland has turned his attention to the nascent field of complexity. "Many of our most troubling long-range problems -- trade balances, sustainability, genetic defects, mental health, computer viruses -- center on systems of extraordinary complexity," said Dr. Holland. "The systems that host these problems -- economies, ecologies, immune systems, embryos, nervous systems, computer networks -- appear to be as diverse as the problems."
But there may be some hidden order, some fundamental characteristics and common interactions inherent in all these systems, Dr. Holland said. More than the sum of their parts, each of these complex systems has, in his view, the ability to anticipate the future, learn and adapt in ways that are not yet understood.
Complexity, for all its youth and growing pains, is a highly controversial field. Some critics call it a sham. One skeptic recently mocked claims for the new discipline by asking if a cure for AIDS was more likely to emerge from the mathematics and computer modeling of complexity science than from the nitty-gritty bench-top work that led to the discovery of the AIDS virus.
Complexity theory may never produce a cure for the acquired immune deficiency syndrome but it can generate theories that help direct experiments, Dr. Holland said. "Theory and experiment go hand in glove and this is where we might make a major contribution," he said.
This year's top accolade in epidemiology, the Timmons award, went to three researchers who used complexity theory to model the spread of AIDS, Dr. Holland said. They showed that the virus is most infectious in the first few weeks of incubation and not, as is widely believed, later on when it multiplies within its victims.
Other critics say that complexity is no different from a number of other scientific fads like chaos, cybernetics and catastrophe theories. "People say these were flashes in the pan but in fact if you look at each, they have contributed healthily to the way scientists look at things," Dr. Holland said. "To say cybernetics failed is to ignore that the fact that feedback in living systems is now accepted as received wisdom in many scientific fields."
Another criticism is that complexity theory is built on computer models that have little to do with the real world. But models lead to genuine insights, Dr. Holland said. For example, before James Clerk Maxwell developed his famous equations describing electromagnetism, he built little gears that floated in water. Maxwell studied the gears' interactions to build up his field theories, Dr. Holland said.
Like Maxwell, Dr. Holland uses models to search for mathematical equations. His goal is to find fundamental rules of nature that he believes drive all complex adaptive systems. "This is more than the search for a terminology," Dr. Holland said. "It signals our intuition that there are general principles that govern all complex adaptive system behavior, principles that point to ways of solving the attendant problems."
For the last 400 years science has advanced by reductionism, Dr. Holland said. "The idea is that you could understand the world, all of nature, by examining smaller and smaller pieces of it. When assembled, the small pieces would explain the whole." Moreover, mathematical laws could predict all natural phenomena.
"In a general sense there is nothing wrong with this approach," Dr. Holland said. "It has led to tremendous successes." But reductionism and the linear mathematics on which it relies, he continued, have hit some serious snags in the last 100 years. The first blow came when scientists like Kurt Godel proved that mathematical systems are always incomplete and cannot be relied on to describe nature.
Then scientists began to take a closer look at nature itself, Dr. Holland said. The world is filled with complex phenomena that do not behave in a linear fashion and that cannot be explained by reductionism, he said. "We can't add up the parts and understand the whole, for that does not give a good picture of what the system does," he said. "The interactions are just as important as the parts." A different kind of mathematics, using nonlinear approaches, is needed.
Scientists from many disciplines are fascinated by complex adaptive systems, Dr. Holland said. He spends time each year at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico where scientists from different disciplines meet to discuss complex phenomena in nature and technology. "I go there to think and cross pollinate ideas," he said.
Dr. Holland said that his basic strategy is to look for common properties and mechanisms in various complex adaptive systems. "A feature that is obvious in one system can be recondite and hidden in another," he said. "If I look at arms races between nations, certain features and motivations seem fairly clear. In ecosystems, there are similar arms races between organisms."
For example, a flowering plant might evolve a toxin that fends off a moth and in turn the moth might evolve an enzyme that renders the toxin harmless, Dr. Holland said. Further mutations might take place in a kind of arms race between the two organisms.
Dr. Holland likes to work alone. "I find most scientific meetings a waste of time," he said. "I read Science, Scientific American and the American Scientist and follow up on references for things that seem relevant. I enjoy learning as much as I can about different fields." He has three offices -- one at the university, one at home and another at a summer home on Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Each hideaway is strewn with books on every conceivable subject and many, such as E. O. Wilson's "The Ants," show signs of having been read more than once.
But as more and more information gets absorbed, Dr. Holland faces his ultimate challenge -- abstracting the information, deciding what to keep in his models of complex adaptive systems and what to toss out.
"This is a matter of taste," he said, "not unlike an art form. It is based on metaphors and analogies." For inspiration, Dr. Holland often talks with a poet, Alice Fulton, who also lives in Ann Arbor. "We discuss creativity in science and poetry," he said. "Our purposes are similar, to find the right phrases, right words, right rhymes. The feeling of rightness is critical to what I do. It's a matter of intuition, of judgment, of style. I look at big, buzzing complex systems and ask what mechanisms and properties seem central."
For one thing, every system has agents. Economies have business firms. Brains have neurons. And anthills have ants. The agents -- business firms, neurons, or ants -- interact on the basis of very simple rules that can lead to complex behavior, Dr. Holland said. An individual ant has a small number of rules. If it finds food, it lays down a scent. If another ant detects a scent, it follows the trail. A dozen or so simple rules used by single ants result in an ant colony that exhibits surprisingly complex behavior, Dr. Holland said. It looks intelligent as it puts out probes to exploit its environment, defends itself and lives far longer than any individual ant. The same goes for neurons. Each cell follows a few dozen simple rules but taken together you get the conscious human brain.
One system may also use building blocks from another system in new ways. The internal combustion engine is composed of parts used in earlier technologies, recombined in a way that led to a whole new transportation system.
Another common trait is that agents form aggregates. In a tropical forest, trees and parasites like Spanish moss collectively retain nutrients in a way that neither the tree nor the parasite could do alone. The first business firm, described by Adam Smith, is another example, Dr. Holland said. Straight pins used to be made by individual craftsmen who could produce only so many pins per day. When the workers formed an aggregate, with one person drawing the wire, another clipping it and another putting on the pinhead, he said, production went up by a factor of 10 and the price of straight pins dropped.
While such aggregates seem obvious, Dr. Holland said, "we still don't understand the mechanisms by which they come about," adding: "What triggers them? Why do they stay together? In modeling aggregates, no one has been able to show how this transformation occurs." Eventually, the interactions between aggregates produce larger systems, he said.
The challenge is to build a computer model that explains both protein folding and international finance, Dr. Holland said.
"We're a long way from achieving this," he said. But the payoff could be enormous bcause complex adaptive systems have lever points. A small perturbation can have far-reaching results. Vaccines are an example. A small injection can make a huge, trillion cell organism immune to measles.
These kinds of lever points abound in natural systems, he said. "We just don't know where to look for them," he said. "But it's possible that a small intervention could make an enormous difference in solving inner-city problems. Good mathematics would suggest where and how to look for them."
Dr. Holland recently wrote a book, "Hidden Order, How Adaptation Builds Complexity," published this fall by Addison Wesley. He is now working on a book called "Emergence," about the relationship between metaphors and computer models and innovation.
"I like to hang out with artists and musicians," for inspiration, said Dr. Holland, who does not look the Bohemian part in his conservative suits and dark ties. "Basically I prefer to work alone," he said. "Spending time alone thinking is critical. I don't remember ideas from sleep but I do get many of my best ideas while in the shower." He smiled, recalling that he was in the shower when, three years ago, the phone rang with news that he had won a MacArthur genius award.
"I've had good luck in the shower," he said. "I should keep a pad of paper closer."

HEADLINE: Creatures of the Deep Find Their Way to the Table

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
DWELLING in darkness, little known or understood, the animals of the deep sea are traditionally thought of as mysterious or monstrous. But that is changing. Increasingly, commercial fishermen are scouring the global deep to catch them by the ton. Creatures of the abyss, frequently grotesque by human standards, are being carefully prepared and marketed to hide their murky origins when sold in stores and restaurants.
Scientists worry that the rush for deep-sea food is beginning to upset the delicate ecology of some of the sunless regions that cover more than half the planet, threatening to tip the evolutionary balance. But chefs and fishermen are eager to probe the new frontier. Deep harvesting, they say, can be prudent and the results quite tasty. 
 "They're an incredible hit," Michael Stafford, the chef at the Captain Daniel Packer Inn in Mystic, Conn., said of the giant deep-sea shrimp he has started to serve. They are known as Stonington Reds and Royal Scarlets and are sometimes as large as lobsters. "They're tender and sweet, and they cook really quickly," he said. "They sell themselves."
Other deep creatures now being harvested or targeted as seafood include rattails, skates, squid, red crabs, orange roughy, black oreos, smooth oreos, hoki, blue ling, southern blue whiting, sablefish, black scabbard fish and spiny dogfish.
The search for palatable fare in the sea's depths is partly fueled by fishing wars and the collapse of such shallow fisheries as the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, where the search for wholesome food and short-term profit has driven such popular species as cod and haddock to the verge of commercial extinction. Worldwide, after centuries of steady growth, the total catch of wild fish peaked in 1989 and has subsequently declined.
Foraging deeper is often a survival strategy for fishermen forced out of traditional grounds by government regulators and pressed by creditors to make payments on expensive boats. In the United States, the investigation of deep fisheries is encouraged by the National Marine Fisheries Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a Federal agency that aids such exploratory work with millions of dollars in grants. The exact amount of the catch from the deep seas is not known.
But scientists and environmental groups warn that so little is known about deep-sea creatures that some face ruin. Animals that inhabit the icy depths, experts say, often grow and reproduce very slowly, making their populations particularly vulnerable to disruption. Scientists recently discovered that the orange roughy, which dwells up to a mile deep off New Zealand and has been heavily exported to the United States for a decade, reaches sexual maturity in its 30's and lives to an age of 150 years or more.
"Deep fisheries can provide a pulse of good fishing but they're often not sustainable," said Dr. Jack Sobel, a senior scientist at the Center for Marine Conservation, a private group in Washington.
The problem is illustrated by orange roughy, whose principal stocks around New Zealand recently collapsed. "They never should have been exploited at all," said Mike Hagler, a fisheries expert in Auckland, New Zealand, for Greenpeace International. "People wouldn't eat rhinoceros or any other land creature that they knew was threatened by extinction. But they're eating fish like orange roughy without a clue to what's happening."
Peter J. Auster, science director of the National Undersea Research Center at the University of Connecticut in Avery Point, said knowledge and moderation were essential to avoiding trouble. "Some of these fisheries might be sustainable with a five-boat fleet but would be rapidly depleted if 15 or 20 boats decided to go after them," he said.
"The attraction is understandable. For the individual fisherman trying to pay off the boat or put his kid through school, and facing Draconian rules to reduce pressure on over-exploited stocks, this is a wide-open area. It's a place to go and use your wits and knowledge to try to make a living, which is what fishermen have been doing for centuries."
Bruce Morehead, an official of the National Marine Fisheries Service, said his agency was aware of the risks that accompanied deep fishing and was working closely with commercial fishermen to strike a balance between exploitation and conservation. "If you don't accurately assess the stocks," he said, "you can accidentally kill them off."
Although limited commercial fishing of the deep has been practiced for decades around the globe, new sciences and technologies are rapidly making it more practical and efficient, even as its allure grows because of the worldwide depletion of shallow stocks. Hauls that once took days can now be done in minutes.
From the start, the main tool has been a long steel line and a stout net or baglike trawl, which can be dragged through the midwater or across the dark bottom, its way eased by rollers and wheels. Now ships are bigger and faster, lines are thinner and stronger, and winding drums are wider. Most importantly, the maws of trawls can be enormous, often hundreds of feet wide.
Former military technologies are helping the hunt, including radars that let boats navigate in dense fogs, sonars that locate deep schools and navigation satellites that pinpoint locations so vessels can return to rich locations.
As a result, the bottoms of many continental shelves and shallow seas have been scraped repeatedly in the hunt for deep seafood. Increasingly, the action is moving into the inky depths.
Recently, fishermen have begun pinpointing zones of deep fertility by studying maps based on formerly secret military data, which reveal hidden sea-floor features. For instance, a map made public in October by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in one step doubled the number of known undersea mountains, which often are associated with upwellings of deep, nutrient-rich water and dense aggregations of sea life.
Deep creatures hauled up as commercial seafood include deep-sea red crabs found off the northeastern United States and southwest Africa, according to Dr. John D. Gage and Dr. Paul A. Tyler, authors of "Deep-Sea Biology" (Cambridge University Press).
In the North Atlantic, Russians pioneered the harvesting of rattails, a ubiquitous deep fish with big eyes and a long tail that swishes back and forth in a sinuous motion. This fishery, which at its peak produced more than 80,000 tons a year, is now in decline. "Whether this has been caused by too-intensive fishing" or natural shifts is unclear, the scientists say.
In the Pacific, the sablefish, or blackcod, is fished at depths of up to a mile, and recent research suggests that individuals can live up to 70 years. Anxious over its slow rates of reproduction, Dr. Gage and Dr. Tyler warn that "the stock could become quickly depleted" unless deep fishing is carefully regulated.
A best seller from the depths has been orange roughy, a pug-nosed warrior that feeds on prawns, squid and fish, living on deep banks and around sea mounts near New Zealand. Trawlers in their heyday could sometimes catch 50 tons an hour. But after a gold rush that resulted in the export of hundreds of millions of dollars a year in orange roughy, the New Zealand fishery recently collapsed to a tiny fraction of its former size.
Now the industry is seeking to develop fisheries for alternative deep species such as black oreos and smooth oreos.
"In deep water you get high costs, high technology, high finance, and consequently, the pressure is on to heavily exploit the stocks," said Mr. Hagler of Greenpeace International. "You're up against the wall, which pushes fisheries beyond the limits of economic sustainability."
Scientists say the collapse of deep stocks such as orange roughy can have all kinds of hidden implications because they are apparently preyed on by such large animals as sperm whales and giant squids. Their disappearance, experts warn, could disrupt delicate food chains.
Off the United States, the National Marine Fisheries Service is helping industry explore fisheries for deep shrimp, rattails, chimeras, orange roughy, smoothheads, slackjaw eels, blue hake, skates and dogfish, which the National Fisheries Institute, an industry group, in an effort to improve their marketability, has renamed cape shark.
"We're excited because these may open up an avenue to try something new and relieve the pressure on cod, haddock, some of the flounders and other species that are depleted at this point," said Kenneth L. Beal, a manager in Gloucester, Mass., with the northeast regional office of the National Marine Fisheries Service.
One pioneer deep shrimper is Capt. Bill Bomster, who with his three sons runs the 100-foot "Patty Jo" out of Stonington, Conn., and sells his catch to the Daniel Packer Inn in nearby Mystic. He has plied the edge of the continental shelf from Block Island to Virginia, dragging the bottom with a 200-foot-long trawl whose mouth is 3 feet high and 150 feet wide. The trawling is done at depths of up to a half mile.
"What's nice is that the water is very cold and exceptionally clean," he said. "That makes the catch far superior to gulf or farm-raised or any other shrimp. Some of the damn things are 10 inches long."
As stocks of better-known fish shrink and international quotas tighten, experts say the deep will increasingly be targeted as a source of seafood, which is fine with Mr. Stafford at the Daniel Packer Inn.
One of his deliveries of deep shrimp was accompanied by a strange kind of crawfish that nobody could identify, even his friends who are marine biologists.
"One of the arms was really long," Mr. Stafford recalled, adding that the exotic crustacean went into the pot along with the big shrimp.
"It was really tasty," he said.

HEADLINE: THE PROMISE OF GAMBLING: A special report.;
After 20 Years, Atlantic City Starts to Reap Casinos' Benefits

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY

 BODY:
Ask Michelle Barnes what her future would look like without the casinos here and she cannot even imagine.
"I don't know," she said. "I guess I would be working at, McDonald's?" 
 Unlike many high school seniors these days, Miss Barnes is not worried about finding a good job when she graduates. She is one of 50 members of the class of 1996 from Atlantic City High School, an urban, largely minority school, who have lined up full-time jobs at the casinos here with starting pay close to $20,000 a year plus benefits and promotion opportunities.
Miss Barnes was born in 1976, the year New Jersey residents voted to legalize gambling in hopes of rejuvenating this decaying honky-tonk resort and restoring some of the economic power that it formerly had in southern New Jersey. Now, as the 20th anniversary of the vote approaches, the gambling industry's big promises -- that the casinos' wealth would spill over and enrich the community as a whole -- are finally beginning to become a reality.
While it has taken longer than anyone expected, and this city of 38,000 has hardly been converted into a utopia, there are now many jobs available for high school graduates and thousands of new units of moderate-priced housing, as well as a new supermarket, airport and minor league baseball team. A new convention center is under construction, along with a big noncasino hotel aimed at attracting tourists who want to do more than gamble.
"This is my future," Miss Barnes said of her $300-a-week after-school job as an assistant cash manager at Claridge Casino restaurants. "I have friends who graduated two or three years ago, and they have houses and cars and babies now. So this is what I'm striving for, to work here until I retire."
Even gambling's defenders, like Atlantic City's Mayor and school leaders, concede that the high-blown promises made during the 1976 referendum campaign are still far from fulfilled. (And in other towns where casinos want to gain a foothold, like Bridgeport, Conn., opponents repeatedly recite the bleak side of the Atlantic City story.)
Homelessness was a problem here 20 years ago, and it still is -- but only about half as bad, according to shelter officials. Unemployment, at 14.9 percent, is still high, but it is an improvement from the 18.2 percent rate in 1976 and not as bad as in Camden, where the rate is 18.4 percent.
And there have been losers in the long, slow development process. Retailers along Atlantic Avenue were among gambling's most ardent promoters 20 years ago, and -- except for the pawn shops -- were repaid by being all but wiped out by the casinos, which deliberately maintain their own restaurants, entertainment and shopping areas as a way of keeping as much tourist money as possible within their own walls.
In one of the most positive signs of a business turnaround, construction is almost complete at a retail complex that includes a Thriftway, the city's first new supermarket in decades.
Crime is down in cities across the country, but in Atlantic City the drop has been sharper than elsewhere. Both violent and nonviolent crime have dropped by half since 1990, helped by the greater availability of jobs -- jobs for which a police record is an automatic disqualifier.
 
Making Progress
Promise of Jobs Motivates Students
Atlantic City High School's dropout rate was 24 percent as recently as 1990. Now it is 13 percent, compared with a statewide average of 16 percent.
"It's still too high, but we're making progress," said William Steel, the principal. He credited, in part, the new $1.2 million high school building -- paid for with casino taxes -- and the lure of casino jobs after graduation.
"You can work part time while you're still in school," said Mark Mangel, the school's job-placement counselor, "but you need a diploma afterward if you're going to go anywhere."
Tonya Maniscarco, a 1990 Atlantic City High graduate, is in her fourth year as a promotions representative at Trump's Castle Casino Resort. "To the kids in school," she said, "the casinos are an adventure, a new kind of life, and there's always advancement. Everybody talks about being a dealer when they're in high school."
Ms. Maniscarco lives with her twin sister, Sherene, who works at the Trump Taj Mahal. She declined to say how much she earns, but said she does not regret having skipped college.
"I make a good salary. They take good care of you medically. If you have children, they cover them, too. So I'm just going to stay."
James Hughes, dean of planning and public policy at Rutgers, says casino gambling is "providing a type of opportunity that is equivalent to the manufacturing jobs we once had."
Dr. Hughes -- who with George Sternlieb wrote a book in 1983 on the ups and downs of the casino industry titled "The Atlantic City Gamble" -- still finds much to dislike about the gambling industry here. The dislocation created in the early days, when homes and businesses were knocked down in anticipation of investment that never came, put a blot on gambling's record that is still seen in the blighted streets along the approach to the city from the Atlantic City Expressway.
But in the 12 years since he wrote the book, he said, the city's economic health has improved.
"You now have more than $3 billion worth of new property to tax," Dr. Hughes said, "and no other urban center in New Jersey has had investment comparable to that. Today, the police are well paid and well equipped, you have a good civil-service staff that was just starting to take shape in 1983 and is now solidly in place. The schools are on solid fiscal foundation."
"And clearly," he added, "the employment opportunities are greater than in any other urban area."
All this has been helped by the strong run the casinos have been experiencing -- 19 straight months of record income growth.
Still, Dr. Hughes said, there are limits. "The notion of taking large numbers of people who were in urban poverty and lifting them into mainstream America, that has not happened. But that is also an impossible standard to hold the city to."
The city's strengths are cited in a Salomon Brothers market analysis headlined "Atlantic City: Worthy of a Second Look." The trends have been bolstered by more investment coming in, including the following:
*A $270 million convention center, the largest between New York and Washington, is under construction, paid for by the state's Sports and Exhibition Authority. It will be linked to a new 500-room, $87 million Headquarters Hotel, Atlantic City's largest nongambling investment in years, intended to widen the city's appeal.
*A $1 billion two-casino complex is planned by Circus Circus and Mirage Resorts, whose chairman, Steven A. Wynn, left Atlantic City in a fury eight years ago over what he called incompetent and meddlesome state casino policy.
*The $225 million Corridor Project, to widen and remake the Missouri Avenue approach to the Boardwalk area, will rebuild the old ocean front convention hall, home to the Miss America pageant.
*Seven casinos are spending $580 million to add 3,000 hotel rooms and build new parking and retail space.
*A new airport has just been completed, and a minor league baseball team has been signed.
The new investment will add thousands of jobs to an industry that has already created 44,000 jobs, more than the city's entire population of 38,000. Nearly half the existing jobs are filled by women and members of minority groups.
 
Recognizing Limits
Some Urban Woes Defy Resolution
One reason the Atlantic City experience has been seen as a failure by many, says Mayor James Whelan, is that high unemployment, poverty and welfare dependence coexist with so much opportunity.
Mr. Whelan, a Democrat, considers Atlantic City a lesson in the limits of trickle-down capitalism.
"The problems that exist in the culture of poverty are not solved by providing jobs," he said. "Casinos do not solve hopelessness, they do not stop kids from dropping out of school, they do not stop kids from getting pregnant. If a teen-age boy does not have a father, getting his mother a job is not going to provide a role model for him."
Although the casino operators deny it, many Atlantic City leaders maintain that the houses, as the casinos are sometimes called, turned their backs on the city in the early years. The managers were from Las Vegas and felt little kinship with the city.
But in the last six years, as industry leaders grew worried about the negative accounts of Atlantic City's gambling experience, the casinos became more community-minded. Some trace the turnabout to 1990, when the casinos embarked on a campaign to have sports betting legalized and sought to win support by showing themselves off as concerned members of the community.
The sports betting effort failed, but today one would be hard-pressed to find a school, club or social service agency that has not received support from the casinos.
"I think what has happened was that the brain trust that is part of the casino industry said, 'We are available now to help,' " said Barry Durman, president of the Atlantic City Rescue Mission, a refuge for the homeless.
"I remember how it happened in 1989," Mr. Durman said. "We had a severe financial crunch, we really needed the help, and I spoke with the Trump organization about it. That Christmas they handed me a check for $10,000, and the next year Trump's Castle called and said, 'We're going to send you 300 entrees every day for the rest of your life.' "
Last year, the Rescue Mission served 208,468 hot meals and distributed 23,526 food baskets, and did not pay for a single one.
In 1991, the Rescue Mission provided 70,850 nights of lodging to homeless people, and that figure has declined each year to 50,589 last year, partly because the city's economy is improving, Mr. Durman said, and because the mission is taking a harder line in excluding men who refuse help getting back on their feet.
Donald Bailey, 28, was one of the men waiting for a meal and a cot recently. He said he shunted laundry carts in a casino for three months until he hurt his foot and is now homeless. Yet, he said, his 25-year old brother Dennis is making $22,000 a year at a laundry service for the casinos.
"The casinos have been good for a lot of people from around here," Mr. Bailey said. "They just haven't been much good for me."
Each year, Harrah's Casino pays for a formal sit-down dinner for parents of honor-roll students at the Uptown Elementary School. Most casinos provide scholarships for graduates of the city's high school.
"Every school has a casino as a partner," said Ernest L. Harper, the Uptown principal, "and it's more than just an adopt-a-school program. They pay for job fairs at the state colleges. They put up smoke detectors for us."
This year, 289 students from the high school are working in the casinos, earning an average of $8 per hour busing tables, cleaning floors and acting as greeters. Typically, between a quarter and a third of graduating seniors work at the casinos. "The casinos have always liked to promote from within, so there is upward mobility," said Mr. Mangel, the job-placement counselor.
Mr. Mangel's son Greg spent two summers at Resorts Casino while he was attending college. At 24, he is now the casino's food and beverage accounting manager.
 
Changing Fortunes
Deregulation Bill Spurs Investment
Perhaps nothing better illustrates Atlantic City's changing business fortunes than the planned return of Mirage Resorts, eight years after Mr. Wynn angrily sold the Golden Nugget casino and swore never to return, saying the city government was corrupt and incompetent, the state overzealous in its regulation.
"Things are so different in Atlantic City today compared to then that I don't know if it's possible to state the differences loudly and clearly enough," said Alan M. Feldman, a Mirage vice president. "But the No. 1 change has been the change in regulatory attitude and emphasis by the Governor and by the Mayor."
On Jan. 25, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed a casino deregulation bill into law that ended state supervision over hundreds of nongambling functions.
"We now confine ourselves to keeping the games honest and making sure the state gets the share of revenues that it is due," said Bradford S. Smith, director of the State Casino Control Commission.
That share is 8 percent of total gambling receipts, good for $263 million last year, that goes toward programs for the aged and the disabled throughout the state.
The law also requires casinos to invest an additional 1.5 percent of all revenue in local nongambling development. This money, more than $50 million a year, has underwritten the construction of new housing at the northern Inlet Section.
The housing, on land cleared of old buildings, was built with special attention to insure that original residents would not be displaced involuntarily, said Susan L. Ney, assistant deputy director of the Redevelopment Authority. Owners were bought out at market rates and given temporary shelter. Renters in the old housing were also placed in rental housing, and the difference in rents subsidized.
New units were offered for sale at heavily subsidized discounts, Ms. Ney said, and renters were provided apartments in new high-rises.
Houses that sold for $63,000 to $69,000 to outsiders went to previous owners from the neighborhood for $50,000 -- the typical buyout price for one of the old houses. The Redevelopment Authority used some of its casino revenue to subsidize mortgage rates.
When the first phase of new houses was offered, there were few takers because few trusted the authority. As successive phases opened, more owners and renters signed on. Today, the authority estimates that more than 90 percent of the people living in the new housing are former residents.
Ralph Brown, a retired middle school student counselor, is one of them. He used to own a three-story frame house at 110 Adelphic Avenue. Now he lives with his wife and child in a three-bedroom town house a block away.
"When they tore down those old wrecks," he said, "they ran off all the squatters that were living in them, and they were causing the crime. No old houses, no crime now."
But Mr. Brown said he paid only $720 a year in taxes on Adelphic Avenue, and his condo, bought for $55,000 last year, cost him $2,300 in taxes and association charges. "Before, I was living mortgage free. Now, I got a mortgage, but I'm living a lot better."
Dr. Hughes has thought a lot about whether gambling has been good for Atlantic City.
"We can tear ourselves apart arguing about whether it's been good or bad," he said. "The fact is, it's there, it exists, and the question now is, how best do we reshape it so that Atlantic City will be viable in the long run. To me, the new housing, the baseball stadium, the corridor project and the convention center are the kinds of things Atlantic City will need to survive in the next century."

HEADLINE: THE CONTENDERS;
Phil Gramm's Offbeat Charm As a Persistent Conservative

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: FLAGSTAFF, Ariz., Dec. 21

 BODY:
There is a kind of offbeat charm in the roguish self-deprecation of William Philip Gramm, the Texas Senator who wants to be the next President of the United States.
Campaigning in Phoenix recently, Senator Gramm was introduced to 2 1/2-year-old Leah Clark, a dazzling little towhead, by her proud parents. "I had a girlfriend once named Leah," drawled Mr. Gramm, tickling the toddler under the chin. "She dumped me!" 
 Phil Gramm's style may or may not captivate the voters. But for the most part, Mr. Gramm, who a colleague once said was "charismatically challenged" and whom Texas Monthly magazine described as a man with "the round, wizened face of a snapping turtle," never planned to win the Presidency with a charm offensive anyway.
Instead, Mr. Gramm has tried to storm his way to the Republican nomination with the twin bludgeons of an unbendingly conservative economic message and an enormous campaign war chest. Now, though, with the 53-year-old Senator having clearly failed to build any air of inevitability about his own nomination, his campaign emphasizes a less ambitious proposition: that there is nothing inevitable about the nomination of the Republican front-runner, Bob Dole.
"We're where we want to be," he insisted in an interview. "I said at the outset of the year that the point was to establish Phil Gramm as the viable conservative alternative to Bob Dole. We have achieved that."
But several state and national polls suggest that at least three other Republican challengers can lay claim to the mantle of Mr. Dole's chief rival or, perhaps more accurately, that none of them can. Mr. Gramm is stuck in a crowd.
So, rather than dueling with Mr. Dole head-on, the Texas Senator rattles off the reasons that he should be taken more seriously than the rest:
*Lamar Alexander, former Governor of Tennessee: "No money; no message."
*Steve Forbes, the multimillionaire: "People are not going to vote for Forbes; he's not plausible."
*Pat Buchanan, the political commentator: "He's a protest vote against Dole. If I convince people that I have a chance of beating Dole, they'll desert Buchanan in droves."
The essence of Mr. Gramm's strategy remains unchanged: finish close enough to Senator Dole in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary to establish himself as the prime alternative, then overpower Mr. Dole in a string of more conservative Southern and Western state primaries that follow.
Mr. Gramm dismisses his standing well below Mr. Dole in a variety of state and national public-opinion polls, insisting that they are largely based on name recognition and that a truer reflection of the race is his victories in straw polls of party activists, events on which he has lavished far more money than any other candidate but which he says demonstrates the grass-roots strength and organization of his campaign.
Still, by this point in the campaign, Mr. Gramm had clearly hoped to be spending most of his time building the case against Senator Dole, not against the lesser-knowns. In fact, by declaring early and raising $20 million, far more than any other candidate except Mr. Dole (though Mr. Forbes is a wild card because he is spending his own money), Mr. Gramm wanted the race to be a two-man duel by now.
That it is not raises questions not about his fund-raising ability or his organizational skills, but about his message and his fundamental appeal as a President. His conservative themes are solid, but he has not electrified crowds and he has also had some embarrassing stumbles.
Asked by Larry King if he would consider a female running mate, Mr. Gramm quipped, "Sophia Loren is not a citizen," a remark that many did not find endearing. His small investment 20 years ago in a soft-porn movie project, "Beauty Queens," did not go over big in conservative Christian circles.
 
Unusual Boast About Money
And he may well have undercut himself with his boasts about his remarkable fund-raising prowess, as if that, as opposed to his vision for the country, amounted to his chief political asset.
The night before he formally announced for President, Mr. Gramm spoke to a glittering crowd in a Dallas hotel where he took in $4.1 million and set a record for the largest amount raised in a single campaign event. He told the crowd: "Thanks to you, I have the most reliable friend you can have in American politics, and that's ready money." (Mr. Gramm says now that criticism over the remark was unwarranted because he was just humorously paraphrasing a Benjamin Franklin quipp that the three most "reliable friends" in the world were "an old wife, an old dog and ready money.")
But if Mr. Gramm is waging an uphill fight for the nomination, few people count him out altogether. Richard Murray, a professor of political science at the University of Houston who has closely followed Senator Gramm's political career, said that while "it doesn't seem like he plays well on the Presidential stage," Mr. Gramm has a history in Texas of winning races in which people did not take him seriously at first.
In fact, the only race he ever lost -- long before he switched from the Democratic to Republican Party -- came when he tried, as an obscure 33-year-old professor of economics at Texas A&M University, to wrest the Democratic nomination for the Senate from a popular incumbent, Lloyd M. Bentsen, in 1976.
"Phil Gramm is just so easily underestimated," Mr. Murray said. "He's smart. He's tough. He's determined. He's resourceful."
Mr. Gramm has a history of shrewdly seizing the political advantage. Running behind in a race for the House of Representatives two years later, Mr. Gramm seemed headed for oblivion until the retiring Congressman in his district, at a news conference to endorse Mr. Gramm's opponent, falsely implied that Mr. Gramm and his wife, Wendy, had a child out of wedlock. Mr. Gramm masterfully seized on the aspersion, using it to build both voter attention and sympathy, and he narrowly won the race.
And in perhaps the most legendary incident of his career, Mr. Gramm appeared to have violated all political decorum in a 1982 fracas. As a member of the Democratic-controlled Budget Committee in 1982, Mr. Gramm, according to an account by President Ronald Reagan's budget director, David Stockman, provided the White House with secret information about the Democrat's budget strategy.
Mr. Gramm was booted off the committee for his heresy. But rather than atone, he committed apostasy.
He resigned his seat, immediately declaring for the vacancy as a Republican and telling the voters: "I had to choose between representing Tip O'Neill or y'all, and I chose to represent y'all." He won smashingly, and the next year he won the statewide election to the Senate.
He has survived ethics scrapes ranging from the arguable use of his Senate staff for campaign activities to a controversy over a Dallas savings and loan operator's paying almost half the $117,000 in building expenses on Mr. Gramm's vacation home on the Maryland shore. Mr. Gramm said that the man contracted to do the work and that the money represented a cost overrun.
Senator Gramm's tenacity is well-documented in everything from his political campaigns to his courtship of his second wife, Dr. Wendy Lee Gramm, whom he married in 1970 and with whom he has two sons, Marshall and Jeff. Both Mr. Gramm and his wife say her first response to him was: "Yuck!"
That was when Mr. Gramm was on a recruiting trip for Texas A&M, which was ready to offer a job to Ms. Lee, herself an economist. "As a single member of the faculty," Mr. Gramm's future wife recalled him telling her, "I'd be very interested in having you come to Texas A&M." The remark rather than landing Mr. Gramm a sexual-harassment lawsuit landed him a wife.
 
A Budget Pledge Close to His Heart
Mr. Gramm cites the evident affection of his wife -- as well as that of the many long-serving members of his staff and of his dog, a yellow Labrador named Gus -- to counter a recurring description of him as "mean."
"I think that when you say, No, in Washington, it makes you mean," Mr. Gramm said, as a turboprop airplane passed over the crimson rock canyons of central Arizona. "But people forget that when you say, 'No,' in Washington, you're making it possible for families to say, 'Yes,' around their kitchen table."
Mr. Gramm's pre-eminent campaign pledge is to balance the Federal budget in four years, and not to run for re-election if he fails to do so. And in recent weeks -- perhaps in response to a memo from his own pollster, Linda DiVall, who warned that the Gramm campaign "offers pain and hard choices, no optimism" -- Senator Gramm has been trying to stress his plan's positive aspects.
"All we hear from Washington is the sacrifice involved in balancing the Federal budget," he said at a construction site in Phoenix. "We don't hear anything about the benefits."
To that end, he produced 27-year-old Ty Brewster, a struggling computer programmer with his wife, Lisa, and two young daughters, Morgan and McKenzie. "This is something we'd like to do if we could just get a little more of our tax dollars back," Mr. Brewster said, gesturing at a house in the making.
Mr. Gramm, projecting that a balanced budget would cut interest rates by two percentage points, rattled off figures about just how much money "average Arizonans" could save on home mortgages or car loans.
To the builder of a master-planned community here in Flagstaff, Mr. Gramm was even more blunt: "I'm gonna make you rich by balancing the Federal budget!"
Mr. Gramm is often given credit for preaching much the same economic message from the beginning of his career or, as he often puts it: "I was conservative before conservative was cool."
Drawing a contrast with Mr. Dole, whom he described as "a politician in search of a consensus" and someone who was "clueless" about the real meaning of last fall's election, Mr. Gramm said: "Party activists know that Senator Dole for 35 years has basically been, in the context of the modern Republican Party, a moderate. His hallmark has been cutting political deals and I think if there's ever been a time where the public is not inclined to go with a deal cutter, it's now."
Then, he quickly added: "Now I know him well. I like Senator Dole. I'm an admirer of his."
Mr. Gramm does have a talent for offering conservative positions in clear, colorful terms. "The social safety net has become a hammock," he says, or: "We must stop building prisons like Holiday Inns."
Mr. Gramm is occasionally compared in style and determination to another Texan, Lyndon B. Johnson. And a central question is whether he will forge a path, like Mr. Johnson, to the White House, or if he will wind up like another Texan, former Gov. John B. Connally, who created a $12 million juggernaut in the 1980 Presidential campaign to wind up with only a single delegate to show for it.
Mr. Gramm's chief strategist, Charles Black, said the big breakthrough would probably come just after Iowa and New Hampshire, in places like Arizona, whose primary comes one week later.
"Iowa's really Dole's best state in the whole country," Mr. Black said in an interview. "New Hampshire, that's a northeastern, New England state -- you've got to expect Dole to win those. Then, the calendar gets much more Gramm-friendly."
The Senator agreed: "One clear advantage I've got right now is that the people that are for me are for me. They have been for me when they have read every day that I was losing. They have for me under the worst of circumstances and they are not going anywhere. And if we begin to win, they're going to get very, very enthusiastic about it. And that's a strength."

Japan Changes Regulation Of the Nation's Banks
 Japan's Ministry of Finance announced sweeping changes in the way it manages the country's banks, in hope of ending a series of financial disasters. The measures are intended to allow the banks to thrive or fail by market discipline. The Finance Minister said the package "will fundamentally change Japan's financial policy." 
 Banks will be required to bolster their internal inspection systems and develop more complete risk management. The new guidelines follow the Daiwa Bank scandal, in which unauthorized trades in New York led to losses of $1.1 billion. [Page A1.]
 
The Politics of Averting a Default
 As Federal departments remained unfinanced and some closed, the Clinton Administration prepared new fiscal steps to avoid default, and a Republican committee chairman talked of a "constitutional crisis." [A1.]
 
Ways to Stabilize A Racing Heart
 The F.D.A. approved the use of two heart defibrillators, which are implanted devices that deliver a jolt of electricity to stabilize a racing heart. The makers are Guidant and Ventritex, which will compete against the market leader, Medtronic. Guidant appeared to have an advantage over Ventritex in how its device can be marketed. [D2.]
 
Stocks Edge Higher
Stocks advanced broadly, but in unusually slow trading. The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue-chip stocks rose 12.29 points, to 5,110.26, and broader measures also went up modestly. The regional Bell stocks and oil shares were among those rising, but many cyclical stocks weakened. [D8.]
 
Bond Prices Also Climb
 Treasury securities rose in thin volume, as the market waited for fresh news about the budget talks in Washington. Signs of weak retail sales lifted prices. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.03 percent, near a two-year low. [D15.]
 
Dissidents Challenge Tesoro
 Dissidents who own 5.7 percent of Tesoro Petroleum are trying to take over the company by replacing five directors. Tesoro stock rose 37.5 cents, to $9.375. [D2.]
 
China's Miracle Misses Millions
 China's economic miracle is improving lives along the coast, but is leaving behind millions of people in the interior. Increasingly, they are expressing anger over the disparity. [A1.]
 
In Mozambique, Hope vs. Reality
 Mozambique, one of the world's poorest countries, has a valuable natural-gas preserve, which the Enron Corporation plans to develop. It intends to build an 800-mile pipeline into the South African market, provided it can find a customer. But Enron may have alienated South African corporate buyers. [D4.]
 
A Tougher Year for Frequent Fliers
 Next year could bring less generous frequent-flier program awards, less flexibility to make plans, and increasing charges for flights, hotels and rental cars. Business Travel. [D7.]
 
Almost-Ads on Public TV and Radio
 Public radio and television stations have begun to stretch the boundaries of corporate underwriting. The radio spots are being dressed up with corporate jingles and toll-free numbers. And the TV spots are adding flashy logos and graphics. Advertising. [D2.]
 
Heating Oil Prices Rise
 Extended cold weather lifted energy prices further. January heating oil gained 0.41 cent, to 60.50 cents a gallon. [D6.]

HEADLINE: Budget Leader In House Fears Crisis on Debt

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 26

 BODY:
As the Clinton Administration prepares another wave of fiscal maneuvers to avoid national default during the budget impasse, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee warned today that the Administration was courting a "Constitutional and legal crisis" by usurping Congress's right to control the national debt.
The accusation by Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, came as the partial shutdown of the Government entered its second full week, with no prospect that Federal workers would be back at their jobs until after the new year. 
 Moreover, three-quarters of a million Federal workers faced the prospect of getting hit in the pocketbook soon, receiving half their normal paychecks next Tuesday.
To the disappointment of Republicans, the shutdown has created little political pressure for a quick budget settlement. Mr. Archer's warning today, in fact, seemed part of an effort by the Congressional leadership to switch horses, hoping that the prospect of default, if the Administration's fiscal juggling is blocked, might work better in forcing President Clinton to accept their priorities for balancing the budget.
Republicans had tried to use the Government's debt ceiling as such a lever back in November, when borrowing approached the statutory limit of $4.9 trillion. But Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin managed to put off any debt crisis through the end of the year.
In a letter sent today to Mr. Rubin, Mr. Archer did not advocate default but said "it is increasingly unclear what legal actions remain open to you," and appeared to be laying the groundwork for a court challenge to any new steps the Administration takes. So far, the Republicans have avoided that route, after their lawyers concluded that Mr. Rubin acted within his authority in November by withholding interest payments to two huge Government trust funds.
In a statement today, the Treasury Department said that it was Mr. Rubin's "duty and intention to take all legal steps necessary to assure that the nation's financial obligations -- obligations already approved by Congress -- are honored."
Mr. Rubin has argued that he has been driven to take "extraordinary measures" because of Congress's refusal to approve an increase in the debt limit. Even the Republican budget, if adopted whole, would require a huge increase in that cap on Federal borrowing.
The accusations and counteraccusations today sounded a bit empty in downtown Washington, chiefly because the combatants were nowhere to be seen. Mr. Archer was home with his family in Texas, Mr. Rubin was in New York and only their fax machines seemed busily at work. In fact, the combined effects of holiday vacations and the partial Government shutdown made Washington seem as empty as Paris in August or Tokyo at New Year's.
Meanwhile, Federal workers were beginning to show the first signs of fraying tempers.
At the Social Security Administration's headquarters in Woodlawn, Md., about 100 furloughed employees held a peaceful protest to express frustration at their inability to work. Some carried signs that read "Furlough Newt," a reference to Speaker Newt Gingrich.
In fact, 56,000 of 66,000 Social Security personnel around the country are on the job. But Joseph Flynn, vice president of the local union representing the protesting workers, said workers were angry that furloughed employees, along with those on the job, were only going to receive paychecks for half their normal pay on Jan. 2.
Paychecks for most workers cover work performed before Dec. 15, when the Congressional approval expired to pay 280,000 furloughed employees at Federal agencies that have not already had their budgets passed and signed into law by the President.
These people face getting one week's pay instead of the normal two on Tuesday, as do an additional 480,000 who have been working because they are considered essential but cannot be paid yet because budget bills covering them have not yet been approved.
The Federal Government has a legal obligation to pay the employees who have remained on the job, and Mr. Gingrich has promised that the furloughed workers will also be fully paid later, at the cost to the Government of about $40 million a day.
But while the furloughed workers are a potent image for television cameras, the debt limit -- a subject so complex that most lawmakers here were only vaguely aware of its details until a month or so ago -- has once again become the centerpiece of political maneuvering.
When Congress refused to extend the borrowing limit, Mr. Rubin first said that default was "unthinkable" and insisted that even the threat of failure to pay America's debts could raise interest rates on Federal borrowing. Several major credit-rating agencies agreed, putting the United States on a version of "credit watch," warning investors that the country's political willingness to pay its lenders, as opposed to its ability to pay, could be in jeopardy.
In fact, interest rates have dropped, in part because Mr. Rubin has poured so much effort, and in some cases considerable imagination, into techniques to keep the country afloat.
In November, he announced that the Treasury would no longer invest the assets of two trust funds in Government securities that generate the interest that keeps the funds growing in size.
By turning those Treasury securities into cash, he reduced the Government's outstanding debt by billions of dollars, creating more room for it to borrow funds on the open market and pay Social Security checks, interest on Government bonds and other expenses.
But it is a game Mr. Rubin can play only briefly. Those two funds are covered by Congressional legislation that requires the Government to reimburse any lost interest. But in one of the oddities of Government accounting, those I.O.U.'s do not count against the debt limit.
On Friday Mr. Rubin will try another twist: he will forgo crediting $14.5 billion in a semiannual interest payment to the Civil Service Retirement Fund, essentially issuing another I.O.U. That savings will get the Government through January, and perhaps into the beginning of February. But after that, he told Congress recently, he will have to take other steps that he has refused to disclose publicly, apparently for fear that it will give Republicans time to try to head off the maneuvers.
Whatever the Treasury does next, it will almost certainly be open to legal challenge. Mr. Archer pointed out in his letter today that the House has already passed a nonbinding resolution calling for the current debt limit to be enforced. And he warned that "the Constitution is clear on this point," citing Article I, section 8, which reserves to Congress the power to "borrow money on the credit of the United States." Sidestepping that constitutional provision, Mr. Archer argued, would "undermine the constitutional balance of power."

HEADLINE: BellSouth Seeks to Ease Curbs on Profit

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: COLUMBIA, S.C., Dec. 26

 BODY:
State regulators in South Carolina are about to decide whether to remove the profit restraints on the BellSouth Corporation. In return, the phone company said it would not raise rates for homes or small businesses until 1998.
BellSouth said it needed the freedom from regulation to help it prepare for competition. Consumer advocates, however, say the utility could earn higher-than-normal profits for some time before it faced true competition for its 1.2 million South Carolina customers. 
 The state Public Service Commission is scheduled to consider the matter Wednesday.
BellSouth, which is based in Atlanta, said that being allowed to keep as much as it could earn, with some limits on rate increases, would be an incentive to become more efficient, not increase rates.
Consumer advocates are skeptical. South Carolina's telephone market "is not even remotely competitive on the local level," said Elliott Elam, a lawyer who specializes in utility regulation for the state Consumer Affairs Department.
BellSouth wants to change rates for large business customers and for special services, like call waiting, as often as needed to attract customers. It would keep rates for residential and small business customers the same for three years and then tie rate increases to the inflation rate.

HEADLINE: Stocks Climb In Unusually Light Trading

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE 

 BODY:
On the day after Christmas, the stock market climbed in unusually light trading, and analysts were left with little to analyze.
"The strength was in the blue chips," said Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisers. "Institutions were dressing their portfolios for the year-end." 
 The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 blue-chip stocks rose 12.29 points, to 5,110.26. The big gainers included Coca-Cola, up 2 7/8, to 74 5/8; Merck, up 1 3/4, to 66 3/4; and DuPont, up 1, to 69 7/8.
Among the broader-based indicators, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 2.34 points, to 614.30, and the Nasdaq composite index increased 2.48 points, to 1,049.37. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index rose 2.22 points, to 543.77. Some 14.5 million shares changed hands on that exchange to push its annual trading above five billion shares for the first year ever.
With many traders staying home after the three-day weekend, turnover on the New York Stock Exchange was the lowest for a full day of trading since the July 4th period. A total of 217 million shares changed hands, compared with 289.6 million shares on Friday. Advances exceeded declines on the Big Board, 1,272 to 1,034.
The budget standoff in Washington, where the White House and Congress will not resume talks until Friday, added to the sluggishness of the market. "A growing contingent of investors are sitting on their hands," Mr. Stovall said. "It's a good reason not to do anything."
Regional Bell telephone stocks rallied after the companies helped to defeat a provision in the final version of the telecommunications-overhaul bill that would have delayed their ability to sell both local and long-distance services. Nynex rose 1 5/8, to 51 3/4; Bell Atlantic increased 1 1/4, to 66 7/8; and US West advanced 1, to 35 5/8.
Oil issues soared as cold winter weather helped to raise heating oil and natural gas prices. Royal Dutch closed at 140 3/8, up 1 1/2; Amerada Hess closed at 52, up 1/2; and Chevron closed at 52 1/2, up 3/8.
Some of the technology stocks were strong on expectations of above-average earnings. Texas Instruments jumped 2, to 53 1/2; Hewlett-Packard climbed 1, to 85 5/8; and Compaq added 1/8, to 49 7/8.
However, many of the cyclical stocks -- which tend to fall quickly when the economy turns down -- demonstrated weakness, apparently due to slowing earnings growth. Alcoa dropped 1 7/8, to 51 1/2; Caterpillar slipped 1 1/2, to 59 3/8; and Phelps Dodge declined 1 3/4, to 61 1/4.
With the release yesterday of the Johnson Redbook report that retail sales at chain and department stores slumped 2.4 percent in the four weeks ended last Saturday, some retailing companies were hard hit. Sears, Roebuck closed at 38 3/8, down 1 1/8; Gap closed at 41 3/8, down 1 7/8; and May Department Stores closed at 41 1/2, down 7/8.
Most of the European markets were closed for a holiday. But in France, the CAC-40 index fell 6.70 points, to 1,866.67.

HEADLINE: A Long March to Capitalism

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: TSINGTAO, China

 BODY:
Not long ago, Tsingtao Brewery looked unbeatable.
With a high quality product, a well established name, a booming beer market and ambitious plans to quadruple production in five years, Tsingtao seemed perfectly positioned to ride China's locomotive-like economic growth. In 1993, when the Government allowed China's top companies to list shares on Hong Kong's stock exchange, Tsingtao was chosen to go first, and its stock was one of the hottest issues of the year. 
 Yet Tsingtao (pronounced ching-dow) is going nowhere. Its profits are sagging, its stock is near an all-time low, and its expansion plans have stalled. Tsingtao managers have been reluctant to explain why the $190 million they raised in 1993 has not been invested in expansion.
Tsingtao's story straddles a central paradox in China today. In this nation's wrenching shift from a planned to a market economy, explosive growth has been accompanied by bumbling financial operations mired in a hopelessly inefficient system run by the Communist Party. The heralded entry of Chinese stocks into securities markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai has been a dud.
"Even by the year 2000 China could become an economic giant but remain a financial pygmy," Timothy Beardson, chairman of Crosby Securities in Hong Kong, said at a recent conference in Beijing.
The contradiction is striking: China has emerged as a magnet for international investment, as manufacturers like Motorola, Coca-Cola and General Motors pour in. Economic growth has averaged a sparkling 12 percent annually for four years, and an awakening demand for consumer goods and services is likely to continue for decades.
Yet the financial system envisioned by China's leaders is stuck in its infancy. China's stock markets remain tiny and lackluster: in the past six months, as the Dow Jones industrial average kept racking up new highs, Chinese shares on the Hong Kong and Shanghai markets have drifted lower and lower.
Unforeseen difficulties are inevitable, of course, when capital markets are being built from scratch. In China, though, such problems are compounded by a situation that most Western investors have a hard time fathoming: companies that say they want to make money are still run by Communist Party bureaucrats who care more about meetings and Government policy than revenues or profit margins.
Many businesses survive on Government subsidies and loans that banks are ordered to give them, and those selected to issue shares are picked as much for political reasons as for financial ones.
Tsingtao's difficulties are especially striking because the opportunity is so great. China's beer market is now about 118 million barrels annually, roughly 15 times as big as it was in 1980 and growing so fast it has overtaken Germany to become the world's second largest, after the United States.
But Tsingtao, unused to entertaining questions from anyone but Government officials, is almost completely indifferent to investors and analysts, offering them little information.
Of the 17 China-based companies now listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, only one, Shanghai Petrochemical, trades at more than its original listing price. And Brilliance China Automotive Holdings, a Bermuda-registered company that promoted itself as China's first listing on the New York Stock Exchange, shot up to $30 shortly after its debut in 1992, but now trades at around $4.
American investment banks like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Smith Barney, after big expansions into China in 1993, now have little business here.
Any analyst can list a number of reasons Chinese stocks are down this year: Many have suffered from Beijing's tight-credit policy, others were hit by unexpected tax increases, still others were simply priced badly. But the main problem is that it has gradually dawned on investors that they understand little about how Chinese companies are run. When they do get a peek inside, they don't like what they see.
Tsingtao is a prime example. It has been making beer here since the Germans opened the brewery in 1903, when they colonized a section of the Shandong peninsula in northeast China. As it earned a reputation for making the best beer in China, Tsingtao gained a robust 70 percent of China's beer exports.
When they announced plans to list shares as the first of many "red chip," or mainland Chinese, stocks in Hong Kong, Tsingtao executives boldly proclaimed plans to dominate China's fragmented beer market, in which more than 800 breweries compete.
Response was overwhelming, and the initial offering was so oversubscribed -- more than 100 times -- that few investors could get in.
After Tsingtao was listed at 36 cents a share, it climbed to $1.40, a towering 98 times earnings, in 1994. The Anheuser-Busch Companies, the American beer giant, bought a 5 percent stake.
But bad news began emerging about Tsingtao in the middle of this year.
Profit in the first half fell 49 percent, as prices of raw materials rose sharply but competition prevented Tsingtao from charging more for its beer. More troubling, analysts looking over the company's puzzlingly vague annual report discovered that Tsingtao's managers had taken nearly half of the $190 million from their share issue and, rather than investing it in plant expansion -- as had been promised in a prospectus -- lent it to other Chinese companies that Tsingtao will not identify.
With its new capital thus mysteriously tied up, Tsingtao had to scale back expansion plans and cut projected growth in beer production, which is now at about three million barrels a year, by half. Worse, it remains unclear how much of Tsingtao's loans will be repaid: China's state-owned enterprises are famous for losing money and remaining immune to demands for repayment.
"When we called with questions, they wouldn't come to the phone," said Lim Cheang Yee, an analyst for H. G. Asia in Hong Kong. "They screwed around with minority shareholders' money, but wouldn't explain anything."
Ms. Lim said that Tsingtao had apparently recovered much of its loan money in recent months, and had even become more responsive to questions. But she said that it would still take a long time to repair the damage done to its credibility.
Talks between Anheuser-Busch and Tsingtao about expanding the American company's stake to 15 percent or more went sour. Anheuser-Busch executives have told colleagues at other beer companies that the deeper they looked into Tsingtao, the more pessimistic they became about the company's ability to expand its share of this fragmented market.
While Tsingtao is one of China's largest breweries and clearly its best known, it has just 2.2 percent of the market. And though its 70 percent share of China's beer exports sounds good, that accounts for just 10 percent of Tsingtao's sales over all. Moreover, those sales are blurred by the complex set of distribution rights, which vary from market to market, that the company agreed to when first entering international markets several years ago.
"They're amazingly arrogant," said a distributor who works with Tsingtao managers. "They say, 'We're Tsingtao, we don't need to advertise.' It's so ridiculous. Even Coca-Cola has to advertise."
The markets have judged Tsingtao harshly as well, with the stock now trading at less than $2 and its American depository receipts selling for pennies. [On Tuesday, the company's shares closed at 1.82 Hong Kong dollars, and its A.D.R.'s closed at 23 cents.]
Tsingtao executives brush away questions about their unorthodox lending.
"I don't see what the fuss is about," said Qiao Qijian, a senior executive at Tsingtao, in an interview at company headquarters here during which he downed three glasses of Tsingtao draft. "Many investors from Hong Kong are concerned. But when they come to visit, they can see that everything is going fine."
Mr. Qiao said Tsingtao had been unable to invest its newly raised capital immediately because of shifting policy in Beijing, and had to delay its planning throughout 1994 until a meeting was held in February 1995. At that time, Beijing officials informed company executives about the need to shift China's alcoholic consumption away from the traditional favorite, grain alcohol, because of a growing shortage of grain.
That means beer and wine production is to be encouraged, which sounds good for Tsingtao. Yet the fact that a leading beer company's expansion was dictated by a Government meeting, itself most concerned with the politics of grain production, was an indication of how the emphasis remains on Government planning rather than on market demand.
Moreover, Mr. Qiao conceded that the financing of increased beer production was not even discussed at the meeting.
That seems short-sighted. China's beer market is entering an intensely competitive stage, with foreign breweries marching into China every day. Asahi and Kirin of Japan and Foster's of Australia recently announced plans to expand, and Beck's of Germany and Pabst of Milwaukee are already making beer in China.
With prospects for Tsingtao bleak, Anheuser-Busch went ahead with a joint venture to produce Budweiser with a different brewery in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
"Our greatest concern with the company has always been that competition will force Tsingtao to cap price growth," Ms. Lim of H. G. Asia wrote in an analysis of the brewery, recommending that shareholders sell. "Profit growth will therefore have to depend on volume growth."
On paper, Tsingtao's expansion plans call for a fourfold production increase by the year 2000, which would come to 10 percent of today's domestic market. But Mr. Qiao, the Tsingtao executive, conceded that with all the delays it has encountered, the company would be pleased to achieve half as much.
Even with scaled-back plans, it is unclear where additional financing will come from, since China is in the midst of a tight credit policy that shows no signs of easing.
Mr. Qiao leaned back in a puffy chair and took a deep breath when asked about this.
"We have three options: bank loans, Government subsidies or another share issue," he said.
Unfortunately, he added, none of those look feasible anytime soon.

HEADLINE: Czechs Use Laws to Exclude Gypsies From Gaining Citizenship and Voting

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: PRAGUE

 BODY:
Nearly three years ago, Verona Slobodnikova suddenly felt like a foreigner in her own country. A well-thumbed red Czechoslovak identity card, with its faded black-and-white photo, no longer gave her the rights accorded to citizens because the country split in two at the start of 1993.
"I can't go to a doctor and get it paid for by the state like I used to," said Mrs. Slobodnikova, who was born in Slovakia but has lived in Prague since childhood. "I can't apply for a job. They ask you in the first meeting at the job center for your citizenship papers." 
 Theoretically, she could apply for Czech citizenship. But Mrs. Slobodnikova has found that becoming a citizen all over again is not so easy.
A 1993 law says she must renounce her Slovak citizenship and meet stiff new requirements for Czech citizenship that some human rights advocates assert are the most discriminatory in Europe since World War II.
The Czech Republic is commonly viewed in the West as a bastion of tolerance and lofty ideals, a country that has most easily made the transition from Communism to democratic values.
But European and American lawmakers have increasingly criticized the Czech Government for a law that they say appears to have been written with the idea of depriving citizenship to Gypsies, the largest ethnic minority in the Czech Republic. A Czech human rights group, the Tolerance Foundation, has estimated that at least 20,000 Gypsies, about a tenth of the country's Gypsy population, have been excluded from Czech citizenship since 1993.
In a letter to Vaclav Havel, the Czech President, the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe described the citizenship law as "instituting what may be the largest denaturalization in Europe since the World War II period."
The law has meant that many Gypsies cannot take part in the country's privatization program or reclaim property confiscated by the Communists.
Those without citizenship are barred from voting or holding public office and are routinely denied social benefits in this country of 10.5 million people.
Social workers say these restrictions further penalize a largely impoverished group that suffers daily from being refused service at bars and restaurants and prevented from renting apartments. The police say racist attacks in the Czech Republic tripled in 1994 to about 160, with most directed at Gypsies.
The discriminatory practices here are particularly serious, says the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, because they set a precedent for other nations contemplating stringent citizenship requirements as a way of excluding people for ethnic or religious reasons.
"Citizenship legislation based on ethnicity is the worst thing happening in Europe and it's being done in the cloak of democracy because international law is fairly weak on this," a United Nations refugee official familiar with the Czech situation said. "If the international community accepts this legislation in the highly developed Czech Republic with a Prague castle and Havel in it, what's to stop the Yugoslav lands from doing it?"
Already, restrictive citizenship legislation is being drafted in Croatia and Macedonia, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Aside from the basic question of human rights, the refugee agency has also expressed concern that the Czech law is encouraging Gypsies, frustrated at the lack of security at home, to flee to Western Europe. Several hundred Gypsies have sought asylum in Germany in the last two years.
There has so far been no action on appeals to the Czechs to change the law and bring it into line with the standards of the Council of Europe, of which the Czech Republic is a member.
Critics say this is partly because Mr. Havel has been unwilling to push to change a law that public opinion surveys show is hugely popular among Czech voters.
Ladislav Zamboj, a social worker with the Tolerance Foundation, which assists Gypsies through the legal labyrinth of attempting to gain citizenship, said Mr. Havel told the foundation this year that he was powerless to change what he agreed was an unfair law.
In response to criticisms, Czech officials have denied that the law is discriminatory. Medical and unemployment benefits were conditioned on a permanent residence card and not citizenship, said Zdenek Matejka, a citizenship expert of the Czech Government.
In practice, however, social workers say that residence cards are often difficult to obtain and that anyway, Government agencies demand evidence of citizenship before giving benefits.
The Czech Interior Ministry, which oversees citizenship procedures, reports that Czech citizenship has been given to 360,000 Slovaks since 1993. But most of these people are non-Gypsies, social workers say. The Interior Ministry has also said that only 150 applicants have been rejected. But this does not count the 8,000 applicants whose papers are pending and does not count those who have not applied or cannot apply because of all the complications, according to the Tolerance Foundation.
The stipulation that an applicant have a five-year record free of any criminal convictions contravenes accepted Western norms for citizenship, according to the Council of Europe, which was founded in 1949 to encourage European unity and democracy.
Several months ago, the council took the unusual step of sending four experts to examine the Czech law. The deputy secretary general of the council, Peter Leuprecht, said the experts had found a number of objectionable features in the law, including the requirement for a clean criminal record, as well as high fees for passports and the release of basic documents like birth certificates.
Mrs. Slobodnikova, for example, is in a bind over the necessary documents. She meets all the requirements; but when her husband, Dusan, managed to get his citizenship papers two years ago, she could not find her birth certificate. Now, the papers proving her clean police record appear to be missing at local precincts.
"We have applied to the Czech and the Slovak police," she said, "but there is nothing yet."

HEADLINE: Phillip Areeda, Considered Top Authority on Antitrust Law, Dies at 65

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER 

 BODY:
Phillip Areeda, a Harvard Law School professor who was considered the country's foremost specialist on antitrust legislation and was writing the eleventh volume of his life work, "Antitrust Law," at his death, died on Sunday in Cambridge, Mass. He was 65.
Doctors at the Stillman Infirmary at Harvard said he had been under treatment for leukemia. 
 "My life has been teaching and writing," Professor Areeda said in a recent interview -- except for what he called a couple of "excursions" to Washington, including four years as a special counsel to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Professor Areeda had taught at Harvard Law School since 1961 and was appointed the Langdell Professor of Law in 1981.
One of his students was Robert Clark, now the school's dean. "He trained literally thousands of students to be precise, critical, careful and aware of alternative viewpoints," Mr. Clark said. He noted that Professor Areeda was an opera fan and said that may have influenced his teaching. "There was a certain drama to it, very exciting," he said.
Professor Areeda himself said that when students being schooled through the Socratic method came up with "oddities and twists, the challenge is to guide the student from misunderstanding -- or perhaps profound insight -- back to the center line of the argument."
Acknowledging that contemporary students might consider him a bit old-fashioned, he said, "My emphasis on not losing sight of the law may also make me old-fashioned.'
' In the 1990's, he noted, the teaching of law had become increasingly interdisciplinary, a development he applauded. But, he added, "In my classroom, the students remember that they are doing law, not economics as such or sociology as such."
Derek Bok, a law school classmate from 1951 to 1954 and later president of Harvard for two decades, said his longtime friend's devotion to his field of expertise, antitrust, grew out of twin interests in public policy and economics. "Antitrust law is where they intersected," Mr. Bok said.
Mr. Areeda was an economics major as an undergraduate at Harvard.
In the spring of 1994 Professor Areeda, in a response he gave to the Harvard University Gazette to a question about the state of his subject, said: "Like all fields of law, antitrust ebbs and flows, sometimes with greater populist concern for protecting small firms from big ones. At other times, the emphasis is on economic efficiency.
"The major change in the field," he said, "has been the growing awareness that business affairs are more complex than they might seem initially, and that motivations for what initially appears to be a restraint of trade might in fact in a more subtle way promote competition."
As for his mammoth work, then nearing completion of Volume 10, he said: "I see a Volume 11 and, I'm afraid, a Volume 12. I attack a topic and work steadily at it almost to the exclusion of everything else, except for my teaching."
Originally he expected the thesis to be completed in two volumes. Then he found himself writing a footnote that went on for some 20 pages.
Associate Justice Stephen G. Breyer of the Supreme Court, a former Harvard Law School colleague, remarked several years ago that most lawyers would rather have the support of "two paragraphs of Areeda on antitrust than four courts of appeals and three Supreme Court Justices."
In 1988 Professor Areeda was the co-author, with Louis Kaplow, of what has become a standard textbook, "Antitrust Analysis" (Little, Brown).
Phillip Areeda was born Jan. 28, 1930, in Detroit. A scholarship student, he graduated from Harvard in 1951 and was later awarded a Harvard traveling fellowship.
In addition to his four years in the Eisenhower White House, he served briefly in 1969 as executive director of the Cabinet Task Force on Oil Import Control under President Richard M. Nixon. For four months in late 1974 and early 1975 he was a counsel to President Gerald Ford.
In October 1972 he was among 79 academics who took out full-page advertisements in The New York Times urging people to re-elect President Nixon. A year later, in the wake of the Watergate, he and others voiced regrets for that action. "There's no way to put how I feel about that in a way I want to be quoted," Professor Areeda said at the time.
In moments of leisure away from his books and his classroom, Mr. Areeda tried to jog nearly every day and to indulge "a weakness for good food and good wine." His devotion to Harvard was reflected in his donation of more than $5 million earlier this year to the Harvard Law School -- the second largest gift from an individual in the school's history.
Mr. Areeda was not married, and left no immediate survivors.

HEADLINE: A Second Look, Then an Arrest In a Girl's Abuse

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
A neighbor called 911 shortly before 8 P.M. Christmas night to report a case of possible child abuse in Brooklyn. Police officers and Emergency Medical Service workers responded, intent on rescuing a child from harm.
That opportunity, however, was almost lost. The parents of the two children in the Bedford-Stuyvesant apartment showed the officers and paramedics a healthy 3-year-old boy; the 6-year-old girl with the black eyes and burn marks on her back was kept in another room. The police left, and the E.M.S. workers returned to their ambulance to radio their dispatcher. 
 "They told us the 3-year-old child was fine, the problem unfounded," John Kilcooley, a supervisor at E.M.S.'s communications center, said of his conversation with the ambulance workers. "But the call had come in for a 5-year-old child. We said, hey, this is Christmas, let's get this one right."
The ambulance workers asked the police to return. Yanin Balbuena, 6 years old, was soon found and taken to Kings County Hospital Center. Jose Balbuena, the children's 24-year-old father, was arrested, and yesterday he was arraigned in Brooklyn Criminal Court on an assault charge. The child's mother, who apparently went along with the initial deception of the police, has not been charged and has retained custody of the girl's 3-year-old brother, Jose.
The incident in Brooklyn underscored once more how easily cases of what is apparently child abuse can go unanswered, a problem that has drawn considerable public attention since the death last month of 6-year-old Elisa Izquierdo.
Police officials and prosecutors in Brooklyn said yesterday that Mr. Balbuena, after first trying to explain that something had merely fallen on his daughter, admitted striking the child with a belt. According to papers filed in court by prosecutors, Yanin Balbuena was found to have swelling of the head and body, blackened eyes and scars from burn marks on her back and buttocks. Mr. Balbuena has been charged with assault, criminal possession of a weapon and endangering the welfare of a child.
Mr. Balbuena, who has no prior criminal record, was released without bail by Judge Karen B. Yellen, but ordered to stay away from his children and the family's apartment at 17 Marcus Garvey Boulevard. The Brooklyn District Attorney, Charles J. Hynes, whose office had sought bail of $20,000, said he was "disappointed" with the judge's decision.
Officials with E.M.S. said the child's injuries were not life-threatening. A spokeswoman for Kings County Hospital Center refused yesterday to disclose the girl's condition.
The landlord and superintendent for Mr. Balbuena's building, Edwin Cedeno, said that the family had moved into the apartment four months ago. He said Mr. Balbuena, who told the police he was unemployed, had worked occasionally as a freelance disk jockey. He said he had never suspected any problem, although he had noticed several days ago that Yanin Balbuena had black eyes.
"I thought it was sickness," said Mr. Cedeno, who said he spoke with the child in the doorway of her apartment over the weekend. "She told me kind of shyly that she had fallen down. I asked her where. She pointed to the back room."
In a brief interview yesterday, Marin Balbuena, the children's mother, said she had asked her daughter what had happened when she noticed her bruises. Mrs. Balbuena said her daughter had told her that Mr. Balbuena had dropped a bottle of water and that she had fallen. Mrs. Balbuena said she believed her daughter's account. Asked if Mr. Balbuena had ever hit her daughter before, she said, "I don't know."
The sequence of events Monday night began with a 911 call placed shortly before 8 P.M. The anonymous female caller said she believed a child was in danger, and that the mother, Marin Balbuena, was too afraid to ask for help.
The officers and E.M.S. workers arrived and were met by both parents and the 3-year-old boy, officials said.
"I don't know who was hiding who," said Mr. Kilcooley of E.M.S. "But this time they didn't get away with it. It was the caller, though, who set the whole thing in motion."
But the E.M.S. dispatcher persevered.
"The anonymous caller was sure there had been a child in trouble," said Susan James, the dispatcher who also talked with the crew. "I was uncomfortable with it. I had a sense there was another child there."
Deputy Inspector Robert Cividanes, a spokesman for the Police Department, confirmed that the initial call had been declared unfounded, and said the department was interviewing all the officers and medical workers involved as part of an inquiry into the incident.
"This isn't about who gets credit," said David Bookstaver, a spokesman for E.M.S. "The bottom line is that a child was removed from harm."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Enron Goes to Africa Seeking Gas and Customers

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Beneath the rolling grasslands of southern Mozambique lies a huge reserve of natural gas, which if piped to neighboring South Africa, could bring $100 million a year in hard currency to Mozambique, the poorest country in the world.
And last month, an aggressive American gas company, the Enron Corporation of Houston, triumphed over several competitors and signed an agreement with the Mozambique Government to develop the field. 
 Enron plans to construct an 800-mile pipeline into the South African market, provided it can find a customer. The only problem is that during the bidding process, Enron may have alienated many of the South African energy companies that were the most promising customers. Some of those companies had wanted a stake in the pipeline themselves.
"If they don't have a buyer for the gas, then Enron loses its rights," said Eric Daffern, a World Bank official. "They can't sit on it forever." Indeed, Enron must find a customer by June or seek an extension from the Government.
The joint venture between Enron and Mozambique's state-owned energy company took diplomacy to put together, company executives and United States officials said. It nearly fell apart several times in the last three months as Mozambican energy officials complained they were under political pressure from the United States to accept what they saw as a bad deal.
In the end, the accord came only after Enron agreed to give the state energy company a bigger share of the venture, Mozambique officials said. Along the way, American diplomats in Maputo and several United States senators mounted a lobbying campaign to persuade Mozambique to sign with Enron.
"Elements of the embassy did a bit of lobbying for the company, which I find a bit strange, because this is a commercial agreement," said John Kachamila, Mozambique's Minister of Energy Resources, who negotiated the deal. He contended that he was "told that other aid to Mozambique might be in jeopardy if this agreement was not signed."
Mozambique relies almost entirely on foreign aid for its budget and receives about $40 million a year in American aid.
American officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, denied that a specific threat to cut aid was made.
"It was a little more nuanced than that," said one Clinton Administration official. The Mozambique officials were told Congress would be less likely to approve the same level of aid for the country if it rejected a major capital project, the official said. "It is difficult to say we should give Mozambique $40 million a year, if it's going to take an opportunity for a $700 million project and not do it," the official added.
Enron's success in navigating the political waters of southern Africa is set against the background of its problems in India, where its project to build a $3 billion power plant in Maharashstra state was nearly derailed last summer after nationalist politicians charged that Enron had padded costs and bribed officials to get the contract.
But the hard-nosed American company is scarcely home free in Mozambique, for it stepped on the toes of South African companies to obtain the right to build the pipeline.
One potential buyer, Eskom Ltd., the South African electric utility, has said the price for the gas was too high. Another possible customer, Sasol Limited -- the South African coal-to-oil processing company -- is still stinging from having lost its bid to build the pipeline before Enron arrived on the scene in late 1994.
Without sales contracts, Enron will never be able to attract the $600 million in financing to build the pipeline, World Bank officials say.
Enron executives say they have high hopes of finding a buyer among South Africa's mining and steel companies, which could use the gas for mining operations.
Joseph W. Sutton, the president of Enron Development, a subsidiary, said the talks were still in a preliminary stage. "We are hopeful," he said. "This is very early in the development stages of this project."
The pipeline project is Enron's first foray into Africa. The company is the largest natural gas supplier in the world, with 44,000 miles of pipelines in South America and the United States, and in recent years, it has aggressively tried to break into new markets in the third world.
The Gulf Oil Company discovered the Pande field in 1961 while drilling an exploratory well in Inhambane province. The Pande is 12 miles by 15 miles and has reserves of about 2 trillion cubic feet. The Mozambican energy company, Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos, has exclusive rights to develop it.
But 20 years of civil war in Mozambique hindered development. That changed when a peace treaty was signed in 1992. President Joaquim A. Chissano has been seeking to increase exports, which total only about $300 million a year, mostly shrimp and cashew nuts. The Enron deal is one such effort.
Although the terms of the joint venture are confidential, officials with knowledge of the details say Enron controls a majority of shares. After Enron pays taxes, however, the Government will end up with about half the revenues -- an expected $140 to $200 million a year.
Last August, however, a tentative deal between Enron and the Government began to unravel, a Clinton Administration official said. American diplomats in Maputo tried to salvage it, and several United States senators and Anthony Lake, the president's national security advisor, wrote letters to the Mozambican Government.
The World Bank then stepped in, concluding that Mozambicans were accepting too much risk. The deal was renegotiated and signed in November. But Mozambique officials then produced a minor political firestorm, complaining about the American diplomats' role in the talks.
In the end, however, the deal will hinge not on American diplomacy, but on whether a market can be found in South Africa, a land with few gas reserves, Mr. Sutton said.
"Enron still has a lot of work to do to bring in a customer," Mr. Kachamila said. "If there is no sign of getting a market, they will be in trouble."

Dollar Falls as a Large Buyer Causes an Increase in the Pound

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar drifted lower against European currencies yesterday as one large buyer aggressively bid up the British pound. Most European markets were closed for a holiday, resulting in thin trading that magnified the impact of the pound-buying spree.
The pound dominated activity, rising against both the dollar and the German mark after a large commercial buyer sent out a flurry of sterling purchases from a range of banks. 
 Some dealers said the buyer came from the Middle East, while others looked to Singapore. Either way, the purchases propelled the pound through key technical levels that set off automatic orders to sell the dollar.
"The lack of liquidity in the market and the lack of players willing to stand in the way triggered a quick run-up," said Peter Wadkins, dealer at Standard Chartered Bank.
Some analysts said the run-up in the pound was largely speculative, intended to hedge against the risk arising out of the budget impasse in Washington, which has left the Federal Government partly shut for a second week.
In late New York trading, the pound rose to $1.5560, up from $1.5400 on Friday, and climbed to 2.2325 German marks, from 2.2168 German marks.
The dollar, meanwhile, dipped to 1.4330 marks, from 1.4380 marks on Friday.
The currency market found little guidance from political developments in Washington, where the White House and Congress set a new round of budget negotiations for today.
"The resolution or the non-resolution of the budget impasse will translate where the dollar goes," said Earl Johnson, foreign exchange economist at Bank of Montreal. "Nobody is going to take a view on the dollar until this is resolved."
The dollar's decline against the pound and the mark pulled the American currency down against the Japanese yen. After posting early gains, the dollar edged down in New York to 102.40 yen, from 102.70 yen on Friday.
Initially, the dollar rose against the yen after the Bank of Japan announced new measures to monitor Japanese banks following the recent scandal at Daiwa Bank.
Currency dealers said the measures were likely to benefit the dollar because increased bank scrutiny could allow wider Japanese financial deregulation and an increased flow of Japanese capital to overseas markets.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
30-Year Bond Rises, Its Yield Now 6.03%

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities rose yesterday in thin trading, as the bond market waited for fresh news about the budget talks in Washington and as retail sales for December seemed to offer further evidence of a weakening economy.
The benchmark 30-year bond rose by 11/32 , to a price of 11117/32 and a yield of 6.03 percent, down from 6.06 percent on Friday. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions. 
 Investors were reluctant to buy amid all the uncertainty of the budget talks, and that and the holiday week kept trading volume low.
However, a weak reading in the weekly Johnson Redbook retail-sales data released in the afternoon did manage to buoy prices a bit. The study helps analysts estimate the pace of consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the economy.
James Hale, a fixed-income analyst at MMS International in San Francisco, said, "We are now getting more reports that Christmas is pretty bad, and the likelihood of further Fed cuts is now greater."
The Johnson Redbook survey said that chain- and department-store sales for the four-week period that ended last Saturday declined 2.4 percent from the previous four weeks, seasonally adjusted. "But the perceptions of a sluggish holiday shopping season are well entrenched," Mr. Hale said, "so we doubt the market can get much more mileage out of it.
He also said the day's trading indicated that investors expected a favorable resolution of the budget talks between White House representatives and the Republican-led Congress. Volume was thin, with no momentum from overseas markets to carry over into yesterday's session, Mr. Hale said, adding:
"Many market participants have elected to remain home this week. Not many want to jeopardize the significant profits that were made this year solely for the chance to add a few more points."
At the beginning of December, signs of restrained economic growth and declining inflation pressure helped lower yields on the benchmark Treasury issue to a two-year low of 6.02 percent, a level the market is again approaching. Traders say the drop in yields has allowed investors to show the best returns in the broad-maturity Treasury market in about 10 years.
Elsewhere, the regular weekly auction of Treasury bills drew mediocre demand at average discount rates of 4.91 percent for a three-month maturity, and 5.04 percent for the six-month. Both were down from the previous auction, with the bid-to-cover ratio considered low at 3.17 for the three-month bills and 3.18 for the six-month maturity. The bid-to-cover ratio, or the value of buy orders compared with the actual amount sold, is regarded as a measure of investor interest. And yesterday's numbers suggested less than usual interest.
Eric Hamilton, senior fixed-income analysts at Technical Data in Boston, said it was "hardly a day for the record books."
He said there was probably a little more buying than first believed, with some last-minute activity adding to the day's gains. But the Government shutdown is keeping many economic reports from being released.
"Traders do however get a chance to look at consumer confidence for December," he said. Analysts are expecting a modest decline in today's report from last month's confidence index level of 101.4.
"If the recent retail sales experience is any guide," he said, "the data could be considerably softer, especially after the latest Johnson Redbook report showed that the holiday shopping season remained weak."
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:

JAPAN BANKS FACE MARKET DISCIPLINE UNDER NEW POLICY

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 26

 BODY:
The Ministry of Finance announced sweeping changes today in the way it manages Japan's banks, in hope of ending a series of financial disasters that have harmed the nation's worldwide image.
The measures are intended to make Japan's banks thrive or fail by market discipline. The ministry's announcement comes at a time when the stock market has been rising to new heights for the year, and the measures appear aimed to ride the resultant crest of good will. 
 "It is necessary for Japan to make a drastic shift in its financial policy," the Finance Minister, Masayoshi Takemura, said. "The package will fundamentally change Japan's financial policy."
A number of the measures are aimed directly at preventing the kind of fraud that occurred at the New York branch of Daiwa Bank, where a bond trader is accused of having falsified thousands of transaction slips and hiding $1.1 billion in losses over nearly a dozen years. Even after both Daiwa and ministry officials discovered the loss, they did not notify American authorities for several weeks.
Under the new measures, the Ministry of Finance will improve its communication channels with regulatory authorities in other countries, and wrongdoings must be reported "promptly" by the financial institution to the regulators in the host country.
Japanese banks have operated for decades on a so-called convoy system, in which all the banks support each other, making it virtually impossible for an institution to fail. Today's measures seek to depart from that concept and force banks to stand on their own.
Under the new guidelines provided by the ministry, banks will be required to bolster their own internal inspection and control systems, and draw up more complete policies for risk management and control in traditional and newer business like derivatives -- highly volatile financial instruments that derive their value from underlying assets such as stocks or bonds.
Ministry guidelines will also cover lending limits. A major problem at a number of the failed institutions was that they lent huge sums to a single company or industry.
"The most important point is that the Ministry of Finance's policy is changing from guardian of the industry to judge or umpire of the industry," said Yoshinobu Yamada, a bank analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan. "It will have long-term implications."
In one of the frankest admissions of regulatory shortcomings by a top Government official, Mr. Takemura said today that Japan's financial authorities should "reflect on the failure" of financial supervision during the speculative "bubble" years of the 1980's.
Bankers piled up mountains of real estate loans, more than $400 billion of which have gone sour since the collapse of the bubble a few years ago.
"We should regard this as a sea change in the Ministry of Finance's approach to things," said Paul Heaton, a financial analyst at Deutsche Bank Capital Markets. "They're saying to themselves: 'We are looking silly at the end of 1995, so we better find out what really is going on at the banks.' "
To be sure, the Ministry of Finance has said before that it would increase supervision, and some of today's measures, which apply to all deposit-taking financial institutions, appeared to be embellishments of steps previously announced. Further, the ministry has so lost credibility because of its failure to prevent banking catastrophes that it may be difficult for it to impose its will on the financial system.
In recent weeks, for example, the ministry had to turn to the use of public funds in mopping up a portion of the banking system's bad loans because it failed to force certain financial institutions to increase their share in the losses.
Nonetheless, the ministry's measures today were an attempt to improve the transparency in a banking system that many foreign bankers view as opaque. Rules are not explicit, and often directives on major policies are not disclosed to the public.
The lack of full disclosure is one of the most common complaints by foreign investors.
The measures, which are expected to go into effect in April, do not directly improve the poor disclosure by banks. Still, the ministry said it hoped that the quality of disclosures would improve as a result of the measures.
To that end, it will set up an early- warning system aimed at detecting irregularities at banks. For example, the ministry established guidelines for capital adequacy and risk management and controls; it will also rate banks and devise inspections according to the ratings.
Although the ministry said it would penalize or fine institutions that violated its guidelines, it said it was still studying other punitive measures, such as ordering a bank to stop paying dividends if its capital ratios fell below a certain level.
At home, Japanese banks must report wrongdoings according to deadlines set by the ministry, and significant wrongdoings should be publicly disclosed in a "timely" manner.
The ministry will send inspection teams to Japanese branch offices in New York and London at the same time it conducts inspections at head offices in Japan. By increasing the number of ministry inspectors to 486 from 420, the ministry hopes to have these inspection teams directly verify transaction slips and other activity.
Overseas branches of Japanese banks will also be encouraged to undergo external audits, and bank employees will be required to take their annual vacations. In the Daiwa Bank case, the accused trader never took a vacation, enabling him, authorities said, to maintain a cover-up of losses for many years.
In a separate development, the Bank of Japan said it would complete its own inspection of the New York branches of half of Japan's 21 major commercial banks. After inspecting three branches, it said it had detected some "defects" in risk management, according to a report by Kyodo News Service.

HEADLINE: The Islamic Challenge in Turkey

 BODY:
Few countries are as strategically important to American interests around the world as Turkey. During the cold war, Washington valued its large army and long land frontier with the Soviet Union. After the Soviet collapse, Turkey's pro-Western leaders have promoted it as a bastion of secular democracy in the Muslim Middle East, a strategic counterweight to Iran.
But Turkey, which is a NATO member and aspires to be a member of the European Union, has never quite lived up to its ambitions, or Washington's. Turkey has waged a brutal war against its Kurdish minority and its human rights record is abysmal. Now its secular character is under siege. 
 The militantly Islamic Welfare Party finished first in Sunday's elections, its strongest showing ever, opening a difficult new phase in Turkish politics. Even though the party drew only 21 percent of a fractured vote, it invokes the Muslim faith professed by 98 percent of Turkey's people. Its success threatens the long-term viability of the secular republic established 72 years ago by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. The Welfare Party's gains also threaten Turkey's international and economic policies since the party is hostile to NATO, Europe, Israel and entrepreneurial capitalism.
The party has material as well as spiritual appeal for Turkey's urban poor, its greatest base of strength. In Ankara and Istanbul, both of which it has governed since early last year, the party has offered cheap bread, health clinics and other social services desperately needed by hundreds of thousands of recent migrants from the countryside. These include many Kurds who have fled fierce army repression in their home region. Local governments controlled by the Welfare Party have also closed battered women's shelters and have campaigned against Western-influenced art and culture.
Turkey's secular parties understandably feel threatened. They are now scrambling to put together a broad left-right coalition and hint that the military could somehow step in to defend Ataturk's secular legacy. The secular parties would do better to reach out to Welfare's voters with social programs, political dialogue and a halt to military pressure against Kurdish civilians.
Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who submitted her resignation Monday, has pressed for Turkey's integration into the European Union to reinforce Ankara's ties to the West. Two weeks ago, the European Parliament, with an eye to helping secularists in Sunday's election, overlooked its objections to Turkish human rights abuses and approved a customs union. But Sunday's voters seemed to care less about Europe than their own economic survival, made harder by the austerity policies international lenders have driven Ankara to pursue.
The Welfare Party's leader is Necmettin Erbakan, a former deputy prime minister and a wily veteran of Turkey's political wars. In the 1970's, he led an earlier Islamic party into a governing coalition with the Social Democrats, the first breach in Ataturk's secular wall. Since then he has advocated friendship with Iraq, hostility to Israel and Europe and hard-line support for Turkish rule in Cyprus.
His most formidable enemy is the army, which sees itself as the guardian of Ataturk's legacy. After the military took power in 1980, it convicted Mr. Erbakan of trying to set up an Islamic state.
Neither military repression nor the narrowly based economic boom of the 1980's has slowed Islamic political gains in Turkey. It is not too late to demilitarize the Kurdish conflict and expand social services, but time is running short.

HEADLINE: Rethink the Army National Guard

 BODY:
During the cold war, the Army National Guard stood by in states across the country as a combat reserve force for possible duty in a global battle against the Soviet Union. Now as the Pentagon searches everywhere for economies, it is considering a redefinition of the Army National Guard's role and a reduction of its forces. The Guard's powerful political allies among the nation's governors and members of Congress, who have long opposed attempts to diminish its role, are resisting this latest effort. The Clinton Administration must nonetheless press forward with cuts that make sense in terms of budget savings and military strategy.
The Pentagon's reasoning seems sound. Defense planners argue that they need only about two-thirds of the existing 386,000-member Army National Guard for use in combat and support of American military operations. Out of this group have come troops that supported the interventions in the Persian Gulf war, Haiti, Somalia and now Bosnia. But the Army says that the remaining third of the Army National Guard, or about 110,000 combat troops, is not part of its war-fighting strategy and simply is not needed, even if the nation has to fight two wars almost simultaneously. The Army proposes to save at least $1.1 billion a year by disbanding half of these troops and converting the other half to support services that the Army needs. One of the divisions to be reduced or redefined under the plan draws 15,000 troops from the New York and New Jersey Army National Guards. 
 Defenders of the Army National Guard complain that the Army has probably resented the National Guard as a drain on scarce resources since the days of the colonial citizens' militias from which the Guard sprang. They also argue that the Pentagon has underestimated the global threat in the coming years from China and Russia. If money is to be saved, these Guard supporters say, the Army should cut its own forces rather than the National Guard, which is cheaper to maintain. Governors, of course, feel more secure in being able to call on National Guard troops in their states for riots, floods and other emergencies.
But the global military threat to the United States has clearly diminished, making it sensible to reduce force levels, guardsmen included. The National Guard may or may not be a bargain, but what good is a bargain if the bargain is not really needed? The governors are understandably happy to know that their emergencies can be met by the National Guard, but surely the two-thirds of the entire National Guard force that the Army wishes to retain is adequate for such purposes.
The biggest obstacle to the scaling back of the National Guard is politics. Communities resist the lost income for their guardsmen and are reluctant to see armories fall into disuse. The Bush Administration tried and failed to get approval of a plan similar to the one now being considered at the Defense Department. But in the 1992 campaign, Bill Clinton signaled his support of the National Guard.
If there were any doubt that the Guard itself is prepared to call in its chits, a letter earlier this year from the Guard's lobbying group was instructive. In that letter, Edward J. Philbin, executive director of the National Guard Association of the United States, reminded Defense Secretary William J. Perry that the divisions slated for cutbacks are located in 25 states and that a "precipitous restructuring could very well affect the 1996 elections."
But this is a decision that the Pentagon and the Congress ought to make based on budgetary and military considerations, not pork-barrel or interest-group politics. There is room to argue over which Guard units should be cut or reconfigured. But at a time of budgetary problems, it makes no sense for the active-duty Army to shrink at a much faster rate than the Army National Guard. The Administration should boldly take the high ground for the likely battle with Congress.

The drinks are in alphabetical order, with clear instructions. "The Perfect Cocktail" by Greg Dempsey (Doubleday, $8.95) is a useful, if a less comprehensive and less handsome volume.
 
Cake of Kings
A deliciously buttery version of rosca de reyes, the traditional Mexican kings cake served on Jan. 6, Epiphany, is available from Rocking Horse Mexican Cafe, 182 Eighth Avenue (19th Street). The cake, studded with dried fruit and nuts, filled with almond paste and baked with a trinket inside, commemorates the visit of the three kings, or Magi. Three days' notice is needed for the cake, $19.95. To order: (212) 463-9511.
 
Wine of Stars
Marilyn sparkling wine, with a star-studded image of Marilyn Monroe on the label, may add a touch of Hollywood glitter to that New Year's Eve party. The wine, a 1990 blanc de blancs from the Carneros district of California, sold under license from the actress's estate, is a well-balanced sparkler, not too dry. It is $19.99 at Crossroads Wine and Liquor, 55 West 14th Street; $21.40 at Pop's Wine and Spirits, 256 Long Beach Road, Island Park, L.I., and $22.99 at Shoppers Liquor, 121 Main Street, Madison, N.J.
 
Dessert and Coffee
Desserts by more than a dozen chefs will be paired with coffee at Starbucks, 13 Astor Place, at Lafayette Street, on Jan. 22 from 7 to 10 P.M. The event, to benefit PBS, presents the chefs from "Cooking and Entertaining with America's Hottest New Chefs," a new public television series. Tickets, $25, are available at Starbucks stores.
 
New Johnnie Walker Colors
The rise in popularity of single malt Scotch has the blended whiskies fighting back. Last year Johnnie Walker, known worldwide for its classic Black Label and its less aged Red Label, reintroduced Johnnie Walker Blue Label, a smooth, pale, limited-production blend similar to one that was made 100 years ago. It is about $150 in numbered bottles. This year, the company added Johnnie Walker Gold Label, around $60, based on a private blend, honoring the company's 100th anniversary in 1920.
 
Off the Menu New Year's Eve Inflation
Few restaurateurs have raised their prices in recent years. But a number of high-profile places appear to be trying to make up for it on New Year's Eve. The Zagat Survey has compared New Year's Eve prices for 1994 and 1995 in 58 places, and found higher prices in 30 of them. For example, New Year's Eve dinner at Gramercy Tavern rose to $196, from $95; dinner at Lespinasse costs $450 this year, compared with $350 in 1994; Le Madri's price is up to $125, from $85, and dinner at March increased to $150, from $100.
 
Bobby Van's on Park Ave.
Though Hamptons restaurants rarely venture into New York City, Bobby Van's, a popular Bridgehampton spot, which is no longer owned by the piano player who founded it, will open next month at 230 Park Avenue (46th Street), formerly Snaps. It is to be a steakhouse by some of the group that owns the Hamptons' Bobby Van's.
 
Spanish-Speaking Help
Rafael Palomino, the chef and owner of the Inca Grill in SoHo, has organized the Spanish Chefs Association of America. Its goals: to encourage culinary training for young people who speak Spanish and to organize food-related charity work in Hispanic communities.
Mr. Palomino said he started this organization because so many workers in America's professional kitchens are of Hispanic descent. Mr. Palomino can be reached at (212) 744-6088.
 
Seafood in SoHo
In January, Aquagrill will be the latest incarnation of the space at 210 Spring Street, at Avenue of the Americas, that was originally Cafe and then Three Degrees North, both co-owned by Richard Picasso, a grandson of the painter. Mr. Picasso has sold the restaurant to Jeremy Marshall, a chef, who is turning it into a seafood restaurant with -- what else? -- an oyster bar.

Turnpike Bond Rating Drops

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK

 BODY:
The New Jersey Turnpike Authority suffered another blow yesterday when Standard & Poor's lowered its rating on $2.8 billion in turnpike revenue bonds two notches, from A to BBB+. S.& P. said the authority, whose members are appointed by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, was guided by "political concerns" when it decided to avoid a toll increase for the next three years. Echoing Moody's Investors Service, which downgraded the turnpike bonds last week, S.& P. criticized the authority for using one-time-only revenue like surplus construction funds to balance its budget. 
 Officials of the authority said they were sticking with their financial plan and denied that politics influenced the decision to maintain current tolls. A lower bond rating could increase the interest rate the agency pays on its bonds.
