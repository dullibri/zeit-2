HEADLINE: The Challenge of Securing the Border

BYLINE: EDUARDO PORTER


HIGHLIGHT: The immigration legislation in the Senate recognizes that trying to make the Mexican border impermeable to illegal entry is unrealistic. But opponents may yet challenge that premise. 

 BODY:
Two decades ago, the border with Mexico was not as big a priority as it is today. The Border Patrol's entire budget was only $362.6 million in 1993 - some $584 million in today's money. It had 4,028 agents. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, border patrolling wasn't amazingly effective.
Studies in the mid-1990s found that of all the immigrants trying to enter the United States illegally from Mexico, Border Patrol agents apprehended fewer than half - somewhere between 35 and 45 percent. 
Fast forward to the present and things have changed a lot. The Border Patrol has more than 21,000 agents - 18,500 along the border with Mexico. Its budget last year exceeded $3.5 billion. We have drones and sensors and hundreds of miles of fence. 
And according to a report by the National Academy of Sciences published last year, Border Patrol agents apprehend about a quarter of those trying to enter the country illegally. 
To be sure, these estimates must be taken with a grain of salt. We don't know how many people are trying to enter the United States illegally in any given year, so it is impossible to tell precisely what share gets caught. Estimates of apprehension rates are derived from statistical analyses that rely on fairly strong assumptions about immigrants' behavior: How many times do they try to get in after being caught? Are the odds of being caught the same each time? 
It is also true that net flows of illegal immigrants from Mexico have fallen to zero over the last few years, because of a combination of slow growth in the United States, expanded legal guest-worker programs and an aging population in Mexico that is slowing the growth of its labor supply. By that measure, the border is as secure as it will ever be.
But the apprehension statistics underscore the vulnerability of the current effort in Congress to pass immigration reform. In my column this week I pointed out how a similar effort six years ago was weakened by disagreements over a guest worker program, which broke apart the coalition of labor, immigrants' rights advocates and businesses supporting the legislation. Assailed by conservatives - who viewed illegal immigrants as lawbreakers and demanded that the border be secured above all else - the effort failed.
This time around, border security remains a hitch. Some conservative Republicans are still demanding that the border be secured before the first undocumented immigrant gets a green card. But the statistics suggest that an impermeable border is a fantasy, no matter how much money and technology is thrown at it. "Border security is part of a strategy by the anti-immigration constituency to stop reform after the fact," said Gordon H. Hanson, an expert on the economics of immigration at the University of California, San Diego. "You make the trigger impossible to meet." 
The immigration legislation presented in the Senate sidesteps the issue nicely. Under its proposed legislation, the Border Patrol must put together a plan to keep out 9 of 10 immigrants trying to enter illegally over the most common entry points - a seemingly impossible target. But it is less tough than it seems. The Border Patrol gets to count as success its own estimate of how many run back into Mexico - a fairly unscientific number that can rely on agents' reading of a footstep in the sand or a broken blade of grass. And those immigrants will surely try again another day.
What's more, if it doesn't hit the target within five years, all Congress can do is form a commission to come up with a better plan.
It may be optimistic, however, to assume that this leniency will survive when the legislation falls under the full glare of public scrutiny.

HEADLINE: America's Biggest Entrepreneurs: High School Dropouts

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: People who have not completed high school are most likely to start their own businesses, according to a new report. 

 BODY:
Among America's most celebrated entrepreneurs are college dropouts like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Michael Dell.
But as it turns out, the country's most frequent business founders are dropouts of a different kind: They dropped out of high school. 
That's according to the latest numbers from the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity, as prepared by Robert W. Fairlie at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Professor Fairlie looked at different demographic groups, and what share of each group started businesses in any given month (which is generally tiny, less than 1 percent for basically all major demographics). When he looked at entrepreneurship by educational attainment, he found that people who had not completed high school were most likely to start new businesses.
The chart above is based on data from the Labor Department's monthly Current Population Survey. It shows the percentage of individuals (ages 25 to 64) who do not own a business in the first survey month but then started a business in the following month, with 15 or more hours worked per week. For those who didn't complete high school, this entrepreneurship rate was 0.52 percent, compared with 0.32 percent for people in this age range over all. 
So how is it that America's least-educated are responsible for so much business creation, especially given that we might associate business acumen with more formal training?
"These high rates for the least-educated group suggest an increased number of people entering entrepreneurship out of necessity," writes Professor Fairlie.
People with more education have more and higher-payingjob opportunities available to them at existing employers. Those rare Mark Zuckerbergs of the world are founding businesses rather than finishing their formal education by choice, not because no one else will hire them. The same probably isn't true for workers without a high school diploma.
Starting a new business, by the way, does not necessarily mean taking on employees. The Labor Department survey upon which this analysis is based does not, unfortunately, currently include information on employer versus nonemployer businesses. A majority of businesses showing up in these figures seem to be nonemployer businesses (sole proprietorships), given that the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity shows 514,000 new businesses being created each month in 2012, whereas other measures that count only new employer establishments, like Business Employer Dynamics numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, "indicate roughly the same number of new businesses per year," Professor Fairlie's report says.
Some other highlights of the report, about demographics of new business owners:

        
Men are much more likely to create new businesses than women are. Other groups with high rates of entrepreneurship, as measured this way, are immigrants and Latinos.
        
The construction industry had the highest rate of entrepreneurial activity of all major industry groups.
        
Montana, Vermont and New Mexico had the highest entrepreneurship rates, whereas Minnesota, Nebraska and Michigan had the lowest.
        
Among the 15 largest metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, Miami had the highest entrepreneurial activity rate in 2012, and Detroit had the lowest.

HEADLINE: Morris J. Kramer, Pioneer in Deal Law, Dies at 71

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Kramer, a longtime partner at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &#038; Flom, helped revolutionize the mergers and acquisitions business and prodded Skadden to expand overseas. 

 BODY:
Morris J. Kramer, who as a longtime partner at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom helped revolutionize the mergers and acquisitions business, died on Friday in Manhattan. He was 71.
The cause was complications of prostate cancer, his son Oliver said.
In the 1970s, Mr. Kramer was one of four deal advisers at Skadden who worked under Joseph H. Flom, the pioneering corporate lawyer. Known within the firm as the "Young Turks" or the "Fab Four," they helped transform Skadden from a small, scrappy practice into one of the world's leading law firms. 
Mr. Kramer and his colleagues made their mark by taking on assignments that New York's white-shoe lawyers had long considered déclassé: advising corporations in hostile takeover bids and proxy battles for the control of other public companies.
In 1973, Mr. Kramer was an architect of a hostile bid by the International Nickel Company of Canada for ESB Inc., a battle that is said to have set off a tidal wave of acquisitions over the next two decades.
During the go-go 1980s, he advised Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella at First Boston as they helped reshape the established order on Wall Street. When Ted Turner sold Turner Broadcasting System to Time Warner for about $7.5 billion in 1995, Mr. Turner retained Mr. Kramer to advise him.
Mr. Kramer loved what he referred to as the "brain surgery" of a deal, mastering the arcana of a transaction that could give his client an edge in negotiations or in court when merger disputes ended up there.
"There's an old saying: 'If the facts are against you, you pound on the law; if the law is against you, you pound on the facts; and if both are against you, you pound on the table,' " said Franklin M. Gittes, a Skadden partner. "But instead of pounding on the table, we turned to Morris for advice."
Mr. Kramer played a major role in one of the defining, and messiest, deals of the era, centering on a hostile bid by Bendix to take over Martin Marietta. To fight it, Martin Marietta introduced the audacious "Pac-Man" defense: bidding for the very company that was trying to acquire it, in this case Bendix. The move paralyzed both companies.
But Mr. Kramer and his Skadden partners broke the logjam through their representation of a third company, the Allied Corporation. Allied thrust itself into the deal by acquiring Bendix outright, a move that also gave it a 40 percent stake in Martin Marietta.
Mr. Kramer also pushed Skadden to grow internationally, arguing that the firm had to keep up with its clients as they expanded around the globe. He helped open the firm's London office in the late 1980s. And in perhaps his most significant merger assignment, he spent months in Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall advising the unified government on privatizing the East German economy.
Morris Joseph Kramer was born on Nov. 18, 1941, in Brooklyn. He grew up in the Bay Ridge section and attended Fort Hamilton High School. He earned his undergraduate degree from Dartmouth College in 1963 and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1966.
He practiced at Cahill Gordon & Reindel for several years before joining Skadden in 1972. Mr. Kramer trained under Mr. Flom, who, like Mr. Kramer, came from humble beginnings in Brooklyn. As described in Lincoln Caplan's 1994 book "Skadden: Power, Money, and the Rise of a Legal Empire," Mr. Kramer was quiet and cerebral but projected "a shimmer of eccentricity" with a flamboyant wardrobe in keeping with '70s.
"He arrived dressing in conservative business suits and soon adopted the mod style (bright-colored shirts, jackets with wide lapels, bell-bottom pants, and long hair)," Mr. Caplan wrote. Mr. Kramer continued to wear his hair in a ponytail well into the 1980s.
Besides his son Oliver, he is survived by another son, Jeremy; a brother, Stephen, and three grandchildren. Mr. Kramer, who had homes in Manhattan and Aspen, Colo., was divorced three times.
Neither of Mr. Kramer's sons followed him into the law; instead, both became film producers. Oliver Kramer is developing a television series about the merger mania of the 1970s and '80s, focusing on an upstart law firm that closely resembles Skadden during its ascent.

HEADLINE: Free to Spend, Developing Economies Recover Quicker

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
THIS has not been a good recovery for the wealthy countries. Growth has lagged, in part, because government spending has been far more restrained than in past recoveries from major recessions. 
But developing economies have been free to increase government spending, and their economies are generally growing more rapidly than they did after past recessions.
The accompanying charts, based on data released this week by the International Monetary Fund in the semiannual World Economic Outlook, show the stark differences in performance.
At the top are charts comparing changes in real gross domestic product per capita in developing countries and advanced economies since 2008, including the fund's forecasts for 2013 and 2014. In every year, the developed countries have lower growth. The monetary fund forecasts that this year the increase in the United States will be a paltry 1 percent, which at least is better than the forecast for the euro zone and Britain, where declines are expected.
A major reason for the slow recoveries is the absence of fiscal stimulus in much of the developed world. The middle charts show trends in government spending in advanced economies and in developing ones, comparing the trend during the current recovery to an average of the recoveries after three previous world downturns -- in 1975, 1982 and 1991. In each case, the figures treat the year before the downturn as zero, and show how earlier and later years differed from that year.
In emerging markets, spending this time has been much stronger than in previous recoveries. But the opposite is true for developed countries, both as a group and for each of the four major regions -- the United States, the euro zone, Britain and Japan -- that are shown in separate charts.
Those changes reflect the determination to follow a path of austerity in much of the developed world. Many developing countries, having built up foreign exchange reserves in the years before the recession, do not need to follow that course.
The Great Recession brought a drop in world trade volumes that exceeded any decline since the Depression. But as the charts show, the percentage declines were a little less in developing countries than they were in developed countries. And since then, the recoveries have been far more impressive in the less developed countries.
In the euro zone, the total level of imports has still not recovered to 2007 levels, although the International Monetary Fund says it thinks that will happen in 2014. The same is true of exports from Japan, a country whose export prowess once seemed unmatched but lately has been running trade deficits.
Among the four developed regions shown, only the United States has experienced an export revival that is comparable to that of the average emerging market.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Rich Countries Lag: The recovery from the Great Recession has been strongest in emerging economies, which have generally done better than they did during previous recoveries, while advanced economies have not done as well. Advanced economies have also lagged in trade growth. (Source: International Monetary Fund) (B3)

HEADLINE: China's North Korea Envoy Will Visit U.S. for Talks

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ and BREE FENG; Thom Shanker contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China's special envoy on North Korea, Wu Dawei, will visit Washington early next week to conduct talks with American officials, the Foreign Ministry said Friday.
The visit was announced after Secretary of State John Kerry said in Beijing last week that China had a vital role to play in helping rid North Korea of its nuclear weapons.
The trip is part of a flurry of diplomacy centered on North Korea as Washington and South Korea focus increasingly on trying to set up talks with the North to cool down fevered tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula. That new focus began to emerge over the past several days, and it coincides with a noticeable drop in pointed threats from North Korea, raising tentative hopes for a way out of one of the worst crises over North Korea in years. 
Yonhap, a South Korean news agency, reported Friday that the South's foreign minister, Yun Byung-se, would meet with the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, in Beijing next week to discuss North Korea.
Security meetings are also planned. In Washington, military officers said Friday that Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had added a stop in South Korea to an official travel itinerary that includes talks in China with his military counterparts. A range of regional security issues are on the agenda in both countries and are expected to include North Korea.
The visit to Washington by Mr. Wu, one of China's senior diplomats, will be his first to the United States since 2010. He will meet with Glyn T. Davies, the State Department's special envoy on North Korea, and other American officials.
A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at the regular news briefing on Friday that Mr. Wu would be in Washington at the invitation of Mr. Davies and would participate in ''an in-depth exchange of views'' on the ''denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.''
Mr. Wu was chairman of the so-called six-party talks on the North's nuclear program that involved both Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States. The talks were suspended in 2008 after North Korea withdrew from them.
During his visit to Beijing last week, Mr. Kerry said the United States would be interested in talks on North Korea, but he set a precondition: North Korea must promise to give up its nuclear weapons. The North's government, led by Kim Jong-un, has rejected that condition.
Since Mr. Kerry's visit to Beijing, North Korea has insisted that if the United States wants dialogue, it must end economic sanctions against North Korea and stop current and future joint military exercises with South Korea.
Mr. Kerry said at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Thursday that the United States was not willing to reward North Korea for merely returning to the negotiating table. But he suggested that the North's statement might be a positive sign and expressed interest in pursuing whether it might be possible to start negotiations.
''That's the first word of negotiation or thought of that we've heard from them since all of this has begun,'' Mr. Kerry told the panel. ''So I'm prepared to look at that as, you know, at least a beginning gambit -- not acceptable, obviously, and we have to go further.''
The Obama administration has expressed gratitude to China for its support of stiffer economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations after North Korea detonated its third nuclear bomb in February.
But the administration has been frustrated by the seeming unwillingness or inability of China, North Korea's main ally and economic patron, to clamp down on the North's nuclear weapons program, which has expanded since the end of the six-party talks.
China seems reluctant to change its fundamental policy of preventing the collapse of North Korea, an outcome that could result in the unification of the Korean Peninsula, potentially putting a close American military ally on China's doorstep.
Apparently in an effort to encourage China to take bolder action against North Korea, Mr. Kerry spoke warmly of his talks in Beijing, his first as secretary of state.
He told the Senate panel that China was worried about North Korea's provocative actions. ''The last thing they would want, I'm convinced, is a war on their doorstep of a completely destabilized Korean Peninsula,'' he said.
Separately, a senior editor of an influential Chinese newspaper, Study Times, who was suspended from his job after criticizing China's ties to North Korea, said in an interview on Friday that China and the United States needed to work together to solve the North Korean situation.
The editor, Deng Yuwen, now a freelance writer, said he doubted that North Korea would agree to join talks on its denuclearization.
The provocative threats from North Korea over the past few months have ''forced the U.S. and China together,'' Mr. Deng said.
''They must work on it together,'' he said. ''China cannot handle it by itself, and neither can the U.S.''

HEADLINE: G.E. Reports a 16% Rise in Quarterly Profit

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
General Electric delivered a solid gain in first-quarter earnings on Friday despite economic weakness, especially in Europe, which is holding back demand for industrial equipment.
G.E., the nation's largest industrial corporation, reported net income of $3.53 billion, or 34 cents a share, a 16 percent increase from $3.03 billion, or 29 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
On an operating basis, income was $4.13 billion, or 39 cents a share. Excluding gains from the sale of its remaining stake in the media company NBCUniversal to Comcast, G.E. posted a 13 percent increase in operating income, to $3.6 billion, or 35 cents a share. That figure matched the average estimate of securities analysts, as compiled by Thomson Reuters. 
Revenue in the first quarter was $35 billion, flat compared with figures in the period a year earlier. Over all, G.E.'s revenue came in ahead of Wall Street's forecast of $34.5 billion. But that total included proceeds from the NBCUniversal sale and slightly higher revenue this year from G.E.'s big finance division, GE Capital.
Revenue from the industrial business, whose products range from jet engines to medical imaging equipment, declined 6 percent, to $22.67 billion.
The drop in industrial sales disappointed investors. Shares of G.E. fell 4 percent, or 92 cents a share, to $21.75.
The shortfall in industrial revenue was attributed to the company's power and water unit, mainly from lower sales of generators for electrical power plants and wind turbines. As investment subsidies are phased out, wind turbine sales have fallen.
With sluggish growth in the United States and Europe in worse shape, the demand for electrical power is down, meaning fewer power generators sold, upgraded and serviced.
The power and water unit's revenue fell 26 percent from a year ago, to $4.8 billion, or $1.7 billion less than in the year-ago quarter. Without the power and water unit, G.E.'s industrial business would have grown slightly.
''This is a power and water story,'' Keith S. Sherin, G.E.'s chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts.
Still, G.E. managed to pull out a steady financial performance, helped by higher profits in its aviation and transportation units and by GE Capital.
Weak industrial demand, analysts say, will be a challenge in the first half of this year for the big companies in the sector, including Siemens, Honeywell and United Technologies. Yet because of the falloff in its big power-generation business, G.E. is being hit particularly hard.
''G.E.'s industrial business is slowing even more than expected,'' said Steven Winoker, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
In a morning conference call, Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.'s chief executive, called the quarterly performance ''mixed.'' The first half of 2013, Mr. Immelt said, was expected to be the most challenging, with demand likely to pick up in the second half.
Industrial orders were strong in some businesses, with orders for oil and gas equipment up 24 percent and aviation orders -- mainly jet engines -- up 47 percent.
The backlog of industrial orders rose to $216 billion, the highest level in the company's history. The rising industrial orders signal stronger sales in the future, Mr. Immelt said, helping to ''position us well for the second half.''
But Europe, where industrial revenue fell 17 percent, may continue to be a drag on the industrial business. ''Europe was tougher than we expected,'' Mr. Immelt said, adding later, ''We're not counting on things getting better.''
To maintain profits in spite of the weakness in industrial sales, G.E. plans to cut costs by $1 billion this year. And the company, Mr. Immelt said, remained committed to spending $18 billion during the year on dividend payments and to buy back its own shares.

HEADLINE: Britain Accuses Glaxo Of Paying Rivals for Delay Of Generic Antidepressant

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE; Katie Thomas contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
LONDON -- British antitrust authorities on Friday accused the pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline of paying three rivals to delay the introduction of a generic version of an antidepressant drug. It is the latest so-called pay-for-delay case drawing scrutiny from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic.
The Office of Fair Trading in Britain contended that Glaxo had abused its dominant position in the market, kept prices artificially high and denied ''significant cost savings'' to Britain's state-run health provider, the National Health Service. 
The British case centers on efforts by three companies, Alpharma, Generics (U.K.) and Norton Healthcare, to market an alternative to Seroxat, GlaxoSmithKline's brand of paroxetine. The company sells it in the United States under the brand name Paxil.
In recent years, regulators in Europe and the United States have paid greater attention to pay-for-delay deals, suspecting that they may allow pharmaceutical companies to make big profits by exploiting a brief but lucrative period of monopoly over the supply of a product.
''These are blockbuster drugs,'' said Farasat Bokhari, a senior lecturer in economics at the University of East Anglia, ''so if they are on the market without generics challenging them then companies can maintain high, monopoly profits.
''As soon as generic entry takes place,'' Mr. Bokhari added, ''prices drop significantly, sometimes by up to 70 to 80 percent.''
GlaxoSmithKline, according to British authorities, warned the three companies that their generic equivalents would infringe a patent. To resolve the dispute, each of the rivals concluded one or more agreements with GlaxoSmithKline, the Office of Fair Trading said.
''The O.F.T.'s provisional view is that these agreements included substantial payments from GlaxoSmithKline to the generic companies in return for their commitment to delay their plans to supply paroxetine independently,'' the regulator said. The agreements with the three companies collectively spanned the years 2001 to 2004, it said.
GlaxoSmithKline said it believed ''very strongly'' that it had ''acted within the law, as the holder of valid patents for paroxetine, in entering the agreements under investigation.''
''These arrangements resulted in other paroxetine products entering the market before GSK's patents had expired,'' the company said. ''We have cooperated fully with the Office of Fair Trading in this investigation.''
The company noted that European Union regulators had reviewed the matters covered by the agreements twice and decided to take no action.
The practice of brand-name drug companies paying generic manufacturers to delay selling their copycat versions has also come under scrutiny in the United States, where the Federal Trade Commission has argued that the practice violates antitrust law.
The matter is currently before the United States Supreme Court, which is considering whether a settlement between Solvay Pharmaceuticals, which developed the testosterone treatment AndroGel, and Actavis, which created a generic version, was illegal.
Brand-name and generic drug makers have argued that companies have a right to protect their intellectual property, and that the payments actually saved consumers money by bringing the generic versions to consumers earlier than they normally would have. But the F.T.C. has argued that the opposite is true and that the payments are delaying cheaper versions from entering the market.
The British regulator cited no estimate of the National Health Service's costs resulting from Glaxo's supposed deals. But pay-for-delay agreements cost American consumers an estimated $3.5 billion a year, according to the F.T.C. It says that in 2012, the number of ''potentially anticompetitive patent dispute settlements'' between branded and generic drug companies increased to 40, from 28 in 2011.
Before the period in the British inquiry, Seroxat was one of GlaxoSmithKline's best-selling drugs and was used to treat, among other conditions, depression and anxiety disorders, the Office of Fair Trading said. Since that time, various generic versions of paroxetine have reached the market.
''The introduction of generic medicines can lead to strong competition on price, which can drive savings for the N.H.S., to the benefit of patients and, ultimately, taxpayers,'' said Ann Pope, senior director of services, infrastructure and public markets at the Office of Fair Trading. ''It is therefore particularly important that the O.F.T. fully investigates concerns that independent generic entry may have been delayed in this case.''
The action Friday was the first step in formal proceedings: the issuance of a statement of objections. The companies involved can now make written and oral responses.
''No assumption should be made at this stage that there has been an infringement of competition law,'' Ms. Pope said. ''We will carefully consider the parties' representations to the statement of objections before deciding whether competition law has in fact been infringed.''
If found to be in breach of antitrust law, a company can in theory be fined up to 10 percent of its worldwide revenue, though penalties rarely are so great.
The European Commission, which is the European Union's antitrust regulator, said Friday that it had a number of investigations under way within the drug industry and in general was ''looking at the so-called pay-for-delay patent agreements.'' It added that it had fined AstraZeneca for delaying market entry of generic competitors to its ulcer drug Losec in 2005.

HEADLINE: Group of 20 Supports Sharing Bank Data to End International Tax Evasion

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
The Group of 20 countries called on Friday for a coordinated effort to stop international tax evasion, urging governments to systematically share bank data.
Finance ministers and central bankers of the G-20, meeting in Washington, said in a communiqué that automatic exchange of tax-relevant bank information should be adopted as the global standard.
The officials also noted the problems of economic weakness and high unemployment in many countries, and called for more action ''to make growth strong, sustainable and balanced.'' 
They acknowledged Japan's recent decision to sharply increase the supply of money to end deflation, but did not criticize the move for driving down the value of the yen, saying only that the G-20 would ''refrain from competitive devaluation and will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes.''
The automatic exchange of tax data, an approach the United States has pushed, would represent a major change from the current procedures, in which countries are expected to provide such information only on request -- as when tax officials seek to track payments across national borders during an audit.
Under an automatic exchange, governments would routinely transfer all foreign taxpayers' data to their home governments, making it far more difficult to hide assets from the tax collector.
The impetus for the new approach is an American law, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, called Fatca, requiring Americans with overseas accounts and non-American financial firms to meet tough financial disclosure requirements. In practice, Fatca conflicts with privacy laws in many countries, so Washington has been working out bilateral deals in which overseas financial institutions share that data first with their own governments for transmission to the Internal Revenue Service in Washington.
European governments, initially skeptical about the idea, have become more enthusiastic amid recent public outrage over the secret offshore finance records unearthed by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. In France, the government of President François Hollande has championed the more aggressive hunt for tax dodgers since it was rocked by the disclosure that the recently ousted budget minister, Jérôme Cahuzac, was squirreling money away in a Swiss account.
''Fatca has been a game changer,'' Pascal Saint-Amans, director of the Center for Tax Policy at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said Friday.
Mr. Saint-Amans noted that in the last week, Luxembourg, long one of Europe's most opaque financial centers, had agreed to begin automatically sharing data in the face of pressure from its European Union partners and the United States.
The challenge, Mr. Saint-Amans said, is to make sure the right information technology is in place to allow for secure account data transfer on a global scale. That is something the O.E.C.D. is now working on, he said.
The G-20 issued its statement Friday after the O.E.C.D. earlier in the day said in a progress report that Switzerland -- which is not a G-20 member -- was still struggling to get off a so-called blacklist of nations cited for a lack of cooperation on tax data.
An additional 13 jurisdictions that are not in the G-20 -- including Guatemala, Lebanon, Liberia and Panama -- have not made the necessary legal and regulatory changes to be removed from the list, according to the O.E.C.D. report.
Other excluded nations include Botswana, Brunei, Dominica, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Trinidad and Tobago, United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu.
The O.E.C.D.'s Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes is now moving toward the adoption of a rating system, under which it would grade nations' compliance with transparency agreements, and it expects to begin in November.
The United States' push for access to overseas account data began after UBS, the biggest Swiss bank, was found several years ago to have been encouraging Americans to hide assets abroad. UBS in 2009 paid $780 million and turned over details about thousands of client accounts to defer United States prosecution.
While Switzerland has met most of the requirements for being removed from the O.E.C.D. blacklist, its status, the report noted, ''is still subject to conditions.'' Recent media reports have said a deal to open American clients' Swiss banking data to the I.R.S. may be near.
Mario Tuor, a spokesman in Bern for the Swiss Federal Finance Ministry, said on Friday that the Swiss government was working to meet the O.E.C.D.'s conditions, and he said that it was unfair to lump Switzerland with truly uncooperative nations. Mr. Tuor said he could not comment about the negotiations with Washington.
Since 2009, the Swiss have taken a number of steps to accommodate American demands, including agreeing to more information sharing, but banks have shown dogged determination to maintain their privacy law, which makes it a crime to divulge some client information.
The United States continues to apply pressure. Last year, American prosecutors won indictments of Wegelin & Company, Switzerland's oldest bank, effectively putting it out of business.
In the latest American salvo, two Swiss men -- Stefan Buck, a member of the executive board of the Zurich lender Bank Frey, and Edgar Paltzer, a partner at a Swiss law firm -- were indicted this week in New York on conspiracy charges.

HEADLINE: Senators Debate Whether Boston Attack Should Figure in Immigration Talks

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER and MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Julia Preston contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A senior Republican senator said Friday that the approaching political debate about an immigration overhaul should take into account the revelation that the suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing had apparently emigrated to the United States from Kyrgyzstan.
Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the most senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, opened a hearing on immigration legislation by stressing the issue's importance ''particularly in light of all that's happening in Massachusetts right now and over the last week.'' 
''Given the events of this week, it's important for us to understand the gaps and loopholes in our immigration system,'' Mr. Grassley said in his opening statement. ''While we don't yet know the immigration status of people who have terrorized the communities in Massachusetts, when we find out, it will help shed light on the weaknesses of our system.''
Friday's hearing was expected to offer an early glimpse into how the Senate would react to immigration legislation that a bipartisan group of senators introduced this week. Instead, it was overshadowed by developments in the Boston bombing case, which also affected the meeting directly when the homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, who was scheduled to testify before the committee on border security and enforcement, had to cancel her appearance to oversee her department's involvement in the investigation.
According to Homeland Security officials, one suspect -- Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, 19, who was captured Friday night -- arrived in the United States in 2002, and remained as part of an asylum claim by his father. His brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, who was killed Friday, arrived in that period but applied for asylum around 2005.''How can individuals evade authorities and plan such attacks on our soil?'' Mr. Grassley asked. ''How can we beef up security checks on people who wish to enter the U.S.?''
Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a member of the bipartisan group behind the legislation, urged caution about linking the bombings to flaws in the country's immigration system.
''Before I get to the bill, I'd like to ask that all of us not jump to conclusions regarding the events in Boston, or try to conflate those events with this legislation,'' Mr. Schumer said. ''In general, we are a safer country when law enforcement knows who was here, has their fingerprints, photos, etc., has conducted background checks and no longer needs to look at needles through haystacks.''
Referring to the legal immigration program that the brothers most likely used, Mr. Schumer added: ''Both the refugee program and the asylum program have been significantly strengthened in the past five years, such that we are much more careful about screening people and determining who should and should not be coming into the country.''
The hearing formally kicked off consideration of a plan that would increase border security and would quickly legalize many of the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States, eventually offering them a path to full citizenship. Opponents of the plan and conservative pundits have already cited the Boston bombings as a reason to move slowly.
But Mr. Grassley received a rebuke from both sides of the aisle. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona, both Republicans and members of the bipartisan group, released a statement Friday afternoon urging their colleagues and the public not to link the Boston bombings with an overhaul of the nation's immigration laws.
''Some have already suggested that the circumstances of this terrible tragedy are justification for delaying or stopping entirely the effort for comprehensive immigration reform,'' the joint statement read. ''In fact, the opposite is true: immigration reform will strengthen our nation's security by helping us identify exactly who has entered our country and who has left -- a basic function of government that our broken immigration system is incapable of accomplishing today.''
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, similarly said he did not think the Boston bombings should affect the legislation.
''If we change the policies of this country every time something happens, whether it's Oklahoma City, 9/11, this, then we're never going to do anything,'' he said after the hearing.
The connection between the Boston attacks and the immigration debate is still tenuous. If early reports that the suspects came into the country legally prove correct, that could undermine attempts by opponents to link the bombings to political concerns about the immigration overhaul.
Still, backers of the 844-page legislation -- who include President Obama -- were already facing a delicate task in trying to pass it in the next six weeks. To succeed, they need to navigate issues of economic fairness, border security, deportation and charges that the bill would inspire a new wave of illegal immigration.
The Boston bombing not only injects a new issue into that debate but also potentially robs the president and lawmakers of some of the momentum to overhaul the nation's immigration laws.
Proponents of the legislation quickly rejected Mr. Grassley's assertions, saying that no connections should be made between the Boston attacks and the immigration overhaul until more information was known.
''There are legitimate policy questions to ask and answer about what role our immigration system played, if any, in what happened,'' said Alex Conant, a spokesman for Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, a chief sponsor of the immigration bill. ''Regardless of the circumstances in Boston, immigration reform that strengthens our borders and gives us a better accounting of who is in our country and why will improve our national security.''
Frank Sharry, the executive director of America's Voice, a group backing an immigration overhaul, criticized Mr. Grassley for bringing the Boston attacks into the debate.
''I think it's shameless.'' Mr. Sharry said. ''Boston is in lockdown, the situation on the ground is fluid, and the ranking minority leader of the Senate Judiciary Committee is exploiting it to try to derail a piece of legislation.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street Rebounds, Lifted by Technology Earnings

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Strong earnings from two technology giants helped the stock market recover some of its losses on Friday, a positive end to Wall Street's worst week in five months.
Microsoft and Google both beat earnings expectations this week, yields of government bonds ticked up, and copper, a crucial industrial metal, continued its fall, losing 2 percent.
Microsoft shares gained 3.39 percent, to $29.76, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average higher. It reported earnings late Thursday that beat analysts' forecasts and showed solid results from its Office, software tools and Xbox divisions. Google's stock climbed 4.43 percent, to $799.87. It raised its prices for ads distributed to smartphones and tablet computers. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 13.64 points, to 1,555.25, up 0.88 percent. The Dow gained 0.07 percent, or 10.37 points, to 14,547.51.
The Dow spent most of the day down, pulled lower by disappointing results from I.B.M., whose shares slipped 8.28 percent, to an even $190. The company's earnings fell short of forecasts for the first time since 2005.
The Nasdaq composite index gained 39.70 points, to 3,206.06, up 1.25 percent.
Traders, like everyone else, were following the news out of Boston, where police were hunting for one of two brothers suspected to be behind the Boston Marathon bombings on Monday. But the news had no impact on markets, traders said.
The slight gains on Friday could not overcome a tough week for the market, when both the S.& P. 500 and the Dow lost 2.1 percent. That is their biggest weekly drop since last November.
''Compared to the rest of the week, it looks like we're going to slide into the weekend on a quiet note,'' said Jim Baird, partner and chief investment officer for Plante Moran Financial Advisors.
By many measures, the markets have endured a rough five days. News that economic growth had slowed in China set off a slide in commodity prices on Monday, leading the stock market to its worst day of the year. Gold dropped below $1,400 an ounce for the first time in two years.
The stock market bounced back the next day, then fell again on Wednesday, its third-worst day this year.
Most big corporations have beaten analysts' low expectations for first-quarter profits. Of the 104 companies that turned in results through Friday morning, 70 have topped forecasts, according to S&P Capital IQ.
Analysts estimate that earnings for companies in the S.& P. 500 rose just 2 percent over the previous year, a slowdown from the 7.7 percent rise in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Next week will be another big week for earnings as 10 members of the Dow and 181 companies in the S.& P. 500 report results.
Interest rates gained. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to 1.71 percent, up from 1.69 percent late Thursday, while its price fell 6/32 to 102 21/32.
Traders cautiously returned to buying certain major commodities on Friday, including gold and oil, after big sell-offs early this week. But copper continued its fall, losing 2 percent to $3.16 a pound.
Rex Macey, the chief investment officer at the Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors, said markets were bound to encounter turbulence as long as the economy advanced at a slow pace.
Forecasts say the United States economy will expand 2 percent this year.
Joseph Tanious, a global market strategist at J. P. Morgan Funds, said: ''We're going to have a stronger 2013 than 2012.''
He added, ''But the recovery is going to be much more bumpy than people thought.''

HEADLINE: Budget Negotiating Chip Has Big Downside for Old and Poor

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
President Obama has put Social Security on the table in an attempt to reach a bipartisan agreement on the federal budget deficit, a move that would hit the program's beneficiaries when they are at their most vulnerable.
The president has proposed slowing the rate at which benefits increase over time, a change that would ultimately hit the oldest of the old, often single women, many of whom have probably exhausted any other savings. Many members of this group also face higher health costs, have little hope of working again and often live without the support of a life partner.
But advocates for retirees say that what is perhaps the most frustrating about all of this is that Social Security, which is self-financed through payroll taxes, does not contribute to the deficit. Yet it is being lassoed into the broader debate. 
''With people facing an increasingly insecure retirement, this is no time to say, 'Let's cut Social Security,' '' said Joan Entmacher, vice president for family economic security at the National Women's Law Center. ''It's even more disturbing to be having a discussion about how much to cut benefits for people who already struggle to make ends meet -- while some lawmakers insist that we can't ask the wealthiest Americans and large corporations to pay a penny more in taxes.''
The Obama administration proposes to water down one of Social Security's strongest features: the inflation adjustment, which enables retirees to maintain their purchasing power over long periods. Starting in 2015, the program would switch to a measure of inflation that has risen more slowly than the current index -- on the order of about 0.3 percentage point less each year.
That does not sound like much. Nor would it lead to a big benefit cut right away. Moreover, President Obama did include a measure to soften the impact of the change, which we will dissect below. But the rate of slower growth would still compound over time and would ultimately cost many older people thousands of dollars over the course of their retirement.
''When you look at the retirement system, people don't have anything else,'' said Alicia H. Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. ''And to have the only statement about Social Security solvency being a suggestion that what we need to do is reduce the indexing is not a useful conversation.''
It has been widely reported that if no changes are made to Social Security, its reserves will be exhausted in 2033, according to the latest annual report from the Social Security Administration's trustees. After that, the payroll taxes collected would be enough to pay about 75 percent of benefits through 2086.
The switch to a different measure of inflation -- known as the ''chained C.P.I.-U'' -- would resolve about 20 percent of the program's current shortfall, according to Social Security's actuaries. (C.P.I.-U stands for the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.)
But here is how it would initially hit retirees' pocketbooks: Workers who retired at age 65 would receive 3.7 percent less in benefits after 10 years than they would under the current system; after 20 years, 6.5 percent less; and after three decades, 9.2 percent less, according to calculations by the Social Security Administration.
The administration has said it will only make a deal that includes some protections, and it incorporated two small benefit ''bump-ups'' -- each equivalent to 5 percent of the average retiree's benefit check, or about $800 annually in today's dollars -- as part of its proposal. The bumps would be phased in over 10 years, beginning at ages 76 and 95.
So take a woman with an initial benefit of $1,100 a month, or $13,200 a year, which is the median benefit of single women 65 and older, according to the National Women's Law Center. (This benefit represents about 73 percent of this group's total income, which is about $18,000.)
By the time she is 75, her benefits would be $41 less a month, or nearly $500 a year less, than under the current program.
''That doesn't sound like so much,'' Ms. Entmacher said. ''Well, it's equal to five days' worth of food. So if you have your monthly Social Security check and you are trying to figure out how to get to the doctor, how to pay your rent and how you pay your out-of-pocket medical expenses, every dollar counts. So are you going to skip a meal for 15 days, each month, to save five days' worth of food? Or are you going to cut your pills in half?''
At 76, the woman in the example would receive her first bump-up, starting at about $6.70 a month. But it would take a decade to claim the full bump of $67 a month or about $800 a year (she would receive 10 percent of the full bump a year), according to the center.
By the time she was 85, even with the bump-up, she would have a cumulative loss in benefits of almost $6,000 in today's dollars. And by 94, the cumulative loss would be more than $8,300, according to the center's calculations. But if she lived until 95, she would get the privilege of the second increase, also equivalent to 5 percent of the average benefit check. Her monthly check would climb back to the levels under the current law if she lived until 104, but by then, she would have lost about $10,200 in total income.
Of course, since the bump-up is a flat amount, some people with lower benefits might receive a bigger increase than they would under the current system, a senior administration official from the White House explained. Conversely, the bump-up offsets a smaller portion of the cut when benefits are higher.
This is not a popular move. According to a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll, 51 percent of respondents opposed changing the way Social Security benefits are calculated so that benefits increase at a slower rate, while 37 percent supported such a change (11 percent had no opinion). The survey said there were no partisan differences, but among people 65 and older opposition was 64 percent.
The ''three-legged stool'' of retirement -- that is, pensions, savings and Social Security -- has already become more of a lopsided two-legged stool, because pensions have been waning for years. And the Social Security leg is providing most of the support for many retirees: about 43 percent of single people and 22 percent of married couples rely on the benefits for more than 90 percent of their income, the Social Security Administration says. More than half of couples and 73 percent of singles draw more than half their income from the program.
The new measure of inflation would alter the way their benefits increase. Right now, Social Security is pegged to the C.P.I.-W, which tracks the typical purchases of a sample of urban wage and clerical workers, but does not include retirees. (Social Security uses this index because it was the only one that existed when the benefits were first adjusted for inflation.) The chained C.P.I.-U includes some retirees.
The chained C.P.I. would more broadly account for how people change their buying habits when prices rise, substituting cheaper items for more expensive ones. When the price of Porterhouse steak increases, the current index considers that a consumer can switch to a cheaper cut, as explained in an AARP paper. But the chained index would account for substitution between category types. So instead of buying cheaper beef, the consumer might switch to chicken.
But critics argue that the elderly and disabled do not have the ability to substitute as much as other consumers. ''When so much of their budget goes toward health care expenses,'' said Cristina Martin Firvida, director of financial security at AARP, ''you are not going to choose to replace a hip treatment with another treatment just because it is cheaper. There is a limit for substitution with older people. We already account for a great deal of it in the current calculation.''
Many opponents say that neither inflation index accounts for the higher out-of-pocket health care expenses that older people have.
The fate of the president's proposal is still unclear. But on Thursday afternoon, Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island, submitted a ''concurrent resolution,'' which, ''if passed by both chambers, would officially express the sense of the House and Senate that we should not use the chained C.P.I. to calculate Social Security'' cost of living adjustments, a spokesman said. The measure had 81 co-sponsors when it was introduced, he added.
Social Security advocates say there are a variety of other ways to strengthen the program that would not be as burdensome to retirees. Currently, employees and employers each pay 6.2 percent on the first $113,700 of earnings (self-employed people must pay the entire 12.4 percent). Eliminating the cap on which earnings are taxed would eliminate about 88 percent of the current shortfall, according to the Social Security Administration.
''What we want Congress to do is follow the will of the people,'' said Nancy Altman, co-director of Social Security Works, an advocacy group. ''They don't want to see benefits cut. As a wealthy country, we can afford this.''
And at the very least, we can afford to have a separate debate on how best to bolster the program.

HEADLINE: Part-Time Workers in Full-Time Wait for Better Job

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
The American economy has generated 30 straight months of job growth. But for millions of people looking for more work and greater income, that improvement provides little solace.
In March, 7.6 million Americans who want more hours were stuck in part-time jobs, about the same as a year earlier and three million more than there were when the recession began at the end of 2007.
These almost invisible underemployed workers do not count toward the standard jobless rate of 7.6 percent. A broader measure, which includes the involuntary part-timers as well as people who want to work but have stopped looking, stands at 13.8 percent.
''There's nothing inherently wrong with people taking part-time jobs if they want them,'' said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. ''The problem is that people are accepting part-time pay because they have no other choice.'' 
Even for those who have been able to take advantage of the better job market, the opportunities have not been good. Since the economy began to recover almost four years ago, hiring has been concentrated in relatively low-wage service sectors, like retailing, home health care, and food preparation, and in contingent jobs at temporary-hiring companies. For example, nearly one out of every 13 jobs is at a restaurant, bar or other food-service establishment, a record high.
Household incomes have been stagnant throughout the recovery, and actually fell in the latest report, according to Sentier Research. As a result, economists and policy makers have been expressing concerns about not only the pace of hiring but the quality of new jobs as well.
''It's important to look at the types of jobs that are being created,'' Sarah Bloom Raskin, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, said in a recent speech. ''Those jobs will directly affect the fortunes and challenges of households and neighborhoods as well as the course of the recovery.''
While increases in part-time and temporary work can sometimes be an early sign that employers will soon take on more permanent hiring, many workers have been trapped in such jobs far longer than they had anticipated.
Part-time work rose rapidly in the recession and early parts of the recovery, and it has not let up much. Today, 19.1 percent of workers say they usually work part time, defined as fewer than 35 hours a week, versus 16.9 percent when the recession started.
Essentially all of the gains in part-time employment have been among people who are reluctantly working fewer hours because of slack business conditions for their employer or an inability to find a full-time job.
''It was a relief just to find something,'' said Amie Crawford, 56, of Chicago. After four months looking for a new job as an interior designer, which she had been for 30 years before the recession, she accepted a position as a part-time cashier at a quick-service health-food cafe called Protein Bar.
She keeps asking for more hours, but her manager's response is always the same.
''He tells me, 'I try to give you as many hours as I can, but everybody wants as many hours as they can,' '' Ms. Crawford said.
The owner of the company, Matt Matros, said that it was working on giving her more hours, but that each location had a limited need for cashiers. He added that Ms. Crawford had the opportunity to get trained in other skills if she wanted to advance or take on other positions.
Holding a part-time job when a full-time one is desired is frustrating for workers, and not only because fewer hours means less income. Like temp workers, part-timers are also less likely to get benefits and are more likely to be stuck with unpredictable schedules that make it hard to plan for child care, transportation or even a second part-time job.
''I'll be on the schedule from this time to this time, so I expect to work from this time to this time,'' Ms. Crawford said. ''But because on a particular day, who knows, it's snowing, raining, or people just didn't come in today for whatever reason, they start cutting people. So I get sent home in the middle of my shift.''
Part-timers also generally earn less per hour than their full-time counterparts.
''The only remaining legal form of discrimination in the labor market is against part-time workers,'' said John Schmitt, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal research organization. ''You can hire part-time workers and full-time workers doing the same job, and you're allowed to pay them different money and different benefits.''
There are multiple reasons for an increased reliance on part-timers, primarily continuing low demand and uncertainty about the economy.
''This job recovery has been more modest than previous cycles,'' said Joseph A. LaVorgna, chief United States economist at Deutsche Bank in New York. ''That, the corporate uncertainty and the recent financial crisis have caused a lot of companies to worry about access to financing. They want to hold extraordinary amounts of cash in this environment, and they're reluctant to make a more permanent commitment to hiring or hiring someone full time.''
Strong job growth in food services and retailing, which disproportionately rely on part-time work, is probably also skewing the overall composition of full- versus part-time employees. Changes in health care policy may be playing a role, too.
Paul Dales, senior United States economist for Capital Economics, said, ''There is another reason to believe that part-time employment will stay higher for longer, namely the incentives to employ part-time workers created by Obama's health care reforms.''
Starting in 2014, employers that had an average of at least 50 full-time employees in the previous calendar year will have to provide health insurance or face penalties. Some companies and franchise locations, like Darden Restaurants, which operates brands like Red Lobster and Olive Garden, suggested last year that they might seek to limit full-time staff to avoid activating this mandate.
Confusion about the law and its requirements abounds, and even some small businesses that will not be affected may be changing their behavior because of it.
''Operators can't be as casual about workers' total hours as they could before because there are fines and penalties and costs associated with it,'' said Scott DeFife, executive vice president for policy and government affairs for the National Restaurant Association. ''You can't accidentally let them become full time without a specific purpose.''
There may be other cost and efficiency pressures for employers to shift more of their workers into part-time jobs, independent of either public policy or the business cycle.
Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said it was much easier to fit workers' schedules to fill longer hours of operation and meet the ups-and-downs of customer demand if they were part time.
''Trying to efficiently schedule full-time workers in McDonald's shifts requires some real brain power, some sophisticated math or software scheduling to make that work,'' Professor Cappelli said. ''If on the other hand you can do it with part-time workers, it's a piece of cake.''

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Wanting More Work: About 7.6 million Americans working part-time jobs are doing so reluctantly, and would rather have a full-time job. People stuck in such positions are one reason a broader measure of unemployment -- which includes reluctant part-timers as well as people without a job who have looked for work in the past year, but not in the last four weeks -- is so much higher than the standard jobless rate, which stands at 7.6 percent.

HEADLINE: Toyota Expansion Reflects a Push for U.S. Lexus Sales

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
With Toyota's announcement on Friday that it would build its Lexus luxury car for the first time in the United States, the automaker underscored how foreign companies are trying to capitalize on the country's robust automobile sales.
Toyota has been eager to bolster its Lexus brand in the United States, the automaker's biggest overseas market, where luxury car sales now outpace sales of other autos. Toyota also wants to shift more production from Japan to overseas markets to better insulate itself from the currency gyrations that have wreaked havoc on its bottom line in recent years. 
For communities like Georgetown, Ky., Toyota's decision to expand auto production came as a vote of confidence in American auto manufacturing after years of painful cutbacks by domestic automakers. Despite that decline, the United States remains one of the top auto manufacturers and employers in the world, thanks to Japanese and other foreign companies that have expanded production here.
Those foreign automakers are getting plenty of incentives. On Wednesday, the Kentucky Economic Development Finance Authority approved $146.5 million in state tax benefits to help Toyota expand production in Georgetown, in a sign of how aggressively states are wooing companies that will create and maintain local manufacturing jobs.
''I feel like the state has just won the Kentucky Derby,'' Gov. Steven L. Beshear of Kentucky said as cheers erupted in a broadcast streamed live in New York from Toyota's Georgetown plant. The site, which opened in 1986, was Toyota's first wholly owned factory in the United States and is its largest manufacturing plant outside of Japan. ''We actually see Toyota as a Kentucky company,'' Governor Beshear said.
Toyota said that it would invest $360 million to install a new production line that will build about 50,000 of its flagship Lexus ES 350 sedans a year at Georgetown. The move will increase annual production at the plant, which already assembles the Camry, Avalon and Venza models and employs about 6,600 people, to about 550,000 vehicles a year. Toyota is also investing $170 million in upgrades to the plant.
''For manufacturing, Kentucky is Toyota's home. It has some of the most experienced engineers in the world,'' Akio Toyoda, president of Toyota Motor, said in New York. He said that building the Lexus here would help Toyota better meet the needs of its American customers and would reduce the effect of the exchange rate on car prices for American consumers.
Since 2008, a punishingly strong yen has weighed on Toyota's profitability, making it more expensive in dollar terms to produce in Japan and eroding the value of its overseas earnings in the home currency. Mr. Toyoda said a recent respite in the yen's strength would not affect the company's plans to protect itself from future ups and downs in currency.
Toyota's new expansion follows brisk sales in the United States of the Lexus ES, a midsize luxury car that is selling twice as fast as it did in 2012. Though the car comes in conventional gasoline and gas-electric hybrid models, only gas-powered cars will be made in Kentucky for now, Toyota said.
Toyota now builds the Lexus ES at a plant on the island of Kyushu in southern Japan. Seeking to soothe worries back home that Toyota is reducing manufacturing jobs there, the company said that it expected to announce soon that the plant would manufacture another model. The Kyushu plant will also make and export the hybrid version of the ES, Toyota said.
Toyota's chief executive for North America, James E. Lentz, said the investment came on top of plans already under way to spend $2 billion to expand and upgrade Toyota factories in Indiana, Mississippi, West Virginia and Canada in the last two years. Those expansions have also created new jobs.
Traditionally tightly controlled from its headquarters in Toyota City, Toyota has revamped its management structure in recent months to give more authority to regional managers, including a new team of executives in North America led by Mr. Lentz. Mr. Lentz said bringing Lexus production to the United States was the first decision made by his team, and he expected similar decisions to follow.

HEADLINE: A State Seeks to Be Heard in a New World Economy

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
PROVO, Utah -- In this deeply Mormon state, the school day is being translated into Chinese. Strains of Taiwanese pop songs float through the hallways. School cafeterias serve dumplings. Third graders pass notes in Mandarin. And when visitors enter a classroom, the students shout, ''Ni hao!''
''If I close my eyes, I see a room full of Chinese children,'' said Colleen Densley, the principal of Wasatch Elementary School here in central Utah, recalling the words of one amazed teacher. ''If I open my eyes I see my American students.'' 
For generations, Mormon missionaries from Utah have crisscrossed the globe and returned home speaking Tagalog and Xhosa. Now, with hopes of preparing students for a competitive world economy, the state is building one of the largest and most ambitious school-language programs in the nation.
Dual-language classes have existed for years, but they are now growing fast in many states as an outcry against bilingual education fades and educators look for ways to prepare American students for a polyglot global job market. But few have embraced the idea with such unlikely zeal as Utah, a state that passed an English-only law in 2000 and routinely ranks last in the nation on education spending, according to United States Census figures.
In foreign languages, however, Utah now sees a highway to the world economy. Republicans in Salt Lake City, the state capital, have pledged millions for the program. Four years after it began, nearly half of Utah's 41 school districts offer programs in which elementary school students spend half the day learning in English and half in a foreign language. There are 14,000 students enrolled and 20,000 signed up for next year.
In Utah, where economic growth is being driven by surging exports of gold and silver, airplane engines and computer memory, industry leaders say a bilingual work force could help lure international companies to the state and would make Utah's graduates stronger candidates for jobs in, say, Beijing, London or São Paulo.
Educators and parents say the program is about academic development, not preparing Mormon students to proselytize overseas. Yet they said Utah's immigrant communities and the overseas peregrinations of its large Mormon population make it fertile ground to teach foreign languages.
''From the very beginnings of Utah, it's been part of our culture,'' said Gov. Gary R. Herbert in an interview, ''the missionary effort of going out and living in foreign lands.''
The dual language programs start in first grade, and will eventually extend through middle school, with students taking advanced placement tests in ninth grade and then studying at a college level through the rest of high school. Right now, they can take classes in French, Spanish, Portuguese and Mandarin. German is likely to be next, and educators have discussed Arabic.
Most of the programs are designed to teach native English speakers. But in corners of the state with more Latino immigrants, the state has also set up classes where Spanish speakers are taught together, in both English and Spanish.
Studies of other immersion programs have found that students do just as well, or better, on standardized tests as students in English-only classrooms, with the added bonus that they picked up a new language while learning state capitals and multiplication tables.
''There's no way to learn another language as easily or as successfully,'' said Myriam Met, a consultant who has worked on Utah's immersion programs.
The teachers -- most of them from other countries -- teach regular subjects like mathematics and reading and social studies, only speaking exclusively in a foreign language. At first, they pantomime and use pictures and videos to get their point across, but they say the students can understand them within a few weeks.
Students in the immersion programs are graded normally, and have to take the same standardized tests as their peers. That can pose a problem in areas like science. Schools have to make sure that students who learned the Mandarin words for ''photosynthesis'' and ''chlorophyll'' can also recognize the terms on an English-language standardized tests.
So far, however, the program has amounted to a transformation. At Chinese-speaking schools, red paper lanterns dangle from the ceiling like ripe fruit, and maps of China are taped to the wall. Taiwanese and American flags hang in classrooms. Cafeterias serve pot stickers, and schools celebrate the Chinese New Year.
At Lone Peak Elementary in the town of Sandy, students grooved along one morning as their teacher played a Chinese hip-hop song. The school's principal, McKay Robinson, stood at the back of the classroom, keeping quiet, mindful not to break the rule posted on the classroom door: ''No English Please.''At Wasatch Elementary, where 360 of the school's 860 students are in Mandarin immersion classes, officials made the faculty lounge an English-only zone so all the teachers could understand one another.
Parents, wary at first, have rushed to enter lotteries to place their children in the programs. Some school districts have waiting lists 100 students long. Some parents drive 30 miles to bring their children to class, or have even moved to be closer to an immersion school.
Holli Gardner knew the classes had taken root when her first-grade son, Talan, said a prayer before dinner in Portuguese. Jody Katz's two sons, Jonah and Simon, will whisper to each other in Mandarin.
''This is something I could never teach my kid,'' said Alison Memmott, 41, whose fourth-grader, Ella, has been studying Mandarin since she was in first grade.
A few months ago, Ms. Memmott's family attended an exhibition by visiting Chinese artists in Salt Lake City, and Ella chatted up one of the artists in Mandarin. Within a few minutes, Ms. Memmott said, all of the artists were laughing and joking with the girl and invited Ella to return to Beijing with them.
''They said there are lots of boys in China she could marry,'' Ms. Memmott said. ''I said no thanks.''

HEADLINE: Measuring College Prestige vs. Cost of Enrollment

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
Having a choice is generally a good thing, and being able to choose among several college acceptances should be a wonderful thing indeed.
But let's face it: the cost of a college education these days ranges from expensive to obscenely expensive. So the decision is likely to be tougher and more emotional than most parents and children imagined as they weigh offers from colleges that have given real financial aid against others that are offering just loans.
While some students will be able to go to college only if they receive financial aid and others have the resources to go wherever they want, most fall into a middle group that has to answer this question: Do they try to pay for a college that gave them little financial aid, even if it requires borrowing money or using up their savings, because it is perceived to be better, or do they opt for a less prestigious college that offered a merit scholarship and would require little, if any borrowing? It's not an easy decision. 
''It's not just the sticker price and the net costs,'' said Sarah Turner, professor of economics and education at the University of Virginia. She added, ''How likely is it that you will get into medical school or law school or have some other opportunities'' if you choose the more prestigious college?
That's the rational argument. In these decisions, though, emotion often wins out, and it can lead to the slippery slope of excessive borrowing.
''Families really need to look realistically at what they can afford,'' said Lynn O'Shaughnessy, author of ''The College Solution'' and a blog of the same name. ''Sometimes, they'll look at a package and say, 'It's not enough, but we can sacrifice and send our children to the school they really want to go to.' They have to realize this a four- to five-year commitment.''
Ms. O'Shaughnessy said she was trying to counsel a father in New Jersey who was on the verge of making a horrendous financial decision. His daughter had received a full scholarship to attend Rutgers University but her first choice was New York University, which, even with financial aid, would cost the family $32,000 a year. The father, an engineer who was also out of work, said he was going to send her to N.Y.U.
''I can't even believe he's considering it,'' she said. ''I was floored. It's irrational.''
But, unfortunately, that father is not so unusual. While it is hard not to give our children what they want, here are some ideas on how to think about this financial dilemma without going broke -- or at least know why you will be broke.
The competition to get into top colleges is fierce in many cities and towns in America, but nowhere is it more so that at the country's elite institutions. And many parents feel compelled to reward all that hard work.
The debate between paying full tuition at an elite institution or accepting a merit scholarship from someplace less prestigious ''is a conversation we have all the time,'' said James Conroy, chairman of post-high-school counseling at New Trier Township High School in Winnetka, Ill., an affluent suburb in Chicago. ''It's a tough conversation because what it gets down to is the values of the family.''
But he said many parents did not realize that their children were going up against other children who were identical to them -- at least on paper. ''There are 100 schools that we talk about in this office day after day after day,'' he said. ''But those are the same schools that every New Trier across the country talks about.''
Prestige has always been part of the equation, but he said he had expected parents to start looking for value in colleges after the 2008 financial collapse. Instead, parents have come to see the elite universities as the only way to give their children a chance at success. They feel jobs are hard to come by and companies are only going to look to hire at the elite universities.
''Whether it's true or not, I have no evidence,'' he said. ''But that was what was out on the bongo drums in the community.''
Ms. O'Shaughnessy knows this thinking well. The New Jersey father she described has many contemporaries willing to try to pay for something they could not afford. And there's no guarantee, she said, that N.Y.U. will bring his daughter greater success.
''Frankly, I think that's why East Coast schools that aren't in the top tier but are in cities can get away with charging outrageous amounts of money and giving mediocre financial aid packages,'' Ms. O'Shaughnessy said. ''Students fall in love with these schools, and there are parents who are willing to sacrifice beyond all rational reasoning.''
But economists are not sure this trade-off is worth it. In two much-discussed studies about the value of a degree from an elite college -- one with people who graduated in the 1970s and the other with more recent graduates -- Alan B. Krueger, then an economist at Princeton University, and Stacy Berg Dale, a senior researcher at Mathematica Policy Research, found that equally smart students had about the same earnings whether or not they went to top-tier colleges. The big difference, their studies found, came from minority and low-income students who went to top-tier colleges: They did better later on.
Lawrence Katz, a professor of economics at Harvard University, said he could envision circumstances where there might be a benefit to attending the more elite institution, but he could see more instances when paying to go to a large, nonelite university was a waste of money.
''The difference between going to Swarthmore and Penn State is greater today than it was in 1976 because there are higher returns to all upper-end skills and connections,'' he said. By contrast, a larger, private, expensive nonelite university was not necessarily better than ''the flagship campus of a top-notch state university.''
For parents willing to pay more for that nonelite, private university, Professor Katz said they should not think about it as an investment but as a form of consumption. ''If your kid is dead set on it, you can splurge on it,'' he said. ''But you should view it like a wedding or a vacation. There are plenty of things that you can do that make your life better if you're upper middle class, and that's fine.''
This spending becomes problematic, of course, when parents cannot really afford to pay and, worse, Professor Turner said, when students borrow heavily without thinking about the kind of life they want after graduation.
''Am I certain I'm going to end up on Wall Street?'' she said. ''If you know that's what you want to do, borrow and go to N.Y.U. But borrowing does not make a lot of sense if you want to go to culinary school.''
In most cases, though, the decision is what Professor Turner called, ''a choice under uncertainty'': few high school seniors really know what they want to do and, by extension, what they will earn.
Parents and their children trying to make the decision now need to be honest with themselves, Ms. O'Shaughnessy said.
If they decide to pay more than they can afford for the coming school year, they need to remember that they're looking at a four-year expense and that given increasing tuition, the total cost will be more than four times the cost of freshman year. ''If you have a smart student who can get into some of these expensive schools, they'll do well in other places,'' she said.
Parents and students also need to look at the graduation rates of the colleges they're considering. While taking on a lot of debt is not good, taking on a lot of debt and not graduating from college is even worse.
And if the students received any merit scholarships, they should consider them. They are a sign that a college really wants the student.
For parents who will be in this situation in a few years, you could do worse than take a page from the playbook of James Montague, director of guidance and support services at Boston Latin School, the oldest public school in the United States and one that selects students based on exams and grades.
Mr. Montague said his students, a third of whom are on subsidized lunch programs, do not often have the options of their peers at wealthy suburban schools. Their parents are not going to be able to find or borrow $30,000 a year for four years.
To prevent disappointment -- or to force the students who want to be bakers to go to work on Wall Street to pay back their loans -- he said he encouraged students to apply to at least one state college that would give them merit aid and to stick to the federally subsidized loan limits.
''Our students are reasonable about this,'' he said, adding, ''Our students are very resilient. They're going to make it work.''
And ultimately, that will be what determines success long after a college is chosen.

HIGHLIGHT: Arrest in Boston bombing; new risky investments; drug maker under scrutiny, and moves against tax evasion. 

 BODY:
The teenage suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings, whose flight from the police after a furious gunfight overnight prompted an intense manhunt that virtually shut down the Boston area all day, was taken into custody Friday night after the police found him in nearby Watertown, Mass., officials said. The suspect, Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, 19, was found hiding in a boat just outside the area where the police had been conducting door-to-door searches all day, the Boston police commissioner, Edward Davis, said at a news conference Friday night. Katharine Q. Seelye reports from Boston and William K. Rashbaum and Michael Cooper report from New York. 
The banks that created risky amalgams of mortgages and loans during the boom - the kind that went so wrong during the bust - are busily reviving the same types of investments that many thought were gone for good. Once more, arcane-sounding financial products like collateralized debt obligations are being minted on Wall Street. The revival partly reflects the same investor optimism that has lifted the stock market to new heights. With the real estate market and the economy improving, another financial crisis seems a distant prospect. What's more, at a time when the Federal Reserve has pushed interest rates close to zero, the safest of these new investments offer interest rates almost double that paid by ultrasafe United States Treasury securities, according to RBS Securities, which was involved in such instruments in the past. Nathaniel Popper reports from New York.
The Group of 20 countries called on Friday for a coordinated effort to stop international tax evasion, urging governments to systematically share bank data. Finance ministers and central bankers of the G-20, meeting in Washington, said in a communiqué that automatic exchange of tax-relevant bank information should be adopted as the global standard. The officials also noted the problems of economic weakness and high unemployment in many countries, and called for more action "to make growth strong, sustainable and balanced." David Jolly reports.
British antitrust authorities on Friday accused the pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline of paying three rivals to delay the introduction of a generic version of an antidepressant drug. It is the latest so-called pay-for-delay case drawing scrutiny from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. The Office of Fair Trading in Britain contended that Glaxo had abused its dominant position in the market, kept prices artificially high and denied "significant cost savings" to Britain's state-run health provider, the National Health Service. Stephen Castle reports from London.
 ARTS On Tuesday, a fascinating auction, the second of its kind, put together at Bonhams by Rupert Worrall and Tanya Grigoroglou, turned the spotlight on "The Grosvenor School and Avant-Garde British Printmaking." The sale opened with an artist whose willingness to experiment in almost every register of the artistic spectrum underlines how little inclination toward modernity mainstream printmakers had when they used traditional techniques, from wood-block to etching. "Souren Melikian reports from London.
 SPORTS One of the most dominant basketball players in recent memory, Brittney Griner, came out as gay Wednesday, casually mentioning the fact in an interview as if it were an afterthought. The news media and the sports world seemed to treat it as such, too, with little mention of the star's sexuality showing up on social media or on message boards, and virtually no analysis of what the revelation meant for tolerance in society as a whole. So how could this sort of revelation be treated with such nonchalance? "Because it was a woman," said Jim Buzinski, a founder of Outsports.com, a Web site about homosexuality and sports. "Can you imagine if it was a man who did the exact same thing? Everyone's head would have exploded." Sam Borden reports.

HEADLINE: The Hand That Feeds Us

BYLINE: SARA HOPE ANDERSON


HIGHLIGHT: I was sure the loss of my job was just an unpleasant drizzle on my career parade. I was wrong. 

 BODY:
During the weekly exchange of peace handshakes several months ago at the small church around the corner from where I live in Chicago, a fellow congregant met my extended hand with a firm grip and said, "I heard that you lost your job - you must be scared." Then she followed up with a "Peace be with you" and moved on to another parishioner.
It was true. When the large bank I had worked for underwent "restructuring" a few months before, I quickly became one of nearly 12 million unemployed people in the United States. That's about the same number of people who watched the zombie drama "The Walking Dead" this season, and more than the entire population of Ohio. 
I should have insisted during that Sunday morning handshake that, despite being the mother of two young children, and newly remarried after three years of single motherhood, I was not at all scared. But I was instead rendered entirely mute. That exchange of peace was the equivalent of a sneeze carrying a contagion. It was the anti-peace.
I was initially confident that the loss of my job was just an unpleasant drizzle on my career parade. I didn't know it would be more like a hailstorm of epic proportions, that I should have built a bunker, lined it with résumé paper, and fortified myself to endure the months and months of the unemployment onslaught.
And so, just after the woman at church extended her well-meaning hand, I took communion worrying that that sliver of bread might be my last.
It was only a few months before that, in the first days of my new jobless status, which I mistakenly understood as a brief break in the professional order of my life, that I had remarried. In between ordering letterpress and buying white hydrangeas, I attended the recommended résumé Webinars and met with dozens of internal recruiters and hiring managers. I networked. Everyone was gracious and really pleased to meet me. I was bolstered by the "keep me posted on your successes" notes included in their e-mails.
I had several long-distance interviews during my honeymoon, which I'd retooled for budget reasons from a European getaway to a kitschy East Coast beach spot. I dialed into conference lines wearing a sandy bathing suit in a car parked in direct sun.
But like sand, the job searching process appeared to have no traction. Post-honeymoon, I spent months pursuing leads. I showed up early for interviews despite long commutes, replacing torn hose in drugstore bathrooms, swabbing smudged mascara in the slim mirrors on the elevator, and all with no benefit other than recommendations for more action verbs in my résumé and yet another name to connect to on LinkedIn.
My new husband has professional commitments in Boston, and is living there until our first anniversary. It's not ideal, but it is what we thought was the best plan. And I committed myself to a glass-half-full perspective. After all, my children depend on me.
I am dedicated, like most parents, to making sure that my children's lives maintain a playful, benign clip and that they are kept from the sometimes cruel exigencies of adult life. Some have already touched them. Their father died suddenly three years ago, not long after we had divorced. His life ended when it might have been renewed, and their loss was deep.
We aspire to an average life with seasonal activities, sports, crafts and family meals. We have a solid routine originally built around the workday. This latticework structure stays in place whether I am working or not.
I don't indulge my children with gadgets and kid-centric travel, but even so, the maintenance of our family requires my income. This is surprising to many because of the existence of a husband; a married woman's paycheck is more often than not considered "extra." But our situation isn't typical. Asking a new spouse for cash infusions to support a home that is not his own did not seem ideal during the first year of a new marriage that will always depend on two incomes. My husband loves me and believes in me. But he was offered little reassurance on the question of whether his savings might dwindle entirely as my search went on.
Over time, as prospects continued to slip away, it got more and more difficult to sustain a demeanor of sunny commitment. I had visions of my future, and they ranged from me smiling in a cinched Burberry trench coat at international airport arrivals to my thoughtlessly exposing a flabby belly wearing pajama bottoms while retrieving coupon mailers from the recycle bin. The reality was not much better - an unemployed, newlywed mother who stood in the shower thinking that her children's generic tear-free shampoo might allow her to finally stop crying.
Job searching involves an uncomfortable mix of constant public self-aggrandizement and the private loss of self-respect. It is tedious and strangely surreal to listen to yourself talk, in a tepid charcoal suit, about achievements and skills while you watch yourself get sucked down a drain.
My family supported my efforts, assuring me that job hunting was a numbers game. The children remained obliviously upbeat, thankfully, and continued to ask for anything and everything and roll their eyes at my refusals without any perception that I was deducting dollars in my head at a frantic rate.
And though I waited until the plastic grids beneath the heel of my boots were visible before getting them fixed, I made sure to keep my interview shoes polished and perfect. I wore them on that happy day when I stood up at the conference table to shake the hand extended toward me and was, at last, offered peace.
 Sara Hope Anderson lives in Chicago and now works for a financial technology company.

HEADLINE: Ford-G.M. Teamwork On Transmissions

BYLINE: By LINDSAY BROOKE

 BODY:
Ford Motor and General Motors announced on Monday that they would jointly develop new transmissions with 9 speeds for front-wheel-drive vehicles and 10 speeds for rear-drive cars and trucks. The new transmissions, with more forward gear ratios than either company now offers, are expected to reach the market beginning in 2016.
The transmissions are considered vital components of the companies' efforts to meet upcoming standards for fuel efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions in the United States and Europe. The transmissions will ''drive fuel economy improvements into both company's future product portfolios,'' said Jim Lanzon, G.M.'s vice president of global transmission engineering. 
The automakers' announcement had been anticipated last October but was delayed over protracted negotiations concerning intellectual property, according to sources familiar with the agreement. Reports of the pending alliance first emerged in an article in the Automobiles section in September 2012.
The joint transmission development program builds on the companies' 2002 agreement that resulted in a 6-speed automatic for front-wheel-drive vehicles.
While Henry Ford couldn't have foreseen this cooperative venture with General Motors when he said, ''Coming together is a beginning; keeping together is progress; working together is success,'' the agreement does appear to fulfill his vision regarding manufacturing efficiency.
By cooperating on design, engineering, and testing, the automakers are expected to save hundreds of millions of dollars and considerable development time, said Skip Nydam, an industry analyst with ND-Automotive and a former transmission engineer. It also saves the cost of licensing the design and production rights from a specialist transmission supplier like ZF of Germany or Aisin of Japan, which can cost up to $100 per unit, according to engineers at Ford and G.M.
''This collaboration provides sound economics and the flexibility both automakers need to meet the new fuel economy laws,'' Mr. Nydam said.
In the 2002 deal, considered a landmark in the highly competitive auto industry, Ford and G.M. invested a combined $720 million. They have since produced more than eight million transmissions -- the model is known as the Ford 6F and G.M. 6T70 and 6T75 -- for nearly 30 models, including the Ford Fusion, Edge, Escape and Explorer, and the Chevrolet Cruze, Malibu, Equinox and Traverse.
''We've already proven that Ford and G.M. transmission engineers work extremely well together,'' said Joe Bakaj, Ford's vice president of powertrain engineering.
Based on their previous 6-speed experience, the automakers will share many common parts for the new 9- and 10-speed; manufacturing the transmissions will take place in each company's own plants. Software controls developed separately by the two automakers will tailor the units to specific G.M. and Ford vehicles, giving each its own performance and operating characterisitics.
The companies did not provide specific vehicle applications or technical details.
G.M. is understood to have contributed the basic design of the new 9-speed for front-drive vehicles, while the 10-speed's design comes from Ford. Jumping to 9- and 10-speeds from the 6-, 7-, and 8-speed transmissions currently used across the industry improves the ratio spread -- the numerical relationship between lowest and highest gears.
A large overall ratio spread makes it possible to achieve both lively acceleration and quieter highway cruising without sacrificing either. The larger the number, the better: the new 9-speed, for example, is expected to have a ratio spread close to 10:1, compared with a typical 6-speed's ratio spread of about 6:1.
At the same time, the added gears make it feasible to use a smaller ratio spread between adjacent gears -- for instance, fourth and fifth gears -- to keep the engine revving at its best power level for a given road speed.
The additional gear ratios are seen as critical for use with the smaller, high-torque turbocharged engines that are increasingly common in cars and trucks. Such engines are leading a trend known as downspeeding, which calls for lowering engine r.p.m. to reduce fuel consumption.
With the new 9-speed, G.M. and Ford are following ZF, which unveiled the first production 9-speed automatic in 2011. The ZF transmission will be introduced in the 2014 Jeep Cherokee and the Range Rover Evoque. The ZF 9-speed is expected to offer up to 16 percent better highway fuel economy than 6-speed automatics, according to ZF engineers.
Like its ZF counterpart, the joint G.M.-Ford 9-speed is expected to feature clever design of its internal mechanisms aimed at making the transmission as compact as possible. This will be critical for fitting the new gearbox into small cars like the Chevrolet Sonic and the Ford Fiesta. Currently these cars can fit only 6-speed transmissions because of the limited width between their front wheels. The 10-speed, because of its longitudinal installation in pickup trucks (where it is expected to be used in high volume), will not be as space-constrained as the front-drive 9-speed.
Despite the added complexity of additional gearsets and clutches in the new 9- and 10-speed automatics, those units are considered by many engineers to be more attractive than continuously variable transmissions. The C.V.T.'s appear mechanically simpler but lack the high torque capacity of conventional automatics and cost more to produce, say transmission experts.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Long Way From Tractors

BYLINE: By JOHN LAMM

 BODY:
After becoming a wealthy industrialist in the 1950s, mainly through the success of his tractor company, Ferruccio Lamborghini was indulging his lifelong love of automobiles and buying Italy's best: Alfa Romeo, Lancia, Maserati and, of course, Ferrari.
There are two versions of what happened next. One, according to an interview published in 1991 in a British magazine, Thoroughbred and Classic Cars, is that Lamborghini was insulted by Enzo Ferrari after complaining of a weak clutch in a car he'd bought: ''Lamborghini, you may be able to drive a tractor, but you will never be able to handle a Ferrari properly.''
A great story, but there's a better chance this successful entrepreneur saw the high markup on parts that both he and Ferrari were using and decided there were lira to be made in the exotic car business. At least that's the story veterans at the Lamborghini factory often tell journalists.
Either way, the reputation of the tractor maker has come a long way since. His Miura sports cars of the 1960s have become prized classics -- breaking the million-dollar mark at auction -- and the company will be feted on its 50th anniversary at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Élégance this August near Monterey, Calif. 
By the time his car company was founded in 1963, Lamborghini had wisely dipped into the pool of talented Italians who could quickly create an exotic automobile from the ground up. Giotto Bizzarrini, late of Ferrari's title-winning racing team, was commissioned to design a 3.5-liter twin-cam V-12. He was followed by Gian Paolo Dallara, whose company builds today's IndyCar chassis, and Paolo Stanzani, who would later engineer the Bugatti EB110. Bob Wallace, a New Zealander, came on staff as test driver. Work began on a factory in Sant'Agata Bolognese, halfway between Bologna and Modena.
Lamborghini commissioned a former designer for the Bertone coachbuilding studio, Franco Scaglione, to design the first car, the 350 GTV, a shapely coupe. Making its debut at the 1963 Turin Motor Show, the GTV was without Bizzarrini's V-12, which was on display and said to have 360 horsepower. Workers could not fit the engine under the hood; according to a subsequent owner, the GTV's front compartment was loaded with bricks to get the correct ride height.
At the time, Lamborghini told Road & Track magazine about plans for touring and competition versions of the 350 GTV, which seems odd now, since the start-up automaker never showed a passion for racing his cars. That made it difficult to compete against Ferrari's reputation for performance, and while there was a somewhat successful Formula One engine program from 1989 to 1993 (and limited participation in current sports car championships), racing has not been a Lamborghini priority.
The 350 GTV never made it past the prototype stage. The body was reshaped by Touring, a Milan coach builder, to create Lamborghini's first production car, the 1964 350 GT, which had a more realistic 280 horsepower. This was followed in 1966 by the 400 GT, a 2+2 design with a 320-horsepower 3.9-liter V-12. In top condition, both GT models can today bring upward of $300,000 at auction.
But for most devoted fans, Lamborghini history really begins with the 1966 Miura.
Started as an off-hours project by Dallara, Stanzani and Wallace, the Miura -- one of several Lamborghinis named for fighting bulls -- was a major departure because its V-12 was mounted transversely at the rear. Credit for the ground-scraping exterior styling went to Marcello Gandini at Bertone; the Miura's coming-out party was the Geneva Motor Show in early 1966.
While the flowing beauty and technical credits of the Miura made it a hit with sports car aficionados, what burned the Lamborghini name into the brains of the public was its successor, the 1974 Countach, another Gandini design.
Commenting on the visual changes to racecars that happened in the late '60s, Mr. Gandini said that while the racecars had become more functional, they were ''no longer beautiful for the sake of beauty.'' He continued: ''They needed lovely lines less, aerodynamics more.''
Mr. Gandini's goal in designing the Countach was straightforward: he wanted people ''to be astonished when they saw the car.'' He certainly succeeded.
An angular wedge with upward-opening scissor doors, showing little restraint in the scoops, ducts and wings that were added over the years, the midengine Countach was powered by a big V-12. The engine layout was unusual, with the rear, or output end, pointing forward and the transmission sticking into the cockpit. There was nothing subtle about the Countach, and it was not an easy automobile to drive.
Though Lamborghini is perhaps best known for its most exotic creations, there were also less outrageous models starting in the late '60s. Among them are the front-engine Islero, Espada and Jarama; the midengine Urraco, which conformed to the founder's original goal of creating supercars he considered more civilized, came along soon after. Design studies included the Marzal and the Bravo, both created by Carrozzeria Bertone, which was to Lamborghini what Pininfarina was to Ferrari.
Ferruccio Lamborghini, who died in 1993, may have entered the car business with all the passion of Enzo Ferrari, but he could not match Ferrari's staying power. His tractor business in trouble, Lamborghini sold 51 percent of the automaker to a friend in 1972.
Worse yet, new safety and exhaust emission laws, along with a global oil crisis, hit the makers of exotic cars hard. The rows of big-throat Weber carburetors so crucial to Italian V-12 engines -- visually as well as for their performance -- were incompatible with pollution controls and good fuel economy. Even Ferrari struggled.
Lamborghini went into receivership in 1977 and a pair of Swiss brothers, Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran, became the administrators. They worked hard to resuscitate the automaker but eventually had to find a savior -- which turned out to be Chrysler. The deal was done in early 1987 at a price said to be $25 million.
Recessionary times from 1989 to 1991 made life in the exotic car business difficult, and in 1994 Chrysler sold Lamborghini. Enter Megatech, an Indonesian company with Hutomo Suharto, known as Tommy, a son of the president of Indonesia, as part owner. That arrangement continued until 1998, when the rupiah crisis put Indonesia in financial trouble and President Suharto out of office. In 1998, Audi stepped in and paid a reported $110 million for Lamborghini, finally bringing stability to the automaker.
During all this financial uncertainty, new Lamborghinis were being developed. The midengine V-8 Silhouette of 1976 evolved into the Jalpa, but the model perhaps most remembered from that time was the brawny LM002 off-roader of 1986.
When Chrysler took over, it inherited Project 132, the successor to the decade-old Countach. Unimpressed with Mr. Gandini's design for what would become the Diablo, Chrysler had the exterior and interior finished in Detroit. Introduced in 1990, the Diablo was Lamborghini's basic product through the 1990s.
Audi's ownership brought Lamborghini the strength it had needed since the late 1960s. The Diablo was replaced by the Murciélago -- also with a V-12 -- and then supplemented with a V-10 model, the Gallardo. In contrast to the rounded shapes of Ferraris, modern Lamborghinis are notable for harder lines and squared-off shapes. Their general demeanor, ride and handling reflect the same values, Lambos being a bit stiffer and more hard-edge than Ferraris -- neither better nor worse, just different.
Lamborghini has carried this theme through the limited-production Reventón to the Murciélago's replacement, the Aventador, and another low-volume machine, the Sesto Elemento. It is considering a four-door model, the Estoque, and last month in Geneva unveiled the Veneno, a flamboyantly styled $4 million supercar.
To collectors, part of the brand's appeal is its accessibility. Aside from the early GTs, the Miura and a few special editions of the Countach, few models creep above $100,000 in valuation guides, with a number of attractive cars going for half that. Experts point out, though, that a Lamborghini can cost as much to maintain as a Ferrari, which typically holds greater investment potential.
Since Audi took over, Lamborghini has gone through a transformation beyond the improved quality of its vehicles. Where some collectors once looked down on the brand, it's not unusual now to find both Lamborghinis and Ferraris in some of the better collections. It's easy to imagine that Ferruccio Lamborghini would take pleasure in knowing the car he created shares such esteemed garage space.

HEADLINE: The Hand That Feeds Us

BYLINE: By SARA HOPE ANDERSON

 BODY:
During the weekly exchange of peace handshakes several months ago at the small church around the corner from where I live in Chicago, a fellow congregant met my extended hand with a firm grip and said, ''I heard that you lost your job -- you must be scared.'' Then she followed up with a ''Peace be with you'' and moved on to another parishioner.
It was true. When the large bank I had worked for underwent ''restructuring'' a few months before, I quickly became one of nearly 12 million unemployed people in the United States. That's about the same number of people who watched the zombie drama ''The Walking Dead'' this season, and more than the entire population of Ohio. 
I should have insisted during that Sunday morning handshake that, despite being the mother of two young children, and newly remarried after three years of single motherhood, I was not at all scared. But I was instead rendered entirely mute. That exchange of peace was the equivalent of a sneeze carrying a contagion. It was the anti-peace.
I was initially confident that the loss of my job was just an unpleasant drizzle on my career parade. I didn't know it would be more like a hailstorm of epic proportions, that I should have built a bunker, lined it with résumé paper, and fortified myself to endure the months and months of the unemployment onslaught.
And so, just after the woman at church extended her well-meaning hand, I took communion worrying that that sliver of bread might be my last.
It was only a few months before that, in the first days of my new jobless status, which I mistakenly understood as a brief break in the professional order of my life, that I had remarried. In between ordering letterpress and buying white hydrangeas, I attended the recommended résumé Webinars and met with dozens of internal recruiters and hiring managers. I networked. Everyone was gracious and really pleased to meet me. I was bolstered by the ''keep me posted on your successes'' notes included in their e-mails.
I had several long-distance interviews during my honeymoon, which I'd retooled for budget reasons from a European getaway to a kitschy East Coast beach spot. I dialed into conference lines wearing a sandy bathing suit in a car parked in direct sun.
But like sand, the job searching process appeared to have no traction. Post-honeymoon, I spent months pursuing leads. I showed up early for interviews despite long commutes, replacing torn hose in drugstore bathrooms, swabbing smudged mascara in the slim mirrors on the elevator, and all with no benefit other than recommendations for more action verbs in my résumé and yet another name to connect to on LinkedIn.
My new husband has professional commitments in Boston, and is living there until our first anniversary. It's not ideal, but it is what we thought was the best plan. And I committed myself to a glass-half-full perspective. After all, my children depend on me.
I am dedicated, like most parents, to making sure that my children's lives maintain a playful, benign clip and that they are kept from the sometimes cruel exigencies of adult life. Some have already touched them. Their father died suddenly three years ago, not long after we had divorced. His life ended when it might have been renewed, and their loss was deep.
We aspire to an average life with seasonal activities, sports, crafts and family meals. We have a solid routine originally built around the workday. This latticework structure stays in place whether I am working or not.
I don't indulge my children with gadgets and kid-centric travel, but even so, the maintenance of our family requires my income. This is surprising to many because of the existence of a husband; a married woman's paycheck is more often than not considered ''extra.'' But our situation isn't typical. Asking a new spouse for cash infusions to support a home that is not his own did not seem ideal during the first year of a new marriage that will always depend on two incomes. My husband loves me and believes in me. But he was offered little reassurance on the question of whether his savings might dwindle entirely as my search went on.
Over time, as prospects continued to slip away, it got more and more difficult to sustain a demeanor of sunny commitment. I had visions of my future, and they ranged from me smiling in a cinched Burberry trench coat at international airport arrivals to my thoughtlessly exposing a flabby belly wearing pajama bottoms while retrieving coupon mailers from the recycle bin. The reality was not much better -- an unemployed, newlywed mother who stood in the shower thinking that her children's generic tear-free shampoo might allow her to finally stop crying.
Job searching involves an uncomfortable mix of constant public self-aggrandizement and the private loss of self-respect. It is tedious and strangely surreal to listen to yourself talk, in a tepid charcoal suit, about achievements and skills while you watch yourself get sucked down a drain.
My family supported my efforts, assuring me that job hunting was a numbers game. The children remained obliviously upbeat, thankfully, and continued to ask for anything and everything and roll their eyes at my refusals without any perception that I was deducting dollars in my head at a frantic rate.
And though I waited until the plastic grids beneath the heel of my boots were visible before getting them fixed, I made sure to keep my interview shoes polished and perfect. I wore them on that happy day when I stood up at the conference table to shake the hand extended toward me and was, at last, offered peace.

HEADLINE: A Hush Falls Where Rockets Once Roared

BYLINE: By MARY F. CALVERT

 BODY:
DURING its heyday, Titusville, Fla., enjoyed the distinction of being the capital of Florida's Space Coast. For decades, technicians, engineers and scientists helped send astronauts into space from the Kennedy Space Center. On July 16, 1969, Apollo 11 lifted off from there, carrying the men who would become the first to walk on the moon. 
But after the Space Shuttle program ended in 2011, and 8,000 people lost their jobs, this boomtown born of the space race started to lose its footing. NASA says it still has ''a robust program of exploration, technology development and scientific research that will last for years to come,'' but the shuttle program was crucial to Titusville's and Brevard County's economy. Now private employers are creating jobs to help make up for the loss. The shuttle Atlantis, meanwhile, which once charged into outer space, is in permanent retirement at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Center.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Gets a Rematch

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
Two weeks before fight night, the Brooklyn boxer Danny Jacobs was in headgear and a padded pelvic girdle, taking rounds in an underground sparring ring at the Starrett City Boxing Club. The club, in the basement of a high-rise building near Jamaica Bay, was in the old-school mold: duct-taped heavy bags and pitted concrete floors -- the sort of place where only a fighter in training would have spent such a beckoningly sunny April day.
Mr. Jacobs, an up-and-coming middleweight, was snapping jabs and practicing his rope moves in preparation for his 10-round fight next Saturday night -- his second since October at the Barclays Center. As he spun around the ring with a partner, his trainer, Andre Rozier, leaned against the ropes to give advice: ''Don't reach, Danny. Clean that up. Punch off the move, off the move!''
Until very recently, a scene like this one -- a Brooklyn boxer training at a Brooklyn gym for a big-time bout in Brooklyn -- would have been impossible, but now that the Barclays Center, on Flatbush Avenue, is midway through its maiden season of organizing fights, local gyms in the borough are again alive with the thump and sweat of hometown fighters readying themselves for hometown crowds. 
''When there's someplace in your own backyard where you can fight for friends and family and people you grew up with, it means a lot,'' said Cleavon Evans, the dreadlocked co-owner of the Starrett City club. ''Every fighter wants to fight for their own, and for us in Brooklyn, Barclays changed that game.''
Brooklyn's boxing history reaches back to 1882, before the Brooklyn Bridge opened, when John L. Sullivan knocked out Jimmy Elliott with a blow to the throat at the Washington Park stadium, which is long defunct. The borough has birthed its share of champions -- Mike Tyson and Riddick Bowe among them.
But the fight game in New York, and especially in Brooklyn, has been moribund for decades, steadily losing ground to casinos in Las Vegas and Atlantic City and to the bloodier, more evenly matched competitions staged by mixed martial arts leagues, which, at least for now, are barred by law from organizing bouts in the city. Until last fall, when Danny Garcia, a junior welterweight from Philadelphia, defended his belts at Barclays' debut fight night, fans in Brooklyn had not laid eyes on title-level boxing since 1931.
Changing that has been the mission of Brett Yormark, the chief executive of the Barclays Center. ''It was just such a natural match -- boxing and Brooklyn,'' Mr. Yormark said in an interview this month. ''Our goal from the start was to pay homage to the history in the borough. But we had to be committed, we had to be all in. Brooklyn knows a contender from a pretender.''
Though Mr. Yormark has not yet met his initial promise of a night of boxing every month, the Garcia fight (accompanied by three more title matches that night) was followed in March by a second night of fights, in which the light heavyweight Bernard Hopkins -- at the arresting age of 48 -- outpointed his opponent to become the oldest fighter in boxing history to win a major belt. On April 27, Mr. Jacobs will fight at yet a third ''show,'' as boxing promoters call their competitions, whose main event will pit Zab Judah, another son of Brooklyn, in a title fight against the returning Mr. Garcia. A fourth show has been scheduled for June at which Paul Malignaggi, a welterweight from Bensonhurst, will meet the rising star Adrien Broner.
For local ring aficionados, the Barclays fights represent a miniature resurrection of a long-declining sport. Madison Square Garden, traditionally the city's home for boxing, held only two shows last year on its main floor, and two in 2011. This year, for the first time since 1927, it did not host the finals of the citywide Golden Gloves amateur competition, which took place Thursday and Friday nights at the Barclays Center.
Thursday's round included 13 matches, featuring fighters from the Bronx, Long Island and upstate, but the contest opened with a bout in the 201-pound weight class that was, fittingly enough, all Brooklyn. Devaughn Greenwood, fighting out of Mr. Judah's father's boxing club in East New York, was the 5-0 winner over Joel Paul, who trains at Gleason's Gym in Dumbo.
The flurry of activity in Brooklyn has breathed new life into the borough's vintage boxing hubs, like Gleason's Gym, which now holds public workouts and promotional events for Barclays boxers. At the same time, it has brought fresh energy to Brooklyn's pool of pugilistic talent, a diverse, if still mostly obscure, array of fighters that includes Luis Collazo from Brownsville; Zachary Ochoa, out of Williamsburg; Frank Galarza, who lives in East New York -- not to mention two Hasidic boxers: Yuri Foreman, who is fighting even as he seeks rabbinical ordination at a local yeshiva, and Dmitriy Salita, the ''Star of David,'' who was born in Ukraine and resides in Flatbush.
''We want to have a national, an international, program, yet still be rooted in Brooklyn,'' said David Itskowitch, the chief operating officer of Golden Boy Promotions, a California company hired to arrange boxing shows for Brooklyn Sports and Entertainment, the Barclays entity that manages fights at the arena. ''Our fighters are the essence of the city. If you were to throw darts from a window in Brooklyn, what would you hit? People from all over the country, all over the world.''
This cosmopolitan attitude notwithstanding, Barclays' partnership with Golden Boy fell prey almost at once to provincialism. When Mr. Yormark announced the deal three years ago, well before the arena was open, he was instantly attacked by indignant New York promoters who claimed that he had outsourced Brooklyn boxing to an interloping West Coast operation.
The deal's most vocal critic was Lou DiBella, a Brooklyn native with a talent for obscenity, who has promoted fights locally for more than a decade. Speaking to Newsday after the announcement, Mr. DiBella, the founder of DiBella Entertainment, called the arrangement with Golden Boy ''a slap in the face.'' He went on to say: ''It's absurd if you think about it. They call themselves Brooklyn Sports and Entertainment. Change your name, guys. You're L.A. Sports and Entertainment.''
Mr. DiBella, who declined to comment further on the deal, has a reputation in the fight world for aggressiveness, and his early jibes were sufficiently provocative that Richard Schaefer, the chief executive of Golden Boy, felt compelled to respond: ''I would say to the other promoters, 'Stop crying. Stop complaining.' Lou DiBella complains that I came into Brooklyn. I've had it with Lou DiBella. This is all just sour grapes.''
Boxing, especially in New York, is ''a business of haters,'' as Mr. Itskowitch described it, a sport in which the battles in the ring are often overshadowed by those in the executive suite, but it was more than professional jealousy that lay beneath those original exchanges. After the arena's first show in October, Sports Illustrated published an article condemning Golden Boy for arranging mismatched bouts on its opening night.
The article, with the headline ''Boxing's Return to Brooklyn: One-Sided Fights and Bad Promoter Deal,'' pointed in particular to a pathetic match between the welterweights Randall Bailey and Devon Alexander. The loser, Mr. Bailey, landed only 45 blows on his opponent in the 12-round bout -- the fewest in the 30-year history of CompuBox statistics. ''A menu like Saturday's main course,'' wrote the author, Bryan Armen Graham, ''feels more like fulfilling business relationships and obligations than producing an authentic sports experience for fans.''
Inherent in this criticism were the conflicts that all promoters face in staging fights. It is intrinsic to boxing that matchmakers need, on one hand, to put on bouts competitive enough to engage the fickle interest of an audience, but still need, on the other, to improve the records, and thus the market values, of the fighters they are contractually responsible for promoting. The quickest, and simplest, way to enhance a fighter's record is to keep him away from difficult fights -- which is to say, to serve him up a vulnerable opponent.
''It's a game of cowboys and Indians, where you know in advance who's going to win,'' said Ron Scott Stevens, a longtime promoter in the city and a former chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission. ''But if a card has too many uncompetitive fights, it's kind of like going to a restaurant and having a bad meal -- you'll never go back.''
Mr. Yormark said he had struck the deal with Golden Boy because neither he nor his staff was expert in organizing fights. He has concerned himself instead with the business end of Barclays' boxing program. He is, for instance, developing a line of boxing merchandise -- or ''merch'' -- to sell at Barclays gift shops and has invited local fighters to appear at Brooklyn Nets' games, which also take place at the arena, to inspire ''cross-promotion.'' Mr. Yormark, who considers himself a follower of the sport, speaks with excitement about attracting boxing fans -- from inside and outside the borough -- by leveraging what he likes to call Brand Brooklyn.
His critics, however, have said his decision to cede control of his boxing shows to Golden Boy has consistently resulted in uninspiring fights. ''The Brooklyn fighters are partly there to push a Brooklyn identity at Barclays, and theoretically because they have local constituencies to sell tickets to,'' said Thomas Hauser, who has written more than 20 books on boxing. ''The problem is that the Brooklyn fighters have frequently been put into horrible mismatches, and fights like that turn boxing fans off.''
The demise of New York boxing is often thought to be inevitable, as though some natural disaster -- a plague or an asteroid -- descended on the sport. But in fact, its downfall can be traced to material and economic changes. In the 1960s, casinos in Las Vegas and elsewhere began to subsidize their bouts with gambling profits. Because of looser union rules, they were able to poach big matches from Madison Square Garden, which even today remains expensive. Several New York promoters said it costs about $400,000 to lease the Garden's main floor for a show and about $100,000 to stage a fight at the Theater, the arena's small event space.
''I did a show there not long ago and they told me it would cost like $2,000 to have my D.J. plug his CD player in,'' said one promoter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared alienating officials at the Garden. ''You can't survive that way when now you have another building down the street,'' referring to the Barclays Center.
While Barclays' officials declined to say how much it cost to put on fights there, they claimed their rates were considerably lower than the Garden's. (The Garden confirmed its own rates but wouldn't comment on Barclays'.) This has caused many in the New York boxing world to imagine the emergence of a price war that could introduce competition between the two arenas and reinvigorate the sport.
''I'm hoping that Barclays and Golden Boy ignite a fire under the Garden,'' said Bruce Silverglade, who has run Gleason's Gym for more than 30 years. ''My desire is that the Garden's management suddenly says, 'Wait a minute, why are all the fights going over there?' ''
Perhaps more important, Mr. Silverglade added that he would love the Barclays Center to promote its own fighters, much as the Garden did until the mid-1990s. While he said that Golden Boy was run by ''a smart bunch of people,'' he maintained that by planning its own shows the Barclays Center could avoid the conflicting interests -- and the off-putting mismatches -- that often come with an outside promoter.
Robert Goodman, who managed in-house boxing at the Garden from 1985 to 1994, said that one chief aspect of his program was a continuing effort to groom young boxers from neighborhoods around New York with an eye toward having them fight one day on the professional stage. ''If you go back in history, small clubs in the city were subsidized by the Garden, almost like a farm system,'' Mr. Goodman said, adding that the former champions Mark Breland and Junior Jones both emerged this way.
''I think that Barclays' fans may suffer in the end, because as it stands, no one is developing local fighters,'' Mr. Goodman said. ''And the only way to do that is to have control of your own department and your own local talent.''
Mr. Yormark acknowledged that his boxing program had not yet built relationships with local gyms aside from Gleason's, or with smaller boxing venues where tomorrow's fighters are fighting today. This has left the effort open to the occasional accusation that Brooklyn boxers who appear at Barclays are often there as steppingstones for Golden Boys' more favored, out-of-town fighters.
There was, for instance, a recent assessment of the Malignaggi-Broner fight scheduled for June, in which The Boxing Tribune described the local boy, Paul Malignaggi, as ''Golden Boy's Thanksgiving turkey, kept in the backyard and fattened up'' for Mr. Broner, a rising prospect from Ohio.
The other day, Mr. Malignaggi responded to this slight while sitting in Portobello's, his manager's pizzeria, a Brooklyn Nets cap cocked in homeboy fashion on his head.
''My name is synonymous with Brooklyn,'' he said. ''I grew up in Brooklyn. I learned to box in Brooklyn. I was never anybody's favorite. I never got the 'let's-set-Paulie-up-to-be-the-next-star' fight. I've been an opponent for other people's stars before and now it's happening again.''
Still, in true Brooklyn fashion, he said it was enough to be fighting at the Barclays Center for a hometown crowd.
''Everybody wants to rep their hood and at this point I can't knock it. Hey, man,'' he added, ''it's boxing.''

HEADLINE: Questioning the Mission of College

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex.
THE flagship campus of the University of Texas here has been in the national news often over the last year, mainly because of a legal challenge to its race-conscious, diversity-minded admissions policy. The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case in October; its decision, not yet rendered, could affect affirmative action nationwide.
But there's another, equally weighty contest being waged at the school, and it concerns nothing less than the future of higher education itself.
Do we want our marquee state universities to behave more like job-training centers, judged by the number of students they speed toward degrees, the percentage of those students who quickly land good-paying jobs and the thrift with which all of this is accomplished? In the service of that, are we willing to jeopardize some of the trailblazing research these schools have routinely done and the standards they've maintained? 
Those questions are being asked and fostering acrimony on campus after campus, the one here in Austin chief among them. In public remarks over the last few years, Hunter Rawlings, the president of the Association of American Universities, has called Texas both the ''epicenter of public debate about the function'' of higher education and ''ground zero'' in a welling crisis.
Rawlings is referring to the tension between the nine regents who set policy for the University of Texas at Austin, all of them appointed by Gov. Rick Perry, and the university's president, Bill Powers. The regents' apparent animosity toward Powers, whose most recent request for a modest in-state tuition increase they denied, reached a point where state lawmakers passed several resolutions in February making their support for him clear. That was a slap at the regents -- and, by extension, at Governor Perry.
And while it reflected political factionalism, it also tapped into a philosophical divide. The regents, Perry and a conservative think tank with great sway over the governor have all called for, or mused publicly about, reforms at the university that many other Texans have deep and warranted reservations about.
The reformers want professors evaluated by how many students they teach and how many research dollars they attract, metrics that favor large classes and less speculative, visionary science.
They want the school to figure out a way, despite huge cutbacks in public funding, to offer students a four-year degree for a sum total of $10,000 in tuition, which is a small fraction of the current cost and seemingly impossible without a diminution in the quality of instruction.
They want expanded online classes. And they want programs tailored more precisely to the job market of the moment.
Powers says he's open to much of this -- to a point. ''I and every other university president I know has made efficiency and affordability and using new teaching systems a high priority,'' he told me when I met with him last week. The issue, he added, is how to do this while still ''educating students at the highest level.''
The pressures on him and university administrators around the country stem from the severity of the country's economic downturn and state governments' accordant budgetary woes. Funding of public universities hasn't just declined; it's plummeted. Increases in tuition have been necessary, even as students find it more difficult to afford. Some students can't make it to the finish line of a bachelor's degree, which betters their odds of employment. Others graduate with crippling debt into a grim job market and wind up with work that doesn't reflect the level or focus of their education.
And so colleges in Virginia are now required to provide information for a database that shows what graduates majored in and what they wound up earning 18 months after getting their diplomas. Florida lawmakers have toyed with encouraging students to study engineering by making their tuition cheaper than humanities majors'. Pat McCrory, the new governor of North Carolina, recently advocated legislation to distribute funds to the state's colleges based not on their enrollments -- or, as he said on a radio show, on ''butts in seats'' -- but instead on ''how many of those butts can get jobs.''
''If you want to take gender studies, that's fine, go to a private school,'' he added. ''But I don't want to subsidize that if that's not going to get someone a job.''
How practical versus idealistic should the approach to college be? I'm somewhat torn, and past columns have reflected that. I applaud proposals to give young people better information about how various fields of study match up with the job market and about projected returns on their investments in college. And for students who want college to be an instant pivot into a job with decent pay, a nudge toward certain disciplines makes excellent sense.
But college is about more than that, with less targeted, long-term benefits that aren't easily captured by metrics. And some of the reforms being promoted right now lose sight of that and threaten to lessen the value of a degree.
''You just don't know what your education is going to result in,'' Rawlings told me by phone last week. ''Many of the kids graduating from college these days are going to hold a number of different jobs in their lives, and many of those jobs have not yet been invented. For a world like that, what's the best education? Seems to me it's a very general education that enables you to think critically.'' For precisely that reason, he said, the push in China now is for more young people to study humanities, even as the new emphasis here is vocational.
He and Powers raised an additional concern: that the devaluation of any university research that doesn't have an imminent payoff or attract outside sponsorship could put the country at a global disadvantage down the line. ''You never know where scientifically driven curiosity will lead you,'' Powers told me, and he's dead right. Sometimes game-changing, immensely lucrative epiphanies lie on the far side of seemingly esoteric inquiries.
I'd sound yet another alarm. Scratch the surface of some of the efforts to reform state universities and you find more than just legitimate qualms about efficiency and demands for accountability. You find the kind of indiscriminate anti-intellectualism and anti-elitism popular among more than a few right-wing conservatives.
It's worth noting that Governor Perry has dismissed global warming as ''one contrived, phony mess'' and that many of the voices calling most loudly for change at the University of Texas are from the Tea Party fringe.
In other words there's some crude, petty politics in all of this. And as we tackle the very real, very important challenge of giving young Americans the best and most useful education possible in an era of dwindling resources, that's the last thing we need.

When 'Affordable' Is Just a Word
In last Sunday's Big City column, Ginia Bellafante asked whether the phrase affordable housing had lost its meaning in the era of $90 million penthouse apartments. Readers responded on nytimes.com; a selection of their comments is below.
New York would truly be the greatest city in the world if it figured out how to house those who are disabled or unable to work, the working poor, as well the upwardly mobile middle class unable to save without some relief in the housing market. 
Without a scheme for this, New York becomes fantastically boring in its self-absorbed, self-applauding upperclassness. Not to mention losing the basic functions of a city because the working poor are pushed out.
Danny, NYC
There is a simple solution that is already being put into effect. Those that can leave, are leaving. My daughter, her husband and my grandson left in October. My wife and I are following them this winter. We both will be retired by then. Almost all of my daughter's friends from high school have left the N.Y.C. metropolitan area. I have not heard of anyone even considering moving back. They include doctors, social workers, therapists, etc.
I pushed my daughter into leaving. New York is no longer a fit place to raise children. The public school system is a disaster. Private schools are outrageously expense and affordable housing is near impossible to find. Sometimes, the only correct decision is to run. Yes, some will be left behind, but for me to stay would be just plain stupid.
RP, Brooklyn, New York
I'm 65 years old, renting a room in a nice apartment in Harlem. The landlady is my rock. Rent is only $500 a month. I want to get my own place, as I've had all my adult life until the layoff. Now my only income is Social Security benefits ... so there is no way I could get my own casa in N.Y.C. ... It's an ugly place to live for the society on the lower rungs ... Let them eat cake; I'm looking at Florida as a destination along with all the other blue hairs.
ron shapley, new york, new york
I think the net effect of Mayor Bloomberg's polices regarding economic development, affordable housing, job creation and taxation has been to drive out ordinary New Yorkers. I heard him speak about this a few years ago. He said that his vision of N.Y.C. was a high-earning knowledge/technology based economy with a small service sector fixing the cars and cleaning the homes of the richer folk.
Daniel Millstone, New York City
Actually, what remains in N.Y.C. is the ''ordinary'' New Yorkers, ordinary in the sense of being dull professionals: bankers, lawyers, doctors, Web entrepreneurs, etc. What's really gone are the non-ordinary New Yorkers, the crazy and creative ones, who didn't make that much but really gave the city some flavor. Now it's the uber-dull professionals in ''acceptable'' fields of work who make enough for rent. Yawn.
Joe Schmoe, Brooklyn
N.Y.C. has become a city for the wealthy, who can live wherever they want; the poor, who are subsidized to live in Manhattan (and get free parking); and the lucky, who can make up to $200,000 a year and still live in one of the 1 million rent controlled/stabilized apartments and enjoy the fact that their rent is subsidized by their younger, poorer neighbors.
That does not even include the ridiculous 80/20 lotteries for luxury buildings which are offered to who? The middle class, you think? Nope, the poor, yet again.
It is the middle class who has been driven out of the city and it is the middle class that the city needs to survive, as we do not need any more rich or poor people.
Although at least the rich pay their way.
Mouse, NYC
Subsidized housing for lower income individuals and families is often an indirect and unfair subsidy to businesses which pay substandard wages.
Fair and just wages for labor would correct much of the housing crisis and end this current debate until the next Great Depression.
Hamilton, F.
Another good idea, put in place last year in Britain, is a special tax on housing owned by offshore companies (which is the preferred structure of foreign plutocrats).
They also have a special sales tax of 7 percent for housing over $3.2 M (2 million pounds) -- both ideas seem like they'd be popular in N.Y.C. if they were introduced.
jake, brooklyn heights
The elephant in the room: Since 1990, the population of NYC has gone up by 1.7 million or so people, while we've built fewer than 200,000 new housing units.
We ran out of ''easy'' housing a decade ago. Now we either have to build or intelligently reuse what we've got.
The people who are doing worst in this are the middle class folks who don't have a ''family'' rent controlled apartment, don't qualify for ''affordable'' housing, and who have to compete for the limited number of free-market apartments.
These are the people that we should be trying to build apartments for.
overtaxed, New York

HEADLINE: Way Out West

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
For years, Hudson Yards seemed unlikely to live up to its own hype.
Rapturously heralded as New York's soon-to-be coolest new neighborhood, it changed only slowly starting in 2005, when its industrial far West Side location was rezoned to encourage a different kind of development. Its 45 square blocks continued to look much the way they had for decades: a mishmash of rail yards, tunnel ramps and parking lots.
''When we started, it was like, 'Will anything ever happen here?' '' said Michael Meola, a real estate consultant who helped City Hall shape the desired look and feel of Hudson Yards in the very beginning, serving from 2006 to 2008 as vice president for development of the Hudson Yards Development Corporation, the entity overseeing the project.
Now, as the recession fades and squabbles about how to proceed are resolved, Hudson Yards finally appears poised to make good on its promised self-reinvention. 
In the last few months, warehouses have been cleared for buildings and parks. Workers are finishing a subway station. The third and last leg of the High Line, looping from West 30th to West 34th Street, will be just one of many green spaces in the neighborhood. And in a place that has long been home to a suburban-style McDonald's drive-through window, a market will open to sell grass-fed sirloin and other delicacies to an upscale clientele.
The biggest change is on the residential side, as the city's largest developers undertake major apartment projects, some of which have been waiting to get off the ground for years. The roll call includes the Extell Development Company, the Related Companies, Glenwood Management, Silverstein Properties, Brookfield Office Properties and the Moinian Group.
From 2005 to 2011, about 6,000 apartments were built in what is considered the Hudson Yards zone, roughly running from 8th to 12th Avenue and from 30th to 42nd Street. But most of the new buildings avoided the neighborhood's heart in favor of its eastern fringes.
Since 2012, another 3,500 units in the thick of the neighborhood have opened or begun construction, or are about to, according to developers, brokers and city officials.
Those 10,000 or so new and planned units put the area halfway to the 20,000 mark, the number that officials say it can support. But given both the sizzling rental market and the oversaturated commercial market, there could yet be even more housing: a movement is afoot to tweak the zoning rules in that direction.
For some, the glittering high-rises and carefully designed green spaces have come at a price.
Ann Warren owns the Cupcake Cafe on Ninth Avenue and 40th Street, which has been in business since 1988. She was forced out of her apartment, on 35th Street near 11th Avenue, when the city used eminent domain to take her building for a new park in Hudson Yards.
''I could see somebody thinking of this area as underutilized,'' said Ms. Warren, who moved with the city's help to a walk-up on 10th Avenue, ''but I certainly liked seeing the blue sky.'' Still, she acknowledged, at a time when no area seems to go undiscovered for too long, ''I guess all this was inevitable.''
Despite its status as the city's most ambitious effort since Battery Park City, most people at the moment could not locate Hudson Yards on a map. But as it continues its transition past the concept stages into reality, there is at last a sense it is coming into its own.
''Hudson Yards was a long-range plan when nobody believed in long-range plans,'' Mr. Meola said. ''But we're finally reaching a critical mass.''
What's Being Built
Developers are not only coming on strong, they're thinking as big as the rezoning will allow.
Extell, like some of its competitors, controls several parcels in the area. Its first apartment building will be 555 10th Avenue, a 50-story rental at West 41st Street with 600 units, a pair of swimming pools and a two-lane bowling alley, said Gary Barnett, Extell's chief executive. Foundations were poured in March; 2016 is the expected completion date.
Units will rent for around $100 a square foot, which is on par with 42nd Street properties like MiMA, from the Related Companies, Mr. Barnett said.
Like other developers, Extell also has commercial projects in the area, including One Hudson Yards, a 56-story office building planned for 11th Avenue and 33rd Street. But the leasing market is soft, making an anchor tenant difficult to find, so that project is on hold for now, Mr. Barnett said.
Extell is also planning apartments on a block-through site between 9th and 10th Avenues on 37th Street. Possibly to include rentals and condos, it probably won't start construction for another year.
''It's like a chicken-and-egg situation,'' Mr. Barnett said. ''You've got to get the tenants to build the neighborhood, and you've got to build the neighborhood to get the tenants.''
Since the fall, Brookfield Office Properties has been building at 425 West 31st Street, the first leg of Manhattan West, a 5.4-million-square-foot mixed-use project on a two-block site on Ninth Avenue between 31st and 33rd Streets.
In addition to office space, Manhattan West will have a 57-story tower with 900 rental units, though Brookfield has configured the building with two elevator banks in case it decides to spin some of those units off as condos, said Philip Wharton, the company's senior vice president for development.
Condos are also envisioned for 3 Hudson Boulevard, a 72-story office tower by the Moinian Group at 11th Avenue and 34th Street. In an unusual combination for New York (allowed by the area's zoning), the 150 condos will be under the same roof as offices; an anchor office tenant is still wanting. ''I'm keeping this flexible,'' said Joseph Moinian, the firm's chief executive.
Moinian has revived a dormant project at 605 West 42nd Street, a rental that is to have 1,191 units, including studios and apartments with one, two and three bedrooms. Foundations were poured in February for the $500 million project, which is expected to open in 2015, said Mr. Moinian, who also built the Atelier Condos next door.
So eager are some developers to tap the Hudson Yards housing market that they are pressing City Hall to amend zoning to allow more apartments. Silverstein Properties, owner of a 90,000-square-foot site on 11th Avenue and 41st Street that once contained a Mercedes dealership, wants to build more housing there than is now permitted, according to industry sources.
And that's not even counting the Related Companies, which along with Oxford Properties Group controls the 26 acres of the old rail yards, a six-block site that in many ways has become a symbol of the area. In 2005, a proposal to build a football stadium for the Jets on a platform over the yard was defeated.
Related and Oxford will spend $15 billion for the mixed-use project, to rise mostly over the rail yards, which runs from 10th to 12th Avenue between 30th and 33rd Streets. Much of the early focus will be on commercial development. The first piece will be a 46-story tower; tenants are to include Coach, L'Oreal USA and SAP, the software company.
Related's residential goal, 5,000 apartments across eight buildings, will mostly be on the site's western half, which won't be fully developed for years. But Related and Oxford are supposed to break ground in 2014 on their first residence, a 75-story tower at 500 West 31st Street. Designed by the architecture firm Diller, Scofidio + Renfro, it will be half condo and half rental, according to Related, which in 2008 was selected to develop the site by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
At 10th Avenue, Related will also soon complete 500 West 30th Street, a 386-unit rental designed by Robert A. M. Stern. Technically just outside the neighborhood, it will still be a notable presence. In 2014, construction will start on another of Related's 10th Avenue rentals, at 530 West 30th Street; it is to have 225 apartments.
What's There Now
Many of the residential buildings already populating Hudson Yards are on and around 42nd Street, or clustered on the eastern side, on dense blocks that overlap the garment district.
Midmarket hotels have sprung up between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, especially on 40th Street. So have large rental buildings, like the 568-unit Emerald Green, at 320 West 38th Street, and the 199-unit Crystal Green, at 330 West 39th Street, both Glenwood Management properties.
Others include the 206-unit Townsend, at 350 West 37th Street, developed by Lalezarian Properties. And Ohm, a 34-story rental from Douglaston Development at 312 11th Avenue, was unveiled in 2010 near the area's southern border.
Although locations closer to Midtown and Chelsea might have been less risky in the early years, not every developer has played it safe.
In 2009, Thomas Elghanayan, the chairman of TF Cornerstone, put up 455 West 37th Street, a rental on a desolate stretch of 10th Avenue, following it a year later with a similar building across the street, 505 West 37th. Together, the glassy towers contain 1,200 apartments. TF Cornerstone was also behind Plaza West, a 1990 high-rise that predates Hudson Yards, at 444 West 35th Street, near 10th Avenue.
Meanwhile Rockrose Development, which is run by Thomas Elghanayan's brother, Henry, owns a full-block parcel along 39th Street between 10th and 11th Avenues; it is zoned for 420,000 square feet of residential development and 1 million square feet of commercial.
''We don't mind people following in, as far as I'm concerned,'' Thomas Elghanayan said. ''Having more residents and more activity is beneficial.''
Getting in early was a problem for some developers, like David Cohen, who in 2006 started construction on a 36-unit condo at 502 Ninth Avenue, at 38th Street. Jan Sasson, the broker who marketed the building, said that the lack of supermarkets and other amenities had cost the area points with potential buyers. ''I'm going to tell you it was a lot of work,'' Mr. Sasson said, ''even at the height of the market.''
But, he added, a possible sign of increased interest in Hudson Yards is the sale of three of the building's eight remaining condos since June 2012.
The Neighborhood
Though new buildings consume much of the attention, the city is hoping that Hudson Yards will also become known for its parks. The third leg of the High Line will traverse the neighborhood from 30th to 34th Street, curving around the rail yards site and extending a short spur across 10th Avenue.
Another major addition will be Hudson Park and Boulevard, a midblock strip of green between 10th and 11th Avenues that will connect 33rd and 39th Streets. The city has razed dozens of buildings to make way for it.
Brookfield is also including a 1.5-acre plaza as part of its Manhattan West property. Built atop train tracks and Dyer Avenue, it will essentially function as a reconstituted leg of West 32nd Street, for pedestrians only. The T-shaped space will also align with New York's main post office, for which a conversion to a train terminal called Moynihan Station has long been planned. ''We're kind of the front door of the project,'' Mr. Wharton said.
He described future shops as lining the plaza and also being squeezed into the truck bays that stud the base of the adjacent 450 West 33rd Street, a slope-walled building owned by Brookfield.
A block away, at the eastern half of the Related site, a much larger green space of six acres will fan out. Designed by Nelson Byrd Woltz, it will have trees encircling a soaring sculpture, according to renderings, though the layout is a work in progress.
That site will adjoin another called the ''culture shed,'' a 170,000-square-foot indoor-outdoor space for exhibitions, film festivals and fashion shows, which will also have an outdoor cafe. The shed, to abut the first Related apartment tower, is to have a roof that rolls out, like a trundle bed, to accommodate larger events -- although this aspect of the project has not yet received city approval. Some residents worry that when the building extends, it will swallow up parkland.
In all, 14 acres of plazas and parks -- including the section of the High Line that crosses the site -- are planned for the old rail yard.
Though stores will be scattered across the Related site, most will be found on three floors of an eight-story structure along 10th Avenue, between the Coach tower and another office building. In look and feel, at least according to the renderings, the retail hub, to open in 2018, will resemble Related's Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle.
Additionally, the spur of the High Line jutting over 10th Avenue will connect to the second floor of a 240,000-square-foot hotel-condo to be developed by Sherwood Equities at 360 10th Avenue, at 30th Street. Sherwood, whose holdings include One and Two Times Square, owns several other large sites in the neighborhood. It doesn't have plans to build on them yet, although a second condo-hotel, 12 stories going up at 515 Ninth Avenue and 39th Street, is to be completed by fall, according to New Line Structures, its builder.
At the moment, the neighborhood in spots is starved for restaurants. Most offerings, especially west of Ninth Avenue, are of the fast-food variety. Which is why Brooklyn Fare, a restaurant opening next month, has generated so much buzz.
At 431 West 37th Street, in the Mantena, a year-old apartment house, it will be a larger outpost of a Downtown Brooklyn restaurant known for its seafood -- a dining room accommodating 60 patrons instead of 18. As in Brooklyn, it will be paired with a market that will sell organic beef as well as cheese, bread and produce.
Early movers to this area -- where rush hour can bring blaring traffic jams and the air sometimes smells like hay from the local carriage-horse stables -- have often found it a tough slog.
In 2005, James Reardon opened the Hudson Yards Cafe at 450 10th Avenue. He hoped to lure green-shirted Jets fans on game days, but when the stadium plan was scrapped, he instead found himself playing host to customers wearing a different type of uniform: that of parking-lot attendant.
''I will probably end up in an urn on somebody's mantel before Hudson Yards is developed,'' he joked.
And yet, as of a few months ago, he can see clear across to the Javits Center on 11th Avenue from the plate-glass windows of his restaurant -- a good sign, since it means that work on the new neighborhood has begun in earnest.
Please, Not HuYa
If there is any confusion over the name Hudson Yards, it could be because it is used to describe both the 26-acre parcel that the Related Companies is developing over the West Side rail yards, and the surrounding 45-acre neighborhood.
''Related's getting all the publicity every time it's used,'' said Philip Wharton, the senior vice president for development of Brookfield Office Properties, a competitor.
The name has generally been adopted by city planners and developers, but is not exactly in common usage.
''I've never heard anybody call it that,'' said Robb Davidson, a resident, who prefers calling the area Hell's Kitchen.
Others have flirted with Linc, a play on the Lincoln Tunnel, whose ramps seem to snake everywhere. One person joked it should be called the flat tire district, for all its auto fix-it shops. Some prefer North Chelsea, which plays off a well-established area to the south.
But the effort to brand a from-scratch area should not be forced, says Mikhail Baryshnikov, who in 2005 opened the Baryshnikov Arts Center between 9th and 10th Avenues on 37th Street, and who rents an apartment near his complex.
''Hudson Yards sounds more beautiful every time I hear it,'' he said. ''But I think it's got to be a decision of the people.''

HEADLINE: How to Put America Back Together Again

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN. 
Nicholas D. Kristof is on book leave.

 BODY:
UNTIL we fully understand what turned two brothers who allegedly perpetrated the Boston Marathon bombings into murderers, it is hard to make any policy recommendation other than this: We need to redouble our efforts to make America stronger and healthier so it remains a vibrant counterexample to whatever bigoted ideology may have gripped these young men. With all our warts, we have built a unique society -- a country where a black man, whose middle name is Hussein, whose grandfather was a Muslim, can run for president and first defeat a woman in his own party and then four years later a Mormon from the opposition, and no one thinks twice about it. With so many societies around the world being torn apart, especially in the Middle East, it is vital that America survives and flourishes as a beacon of pluralism.
Rebuilding our strength has to start with healing our economy. In that regard, it feels as if our budget drama has dragged on for so long that it has not only been drained of all emotional energy but nobody even remembers the plot anymore. It's worth recalling: What are we trying to do? 
We're trying to put America back on a sustainable growth track that will expand employment, strengthen our fiscal balance sheet to withstand future crises and generate resources to sustain the most needy and propel the next generation. That requires three things: We need to keep investing in the engines of our growth -- infrastructure, government-financed research, education, immigration and regulations that incentivize risk-taking but prevent recklessness. We need to reform Social Security and Medicare so they can support all the baby boomers about to retire. And we need to raise more revenues, in the least painful way possible, because we can't just cut everything. As I've said, you can lose weight quickly by cutting off both thumbs, but that will be a problem at work.
It was good to see President Obama put out a budget proposal that addressed all three needs. The attacks on him from the left are unfair because, ultimately, we will need to do all three even more. As Bloomberg News reported on Monday: ''Typical wage-earners retiring in 2010 will receive at least $3 for every $1 they contributed to the Medicare health-insurance program, according to an Urban Institute study.'' That's unsustainable. The Republican budget plan, though, would cut so much so fast -- including taxes -- that it would leave virtually nothing for investing in our growth engines. That's irresponsible.
So what to do? We need a more ''radical center'' -- one much more willing to suggest radically new ideas to raise revenues, not the ''split-the-difference-between-the-same-old-options center.'' And the best place to start is with a carbon tax.
A phased-in carbon tax of $20 to $25 a ton could raise around $1 trillion over 10 years, as we each pay a few more dimes and quarters for every gallon of gasoline or hour of electricity. With that new revenue stream, we'd have so many more options. One, preferred by Republicans like the statesman George Shultz and the Nobel laureate Gary Becker, is to make the carbon tax ''revenue neutral.'' It could be offset entirely by a rebate or by cutting tax rates for every U.S. citizen and corporation, which would increase spending. Another option, the one I'd prefer, would devote half the carbon-tax revenues to individual and corporate tax cuts, use a quarter for new investments in infrastructure, preschool education, community colleges and research -- which would create jobs now and tomorrow -- and then use a quarter on deficit reduction.
In short, if you added such a carbon tax to Obama's budget, you'd have the makings of a radical grand bargain: Republicans would have the income tax cuts they want; Democrats would get the additional infrastructure stimulus they want, plus a new revenue stream to start gradually addressing the deficit, while reducing the amount that we'd have to bite from entitlements now; and the country would have a vehicle to address climate change, to drive clean-tech innovation (and to take money away from people who fund jihadist hate sites on the Internet).
HOWEVER we divide the money, a carbon tax would enable a radical grand bargain that would be more fiscally responsible for the long run and more stimulative in the short run, paving the way to more sustainable growth. (Yes, a carbon tax is not painless. We would have to, and easily can, cushion the poor from its impact.) We'd be serving the present and the future. Here's one example how: Today states are slashing budgets for community colleges, just when every good job requires more skill. That is truly cutting off our thumbs to lose weight. Last week, I interviewed Gary Green, the president of Forsyth Technical Community College, in Winston-Salem, N.C., with 10,000 students.
''We have a labor surplus in this country and a labor shortage at the same time,'' Green explained to me. Workers in North Carolina, particularly in textiles and furniture, who lost jobs either to outsourcing or the recession in 2008, often ''do not have the skills required to get a new job today'' in the biotech, health care and manufacturing centers that are opening in the state.
If before, he added, ''you just needed a high school shop class or a short postsecondary certificate to work in a factory, now you need an associate degree in machining,'' a two-year program that requires higher math, I.T. and systems skills. In addition, some employers are now demanding that you not only have an associate degree but that nationally recognized skill certifications be incorporated into the curriculum to show that you have mastered the skills they want, like computer-integrated machining.
I know: If we can't get some simple gun control, how do we get a carbon tax to pay for all of this? With both, you have to try and keep trying, until the unimaginable becomes the inevitable. Our goal is not just balancing the budget. It's generating the resources in the most intelligent way possible to renew America for the 21st century. I hope the president swings for the fences. It's the only way to revive the country and a moribund Republican Party.
''Margaret Thatcher's big ideas set the context for the creation of New Labour,'' said Don Baer, the former Clinton administration communications chief. ''Ronald Reagan's big ideas did the same for the New Democrats.'' Maybe only big ideas from President Obama can give birth to New Republicans -- and the revival of the country. Competition works. But if we treat every good big idea as ''dead on arrival'' then so are we. We cannot allow that. A more interdependent world desperately needs an America at its best.

HEADLINE: Bombing Suspects' Immigration Story Adds Layer to Debate on Overhaul

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
WAYNE, Pa. -- With the television in her pizzeria showing an endless loop of the Boston manhunt on Friday, Bessie Kontis glanced up at scenes of the quasi-military lockdown and shuddered.
''After something like that happens, they should stop all visas, for crying out loud,'' said Ms. Kontis, 58, who owns New Wayne Pizza with her husband, Alex. ''It's insane. It just angers me.''
Ms. Kontis was born in Greece and immigrated to the United States as a child, but when two men of Chechen heritage were identified as the suspects in the fatal Boston Marathon bombings, her usually broad views about immigration became colored by concerns for national security. 
''That is who's coming in,'' she said. ''We don't know what kind of people they are. The bottom line is we have to stop being goody-goody Americans.''
As a national debate over major immigration reform begins in Congress, some opponents are pointing to the Boston bombings as cause for concern about expanding visa programs and offering millions of illegal immigrants a path to citizenship.
On Friday, Senator Charles E. Grassley, a senior Iowa Republican on the committee debating the plan, which is proposed by a bipartisan group of eight senators, said the terrorist bombings should figure into the debate. Some conservative commentators and Congressional Republicans want to shift the focus away from economic and humanitarian concerns to border security and the potential threat from terrorists entering the country.
How successful their efforts turn out to be, and whether Boston slows momentum for change, could depend on how many citizens express views like Ms. Kontis's.
But judging by a sampling of voters in one politically divided region, the western suburbs of Philadelphia, the Boston bombings may be an imperfect test case for opponents of reform.
In interviews Friday night, as the denouement of the manhunt played out in the hours when people gathered in taverns or strolled the streets on a pleasant evening, many mentioned that the two brothers linked to the attacks -- Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, 19, who was captured Friday, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, who was killed earlier -- had arrived in the country a decade earlier, with a father who claimed asylum because of the conflict in their homeland. They could hardly have been identified by more vigilant border control, people said.
''You can't stop people who came into the U.S. who 10 years later do bad things,'' said Andrew Factor, 26, an investment adviser who stopped outside his office on the main street here. ''We're supposed to screen for terrorists when kids are 9 and 16?''
Nonetheless, the details of the Tsarnaev family's odyssey may become lost in a larger debate over immigration policy, an issue that evokes visceral reactions. Two Republican senators favoring reform, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona, warned Friday of bringing Boston into the debate and insisted an overhaul would tighten security ''by helping us identify exactly who has entered our country and who has left.''
But that message was not always embraced. ''I'm a little more of an extremist now after what happened in Boston,'' said Greg Ricker, 41, a stockbroker, as he stepped outside the Flying Pig Saloon in Malvern for a cigarette. ''I think we should just stop letting people in.''
Like nearby Wayne, Malvern is part of a suburban belt that has grown more Democratic in recent elections. Attitudes toward immigration reform seem to be changing, in part along generational lines. Frank Cunningham, a 27-year-old accountant, said that he, unlike his father, favors a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the country.
''The way I was raised, my dad says, 'If you come into the country illegally, you don't deserve to be here,' '' Mr. Cunningham said. ''But I'm wondering who is going to do those jobs?''
Gary Burnett, 35, said he favored a path to citizenship and expanded permanent-resident visas for those waiting outside the country, because the nation is already part of a global economy.
As a software engineer, he said, ''I compete with the entire world already. I have to be able to do the work of at least three people in Asia to compete.''
He thought the potential that some immigrants might turn out to be terrorists was a red herring.
Melvin Cook, 57, who was buying a pizza, went further. He accused politicians of exploiting the Boston bombing. ''They're trying to put fear into us of immigrants,'' he said. Mr. Cook, a truck driver, said of illegal immigrants, ''The jobs they're getting, nobody wants.''

HEADLINE: Conservative Koch Brothers Turning Focus to Newspapers

BYLINE: By AMY CHOZICK; Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Three years ago, Charles and David Koch, the billionaire industrialists and supporters of libertarian causes, held a seminar of like-minded, wealthy political donors at the St. Regis Resort in Aspen, Colo. They laid out a three-pronged, 10-year strategy to shift the country toward a smaller government with less regulation and taxes.
The first two pieces of the strategy -- educating grass-roots activists and influencing politics -- were not surprising, given the money they have given to policy institutes and political action groups. But the third one was: media.
Other than financing a few fringe libertarian publications, the Kochs have mostly avoided media investments. Now, Koch Industries, the sprawling private company of which Charles G. Koch serves as chairman and chief executive, is exploring a bid to buy the Tribune Company's eight regional newspapers, including The Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune, The Baltimore Sun, The Orlando Sentinel and The Hartford Courant. 
By early May, the Tribune Company is expected to send financial data to serious suitors in what will be among the largest sales of newspapers by circulation in the country. Koch Industries is among those interested, said several people with direct knowledge of the sale who spoke on the condition they not be named. Tribune emerged from bankruptcy on Dec. 31 and has hired JPMorgan Chase and Evercore Partners to sell its print properties.
The papers, valued at roughly $623 million, would be a financially diminutive deal for Koch Industries, the energy and manufacturing conglomerate based in Wichita, Kan., with annual revenue of about $115 billion.
Politically, however, the papers could serve as a broader platform for the Kochs' laissez-faire ideas. The Los Angeles Times is the fourth-largest paper in the country, and The Tribune is No. 9, and others are in several battleground states, including two of the largest newspapers in Florida, The Orlando Sentinel and The Sun Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale. A deal could include Hoy, the second-largest Spanish-language daily newspaper, which speaks to the pivotal Hispanic demographic.
One person who attended the Aspen seminar who spoke on the condition of anonymity described the strategy as follows: ''It was never 'How do we destroy the other side?' ''
''It was 'How do we make sure our voice is being heard?' ''
Guests at the Aspen seminar included Philip F. Anschutz, the Republican oil mogul who owns the companies that publish The Washington Examiner, The Oklahoman and The Weekly Standard, and the hedge fund executive Paul E. Singer, who sits on the board of the political magazine Commentary. Attendees were asked not to discuss details about the seminar with the press.
A person who has attended other Koch Industries seminars, which have taken place since 2003, says Charles and David Koch have never said they want to take over newspapers or other large media outlets, but they often say ''they see the conservative voice as not being well represented.'' The Kochs plan to host another conference at the end of the month, in Palm Springs, Calif.
At this early stage, the thinking inside the Tribune Company, the people close to the deal said, is that Koch Industries could prove the most appealing buyer. Others interested, including a group of wealthy Los Angeles residents led by the billionaire Eli Broad and Ronald W. Burkle, both prominent Democratic donors, and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, would prefer to buy only The Los Angeles Times.
The Tribune Company has signaled it prefers to sell all eight papers and their back-office operations as a bundle. (Tribune, a $7 billion media company that also owns 23 television stations, could also decide to keep the papers if they do not attract a high enough offer.)
Koch Industries is one of the largest sponsors of libertarian causes -- including the financing of policy groups like the Cato Institute in Washington and the formation of Americans for Prosperity, the political action group that helped galvanize Tea Party organizations and their causes. The company has said it has no direct link to the Tea Party.
This month a Koch representative contacted Eddy W. Hartenstein, publisher and chief executive of The Los Angeles Times, to discuss a bid, according to a person briefed on the conversation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the conversation was private. Mr. Hartenstein declined to comment.
Koch Industries recently brought on Angela Redding, a consultant based in Salt Lake City, to analyze the media environment and assess opportunities. Ms. Redding, who previously worked at the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, did not respond to requests for comment.
''As an entrepreneurial company with 60,000 employees around the world, we are constantly exploring profitable opportunities in many industries and sectors. So, it is natural that our name would come up in connection with this rumor,'' Melissa Cohlmia, a spokeswoman for Koch Companies Public Sector, said in a statement last month.
''We respect the independence of the journalistic institutions referenced in the news stories,'' Ms. Cohlmia continued. ''But it is our longstanding policy not to comment on deals or rumors of deals we may or may not be exploring.''
One person who has previously advised Koch Industries said the Tribune Company papers were considered an investment opportunity, and were viewed as entirely separate from Charles and David Kochs' lifelong mission to shrink the size of government.
At least in politically liberal Los Angeles, a conservative paper could be tricky. David H. Koch, who lives in New York and serves as executive vice president of Koch Industries, has said he supports gay marriage and could align with many residents on some social issues, Reed Galen, a Republican consultant in Orange County, Calif., said.
Koch Industries' main competitor for The Los Angeles Times is a group of mostly Democratic local residents. In the 2012 political cycle, Mr. Broad gave $477,800, either directly or through his foundation, to Democratic candidates and causes, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Mr. Burkle has long championed labor unions. President Bill Clinton served as an adviser to Mr. Burkle's money management firm, Yucaipa Companies, which in 2012 gave $107,500 to Democrats and related causes. The group also includes Austin Beutner, a Democratic candidate for mayor of Los Angeles, and an investment banker who co-founded Evercore Partners.
''This will be a bipartisan group,'' Mr. Beutner said. ''It's not about ideology, it's about a civic interest.'' (The Los Angeles consortium is expected to also include Andrew Cherng, founder of the Panda Express Chinese restaurant chain and a Republican.)
''It's a frightening scenario when a free press is actually a bought and paid-for press and it can happen on both sides,'' said Ellen Miller, executive director of the Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan watchdog group.
Last month, shortly after L.A. Weekly first reported on Koch Industries' interest in the Tribune papers, the liberal Web site Daily Kos and Courage Campaign, a Los Angeles-based liberal advocacy group, collected thousands of signatures protesting such a deal. Conservatives, meanwhile, welcomed the idea of a handful of prominent papers spreading the ideas of economic ''freedom'' from taxes and regulation that the Kochs have championed.
Seton Motley, president of Less Government, an organization devoted to shrinking the role of the government, said the 2012 presidential election reinforced the view that conservatives needed a broader media presence.
''A running joke among conservatives as we watched the G.O.P. establishment spend $500 million on ineffectual TV ads is 'Why don't you just buy NBC?' '' Mr. Motley said. ''It's good the Kochs are talking about fighting fire with a little fire.''
Koch Industries has for years felt the mainstream media unfairly covered the company and its founding family because of its political beliefs. KochFacts.com, a Web site run by the company, disputes perceived press inaccuracies. The site, which asserts liberal bias in the news media, has published private e-mail conversations between company press officers and journalists, including the Politico reporter Kenneth P. Vogel and editors at The New Yorker in response to an article about the Kochs by Jane Mayer.
''So far, they haven't seemed to be particularly enthusiastic about the role of the free press,'' Ms. Mayer said in an e-mail, ''but hopefully, if they become newspaper publishers, they'll embrace it with a bit more enthusiasm.''
A Democratic political operative who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he admired how over decades the brothers have assembled a complex political infrastructure that supports their agenda. A media company seems like a logical next step.
This person said, ''If they get some bad press that Darth Vader is buying Tribune, they don't care.''

HEADLINE: Hispanics, the New Italians

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
THE German immigrants of the 19th century were so devoted to their native language that Americans wondered if the new arrivals would ever assimilate. The Irish who followed were said to be too devoted to a foreign pope to embrace American democracy.
Many Italians not only were Roman Catholic but also returned home for the winter, when construction work here slowed. The Chinese and Jews, skeptics argued, were of an entirely different race than many successful immigrants who came before them. 
With the arrival of millions of Latinos in recent decades, there have been multiple reasons to wonder if they would assimilate and thrive -- including legitimate economic issues that go well beyond ethnic stereotypes. Unlike previous generations of immigrants, today's can remain in daily telephone and video contact with their homeland. And unlike those in the past, today's immigrants face legal obstacles, and their pathway to a middle-class life involves college tuition. A decade ago, the political scientist Samuel P. Huntington described the newfound issues with assimilation as simply the ''Hispanic challenge.''
Yet as the Senate begins to debate a major immigration bill, we already know a great deal about how Latinos are faring with that challenge: they're meeting it, by and large. Whatever Washington does in coming months, a wealth of data suggests that Latinos, who make up fully half of the immigration wave of the past century, are already following the classic pattern for American immigrants.
They have arrived in this country in great numbers, most of them poor, ill educated and, in important respects, different from native-born Americans. The children of immigrants, however, become richer and better educated than their parents and overwhelmingly speak English. The grandchildren look ever more American.
''These fears about immigrants have been voiced many times in American history, and they've never proven true,'' Alan M. Kraut, a history professor at American University, in Washington, told me. ''It doesn't happen immediately, but everything with Latinos points to a very typical pattern of integration in American life in a generation or two.''
Immigrant Latino households have a median income that trails the national median by $24,000 (or more than 40 percent). Among second-generation Latino households, the gap is only $10,000, according to a recent Pew Research Center report. Similarly, only 7 percent of Latino immigrants marry someone of a different ethnicity; a whopping 26 percent of the second generation does. ''It's a very reassuring set of metrics,'' said Paul Taylor, the Pew center's executive vice president.
Even one alarming trend among the children of Latino immigrants highlights their increased American-ness: younger Latinos are having more children outside marriage than their parents did, just as whites and African-Americans are.
If anything, these snapshots of today's different generations tend to understate immigrants' progress. Over the last several decades, Mexico and other Latin-American countries sending migrants here, like El Salvador, have also become richer and more educated. As a result, the immigrants of the past -- and, by extension, their children and grandchildren -- started out even further behind than today's newcomers.
To gauge the progress of an immigrant group, the ideal comparison is not between the second and third generations in 2013 and the first generation in 2013; it is between the later generations and their actual parents and grandparents. James P. Smith, an economist at the RAND Corporation, has done such complex, longitudinal work and finds that the trajectory of Latinos most closely resembles that of Italians, who also arrived with comparatively little education.
FOR decades, the average Latino immigrant has had slightly more than a junior-high school education. An average child of a Latino immigrant today completes high school and attends almost one year of college. A typical grandchild attends more college, Mr. Smith found. In the last decade alone, according to the Pew study, the number of Latinos graduating from college has roughly doubled, to more than 250,000.
Latino immigrants, of course, still trail other groups in a number of metrics, including education and income. And there is no guarantee that they or their descendants will close the gaps completely.
They have advantages that previous immigrant waves did not, starting with a national culture less accepting of discrimination than in the past. But they also face new obstacles. Perhaps most important, earlier groups of immigrants were not breaking the law by living in this country.
For the myriad ways that the country accepts illegal immigrants as part of society, their status still brings enormous disadvantages that inhibit climbing the economic ladder. Parents without legal status are less willing to become involved in their children's schools. They are less willing than legal workers to ask for a raise or to leave one job for another that brings more opportunity. They are less easily able to start a business.
Whether you consider those costs too small or too large for people who enter the country without permission, the bipartisan bill introduced in the Senate last week would clearly reduce them. Long before they won citizenship -- which would take years -- many of today's 11 million illegal immigrants would be able to lawfully register as residents.
''The change would be very significant for them, and it would happen immediately after they register,'' said Doris M. Meissner, a former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service who is now at the Migration Policy Institute. ''They would no longer be clandestine.''
The Senate bill is a long way from becoming law. The most probable outcome seems to be a bill that will help many recent immigrants, either substantially or modestly. No matter what, the overall direction for the modern wave of American immigrants is unlikely to change.
The notion of a unique ''Hispanic challenge'' is not wrong. But neither was the notion of a unique Italian challenge, Chinese challenge or Jewish challenge.
To be an impoverished immigrant who does not speak English and has few labor-market skills is not easy. Over time, the specific challenges -- legal, cultural and educational -- have changed. Yet the core parts of the story have not, including its trajectory.

HEADLINE: Rewinding History, Bush Museum Lets You Decide

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
UNIVERSITY PARK, Tex. -- More than four years after leaving office, former President George W. Bush has a question for America: So what would you have done?
In a new brick-and-limestone museum, visitors to an interactive theater will be presented with the stark choices that confronted the nation's 43rd president: invade Iraq or leave Saddam Hussein in power? Deploy federal troops after Hurricane Katrina or rely on local forces? Bail out Wall Street or let the banks fail?
The hypothetical exercise, which includes touch screens that let users watch videos of ''advisers'' before voting on whether they would make the same choices that Mr. Bush did, revisits the most consequential moments of his administration. In the process, the country is being asked to re-evaluate the two-term president who presided over some of the most tumultuous years in the nation's history.
The George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum will be officially dedicated on Thursday on the campus of Southern Methodist University in a ceremony that will bring together President Obama and the four living ex-presidents. Leaving aside for a day the partisan rancor that marked Mr. Bush's tenure, they will help celebrate his eight years as president and six as governor of Texas. 
The $250 million complex houses the 13th official presidential library, and the third in Texas, but it is the first of the iPad era. The exhibits are filled with modern gadgetry and 25 different films and interactive videos. Many of the artifacts of the period are on display -- a butterfly ballot from Palm Beach County, Fla., a replica of Mr. Bush's Oval Office, the bullhorn he used at ground zero and a gnarled steel beam from the World Trade Center demolished on Sept. 11, 2001.
The museum's 14,000 square feet of exhibits present the presidency Mr. Bush intended (tax cuts, No Child Left Behind, faith-based social services) juxtaposed against the presidency he ended up having (terrorism, war and financial crisis). Large screens recall the day the towers fell in New York and the invasion of Iraq. A glass-topped Defending Freedom Table allows visitors to pull up briefing materials, videos and maps as if on a giant tablet.
No president produces a museum known for self-flagellation, and Mr. Bush's is no exception. It does not ignore controversies like the weapons of mass destruction that were never found in Iraq, but it does not dwell on them either. In the Iraq display it says flatly, ''No stockpiles of W.M.D. were found.'' But then it adds, ''Post-invasion inspections confirmed that Saddam Hussein had the capacity to resume production of W.M.D.''
A six-minute introductory video narrated by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice acknowledges disputes over Iraq and interrogation techniques while defending them as efforts to protect the country. ''If you were in a position of authority on Sept. 11,'' she says, ''every day after was Sept. 12.''
The museum touches on other crises and setbacks as well, including exhibits on Hurricane Katrina and the president's failed Social Security initiative. But it also features often-overlooked achievements, like the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which has treated millions of people with AIDS in Africa, and the creation of the world's largest marine preserve.
''The museum itself is the Bushes' personal statement about what they think was important,'' said Mark Langdale, president of the George W. Bush Foundation, who oversaw the construction. But Brendan Miniter, who managed development of the museum, said that Mr. Bush wanted the exhibits to avoid editorializing and, for example, insisted that critical letters from troops be included. ''We try to let it speak for itself,'' Mr. Miniter said.
Mark K. Updegrove, director of the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library, said the tone should come as no surprise. ''It's unfair for us to assume that an exhibit depicting a president's administration will be objective when the president is alive,'' said Mr. Updegrove, who is working on a book on the father-and-son Bush presidents. ''But there's still great value in getting a president's perspective on his administration.''
An intriguing aspect of the museum is who is featured and who is not. There is a statue of Mr. Bush with his father, a section devoted to Laura Bush's travels, a video by his daughters and even statues of the family dogs and cat. In addition to Ms. Rice, Mr. Bush's two chiefs of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr. and Joshua B. Bolten, also narrate videos. But former Vice President Dick Cheney, former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Karl Rove, the president's political strategist, generally make only cameo appearances in news footage.
More than $500 million was raised for the George W. Bush Presidential Center and associated programs. The library and museum will be turned over to the National Archives and Records Administration, while the former president will retain control of a public policy institute that promotes his priorities.
Set on 23 acres of the S.M.U. campus, the expansive complex designed by Robert A. M. Stern Architects fits the university's Georgian architectural style. Its conservation elements, including rooftop solar panels, rainwater harvesting and efficient building systems, earned it LEED (for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Platinum certification, the highest rating by the United States Green Building Council.
A 15-acre park landscaped by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates features native Blackland Prairie grasses, habitats for butterflies and birds and tree-shaded lawns. A 67-foot tower called Freedom Hall will be lighted at night against the Dallas skyline. Inside visitors will encounter a giant 360-degree high-definition video wall showing scenes from Texas.
The institute is ''a cross between a think tank and an N.G.O.,'' or nongovernment organization, according to James K. Glassman, its founding executive director. It concentrates on six areas: economic growth, democracy promotion, education reform, global health, military service and women's rights.
''These are the things the president has been passionate about,'' Mr. Glassman said. ''Some of these things he was able to get done while he was governor and while he was president, and some of these things will take a long time to get done.''
Much like Bill Clinton, Mr. Bush uses his influence to convene public and private resources behind his initiatives. The institute's Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon project, for instance, builds on the AIDS relief initiative by fighting cervical cancer in Africa. In partnership with the federal government, the United Nations, Susan G. Komen for the Cure and drug companies, the institute is organizing vaccinations, homemade diagnoses and early treatment programs in places like Zambia and Botswana.
Such efforts may enhance the reputation of a president who left office with historically low approval ratings, but he denied that was his goal. ''I don't view the post-presidency as burnishing any legacy,'' Mr. Bush said in an interview with Mr. Updegrove in Parade Magazine. ''I view it as living life to the fullest. The challenge when you're a former president is how do you use your God-given talents? People will tell you that you deserve to rest. Well, you never deserve to rest.''
As president, he rarely had a chance to rest given the endless cascade of crises as visitors will experience in the Decision Points Theater. As many as 24 visitors at a time are presented with one of four situations -- the invasion of Iraq, the troop buildup in 2007, Hurricane Katrina or the financial crisis. Visitors have four minutes to pull up videos of actors playing White House aides, generals, lawmakers and others giving advice, then they pick one of three options.
When the room has voted, either Mr. Card or Mr. Bolten appears on the main screen to announce the result. Then Mr. Bush appears to describe what he did.
Mr. Bush's advisers said the idea was to let Americans see the choices as he did. ''We fully anticipate that some people will try to poke holes or some people will debate,'' said Mr. Langdale. ''That's fine. That's part of history.''

HEADLINE: Urban in Name (and Taxes) Only

BYLINE: By VERA HALLER

 BODY:
When Mohsima and Nafisur Rahman decided about a year and a half ago that the time had come to leave their two-bedroom rental in Jamaica Estates, their list of reasons for moving was long.
They had tired of the crowds and noise they encountered, being so near subway and bus stops. Their two sons -- now 3 and 8 -- needed space to run and jump without bothering neighbors, and the family needed to be closer to good schools.
The couple knew exactly where they wanted to buy: a few miles east in Floral Park, one of the most suburban of city neighborhoods. Abutting the Nassau County village of the same name, but with much more affordable taxes, it has small single-family homes on uniform lots with trim front lawns. It remains the kind of place where people help shovel one another's sidewalks after a snowstorm and keep an eye on elderly neighbors. Its schools are in the well-respected District 26, and demand for its houses is fierce.
After searching for a year, the Rahmans, who both hold public health jobs in city government, bought a three-bedroom ranch with a finished basement and a backyard in the northern part of Floral Park. Since moving in seven months ago, Mrs. Rahman said, the family has enjoyed both the calm and the outdoor space. 
''It's a very good neighborhood for certain things like location and the schools,'' she said. ''There's public transportation, but it's also easy to drive.''
She likes the international flavor of their corner, too. The neighbors are Indian, Filipino and Italian. The Rahmans, who are Bangladeshi, add to the mix.
Floral Park was developed after World War II for returning veterans. Originally it drew Irish, Italian and German families. Now it is popular among South Asians.
Kathy Gibbons, the manager of the Bellerose, Queens, office of Laffey Fine Homes and a lifelong resident of Floral Park, has been struck by the similarities between the old and the new.
''Just like the Irish, Italians and Germans who moved here 50 years ago,'' Ms. Gibbons said, ''the South Asians are the same. They have the same core values as their predecessors, and that's what makes this neighborhood still so desirable.''
The city has grouped 2010 census data about Floral Park with Glen Oaks and New Hyde Park. It lists 48 percent of the 22,571 residents of this larger area as white and just over 33 percent as Asian, including Indians and other South Asians. Hispanics and African-Americans made up the rest. The figures, when compared with 2000's, showed the Asian population having grown about 33 percent and the white population having shrunk about 20 percent.
Ms. Gibbons said one benefit of the change was culinary. She recalled musing aloud in the office one day about how far she would have to travel to find saffron for a recipe. ''Come with me,'' said Hasmukh Shah, a colleague. He took her down the block to Patel Brothers, an Indian market, which had saffron aplenty.
One sign of the area's growing importance to South Asians is the decision by Butala Emporium -- a chain store selling Indian products -- to open a local outlet. Its other two stores in New York are in Jackson Heights and on East 28th Street in Manhattan's so-called Curry Hill area.
What You'll Find
Most houses are simple Capes built with three bedrooms and one bath on lots of 40 by 100 feet. Over the years, many owners have added baths and finished basements. The compact neighborhood also has a smattering of larger colonials built on teardown sites.
It is popular because it offers Long Island-style living without the high property taxes of Nassau County, said Mr. Shah, of Laffey Fine Homes. The schools' reputation only increases the allure, he said. He sees not only young families looking to buy, but also pensioners who raised children on Long Island and now want lower taxes.
The area's real estate is almost exclusively single-family; for those drawn to apartment living, one option is North Shore Towers in Glen Oaks, whose grounds hug the Grand Central Parkway at the Nassau border. The complex, made up of three 33-story towers, has an underground shopping arcade, a golf course and many other amenities. The views from the upper stories are spectacular, stretching from the Long Island Sound to the Manhattan skyline.
What You'll Pay
In early April, a check of the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, which also covers Queens, showed only 20 listings in Floral Park and Glen Oaks, which are paired together. Prices ranged from $400,000 to $900,000, with most grouped around $550,000.
Mr. and Mrs. Rahman declined to say how much they paid for their house last year, but properties like their three-bedroom ranch were selling for about $480,000, according to Mr. Shah.
He ascribed the increased demand to a convergence of factors: the area's popularity; the availability of low-interest loans; and media reports that real estate prices in New York and across the country were expected to rise.
Mr. Shah says he tells homeowners that he can probably sell their properties in a week. He described the recent open house for a typical Cape as yielding 10 offers by the end of the day.
Prices are starting to rise as well, said Ms. Gibbons, but they have not reached the levels they hit before the economic downturn. She says typical Capes that now sell for $500,000 to $550,000 were selling for $600,000 six years ago.
(Given these factors, the three representative properties accompanying this article are recent sales rather than current listings.)
The Commute
Floral Park, at the easternmost end of the city, has no direct subway service, but residents can catch a bus to the subway. The Q43 and Q36 take riders to the Hillside Avenue-179th Street subway station in Jamaica, where the F train stops.
A morning commute using this route takes about an hour and 20 minutes to Midtown. The X68 express bus takes about the same amount of time to get to Grand Central Terminal.
A bus serving North Shore Towers, the QM6, is a little quicker. Its 7:28 a.m. bus gets to 57th Street and Third Avenue by 8:43 a.m.
Residents who live near the Nassau border can walk to the Floral Park Long Island Rail Road station, where a train to Penn Station takes 35 to 40 minutes, depending on the time of day.
The Schools
Strong public schools are a point of pride. Public School 191 the Mayflower has an enrollment of 412, according to the Department of Education Web site. Last year, 87.2 percent of tested students met state standards in English, 93.6 percent in math last year, versus 49 and 57 percent citywide. Middle School 172 Irwin Altman, with 975 students in Grades 6 through 8, also had strong state scores. The Queens High School for Teaching, Liberal Arts and the Sciences, in Bellerose, has an enrollment of 1,195 students and focuses on preparing future teachers. Its SAT averages were 437 in reading, 446 in math and 434 in writing, versus 496, 514 and 434 citywide.
What to Do
A major attraction in the area is the Queens County Farm, which offers seasonal events for Halloween and Easter, as well as an antique car show and, every September, the Queens County Fair. For jogging, walking and other outdoor recreation, residents use adjacent Cunningham Park, a 358-acre oasis with playgrounds, tennis courts and ball fields (including fields for cricket). A stretch of the old Vanderbilt Motor Parkway that runs through the park is a bike and jogging path. Also close by is the 655-acre Alley Pond Park, which has a nature trail and a bird sanctuary.
The History
The name Floral Park has roots in a horticultural past. Long a farming area, it began to change in the late 19th century with the arrival of the railroad. According to historical accounts, a seed company owner, John Lewis Childs, bought land to develop and named the area to promote his business.
The southern part of that area joined Nassau in 1899. The city neighborhood is sometimes called North Floral Park, to distinguish it from its Long Island neighbor.

HEADLINE: Financing a Vacation Home

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
Buying a vacation home these days requires plenty of cash on hand.
Mortgage down payment requirements are considerably stiffer than for primary residences, and lenders are scrutinizing income more closely, which can make financing especially difficult for the self-employed.
The tougher terms make for a ''bittersweet situation'' in the Hamptons, said Judi Desiderio, the president of Town and Country Real Estate in East Hampton. 
Many of her clients ''have given up on getting mortgages -- totally,'' and instead are paying cash, she said. But as much as she hates to say it, Ms. Desiderio said the real estate market is probably better off this way. ''If money was as easy to get as before the crash,'' she said, ''I think we would have real estate pandemonium. It would create a whole new bubble.''
Nationally, the number of vacation home sales last year rose 10 percent over 2011, to 553,000, according to a National Association of Realtors survey released this month. As a share of all purchase transactions, however, vacation-home sales remained flat at 11 percent.
The same survey found that 46 percent of vacation-home buyers paid in cash last year. For those who financed a purchase, the median down payment was 27 percent.
For conforming loans (up to $625,500 in the New York area), most lenders require 35 percent down on a second home, though a few accept 20 percent down, said Pattie Romanzi, the president of the Par East Mortgage Company in East Hampton.
The down payment requirement on jumbo loans typically is 25 to 30 percent on amounts up to $1.5 million, and then 35 percent and up. The banks ''just don't make exceptions on a second home the way they do on a first,'' Ms. Romanzi said. ''And some want to see that you have X amount of months' payments left in reserves.''
Self-employed buyers who have the cash for a down payment may still run into difficulties. These are people who tend to ''whittle down'' their adjusted gross income for tax purposes, but ''that doesn't help in the mortgage world,'' said Daniel Gualtieri, the vice president of the Hamptons division of GFI Mortgage Bankers. ''This whole Dodd-Frank thing is all about the borrowers' ability to show that they are qualified to repay the loan,'' he said, referring to the 2010 financial reform law. ''The lender's job is to disclose this in as many ways as possible.''
Another potential problem for these buyers is that banks take two-year averages on income. If the sagging economy hurt a buyer's business in 2011, a better showing in 2012 still may not be enough to satisfy the income requirements.
There are stated-income mortgage programs -- in which borrowers' income is not verified -- but terms are more stringent. Financing typically covers up to 65 percent of value up to $1 million, and no more than 50 percent above that, Ms. Romanzi said.
On the Jersey Shore, the extensive storm damage from Hurricane Sandy scared away some lenders. ''We're not seeing the big banks writing loans'' in damaged areas, said Eric Birchler, the owner of Birchler Realtors in Lavallette. ''But the good news is, the local banks are still writing paper here.''
Banks like OceanFirst and Manasquan Savings have stepped up to provide purchase and rehab financing, often through the Federal Housing Administration's 203k renovation loan program, he said. Depending on the bank, down payment requirements are anywhere from 35 to 50 percent.
Appraisals can complicate deals, especially with appraisers from out of the area. ''A lot of them were confused before the storm,'' Mr. Birchler said, ''and after the storm they're even more confused.''

HEADLINE: If It's Underground, Maybe Its Price Is, Too

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
IN waves of intense selling, an array of commodities extracted from beneath the earth's surface -- from gold and silver to oil, aluminum and copper -- has fallen sharply in price this month.
Each commodity is unique, of course, with its own problems and personality. Gold retains an almost theological status among some of its adherents, who say it's the one true store of value -- yet gold's price swings have been stunning. Oil has plenty of swagger, and its fluctuations have brought economies to their knees and countries into conflict. Copper is quietly useful and is said to convey so much information about global trends that it is called Dr. Copper -- the commodity with a Ph.D. in economics.
Yet despite many idiosyncrasies, commodities have been moving largely in the same direction. With some exceptions and interruptions -- notably, during the financial crisis -- all of these finite resources rose in value for a decade or so. And at least for the moment, that overriding trend appears to have been broken. 
What is striking is that a broad market consensus has rapidly emerged: that the immediate prospects for many high-flying commodities have grown appreciably bleaker.
''I see further declines ahead for most commodities,'' says Julian Jessop, chief global economist and head of commodities research for Capital Economics in London.
In reports this month, a host of investment banks and brokerage firms have said that a range of commodities is caught in a downdraft. Edward L. Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup in New York, said he ''expects 2013 to be the year in which the death bells ring for the commodity supercycle.'' This, he wrote, should be the first year ''in over a decade in which, broadly, commodity prices end the year lower than when the year started.''
Already this year, many commodities have built up deficits. Gold is down 16.3 percent, while silver, its less glamorous sidekick, has fallen 23.1 percent. Copper has lost 13.3 percent, and oil, 4.3 percent. The S.& P. GSCI index, which tracks a basket of commodities futures contracts, is down 7.5 percent.
If commodities don't recover together by year-end, it would be a significant reversal. From 2000 through March, gold prices rose 13.8 percent, annualized, compared with 10.9 percent for copper, 10.6 percent for oil and 9.6 percent for the S.& P. GSCI, according to Bloomberg. That's a reason Mr. Morse and some other analysts have called the long climb a supercycle.
David S. Jacks, an economics professor at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia who has analyzed more than 160 years of prices for 30 commodities, subscribes to this view. He says he has found a modest, 2 percent annualized price increase since 1950, adjusted for inflation. But he discerns supercycles within this trend. After roughly 15 years of generally upward movement, he believes that we have entered a phase of declining prices.
Like Mr. Morse and Mr. Jessop, he says that after the Asian currency crisis of the late 1990s, the explosive growth of resource-hungry emerging economies like China's helped set off a multiyear commodities price boom. And he says today's apparent slowdown in China, and signs of weakness in the global economy, have contributed to the current decline.
Mr. Jacks has found tight correlations among nearly all ''hard'' commodities -- ''those that are extracted from the ground, rather than grown on it.'' Part of this may be because of the ''financialization'' of commodities -- their inclusion in indexes and exchange-traded funds that let traders place bets by pressing a button. Agricultural commodities like wheat that are included in broad indexes like the GSCI have come to share in these price movements, he says.
Because so many commodities are finite, Mr. Jacks says, population pressures and industrial growth have given prices a modest upward long-term trend that should eventually dominate again.
MR. JESSOP agrees with some but by no means all of this. While he expects gold to recover as an alternative to currencies like the dollar, he says commodities over all are likely to decline for a while.
Low interest rates and the liquidity uncorked by the Federal Reserve and other central banks helped account for commodities' climb in recent years, he says, but asset classes like stocks now benefit more from that easy money. He says shocks from the euro zone and China are more likely to hurt commodities than equities, especially in the United States. That's because stocks ''represent a claim on the cash flow of corporations for years to come,'' he says, ''and those long-term flows aren't as economically sensitive as commodities are.''
But he does not recognize the existence of commodities supercycles.
''It's been more like a roller coaster, with booms and busts and prices moving up and down,'' he says. All else equal, he says, when prices rise, demand tends to decline and supply to increase -- leading to a glut. ''I'm not sure that I see any cycles beyond that.''
Jeremy Grantham, founder of the Boston asset management firm GMO, sees the commodities price decline as a short-term investing opportunity for individuals and for his own family foundation, which has made major donations to organizations focused on the environment, including InsideClimate News, the nonprofit that recently won a Pulitzer Prize.
Mr. Grantham says he is making long-term buys of ''good farmland and forestry and, secondly, in good stuff in the ground like oil, copper, potash and phosphate.'' He quickly adds, ''Skip coal and tar sands because they will be priced out of business.'' Natural gas, which has been plentiful and cheap in the United States, is likely to be in high demand and climb in price, he said.
Seeing the planet as endangered by climate change, he says human ingenuity must respond fast enough to stave off disaster. In the meantime, he says, crucial commodities are likely to be in scarce supply -- and he expects them to rise in value over the next decade.
''There just isn't enough of these things,'' Mr. Grantham said. ''Of that I'm confident.''

HEADLINE: Immigration and Fear

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Much of the country was still waking up to the mayhem and confusion outside Boston on Friday morning when Senator Charles Grassley decided to link the hunt for terrorist bombers to immigration reform.
''How can individuals evade authorities and plan such attacks on our soil?'' asked Mr. Grassley, the Iowa Republican, at the beginning of a hearing on the Senate's immigration bill. ''How can we beef up security checks on people who wish to enter the U.S.?''
The country is beginning to discuss seriously the most sweeping overhaul of immigration since 1986, with hearings in the Senate last week and this week, and a possible vote by early summer. After years of stalemate, the mood has shifted sharply, with bipartisan Congressional coalitions, business and labor leaders, law-enforcement and religious groups, and a majority of the public united behind a long-delayed overhaul of the crippled system. 
Until the bombing came along, the antis were running out of arguments. They cannot rail against ''illegals,'' since the bill is all about making things legal and upright, with registration, fines and fees. They cannot argue seriously that reform is bad for business: turning a shadow population of anonymous, underpaid laborers into on-the-books employees and taxpayers, with papers and workplace protections, will only help the economy grow.
About all they have left is scary aliens.
There is a long tradition of raw fear fouling the immigration debate. Lou Dobbs ranted about superhighways from Mexico injecting Spanish speakers deep into the heartland. Gov. Jan Brewer told lies about headless bodies in the Arizona desert. And now Representative Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, is warning of radical Islamists posing as Hispanics and infiltrating from the southern border.
But the Boston events have nothing to do with immigration reform. Even if we stop accepting refugees and asylum seekers, stop giving out green cards and devise a terror-profiling system that can bore into the hearts of 9-year-olds, which seems to be Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's age when he entered the United States, we will still face risks. And we will not have fixed immigration.
There is a better way to be safer: pass an immigration bill. If terrorists, drug traffickers and gangbangers are sharp needles in the immigrant haystack, then shrink the haystack. Get 11 million people on the books. Find out who they are.
The Senate bill includes no fewer than four separate background checks as immigrants move from the shadows to citizenship. It tightens the rules on employment verification and includes new ways to prevent misuse of Social Security numbers. It has an entry-exit visa system to monitor traffic at borders and ports.
And if we are serious about making America safer, why not divert some of the billions now lavished on the border to agencies fighting gangs, drugs, illegal guns and workplace abuse? Or to community policing and English-language classes, so immigrants can more readily cooperate with law enforcement? Why not make immigrants feel safer and invested in their neighborhoods, so they don't fear and shun the police? Why not stop outsourcing immigration policing to local sheriffs who chase traffic offenders and janitors?
As we have seen with the failure of gun control, a determined minority wielding false arguments can kill the best ideas. The immigration debate will test the resilience of the reform coalition in Congress. Changes so ambitious require calm, thoughtful deliberation, and a fair amount of courage. They cannot be allowed to come undone with irrelevant appeals to paranoia and fear.

HEADLINE: Big Data, Trying to Build Better Workers

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
BOSSES, as it turns out, really do matter -- perhaps far more than even they realize.
In telephone call centers, for example, where hourly workers handle a steady stream of calls under demanding conditions, the communication skills and personal warmth of an employee's supervisor are often crucial in determining the employee's tenure and performance. In fact, recent research shows that the quality of the supervisor may be more important than the experience and individual attributes of the workers themselves.
New research calls into question other beliefs. Employers often avoid hiring candidates with a history of job-hopping or those who have been unemployed for a while. The past is prologue, companies assume. There's one problem, though: the data show that it isn't so. An applicant's work history is not a good predictor of future results.
These are some of the startling findings of an emerging field called work-force science. It adds a large dose of data analysis, a k a Big Data, to the field of human resource management, which has traditionally relied heavily on gut feel and established practice to guide hiring, promotion and career planning. 
Work-force science, in short, is what happens when Big Data meets H.R.
The new discipline has its champions. ''This is absolutely the way forward,'' says Peter Cappelli, director of the Center for Human Resources at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''Most companies have been flying completely blind.''
Today, every e-mail, instant message, phone call, line of written code and mouse-click leaves a digital signal. These patterns can now be inexpensively collected and mined for insights into how people work and communicate, potentially opening doors to more efficiency and innovation within companies.
Digital technology also makes it possible to conduct and aggregate personality-based assessments, often using online quizzes or games, in far greater detail and numbers than ever before.
In the past, studies of worker behavior were typically based on observing a few hundred people at most. Today, studies can include thousands or hundreds of thousands of workers, an exponential leap ahead.
''The heart of science is measurement,'' says Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the Center for Digital Business at the Sloan School of Management at M.I.T. ''We're seeing a revolution in measurement, and it will revolutionize organizational economics and personnel economics.''
The data-gathering technology, to be sure, raises questions about the limits of worker surveillance. ''The larger problem here is that all these workplace metrics are being collected when you as a worker are essentially behind a one-way mirror,'' says Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an advocacy group. ''You don't know what data is being collected and how it is used.''
Companies view work-force data mainly as a valuable asset. Last December, for example, I.B.M. completed its $1.3 billion acquisition of Kenexa, a recruiting, hiring and training company. Kenexa's corps of more than 100 industrial organizational psychologists and researchers was one attraction, but so was its data: Kenexa surveys and assesses 40 million job applicants, workers and managers a year.
Big companies like I.B.M., Oracle and SAP are pursuing the business opportunity. So is eHarmony, the online matchmaking service. It announced in January that it would retool its algorithm for romance so it could examine employee-employer relationships, and enter the talent search business later this year.
THE penchant for digital measurement and monitoring seems most suited to hourly employment, where jobs often involve routine tasks. But will this technology also be useful in identifying and nurturing successful workers in less-regimented jobs? Many companies think so, and can point to some encouraging evidence.
Tim Geisert, chief marketing officer for I.B.M.'s Kenexa unit, observed that an outgoing personality has traditionally been assumed to be the defining trait of successful sales people. But its research, based on millions of worker surveys and tests, as well as manager assessments, has found that the most important characteristic for sales success is a kind of emotional courage, a persistence to keep going even after initially being told no.
The team of behavioral and data scientists at Knack, a Silicon Valley start-up firm, uses computer games and constant measurement to test emotional intelligence, cognitive skills, working memory and propensity for risk-taking. Early pilot testers include the NYU Langone Medical Center, Bain & Company and a unit of Shell, says Guy Halfteck, Knack's C.E.O.
Google, not surprisingly, is committed to applying data-driven decision-making to human resource management. For years, candidates were screened according to SAT scores and college grade-point averages, metrics favored by its founders. But numbers and grades alone did not prove to spell success at Google and are no longer used as important hiring criteria, says Prasad Setty, vice president for people analytics.
Since 2007, the company has conducted extensive surveys of its work force. Google has found that the most innovative workers -- also the ''happiest,'' by its definition -- are those who have a strong sense of mission about their work and who also feel that they have much personal autonomy. ''Our people decisions are no less important than our product decisions,'' Mr. Setty says. ''And we're trying to apply the same rigor to the people side as to the engineering side.''
Evolv, a San Francisco start-up, uses data science to advise companies on hiring and managing hourly workers. Evolv is sharing its data from clients -- data that are stripped of personally identifying information and demographics like race and sex -- with researchers at Wharton, Yale and Stanford. (This column's first two examples came from Evolv's data and analysis.)
Michael Housman, an economist and managing director of analytics at Evolv, says he thinks work-force science will increasingly be applied across the spectrum of jobs and professions, building profits, productivity, innovation and worker satisfaction.
Evolv, he says, has focused initially on hourly workers and call centers, which capture masses of data on every call and online exchange. Jobs at these centers are often difficult and have very high rates of attrition, routinely as high as 100 percent a year. ''We wanted to start where there was a huge opportunity'' to make improvements, he says.
Transcom, a global operator of customer-service call centers, conducted a pilot project in the second half of 2012, using Evolv's data analysis technology. To look for a trait like honesty, candidates might be asked how comfortable they are working on a personal computer and whether they know simple keyboard shortcuts for a cut-and-paste task. If they answer yes, the applicants will later be asked to perform that task.
Those who score high on honesty typically stay in their jobs 20 to 30 percent longer than those who don't, Evolv says.
Neil Rae, an executive vice president of Transcom, was impressed with the project's results and plans to use Evolv in the call centers he runs, which employ 12,500 workers.
In the call-center world, Mr. Rae says, 5 percent attrition a month -- 60 percent a year -- is stellar performance. Dropout rates are calculated at 30-day intervals, and it takes four to six weeks to train a worker. The cost of attrition -- for hiring and training a replacement -- is about $1,500 a worker, he says.
In the project with Evolv, Mr. Rae says, Transcom was able to hire fewer people -- about 800 instead of a more typical 1,000 hires -- to get 500 workers who were still on the job at least three months later. The big payoff, he says, should come in cost savings and better customer service with less worker churn in call centers.
''This makes hiring more a science and less subjective,'' Mr. Rae says.

HEADLINE: Before Housing Bubbles, There Was Land Fever

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.

 BODY:
SINCE 1997, we have lived through the biggest real estate bubble in United States history -- followed by the most calamitous decline in housing prices that the country has ever seen.
Fundamental factors like inflation and construction costs affect home prices, of course. But the radical shifts in housing prices in recent years were caused mainly by investor-induced speculation.
Anyone contemplating the purchase of a home wants an idea of where prices will be when it is eventually time to sell, perhaps many years later. For that kind of long-term forecasting, we need to understand the reasons for the recent, violent price cycle, and whether it is likely to repeat itself.
History has much to teach us about real estate bubbles, and some of it is reassuring. The land booms of New York State in the 1790s, Kansas in the 1850s, California in the 1880s and Florida in the 1920s all appear to have been relatively isolated events. And the cycle was not repeated in short order. 
But those events were fundamentally different from the recent housing bubble. As relatively local phenomena, involving a fairly small number of adventurers, they did not consume most people's attention. And a major cause can be easily identified: they developed from the promotion of supposedly valuable lots of land.
In fact, outside of New York City and a few urban centers, most speculators in past decades didn't focus much on home prices. The term ''housing bubble'' was not even in their vocabulary. Land, not houses, was the object of their desires. They had ''land mania'' or ''land fever.''
In a 1932 book, ''The Great American Land Bubble,'' Aaron M. Sakolski offers a vivid history of these manias, going back hundreds of years. There were repeated examples of promoters creating land subdivisions with vaunted plans for development, and advertising campaigns to sell them to investors.
As president in the 1790s, George Washington helped promote the sale of lots in his namesake capital city, and even bought some himself. Earlier in his life, he was a surveyor, and in 1763, he was a founder of the Mississippi Land Company, which was to acquire land, survey and subdivide it, and sell off individual farm and town plots to settlers. While his involvement in the development of Washington, D.C., was ultimately successful, his earlier company failed.
Land fevers tend to have a definite starting point and vector of contagion: they begin when a promoter subdivides land into lots small enough for many investors, and are usually accompanied by an advertising blitz with glowing descriptions of the future town and country, setting off a buzz and speculative excitement.
The Florida land bubble of the 1920s provided a turning point in public opinion, thanks to newspaper reporting around the country that made it clear that a mania was being artfully promoted. Anne O'Hare McCormick wrote in The New York Times in 1925: ''What impressed me most was that every jungle and swamp and palmetto hummock from Lake City to Key West is staked out in city lots and offered for sale as building sites.'' Such colorful writing can have a lasting impact. Many people now remember the image of the trusting Northerner unwittingly buying a lot in a Florida swamp. And the whole enterprise of subdivision, advertising and promotion of empty lots for sale, which made the manias possible, faded.
Shady operators were called purveyors of ''premature subdivisions'' and ''defunct subdivisions.'' Local regulators came to demand that development plans were at least intended to produce homes that people would actually live in, not sham operations to defraud ignorant investors.
The first widely documented, nationwide speculative fever attached to single-family homes, as opposed to lots, was in the housing boom of 1943 to 1950. But home prices remained relatively quiet for many years thereafter. Starting in the 1970s, home price bubbles became more frequent and severe. By the end of the 20th century, housing speculation became at least a pastime for many Americans.
THE great housing bubble of the 2000s was diffused widely through the population and didn't owe its beginnings to any single promotional scheme. The bubble became so big apparently because of a number of kinds of financial promotion -- of subprime mortgages, no-down-payment mortgages, securitized mortgages and other innovations.
It was also driven by confusion about supply: people without much experience with housing bubbles seemed to accept the old real estate argument that because land is finite, its price must rise. And they may have thought that when they bought a home, they were primarily investing in land.
If so, they were wrong, but not by as much as they would have been in previous decades. According to a 2007 study by Morris Davis of the University of Wisconsin and Jonathan Heathcote of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, the share of nonfarm home value accounted for by land rose to 36.4 percent in 2000 from 15.3 percent in 1930. In an update, they put the percentage at 23.7 percent in the third quarter of 2012.
In fact, except in some densely populated areas, the value of a home has always been mostly in the structure, not the land. But because land's fraction was rising until recently, people may have been deluded into thinking that investments in housing and land were one and the same.
By 2000, many people appeared to have forgotten that when home prices rise sharply, builders are likely to increase the supply, which tends to bring prices back down. We had such a supply response in the 2000s, and with a vengeance. In the near future, at least, while a speculative investing culture may re-emerge among homeowners, it is likely to be tempered by the memory of crashing prices.
Housing prices themselves aren't the only speculative factors relevant to the housing market. Speculation in the bond or mortgage market counts as well.
Interest rates have been declining for decades now. Clearly, that cannot continue on the same track for another 10 years, because rates would have to turn negative.
But, of course, inflation can rise -- and it's easy to imagine that both it and interest rates will rise substantially, creating a bonanza for home buyers who have already locked in low rates. And because rates are so low now, they could climb a lot once they turn.
In short, it's quite possible that the next decade might bear a resemblance to the 1960s or '70s, when inflation and interest rates kept surprising people on the upside, culminating in 18 percent rates on 30-year mortgages in 1981, and inflation that was almost as high.
Homeowners did very well if they bought in 1960 or 1970, locked in low fixed-rate mortgages and saw the nominal values of their homes soar while their real mortgage balances declined. (Buyers since then have generally not fared as spectacularly.)
A more moderate path is also possible: without going back to the extremes of the '60s or '70s, higher fixed-rate mortgage rates might return.
With rates now relatively low, this could be an auspicious time to buy a house with a fixed-rate mortgage. That could make good sense for people who aren't out to bet on the housing or mortgage markets but are instead focused on settling into a home for the long term.

HEADLINE: Need Motivation? Declare A Deadline

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
AT a meeting last Tuesday, I told my colleagues that I would finish this column -- which is about deadlines -- by noon on Thursday. I spent part of Tuesday afternoon searching the word ''deadlines'' on Google, but didn't make much progress. By late afternoon, I felt a tiny knot of fear in my stomach. What if I let my co-workers down? So I wrote something silly just to get started. This paragraph.
During my Googling I found out that Dan Ariely is an expert on deadlines, and I forced myself to contact him because I had promised to get this work done. 
Making that declaration was a good move, as it turns out. Publicly committing to meeting a deadline is a powerful motivator because it puts your reputation on the line, said Mr. Ariely, a professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University and the author of ''Predictably Irrational.''
Workers who fail to meet deadlines risk the disapproval -- and sometimes the wrath -- of their managers and colleagues. Still, some people will blow a deadline, rationalizing that there is both a ''deadline'' and a ''real deadline.'' They will use whatever devices and excuses they can muster to buy more time.
But what about assignments that don't have clear deadlines? Or projects that are so large that they must be done in increments, so that pulling an all-nighter isn't an option? Or creative goals that no one much cares about, except you?
I know people who, through boundless narcissism, single-minded obsession or unfathomable self-discipline can complete big projects without deadlines. Many of us, though, need a looming threat to finish major work.
People respond well to deadlines because meeting them provides a distinct feeling of having achieved something within a time frame. ''It's a good way to keep score,'' Professor Ariely said.
It is possible to motivate yourself, he said, by announcing a deadline to others -- perhaps on Facebook or on Twitter. Not meeting the deadline would then feel like breaking a promise, he said: ''It does say something about your character.''
A mere announcement on Twitter, though, would hardly be enough for die-hard procrastinators. If you are one of them, consider creating a situation that has real consequences, Professor Ariely said. Give a friend $100 and say, ''If I don't meet my deadline you can keep this.'' Or, he said, try the prospect of public humiliation. Make a bet with your friends: if you don't meet the deadline, you must run through the streets naked.
Perhaps Professor Ariely has friends who really would force him to run naked through the streets of Durham, N.C. My friends are warm and supportive and would say ''that's O.K.'' if I didn't meet my self-imposed deadline, which, of course, makes them wonderful friends but not good enforcers.
I have always wanted to write a book, however, and it occurs to me: Why not hire someone to hector me? Services like TaskRabbit have sprung up to help people with all manner of tasks, including fixing their computers and doing their laundry. Surely a stranger would be willing, for a small fee, to call or text me and say: ''Have you written those 500 words you said you would write by 8 a.m.?'' It's worth a try. A shaming e-mail if I don't do my assignment should be included in the price.
Here may be the secret to meeting a big self-imposed deadline: First, divide the work into smaller tasks and set deadlines for every one of them. Then find a tough and reliable person to hold you accountable for meeting each one. Make meeting the big deadline -- not achieving perfection -- the ultimate goal. Voilà. You're making no guarantees of quality, but perhaps your work can be improved later.
THIS column, for example, is nowhere near as good as it was as a vague idea in my mind's eye. There's so much more I wanted to cover, including the etymology of the word ''deadline.'' (O.K., I'll throw it in: It was formerly ''a boundary around a military prison beyond which a prisoner could not venture without risk of being shot by the guards,'' according to Dictionary.com.)
I wanted to discuss the link between death and deadlines, and whether death awareness affects people at work, a topic that has been explored by Prof. Adam Grant, an organizational psychologist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
But I ran out of time, and that's the point. This column -- inferior though it is to what I had imagined -- is done, and it's done because I had a deadline.

READING FOR MY LIFE: Writings, 1958-2008, by John Leonard. Edited by Sue Leonard. (Penguin, $18.) These are exuberant essays and reviews by the cultural critic (and onetime Book Review editor), who died in 2008 -- from his earliest columns for the Harvard Crimson to his final writings for The New York Review of Books. It includes reflections on Joan Didion, Don DeLillo and Toni Morrison, as well as tributes to Leonard by friends and colleagues. 
INSIDE, by Alix Ohlin. (Vintage Contemporaries, $15.) Set in New York, Montreal, Kigali and elsewhere, Ohlin's novel consists of interconnected stories about people trapped in their own hermetic worlds: a therapist rescues a man attempting suicide only to fall in love with him; a desperate divorcé leaves one hopeless situation for another.
ARE YOU MY MOTHER?: A Comic Drama, written and illustrated by Alison Bechdel. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $15.95.) In her previous book, ''Fun Home,'' Bechdel, creator of the comic strip ''Dykes to Watch Out For,'' told the story of her father's secret homosexuality, thwarted artistic expression and suicide -- and of her own coming out in college. Here she delves into her relationship with her distant, unhappy mother, and into her difficulties with a series of girlfriends.
NORUMBEGA PARK, by Anthony Giardina. (Picador, $16.) When Richie Palumbo drives past a venerable old house in the Boston suburbs in 1969, he decides he must have it. His dream sets the Palumbos -- the Italian-American family at the center of Giardina's heartfelt novel -- on a 40-year journey as they navigate the nuances of class, sex and spirituality.
THE RICHER SEX: How the New Majority of Female Breadwinners Is Transforming Our Culture, by Liza Mundy. (Free Press, $16.)

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Gas Drilling and Our Energy Future

 BODY:
Readers discuss whether natural gas from shale is a promising resource or a misguided risk.
To the Editor:
Several states, including New York, are now considering whether to permit hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in areas under their authority. Fracking has made important changes to the American energy budget but has also raised significant concerns about environmental impacts.
The resulting natural gas production has lowered natural gas prices and reduced American dependence on foreign oil. Yet videos of residents near fracking operations setting their kitchen faucets on fire because of methane gas in the drinking water are routinely summoned to condemn the technology.
A reasonable case can be made that the gas resource is too important to ignore, but also that the environmental issues are too important to dismiss. The country must find a way to make this technology work in an environmentally sound way. 
Groundwater is notoriously difficult to clean up once it has been contaminated. Fracking advocates assure the rest of us that their technology is foolproof and completely benign environmentally, but we all know how hollow those assurances can ring when something inevitably goes wrong. A peculiarity of fracking from a federal regulatory standpoint is that, like other oil and gas industries, it is exempt from compliance with key environmental requirements of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act.
As we approach Earth Day on April 22, clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, and clean lakes and rivers are as important as ever. So what can states such as New York do to permit fracking but also assure the public of its safety?
I think that they should challenge the industry to live up to its boasts about how environmentally friendly fracking is. States should adopt their own regulations that mirror the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act and require fracking operations to comply, regardless of any federal exemptions.
RICHARD POETON Bennington, Vt., April 15, 2013
The writer is a retired environmental scientist for the Environmental Protection Agency.
Readers React
Mr. Poeton asks the wrong question. The issue is not what we can do ''to permit fracking but also assure the public of its safety.'' The issue is rather whether fracking can be done safely at all. In framing the question as he does, Mr. Poeton pre-emptively rules out a growing body of evidence that there may be no such thing as safe fracking.
Research by Prof. Robert Howarth and colleagues at Cornell finds that fugitive methane emissions from natural gas production, almost impossible to eliminate, may be a worse greenhouse gas problem than carbon dioxide, and may even lead to runaway global warming. This is only the most ominous finding that suggests it is foolish to presume that this dangerous procedure can be done safely.
ADRIAN KUZMINSKI Fly Creek, N.Y., April 17, 2013
The writer is the founder of Sustainable Otsego, an advocacy group.
Fracking for gas has not reduced America's dependence on foreign oil as we don't use natural gas in our cars or oil to produce electricity. This common and incorrect assertion is a window into other false propaganda claims about fracking for gas.
The gas companies continue to deny that there has been even one instance of groundwater contamination from fracking -- despite multiple proofs of this happening in Texas, Wyoming, Pennsylvania and other states.
The claim that fracking for gas is better for the climate is also proving false as so much methane leaks from the wells, pipelines and the fracking process itself that it negates any climate advantage over coal. Methane is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide for decades.
Most of all, industry and Pennsylvania state studies prove that these wells leak and crack -- 6 percent of them immediately, and more than 50 percent over time. This cannot be prevented by regulation or fixed after it occurs.
America should reject these false claims for fracking and pursue energy efficiency and clean energy instead.
MARK RUFFALO New York, April 18, 2013
Mr. Ruffalo, the actor, is writing on behalf of Artists Against Fracking.
A common assumption is that developing natural gas from shale -- including the use of hydraulic fracturing -- has economic and geopolitical benefits, but they come at the cost of the environment. Like so much written about the oil and gas industry, this is not true.
Air quality has improved significantly thanks to increased use of natural gas, a growing share of which is coming from shale. The Environmental Protection Agency recently reported that because of natural gas replacing dirtier fuels for power generation, air pollution in the mid-Atlantic region had declined by 14 percent. Greenhouse gas emissions have also fallen to a 20-year low thanks to natural gas.
Additionally, horizontal drilling allows companies to access as much energy from a single well that used to require a dozen vertical wells. Thus, modern shale development is allowing us to produce more energy with a substantially smaller environmental footprint.
Shale development has brought new jobs and renewed hope to communities across the country, and New York should welcome those opportunities. But we should also recognize the significant environmental benefits of responsible development -- a story that, unfortunately, often goes untold.
LEE FULLER Washington, April 17, 2013
The writer is executive director of Energy in Depth, a research and public education program of the Independent Petroleum Association of America.
Mr. Poeton makes the case that natural gas ''is too important to ignore,'' summoning up arguments that allow the industry to frame the debate.
It is true that the nation's energy budget has been changed by fracking -- unfortunately, by forgoing renewable energy resources in favor of a limited energy resource.
It is also true that gas prices are lower. Supply and demand determine price, so of course the gas is cheaper now that there is a surplus due to intensive drilling all over the country.
But regarding his assertion that fracking has reduced America's dependence on foreign oil, I'd like to point out that many pipelines are not installed for domestic consumption but for exporting natural gas overseas.
It is time to abandon industry talking points and focus on the issues that are of most importance. Then we could have a real discussion about the safety of fracking.
ALICE JOYCE Brooklyn, April 17, 2013
I would like to direct readers' attention to the recent creation of the Center for Sustainable Shale Development, a collaborative effort of energy companies (including Chevron and Consol Energy), environmental organizations (including the Environmental Defense Fund and the Pennsylvania Environmental Council) and philanthropic foundations for safe, environmentally responsible shale resource development.
This group is cooperating to develop rigorous performance standards for air and climate and surface and groundwater. Such cooperation between respected participants with different agendas is a worthwhile step in the fracking debate.
PETER H. SPITZ Scarsdale, N.Y., April 17, 2013
Mr. Poeton addresses only the immediate problem of fracking and water safety, without mentioning the many other problems associated with fracking. Should fracking come to our town in the Catskills, for example, a rural area will be transformed into an industrial site. Hundreds of trucks will continuously travel back and forth, 24 hours a day, on what are currently lightly traveled small town and county roads (whose maintenance is paid for by town and county taxes).
For the drilling itself, millions of gallons of water will be drawn from our rivers and aquifers. Anyone who assumes that natural gas is ''clean'' and comes without a price has been sold a bill of goods by the gas industry.
Moreover, for many of us who own homes near well sites or the roads to and from them, property values will decline precipitously. Once the wells run dry and the drillers depart -- the inevitable endgame of this boom-and-bust industry -- lingering fear about the safety of the land and water will make it unlikely that anyone would want to purchase homes or property anywhere near previous well sites.
Is this really where we want to go?
LAURIE FENDRICH Callicoon Center, N.Y., April 17, 2013
Having spent a number of years as a drilling engineer in Texas and Oklahoma, I have seen the exploration and completion process close up, and I am deeply conflicted about horizontal fracking.
It is absolutely true that ''a reasonable case can be made that the gas resource is too important to ignore.'' But I also agree that ''the environmental issues are too important to dismiss.'' The ocean is far more resilient than any groundwater aquifer, and exploration and completion of wells are in the best of circumstances fraught with risk and the unexpected. If any of the myriad things that can go wrong do go wrong, it can have a major environmental impact.
The key is systems that are fail-safe and with multiple redundancies, coupled with monitoring and swift, certain enforcement. The states, with far more experience and far more competence than the federal government, still need to review and upgrade their regulations and adequately finance the monitoring and enforcement.
Likewise, exploration firms need to realize that it is in their best interest to adopt all the safeguards possible. We saw what can happen, in the Deepwater Horizon disaster, when human error and equipment failure met shoddy quality control and rampant shortcutting.
ERIC W. ZEPP McKinney, Tex., April 17, 2013
Until there is absolutely no risk to our water, fracking should be banned. We already have vast amounts of ''natural'' gas that can be produced from city sewage and from livestock waste. These resources are far from glamorous, but would provide renewable energy far into the future and would also serve double duty in cleaning up the huge ''reservoirs'' of organic pollutants that our animal-eating society constantly produces.
ED TEMPLE Brooklyn, April 17, 2013
For many of us who own property on the Marcellus Shale formation, it is too late for responsible legislation. The wells have already been drilled, and our groundwater has already been subjected to the unidentified and unregulated chemicals pumped into the earth as part of the fracking process.
The financial incentives that the companies offered to the residents of less affluent regions were often too good to pass up. These companies came in and seduced property owners into signing complicated leases that many of them did not fully understand, possibly forfeiting the right to avail themselves of whatever legal action might be taken under laws passed in the future.
NANCY REHM Gettysburg, Pa., April 17, 2013
The Writer Responds
Several readers, including Mr. Kuzminski and Mr. Ruffalo, make the point that there is no such thing as safe fracking. It is true that everything we do, particularly when it comes to energy production, has some kind of environmental or social impact. The real questions are how to minimize the impacts and whether the consequences are worth the costs: economic, social and environmental.
Others, like Mr. Fuller, suggest that it is possible to have natural gas development without significant environmental impacts. While Mr. Fuller points out some ways in which shale gas may be less objectionable when compared to other sources, the fact remains that it has significant environmental detriments that need to be considered.
Still others, including Ms. Joyce, take issue with my premise that the gas resource is too important to ignore. Currently the big alternatives for energy sources (coal, oil and nuclear power) all have substantial environmental costs, too. We can decide not to allow fracking, but we can't ignore the choices that confront us. Would we rather have fracking, or level a mountaintop for the coal?
I am not advocating that any particular state allow fracking. For states that do, however, I propose that the rules be more rigorous than they currently are. Environmental regulations are necessary to assure the public that someone is watching polluters and keeping their impacts within defined limits. Mr. Spitz points out an interesting initiative in this regard.
If the fracking industry is as clean as it claims, it should have no trouble meeting new strict requirements to limit its damage. Tough regulations should go along with tough choices.

HEADLINE: Nick Cave's Unlikely Muse

BYLINE: By DAVE ITZKOFF, MAUD NEWTON, MARK LEIBOVICH, ELIOT GLAZER, MARNIE HANEL, MARIO BATALI, LIZZIE SKURNICK, DAVID VECSEY, ERIC SPITZNAGEL, JOHN HODGMAN, ROBERT IRVINE and TYLER COWEN

The Big Profile By Dave Itzkoff
The apocalypse that Nick Cave's music has hinted at might really be coming, now that he has name-checked Miley Cyrus and her former alter ego, Hannah Montana, on a song from his new album, ''Push the Sky Away.'' ''The benign image of her lying in a swimming pool in Toluca Lake has a dark, resonating idea that's synonymous with spiritual collapse, at least to me,'' Cave explains. ''The journey in this particular song is witnessing a series of spiritual collapses in the world, up until the present day. Although, obviously, Hannah Montana isn't the present present anymore.''

Garden of Eatin' By Maud Newton
The nation's largest ''food forest'' will begin bearing fruit, herbs, vegetables and nuts this summer in Beacon Hill, a gentrifying Seattle neighborhood once populated largely by factory workers. The food will be free for the taking. ''People are, like, 'What if homeless people come and eat it all?' '' one of the project's designers, Jenny Pell, told Seattle Magazine. ''My biggest dream is that it all gets eaten.''
Inside Baseball By David Vecsey
With the Mets mired in their post-Madoff recession, it might seem like piling on that Christopher Frankie -- a Mets fan, writer and former employee of Lenny Dykstra's -- would release ''Nailed!'' which details the professional and personal misdeeds that landed their iconic, chaw-chewing outfielder in prison. But if not now, when? ''I don't know if waiting for the next Mets championship would have been the best marketing plan,'' Frankie says.
Washington Monuments Will-ary? By Mark Leibovich
Guns, immigration and other important issues only distract from the one thing that matters in D.C. right now: When is Hillary Clinton announcing her presidential run? It hardly matters whether she wants to or not, because her candidacy is already central to the 2016 narrative, meaning absolutely nothing can stop it -- except maybe an awesome counternarrative. And that would make for some metanarrative, huh?
What I'm Drinking Now By Mario Batali
You can't go wrong betting on mint juleps for Derby Day. Take a bunch of fresh mint, chop it up and put it in a pan with 2 cups each sugar and water, heating it to a boil. Then chill and strain. Muddle 9 leaves of fresh mint with 2 oz. of the syrup in a frosted tumbler. Fill with ice then pour Kentucky bourbon to the top and stir -- and you're off!

Judge John Hodgman Rules By John Hodgman
JOLENE WRITES: One of my employees, Tyler, 21, claims Maroon 5 is ''the band of our generation.'' Tyler is welcome to love Maroon 5, but I think it is unacceptable to make such a claim. This court enjoys youthful hyperbole, but Tyler is deranged, and not merely because he is talking about Maroon 5. Even if our splintered culture allowed for such a thing, how could Maroon 5 be the band of his generation? Not only have I heard of this rock band, it is also a rock band that is played on Top 40 radio. That's as old-timey and esoteric a genre as steampunk bluegrass -- something I am confident exists.

How To Cook as a Family By Robert Irvine
Make it interactive. When my 11-year-old was 3, I had her cutting tomatoes with one of the sharpest knives I've ever used. People were like, ''Oh, no, she can't pick up that knife.'' But if you supervise and teach kids, it's amazing. It's so much fun to put a chef's jacket on a young child and make them feel important. As told to Spencer Bailey

LENGTH: 1271 words

HEADLINE: A Sporty Declaration of Independence

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
Mazda has fallen from Ford's financial nest -- the Detroit giant having sold the stake that once gave it control -- and must now feed itself.
The small scale of the fierce-yet-fragile Japanese independent, struggling to hang onto roughly 2 percent of the American market, will be a never-ending challenge as it tries to compete with global empires like Toyota, General Motors, Volkswagen and Ford itself.
The redesigned 2014 Mazda 6 seems to show evidence of that strain, but also the upside of the company's emotional, uncompromising approach to engineering.
Automakers like Toyota and Hyundai don't care to be reminded, but Mazdas almost always handle and perform better than more pedestrian rivals. Yet typical mass-market buyers don't put much stock in performance, choosing Toyota Camrys and other dull-but-reliable cars by wide margins over Mazda's medal-winning counterparts. 
Perhaps counterintuitively, Mazda's worst failures have come when it has tried to out-Toyota Toyota, forsaking sporty principles and settling for the middle ground.
The Mazda 6 has been a great example. The first-generation sedan of 2003 was lauded as a midsize benchmark, and by Mazda standards, it posted excellent sales. One notable criticism was that the back seat was a bit tight.
So Mazda gave in to mass-market temptation for the redesign of the 2009 model. It pumped up the 6 to the size of a Honda Accord, with handling that seemed as unrecognizable as the car itself. Sales plunged and have never recovered.
Now Mazda regroups with a mildly scaled-down 6 for 2014. The car is a looker again, a shapely adaptation of the Takeri concept car that made the rounds of international auto shows.
Production has moved to Japan as Mazda wrapped up a quarter-century of building cars alongside Fords in Flat Rock, Mich.
And Mazda's personality shines clearly, with an all-new chassis, transmissions and engines, including an advanced 2.2-liter Skyactiv-D diesel that will go on sale later this year. That will make Mazda, long associated with rotary engines, the first Japanese brand to offer a modern clean-diesel passenger car in America. Mazda has been coy on mileage, but the diesel version should breeze past 40 miles a gallon on the highway.
Keeping its priorities straight, Mazda has lavished resources on the mechanicals. The new 6 delivers that familiar Mazda connectedness, but with a pronounced improvement in fuel economy, historically a sore spot for this brand. The gasoline version, with a 2.5-liter direct-injection 4-cylinder, has a thrifty economy rating of 26 m.p.g. in town and 38 on the highway, with its redesigned 6-speed automatic transmission. That's up from a mere 21/30 m.p.g. for the departing model.
The new engine, designed to run on regular gas, also has 184 horsepower and 185 pound-feet of torque, up from 170 and 167 in the obsolete 2.5 liter of last year.
Like many of its rivals, the 6 no longer offers a V-6 option.
Tech tricks abound, though, including extremely high compression that improves efficiency.
The automatic transmission incorporates both a conventional torque converter for silky low-speed operation and a single automated clutch for decisive gear changes -- which can be made with paddle shifters behind the steering wheel. Naturally, Mazda has kept the stick-shift faith, offering its fine new 6-speed manual on all but the top-level Grand Touring.
The 6 is the first car in America to capture energy in a fast-charging capacitor with no rare-earth metals, rather than a slower, bulkier and harder-to-recycle battery. Lift off the gas, and the optional i-Eloop system spins the alternator to charge the capacitor in eight seconds flat. The stored juice -- roughly 2,000 watts -- then powers the electric system and accessories. E.V. and laptop users, take note: unlike lithium-ion batteries, Mazda's capacitor is designed to charge and discharge millions of times with no loss of storage capacity.
Yet for all of its prowess, Mazda's relatively small financial basket suggests that there are only so many eggs to go around. For the cabin, Mazda needs to break a few more eggs.
Don't get me wrong: the 6 puts its driver in perfect alignment with the steering wheel and controls. The seats and forward visibility are excellent. The trunk officially measures a modest 14.8 cubic feet, but it feels cavernous in daily use. An 18.5-gallon fuel tank lets the Mazda cover 600 highway miles between fill-ups.
The Mazda also keeps up with the gadget-obsessed Joneses. Owners can choose a smooth-running adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warning, forward collision alert system, blind-spot monitors, rear cross-traffic detection and headlamps that automatically switch between low and high beams.
But compared with, say, the lavish Honda Accord or Hyundai Sonata, the 6 feels as if it's playing catch-up inside. That begins with the amateurish TomTom navigation system and its scrawny, inscrutable 5.8-inch screen. The optional system is mediocre enough if you've programmed a destination; when you haven't, it's the bane of lost travelers, often failing to label streets, cities and even freeways.
Worse, the design pizazz of the exterior is missing inside. I'm all for minimal cabins, but the Mazda seems as featureless as the nighttime prairie, and some wobbly-feeling switches don't help. In comparison, a Chevy Malibu is a paragon of texture and daring.
The rotary console controller halfheartedly mimics those in a dozen other cars. And who, among Mazda's red-blooded engineers and executives, signed off on those wimpy gauges? With a generic font and pale white lighting, the display is perfect for a Chinese minivan, but not suited for this driver's car.
Fortunately, beyond the cabin lies the most dynamic, assertive driver's car in the midsize realm. The chassis is far stiffer, and 58 percent of the body is high-tensile steel, holding the base model's weight to barely 3,100 pounds.
Electrically assisted steering, fast becoming a universal fuel saver, has damped the response of even six-figure cars. But Mazda's system feels attuned to every road nuance, with a steering ratio that's nearly as fast as the Miata convertible's. The front wheels' caster angle is more acute than in any front-drive rival, more even than the Mazda's late, fondly remembered RX-8 sports car, another contributor to the 6's right-now reactions.
Flirting with two-lane roads in upstate New York, the Mazda caressed every curve, showing excellent grip -- almost too much, considering its modest power -- from optional 19-inch wheels and tires. Pushed hard, the back end eventually bobbles. But it takes serious pushing to remind you that the 6 is intended for families, not just drivers.
The 2.5-liter engine, while adequate by class standards, elicits less excitement. The engine works to make speed, emits a gassy bleat and barely revs to 6,200 r.p.m. before running out of steam. But that is apparently the price to pay for major fuel savings. (Enthusiasts can cross their fingers and hope that a more powerful, tightly wound Mazdaspeed 6 is in the works).
The price starts at $21,675 for a Mazda 6 Sport with a 6-speed manual transmission. Moving up, the automatic Touring version starts at $25,290. The chart-topping Grand Touring costs $30,290. Come summer, a new Advanced Package will be offered for $2,080, adding the various collision warnings and monitors, adaptive cruise and high-beam systems, and the i-Eloop regenerative system.
Graft the Accord's interior into this handsome, frisky and frugal Mazda, and the result could be the world's leading family sedan. For now, Mazda 6 buyers will have to settle for the sportiest.

 BODY:
You have to imagine what it was like being Don Carcieri in the harsh winter of 2010. As Rhode Island's governor, a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic state, he had come into office seven years earlier as a business executive turned politician, vowing to retool the state's corroded economy.
But that winter, Rhode Island was on the precipice of economic ruin. Its unemployment rate was pushing up against 12 percent -- fourth worst in the nation -- and three of its cities were careening toward bankruptcy. Facing term limits, Mr. Carcieri had only months left to do something to arrest the steep decline.
And that's when Don Carcieri ran into Curt Schilling, the revered former Boston Red Sox ace -- the man who had famously bled through a sock while pitching his team to its first World Series title in 86 years. That March, Mr. Carcieri attended a fund-raiser for a prospective documentary at Mr. Schilling's 25-acre estate in Medfield, Mass. The two men exchanged pleasantries in the living room before the talk turned abruptly to business. 
''I said, 'Well, what are you doing?' '' Mr. Carcieri recalled when I met him recently, at a Panera Bread in East Greenwich, R.I., his hometown. ''And he said, 'I've got this business, this company, creating video games.' Which I knew nothing about -- my grandkids know more about it than I do. But he was describing it. He said: 'It's a great little company, it's growing,' et cetera. And he was looking to grow it further.''
More to the point, Mr. Schilling let drop that he wasn't getting much help in Massachusetts when it came to the financing he needed to expand, and he was frustrated. You can imagine the heralding trumpets that must have been blasting in Mr. Carcieri's ears as he listened to Mr. Schilling dangle hundreds of jobs in front of him.
Within a few weeks, Mr. Schilling, a novice in the gaming field, was wowing other local politicians with his outsize presence and his grand ambitions to build a Microsoft-like behemoth. And soon Rhode Island's lawmakers were rushing to approve a deal to make the state Mr. Schilling's angel investor. The tiny, struggling state issued $75 million in bonds so that Mr. Schilling's company, called 38 Studios, could relocate to Providence and unleash the world's next killer fantasy game.
Ideas that seem plausible in our darkest moments often seem plainly flawed in hindsight, and you can probably see where all this is going. A little more than two years after Mr. Carcieri first talked to Mr. Schilling about 38 Studios -- so named for his baseball uniform number -- the company went bankrupt, blowing a sizable hole in the state's already strained finances. And now Mr. Schilling's headquarters on Empire Street, the brick building just a few blocks from the Capitol that was supposed to prompt a high-tech urban renaissance, sits locked and abandoned, like some ugly monument to political folly.
Politicians are debating whether Rhode Island can afford to repay the bondholders, or whether it should simply default. Because the bonds are what's known as moral obligation bonds, the state doesn't technically have to repay them, but its credit rating could take a hit, and Mr. Carcieri's successor as governor, Lincoln D. Chafee, has promised that the bondholders would be repaid. Mr. Chafee is also suing Mr. Schilling and his partners, along with a raft of former state officials, banks and law firms involved in the deal, and a criminal investigation is under way.
Even in a state that long served as New England's Mafia headquarters -- and a state whose best-known modern political figure, Buddy Cianci, the former Providence mayor, was sent to prison in a federal corruption case known as Operation Plunder Dome -- the 38 Studios debacle has registered as a painful embarrassment. (When I called influential Rhode Islanders and told them I was writing about 38 Studios, virtually all of them, even if they had opposed the deal, answered with some version of, ''Do you have to?'')
Rhode Islanders are used to being played by their politicians. What makes them cringe is the suspicion that virtually all their elected leaders might have been played by someone else.
A Beguiling Vision
It may be hard to understand how all of this happened without understanding the ancient, one-sided rivalry that exists between Rhode Island, a state of just 1,000 square miles, and Massachusetts, which squeezes Rhode Island on two sides like a vise. Massachusetts is the land of the Red Sox and the Kennedys; Rhode Island makes do with the Red Sox' Class AAA affiliate in Pawtucket and has a history of rampant political corruption.
Going back to the 1980s, Massachusetts developed a high-tech corridor near Cambridge that enabled it to transcend its manufacturing roots. Rhode Island remained stubbornly wedded to its textile makers and jewelry factories, most of them now long gone or crumbling.
So when Curt Schilling came courting in the weeks after his encounter with Mr. Carcieri, it wasn't just the promise of jobs that caught the attention of the state's political establishment. Here was one of Boston's greatest living legends, a proven winner who had sunk something like $50 million of his own fortune into his company, and he was looking to build it not in Kendall Square of Cambridge, but near the old Jewelry District of Providence. If ever there was a way to show up the Bay Staters next door, this had to be it.
''It just felt really good, when this all started, to have the sexy sports celebrity from Boston who seemed to like Rhode Island and showed up in Rhode Island, and who built this exotic new business, even though no one knew what it was,'' says the historian Ted Widmer, who grew up in Providence and works at Brown. ''It seemed like the digital economy, or biotech, or whatever. But then it turned out that it wasn't the new digital economy. It was some 13-year-old's medieval fantasy.''
That's not really an accurate assessment of Mr. Schilling's start-up, but neither is it entirely off base. (Mr. Schilling declined to talk to me about 38 Studios, citing the continuing litigation; in an e-mail, he called the state's case against him ''wholly without merit and literally 100 percent baseless.'') An avid gamer when he wasn't on a mound, Mr. Schilling dreamed up 38 Studios near the end of his playing days back in 2006, according to a Harvard Business School case study written in 2009.
From the start, his goal was to build what gamers call an MMORPG -- for a massively multiplayer online role-playing game -- along the lines of the crazily popular ''World of Warcraft,'' and to get what he called ''Bill Gates-rich'' in the process.
By the time Mr. Schilling pitched Mr. Carcieri on his company, one of the world's leading video game publishers, Electronic Arts, had agreed to underwrite and publish a scaled-down, console version of the game, titled Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. (A console game is the kind you can put into a system like an Xbox.) But Mr. Schilling estimated that he would need an additional $100 million and a couple of years to finish his multiplayer masterpiece.
He had been unable to get it from any of the venture capital firms in Boston, probably because these types of online role-playing games are notoriously expensive and hard to produce -- even now, none have approached the commercial heights of Warcraft -- and, according to the Harvard Business School study, Mr. Schilling wasn't willing to hand over even half the company's equity to prospective investors. He had little patience for their skepticism.
''Sitting across from people at investor meetings, I wonder, How can you not understand this?'' Mr. Schilling told the study's authors. ''How do you not see what we are doing? And if you do see it, why aren't you writing a check?''
As it happened, Rhode Island had decided to start writing its own checks in an effort to modernize its economy. Mr. Carcieri had overhauled the Economic Development Corporation, a quasi-public agency chaired by the governor and responsible for attracting new jobs. Its 13-member board included the respected chiefs of some of Rhode Island's leading businesses, including the chairman and former C.E.O. of Hasbro Toys and the vice chairman of Gilbane, an international real estate developer.
In past years, the corporation had provided loans of $1 million here or $1 million there, usually to help a local factory buy a new machine or to expand a plant, but now Mr. Carcieri was putting some muscle behind it. He and the Democratic leaders of the Legislature were preparing to appropriate $50 million to the corporation so it could place bigger bets on new industries looking to locate in Rhode Island.
For years, state officials had been kicking around the intriguing idea of transforming the old jewelers' neighborhood in Providence, not far from the Rhode Island School of Design, into a nationally competitive ''knowledge district'' -- the kind of neighborhood to which hip, young graduates would flock to design software. So, right from the start, what Mr. Carcieri and his economic planners saw in 38 Studios was just the sort of high-tech start-up that could be the magnet to revive the area.
Before they could realize this vision, however, Mr. Carcieri and the Democratic legislative leaders had to get through a two-step process. First, they had to convince lawmakers to authorize an extra $75 million in bonds issued by the Economic Development Corporation, because Mr. Schilling said he needed at least that much if he was going to relocate to Providence and complete the multiplayer project. They managed to achieve this with only one dissenting vote, which was cast by Robert Watson, then the Republican leader in the House. (''Scandal finds money,'' Mr. Watson darkly warned at the time.)
With that obstacle out of the way, the project's boosters had to persuade the business heavyweights on the corporation's board to approve the loans to 38 Studios. When we talked, Mr. Carcieri emphasized to me that the board, far from being bullied by the governor or star-struck by Mr. Schilling, had engaged in a laborious process of due diligence and had come to see 38 Studios as a solid opportunity. ''These are people who are not just going to roll over, even if it's something I wanted them to do,'' Mr. Carcieri told me.
And yet, you don't have to dig very hard into the record to find that there were plenty of serious-minded advisers who tried to warn state officials away from 38 Studios. Among them, apparently, was the corporation's own financial portfolio manager, Sean Esten.
According to the state's pending lawsuit, Mr. Esten was alarmed that 38 Studios' worst-case projection for its business seemed to rely on releasing a successful game every two years -- a track record that most gaming companies can only dream of.
''I don't think I can support a $75 million guarantee to any single company in this industry due to the wide volatility in commercial success of game releases,'' Mr. Esten told his bosses in an e-mail. ''Perhaps we should develop a toolbox of incentives (including loan guarantees) to attract companies into a cluster and not rely on a single company to build the cluster around.''
According to the state's complaint, Mr. Esten's bosses decided to bury his analysis. (Like others involved in the deal, Mr. Esten declined to return my calls or e-mails.)
Another skeptic was Gina Raimondo, a Democrat who was running for state treasurer at the time and now holds the office. Ms. Raimondo spent the previous decade working in venture capital, and after reading about the proposed investment in July 2010, sent an unsolicited and eerily prescient e-mail to Keith Stokes, who was then the corporation's executive director and the deal's main architect.
''In general, I would proceed very carefully on this,'' Ms. Raimondo wrote. The company ''is in the Boston area where there are 200 venture capital firms, and it is in a very hot area of gaming so if it were in fact a compelling investment I would have to think it would be well funded already by venture capitalists; the fact that many have looked at it and passed is a red flag.''
(Mr. Stokes, who is out of government and is among those being sued, sent me a one-paragraph statement that said, in part, ''I am fully prepared to undertake a vigorous defense and look forward to correcting the false and misleading allegations that have been leveled against me.'')
In the end, with warnings like these apparently ignored by the staff, only one of the 13 board members voted against the investment in 38 Studios. That lone dissenter was Karl Wadensten, who owns Vibco, one of the country's main manufacturers of industrial vibrators.
Mr. Wadensten told me that he had simply asked himself some basic questions before the vote: Doesn't it always take twice as long to bring a product to market as you think it will? And if the economy keeps cratering, aren't parents likely to stop buying video games for their children?
It's easy, of course, to consider these questions now and to wonder what the rest of the state's top politicians and blue-ribbon C.E.O.'s were thinking. And no doubt Mr. Wadensten and others deserve credit for seeing the risks. But you can't really divorce the fateful plunge into 38 Studios from the context of the economic moment.
''They were telling us we could have unemployment of 13 or 14 percent!'' Gordon D. Fox, the Democratic House speaker, recalled when we sat in his State House office one morning last December. ''And you've got a population saying: 'O.K., lookit, we need something to happen now. We need jobs now.' And O.K., what is government's role in that?''
Mr. Fox and Mr. Stokes were the first Rhode Island officials to meet with Mr. Schilling after he made his pitch to Mr. Carcieri, and Mr. Fox was instrumental in pushing the financing through the Legislature. His father, he told me, had been a jewelry polisher downtown; his mother had worked as a maid. In 2010, people who reminded him of his parents were losing paychecks and getting tossed from their homes, and suddenly there was Mr. Schilling, sitting in front of him with a plan and bursting with entrepreneurial confidence.
''I don't want to make it look like I'm beguiled somehow by a sports guy,'' Mr. Fox told me. ''But I imagine it's like certain military generals, when they call them up and say, 'You know what? We need Eisenhower in there because he's the guy to lead that fleet across to Normandy.' You just at some point have confidence that, whatever that intangible is, this guy can do it. And I did get that feeling from him, that if all of this vets out true, this is probably a guy who can pull it off.''
A Personal Feud
Lincoln Chafeeis one of the more unusual politicians you will ever meet. The scion of one of Rhode Island's most admired political families, young Linc graduated from Brown in 1975 and promptly went off to shoe horses out West, spending seven solitary years on the Canadian racing circuit.
Although he can sometimes seem meek and stammering, all that time alone seems to have instilled in him a steely resolve. Throughout his career as a Republican senator and now as a governor without a party, Mr. Chafee has displayed a stubborn indifference to the wisdom of crowds and an outright contempt for famous figures -- most notablyGeorge W. Bush -- who strike him as imperious.
So it's not surprising that Mr. Chafee, after talking with some private investors he knew, decided that he wanted nothing to do with Mr. Schilling or 38 Studios. In July 2010, just after the Economic Development Corporation approved the bond issue for Mr. Schilling's company, Mr. Chafee, who was then a candidate for governor, spoke out against the deal and wondered aloud whether Mr. Schilling was the right business partner for the state.
''I just remember his own teammates didn't like him,'' Mr. Chafee said in a radio interview the day after the vote. ''They thought he was a bit of a salesman. I remember one of his teammates said he painted his sock, the bloody sock, he painted it.'' (That story turned out to be inaccurate.) Mr. Chafee added, ''I don't know if I trust Curt Schilling.''
In the heart of New England, accusing Mr. Schilling of having fabricated the bloody sock was like saying that Betsy Ross had imported her flag from China. Local reporters immediately set about seeing if Mr. Chafee would retract the allegation. He wouldn't.
Thus began the often personal feud at the center of the 38 Studios scandal, between the revered and voluble jock on one hand and the obstinate introvert who was soon to become governor on the other. When it came to sounding the alarm about 38 Studios, Mr. Chafee told me recently, ''You couldn't say I didn't do everything I could.''
Whether Mr. Chafee did everything he could after becoming governor, however, is a different question. He made a point of touring 38 Studios' new building on Empire Street and trying to reach some accord with Mr. Schilling. Whether or not he liked the deal, Mr. Chafee said, the state was now in business with the company and he was committed to making sure that it succeeded. But then, from all appearances, Mr. Chafee pretty much wiped his hands clean and moved on to other things.
As governor, Mr. Chafee chaired the board of the Economic Development Corporation he had accused of negligence, but until 38 Studios went under, he made no consequential changes to the board or its staff. Mr. Chafee told me that he left Mr. Stokes in charge of monitoring the 38 Studios deal because Mr. Stokes was a longtime friend of the state Senate's president, and removing him would have required more political capital than it was worth.
According to an investigation by GoLocalProv.com, the development corporation's various committees held 63 meetings from September 2010 to May 2012, but not once did anyone discuss the financial health of 38 Studios. The board seemed to be under the impression that a consulting arm of I.B.M. had signed on to police its investment. In fact, I.B.M. was being paid by 38 Studios, not the state, and didn't issue a single report to the board.
Mr. Chafee doesn't dispute the suggestion that he might have done more to monitor the state's investment.
''I had so many reservations about this being a bad deal, that I was reluctant to micromanage, to have it be 'Chafee screwing this up,' '' he told me recently. ''And don't forget, we had our hands full in this state.''
He ticked off a series of challenges he has confronted as governor: a $450 million budget shortfall, a small city in bankruptcy, Hurricane Irene and a battle over reforming the pension system. ''We... had... our... hands... full,'' he repeated, tapping the table to emphasize each word.
It wasn't as if the state's leading politicians were going to run into Mr. Schilling at the Providence Place shopping mall, or sitting at a corner table at Capriccio, so they could ask him what was up with that whole gaming thing. If state officials had envisioned that Mr. Schilling would become a glamorous new pillar of the local business community, they had miscalculated there, too. Mr. Schilling made the drive most days from his Massachusetts home to Providence, but he didn't become a man about town. Mr. Schilling was talked about but rarely seen, and neither Mr. Chafee nor any other politician I spoke to ever thought to invite him over for a talk about what the company was doing with Rhode Island's money.
'The Company Was Curdling'
Had state officials known what was transpiring inside the brick building on Empire Street, it's a good bet they would have sensed trouble coming a lot sooner.
From the start, Mr. Schilling prided himself on offering good pay; the average annual salary, according to Mr. Schilling, was $86,000. ''We had as good a health care plan as anyone in the world,'' he said in an interview with WEEI, a Boston sports station, after 38 Studios collapsed.
And because Mr. Schilling was determined to bring his best talent with him from Boston to Providence, 38 Studios had also assumed responsibility for the mortgages on dozens of its employees' homes until they could be sold -- the kind of incentive not usually offered by start-up companies.
As if all of this weren't expensive enough, as part of his agreement with Rhode Island officials, Mr. Schilling was ramping up at a frantic pace, hiring hundreds of new employees. Mr. Schilling and his main investor found themselves at cross-purposes; he needed to control costs, but the taxpayers had been promised more jobs, and jobs they got.
Experts will tell you that a multiplayer online game like Amalur is among the most complex and ambitious projects that a game producer could undertake, even if the company were well capitalized and had a proven record of success. Mr. Schilling's version was especially challenging, because it was a ''player versus environment,'' or P.V.E., game, which means that your world as a player can evolve differently than some other guy's, depending on the choices you make; if you kill a wizard somewhere, the fortress that the wizard might have created somewhere else in the game will never exist.
Multiple layers of entire worlds have to be designed and coded. One of Mr. Schilling's original collaborators was the best-selling fantasy author R. A. Salvatore, whom Mr. Schilling recruited to create a fantasy world with 10,000 years of back story, racking up a bill (still unpaid) of almost $2 million.
In 2011 and into 2012, as Mr. Schilling piled up expenses and payroll, 38 Studios was burning through several million dollars a month, with no end in sight. Brett Close, who had been 38 Studios' founding C.E.O. in Boston but left well before Mr. Schilling struck his deal with Rhode Island, told me that he had pushed Mr. Schilling to consider scaling back his ambitions. He suggested releasing Amalur in smaller phases, rather than ''trying to build the skyscraper horizontally and then standing it up.''
Mr. Schilling, however, was unmoved. He seemed to think that he could will Amalur into being, in the same way he had always been able to pitch his way out of a bases-loaded jam, even with a throbbing arm. His certainty reassured employees on Empire Street, who had no idea that he was running out of money.
Mr. Schilling had been counting on the sales of his console game, Reckoning, to keep the company going until the online game was ready. But in the months after 38 Studios and Electronic Arts introduced that version in February 2012, it became apparent that Reckoning wasn't going to be the breakout hit that Mr. Schilling needed it to be.
In the end, Reckoning sold about 1.5 million units, which was a more-than-respectable debut for a gaming company, but nothing like the spectacular showing that Mr. Schilling had projected. There was no way that he was going to lure more private financing at that point, and he had no more of his own cash to lose. He pledged his collection of gold coins to secure a bank loan for $8.5 million, but time was running out.
In April 2012, Mr. Schilling finally reached out to the state, inviting Mr. Chafee and Mr. Fox, the House speaker, down to Empire Street for a meeting. Mr. Chafee recalled that as the two men waited for Mr. Schilling in a conference room, they poured themselves coffee, only to watch the cream in their cups curdle instantly.
''In retrospect, it was symbolic, because at that meeting there was indication that the company was curdling,'' Mr. Chafee told me. ''Curt was talking about his investment, and how much he'd put into it, and how they were going to need more financing.''
The two politicians tried to take all this in, then stumbled back into the street, too dazed to speak.
Inevitably, the sad, final act unfolded in a swirl of public recrimination. Mr. Schilling thought he had long been promised an additional $14.3 million in tax credits from the state, but the Chafee administration refused to authorize them.
''We were in deep already, and like any good investor, show me a bridge to success, and I'll do the cost-benefit analysis,'' Mr. Chafee told me. ''We never got that confidence that it was going to lead to something successful.''
As Mr. Schilling scrambled for backing and failed to make his payroll for three consecutive weeks, Mr. Chafee publicly called the console game a ''flop'' and said 38 Studios was ''just the worst investment that's ever been made, I think, in the history of Rhode Island.'' He also accused 38 Studios of trying to pass the state a bad check. By the time 38 Studios closed its doors for good in June, dismissing hundreds of employees in an e-mail, the company listed $150 million in debt, $22 million in assets and $320 in petty cash.
For his part, Mr. Schilling made it very clear that he blamed Mr. Chafee for scuttling his plans to save the company. In the WEEI interview, Mr. Schilling said that a gaming company had been prepared to sign a $35 million publishing deal for his console game, Reckoning. But then Mr. Chafee went and slammed the company, and Mr. Schilling's partner fled the scene.
''I think he had an agenda, and he executed it,'' Mr. Schilling said on the radio of Mr. Chafee. ''This is an I-told-you-so, absolutely.''
Mr. Schilling said he had basically lost his entire baseball fortune in 38 Studios. Months later, he would auction off his bloody sock.
'The State Kind of Took Itself'
The state's 95-page complaint against Mr. Schilling and his 13 co-defendants, most of whom have now filed motions with the court to dismiss the case, reads like the treatment for a modern remake of"The Music Man.''
According to the complaint, Mr. Schilling knew that he needed more than $75 million to realize his dream. He also must have known, it adds, that the amount of money he would get from Rhode Island -- minus the money set aside for insurance and paid in transaction fees, along with the costs of relocating his employees -- would actually fall short of that mark by more than $20 million. The complaint contends that Mr. Schilling purposely defrauded the state by taking its money even though he knew that it wasn't enough and that 38 Studios was ''destined to fail.''
This may or may not persuade a jury -- and, in any event, it almost certainly won't get that far, because the main objective is most likely a settlement with the three major banks named as co-defendants in the suit, all of which advised the state or helped issue the bonds.
To the casual reader, though, the case against Mr. Schilling may not be all that impressive. After all, if people went around suing everyone who accepted a loan for less money than they actually needed, the courts wouldn't have time for anything else. In the state's version of events, Mr. Schilling comes off as an arrogant and overexuberant entrepreneur, possessed of grand delusions. But there's no suggestion that he intended to swindle anyone. He clearly believed he could succeed.
No, it was the entire political establishment of Rhode Island, not Curt Schilling, who decided that it would be a good idea for the taxpayers to capitalize a gaming company that had never actually produced a game, because the guy running it had a World Series ring, and because it might just seed a magic garden of technological innovation.
At bottom, 38 Studios may be that rare political scandal that grew not from any lies that anyone told the public, but from the stories that desperate politicians told themselves.
''Maybe this just came down to everyone wanting it too badly,'' Mr. Fox told me. Or as another legislator, Charlene M. Lima, a Democrat, put it, ''The state kind of took itself.''
If there's a lesson in all this, it probably has to do with the limits of what any government can -- or should -- do to bring about growth. Just about every state offers some kind of tax incentive or loan program for businesses looking to relocate. But Rhode Island went further than that; in its zeal to land Mr. Schilling, the state took on the role of venture capitalist, without having the expertise to do it well.
An actual venture capital firm would have been investing in many companies at once, to minimize its exposure, and it would have demanded a sizable equity stake. It would have taken a seat on the board so it could monitor the money closely and, if needed, restructure the company. Rhode Island, instead, threw most of its venture money into a single, highly speculative start-up, insisted that it more than double the size of its work force, and then walked away.
This lesson isn't lost on Mr. Chafee, who has been preaching a longer-term, more methodical kind of economic development centered on what he calls ''the meds and the eds'' -- that is, hospital and universities, of which Rhode Island has plenty. Brown recently moved its medical school into the hoped-for knowledge district, and the state has just finished relocating a highway in the neighborhood, clearing acres of real estate.
Even so, with unemployment in Rhode Island above 9 percent, Mr. Chafee is now a profoundly unpopular governor, and his chances for re-election at this point seem slim. His deliberate approach inspires little confidence.
''People don't like it,'' Mr. Chafee acknowledged, shaking his head. ''They want the razzle-dazzle.'' By which he meant something more like the shimmering kingdom of Amalur, twinkling just out of reach.

HEADLINE: Traveling 48 States, by Orchestra

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ROBIN

 BODY:
If there had been room in his camper, John Steinbeck once wrote, he would have packed all 48 volumes of the American Guide series. Compiled in the 1930s by the Federal Writers' Project, part of the artistic wing of the Works Progress Administration, the guides provided state-by-state accounts of local history geared toward tourists in cars. In the middle of the Depression, the Writers' Project retained more than 6,600 unemployed workers, ranging from up-and-coming luminaries like Saul Bellow and Richard Wright to schoolteachers and ditch diggers, who gathered information about their hometowns and spun it into legend.
''If W.P.A. workers leaned on their shovels, the writers leaned on their pens,'' Steinbeck wrote. 
The Brooklyn-based composer and singer Gabriel Kahane has assembled an impressive collection of original American Guides -- his current tally is 25 -- and his library helped him shape ''Gabriel's Guide to the 48 States,'' a work that will have its New York City premiere with the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra at Carnegie Hall next Saturday. (It had its world premiere at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., on April 19.) Commissioned by Orpheus to write a piece on a W.P.A. theme for the orchestra's 40th-anniversary season, the 31-year-old Mr. Kahane discovered the Massachusetts and Connecticut guides at a used bookstore and embarked on trying to gather a full set.
''I was immediately spellbound by the aesthetic values of those books and by their craftsmanship,'' he said in a recent phone interview.
As a liberal dramatizing the New Deal, part of the lore of the American left, Mr. Kahane worried about creating music that was too preachy, but the guides offered a path beyond propaganda.
''You can't escape ideology when you create your own historiography,'' he added. ''I thought that to let the era speak for itself through these texts would of course -- through their curation -- be political, but less explicitly so.''
For Mr. Kahane, allowing the 1930s to speak for itself involved reading the guides and transcribing intriguing passages into a massive document, which he condensed and edited into a libretto. ''Gabriel's Guide'' journeys from California to New York, describing along the way the working class in San Francisco; the slave trade in Washington, D.C.; and the beauty of Oregon. While Orpheus plays his score, Mr. Kahane will sing and recite excerpts from the guides, accompanying himself on banjo and electric guitar. The piece is a travelogue geographically and historically, moving fluidly from the early explorers to the striking farm workers of the Depression, tieing mythic past to political reality in the same manner as the original American Guides.
The Writers' Project was part of a four-pronged plan known as Federal One, which encompassed initiatives aimed toward employing visual artists, writers, actors and musicians. Harry Hopkins, Roosevelt's closest confidant, had started the W.P.A. in 1935, putting millions of Americans to work building bridges, hospitals and roads. Soon after, he introduced Federal One -- ''Hell, artists got to eat, just like other people,'' he said -- with support from Eleanor Roosevelt.
Mr. Kahane weaves Hopkins's voice into the ''Guide,'' at one point reading part of his defense of W.P.A spending to a background of hushed strings. (The piece's long subtitle mentions ''The one and only Harry Hopkins, intrepid New Deal figurehead and hero, who really there ought to be a monument of somewhere, but there isn't.'')
The Writers' Project might seem an odd choice for Mr. Kahane, given that his musical sensibility -- equally at home in the worlds of pop, musical theater and classical composition -- lends itself to the aesthetic of another Federal One division. The Federal Theater Project sponsored companies around the country to perform new shows for a broad, working-class audience in unconventional venues. Employing the likes of Orson Welles and Kurt Weill, the theater project addressed topical issues like the striking of steelworkers and the Agricultural Adjustment Act, often in the form of ''Living Newspapers'' taken from headlines. Productions tilted toward agitprop, which doomed it in 1938 when the House Un-American Activities Committee declared it New Deal propaganda.
Theater Project musicals included ''The Cradle Will Rock,'' by Marc Blizstein, which balanced the composer's avant-garde training with a blue-collar sensibility, portraying the struggles of the unions against capital in Steeltown, USA. It was locked out of its Broadway theater on the day of its premiere over either issues of financing or political censorship, depending on who told the story. A 22-year-old Orson Welles, presiding over the affair, marched the actors uptown to perform in an otherwise empty theater offered at the last minute.
Just as prevalent as classics like ''Cradle'' were less artful political allegories -- like ''Revolt of the Beavers,'' a play for children -- as well as opportunities for émigrés to bring Weimar Republic-era commentary to the United States. The project championed Weill's ''Johnny Johnson,'' an antiwar musical that adapted the biting satire of his Berlin collaborations with Bertolt Brecht to the Americana of the 1930s (it includes a singing Statue of Liberty and a cowboy song).
Though Weill's Theater Project work did not directly inspire ''Gabriel's Guide,'' Mr. Kahane's musical idiom is indebted to Weill's style, combining witty populism with a modernist edge. The American Weill has biographical resonance for Mr. Kahane as well. At 13, he traveled to Germany to perform in Weill's ''Street Scene,'' accompanied by his grandmother, who was returning to there for the first time since fleeing in 1939.
The Theater Project loomed in Mr. Kahane's imagination, but he was more intrigued by the problems afforded by the political reality of the Writers' Project.
''One of the things that's really interesting to me about Federal One over all is how much they struggled to figure out what to do with writers,'' he said. ''It was pretty clear what to do with makers of theater and with musicians and so on and so forth. There was an obvious public desire for those services.'' But, he added, ''there was no way that the government was going to convince people on the right to employ novelists writing novels and to get a federal paycheck.''
Though they mostly eschewed overt politics in favor of tales of local color, the guides still dealt with deep-seated issues of prejudice, which Mr. Kahane has also adapted into his work. In including the stories of minority groups and the working class, the guides embraced a pluralism that countered racism at home and fascism abroad. In ''Gabriel's Guide,'' Mr. Kahane incorporates the text of ''The Negro in Washington,'' an essay describing the horrors of the slave trade in that city, written for the Writers' Project by Sterling A. Brown. ''You can't really talk about America without talking about race and class,'' Mr. Kahane said.
Contemporary conflicts often cropped up in the reception of the guides, as when the compilers of the 1937 Massachusetts guide mentioned the anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti, hanged a decade earlier. Supporters of the pair saw the reference as an acknowledgment of the government's mistake, but its inclusion galvanized the right against a perceived leftist infiltration of the Writers' Project. A year later, editors quietly excised the passages.
While drawing upon the activism of the 1930s, Mr. Kahane does not wish to recapitulate its controversies. Liberals invoke the New Deal today as a model for the future while conservatives view it as a harbinger of the welfare state, and federal financing of the arts has always been mired in contention.
''If there's anything explicit in the relation of this piece to the current political climate, it's to basically say: Here are all these beautiful texts that were created when the government was imaginative enough to revive its economy to a certain extent through putting its artists to work,'' Mr. Kahane noted. ''There's something to me about proposing a clean slate for the future by looking at this slate from the past, which I realize is quixotic and foolhardy -- nevertheless, that's why we're here to make art, to propose an alternative path.''
Mr. Kahane's score reflects that attitude, shifting neatly from the sound-worlds of the vernacular to the avant-garde. Punchy ''Motor Tours'' transition between sections and recall the bustling postminimalism of John Adams. Mr. Kahane labels interludes ''Knee Plays,'' after Philip Glass and Robert Wilson's ''Einstein on the Beach.''
In recapitulating the spirit of the 1930s, ''Gabriel's Guide'' opens dialogues with folk music, both past and present. When the piece navigates through Alabama, the Orpheus players stand and belt a hymn from ''The Sacred Harp,'' the 19th-century Southern book of shape-note tunes. For the Chicago section, Mr. Kahane sneaks in a melody by Sufjan Stevens, a fellow singer-songwriter whom he sees as part of today's folk tradition. The specter of Charles Ives, the grandfather of American modernist eclecticism, hovers over the proceedings.
This Pan-American historicism resonates with Mr. Kahane's recent large-scale works: the musical ''February House,'' which recreated the Brooklyn brownstone that housed artists from Benjamin Britten to Carson McCullers during World War II; his orchestral song cycle ''Orinoco Sketches,'' which drew on his grandmother's diaries; and ''Crane Palimpsest,'' which combined Kahane's own poetry with that of Hart Crane. The New York of the past is a recurring leitmotif. ''Gabriel's Guide'' ends in Manhattan, with a gleaming setting of a passage from the New York guide describing the joyous multitude of the city (written, no less, by an anonymous, fresh-faced John Cheever).
''One of the things that is so moving to me about these books -- about the American Guide series -- is finding in them this shared sense, from state to state, of a kind of awe and wonderment at the assignment and opportunity to self-mythologize,'' Mr. Kahane said. ''You have this young country taking stock of itself for the first time.''
Decades later, Mr. Kahane has accepted a similar assignment. In taking stock of that historical moment, he reimagines a pluralist America, coast to coast, united in guiding its travelers to a brighter future.

 CORRECTION:
An article and an accompanying picture caption last Sunday about the composer and singer Gabriel Kahane referred imprecisely to the debut of his ''Gabriel's Guide to the 48 States.'' The performance at Carnegie Hall on Saturday was to be its New York debut, not its world premiere. (Its debut was at Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., on April 19.) The article also quoted incorrectly from comments by Mr. Kahane about the purpose of art. He said we make art ''to propose an alternative path,'' not ''an alternative past.''

OVERBOOKEDThe Exploding Business of Travel and Tourism
By Elizabeth Becker448 pp. Simon & Schuster. $28.
In 1980, armed with a backpack and a dog-eared copy of the Lonely Planet guidebook, I set out on a yearlong post-university trip through Asia. I hired a fishing boat to take me to a near-deserted island in the Gulf of Thailand and trekked for weeks through roadless villages in the Nepalese Himalayas. The highlight of the trip was a one-week tour of Myanmar, then almost completely cut off from the outside world. Three decades later, Jet Skiers and beach resorts have taken over my Thai island, and busloads of day-trippers flock to those Nepalese villages on a newly built trans-Himalayan highway. Even once-hermetic Myanmar is grabbing a piece of the global tourism trade; during the high season, the medieval temples of Bagan now face a crush of foreign invaders. 
As Elizabeth Becker observes in ''Overbooked: The Exploding Business of Travel and Tourism,'' her meticulously reported and often disturbing exposé of the travel industry, the world has gotten smaller -- but not often for the better. A former correspondent for The New York Times, Becker crisscrossed the globe, from the beaches of Sri Lanka to the game reserves of sub-Saharan Africa, from the vineyards of France to America's national parks, measuring the impact of the tourist trade. And while she finds plenty of inspiring examples of wise governance and corporate responsibility, in many other cases greed and shortsightedness have ruined once-pristine environments, exacerbated human misery and destroyed the spontaneity that once made travel an adventure.
As Becker tells it, entrepreneurism, technology and political transformation all brought about the tourism boom. In the late 1950s, Arthur Frommer, a former G.I., turned a guidebook he wrote for soldiers on R.&R. into the best-selling ''Europe on 5 Dollars a Day.'' It made overseas travel inviting for millions. The decreasing cost of long-distance flights placed exotic destinations within the reach of people who once would have indulged their wanderlust by reading National Geographic. And the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of the Soviet Union opened regions that had previously been off limits. Before 1990, Becker reports, 60 percent of the world's international tourists visited Western European countries. ''Afterward the tourist map was redrawn'' to include the former Eastern bloc and ''vast swaths of Africa and Asia.'' The result, she says, was a remarkable surge in the overall number of foreign trips, from 25 million in 1960 to one billion in 2012. Today, ''in gross economic power,'' tourism ''is in the same company as oil, energy, finance and agriculture.''
In the face of the tourist onslaught, some governments have acted with foresight and sensitivity. Becker lavishes praise on France, which has protected its coasts and its cottage industries, including winemaking and cheese production, through a mix of subsidies and tough environmental laws. Costa Rica has become the world's pioneer of ''ecotourism,'' turning cloud forests into nature reserves and inspiring hotels to go green. The Costa Rican government even refused to sign a free-trade pact that would have forced it to admit developers from the United States and jeopardized control of its coastline. Looking for a safari, Becker avoids Kenya and South Africa, which have increasingly become ''Out of Africa'' theme parks. Instead she heads to Zambia, where the safari industry is just beginning to be built up. Here she finds conservationists, government officials and tour operators seeking a balance between encouraging tourism and safeguarding the country's wildlife. ''Zambia is still wide open,'' she observes, ''with more than a hint of the Africa that the Europeans fell in love with a century ago.''
At the opposite end of the spectrum is Cambodia, which has pursued tourist dollars with little concern for the environmental or human consequences. The temples of Angkor Wat are being degraded, and the mystical ambience, Becker writes, has been lost ''in a scrum of foreigners with guides shouting in competing languages.'' Fueled by government corruption, sex tourism has flourished in Phnom Penh and other Asian cities. Dubai, transformed by oil wealth into an oasis of conspicuous consumerism, condemns its laborers to the equivalent of indentured servitude and expends enormous amounts of energy air-conditioning its skyscrapers, hotels and shopping malls. Dubai and Abu Dhabi, in Becker's view, ''are now global cities with little left of their desert heritage, their environment or their hold on the future should all those foreigners leave.''
She devotes two chapters to China, the new colossus in the tourism industry, where Becker and her husband stay in ersatz-traditional hotels, endure shakedowns in a panda park and are led around by a robotic guide who insists that the smog stinging their eyes and making them choke is merely a ''yellow mist.'' The guide also tells them that if the government hadn't mowed down pro-democracy demonstrators at Tiananmen Square ''China would have collapsed.''
Becker aims her sharpest barbs at the cruise ship industry, which claims to add some $40 billion a year to the United States economy. Giants like Royal Caribbean and Carnival Cruise Lines avoid paying minimum wage and exempt themselves from environmental scrutiny by registering their vessels under the flags of countries with lax or nonexistent regulations. They lure cruise passengers into making expensive purchases of diamonds and art from companies that offer dubious money-back guarantees. And they have turned certain ports of call into crowded bazaars filled with tacky merchandise and tourist hordes. ''They're like portable low-rent Hiltons,'' one walking-tour executive tells Becker, ''that go everywhere with little concern for the garbage they leave behind or the havoc they make in the short time they invade a place.''
Becker lapses occasionally into trade-magazine speak, attending ''dazzling'' industry awards ceremonies and dutifully quoting hotel and public-relations executives. I would like to have seen her address the rapid opening of Myanmar, and how its government is dealing with a potential tourist onslaught. And she could have delved a bit into Tunisia, where the corrupt former president, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, enriched himself and his cronies by turning the coastline into an eyesore of cheap hotel towers catering to package tourists. And ''Overbooked'' doesn't engage in much discussion of the moral quandaries raised by tourism in dictatorships and quasi dictatorships -- in Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe, for example, where one of the world's most repressive regimes benefits from every tourist dollar.
Becker ends her investigation with a look at tourism in the United States, which followed an idiosyncratic path after 9/11. While the rest of the world was opening its doors to foreign visitors, the State Department tightened visa requirements and foreigners were subjected to humiliating interrogations at entry points, even jailed when they inadvertently overstayed their welcomes. ''Travel to America? No Thanks,'' ran the headline on a scathing article in The Sunday Times of London. American tour operators call the period a ''lost decade,'' claiming the industry lost $94 billion and 200,000 jobs in the first five years after the attacks. Given the horrors Becker so vividly documents in ''Overbooked,'' it might be time for places like Cambodia and Dubai to adopt a similar approach.

THE THIRD COASTWhen Chicago Built the American Dream
By Thomas DyjaIllustrated. 508 pp. The Penguin Press. $29.95.GOLDENHow Rod Blagojevich Talked Himself Out of the Governor's Office and Into PrisonBy Jeff Coen and John ChaseIllustrated. 486 pp. Chicago Review Press. $27.95.YOU WERE NEVER IN CHICAGOBy Neil Steinberg247 pp. The University of Chicago Press. $25. 
''Poor Chicago,'' a friend of mine recently said. Given the number of urban apocalypses here, I couldn't tell which problem she was referring to. Was it the Cubs never winning? The abominable weather? Meter parking costing more than anywhere else in America -- up to $6.50 an hour -- with the money flowing to a private company, thanks to the ex-mayor Richard M. Daley's shortsighted 2008 deal? Or was it the fact that in 2012, of the largest American cities, Chicago had the second-highest murder rate and the second-highest combined sales tax, as well as the ninth-highest metro foreclosure rate in the country? That it's the third-most racially segregated city and is located in the state with the most underfunded public-employee pension debt? Was my friend talking about how a real estate investor bought The Chicago Tribune and drove it into bankruptcy? Or how 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, who performed at the festivities for Barack Obama's inauguration, was shot dead near the president's Kenwood home?
Actually, ''poor'' seems kind. And yet even as the catastrophes pile up, Chicago never ceases to boast about itself. The Magnificent Mile! Fabulous architecture! The MacArthur Foundation! According to The Tribune, Chicago is ''America's hottest theater city''; the mayor's office touts new taxi ordinances as ''huge improvements.'' The mayor likes brags that could be read as indictments too, announcing the success of sting operations busting a variety of thugs and grifters.
The swagger has bugged me since I moved here from New York 13 years ago. So I was interested to learn in ''Chicago by Day and Night: The Pleasure Seeker's Guide to the Paris of America'' -- a new annotated Northwestern University Press edition of an 1892 guidebook -- that it initially surfaced in the era of wild growth after the Great Fire of 1871. In their 1909 plan, Daniel Burnham and Edward Bennett predicted that by 1950, Chicago would house 13.5 million people.
Today, Chicago has fallen short of such dreams. The city's population, for example, is currently at 2.7 million, having dropped since a high of 3.6 million in 1950. But the bloviating roars on, as if hot air could prevent Chicago from turning into Detroit.
Before anyone accuses me of being some latter-day A. J. Liebling, whose 1952 book ''Chicago: The Second City'' infuriated residents, let me say there are some good things about living here. The beauty of Lake Michigan. A former rail yard has become Millennium Park. Thanks to global warming, the winters have softened.
In 1968, Norman Mailer called Chicago ''the great American city,'' but he was particularly prone to Chicago's idea of itself. Today, a big part of Chicago's problem stems from that mythology; while the mayor embarks on a P.R. campaign for the ''global'' city, many locals cling to its tough-guy, blue-collar, gangster-worship identity.
''Golden,'' by Jeff Coen and John Chase, is a case in point. The authors describe the ex-governor Rod Blagojevich's crookedness by employing Nelson Algren's garish phrase about Chicago's founders -- ''they all had hustler's blood'' -- as if being born here predisposes you to graft.
It's easy to see why Coen and Chase, both reporters at The Tribune, lean on such clichés. Blago is the fourth of the last seven governors in this state to go to jail. ''Golden'' takes its title from a notorious moment in an F.B.I. wiretap, made public in 2008 at the time of his arrest, when the ex-governor crowed about selling or trading the president-elect's Senate seat. ''I've got this thing and it's [expletive] golden,'' he said.
Relying largely on the public record, Coen and Chase tell Blago's story, from his poor beginnings on the Northwest side to his trial in a courtroom downtown. They recount many details of the ex-governor's eccentricities, including his Elvis obsession and his helmetlike coif, which he would groom with one of nearly a dozen hairbrushes his staff kept on hand. There are also bizarre moments, like the one in which Blago complains that David Axelrod, then his media consultant, has declined to commit to his gubernatorial race because of an impression that Blago lacks ''gravitas.''
Nor do Coen and Chase stint on examples of Blago's incompetence, arrogance and venality. Policies enacted could fill a thimble: ''He was showing up at work maybe two to eight hours a week.''
You can tell this book is written for people who live in Crook County -- as Chicago's Cook County is known -- instead of those on the coasts, because of its tone of weary resignation. Coen and Chase reside here, after all. But if Chicago is to thrive, the nation needs a more animated book, schooling it not merely in who Blago is but in what he represents: a dysfunctional system threatening the city's well-being. The real culprits include Chicago's anemic economy, the crippling legacy of machine politics, the uncompromising unions and the handful of dynasties running the city.
Neil Steinberg's memoir, ''You Were Never in Chicago,'' pitches even more indulgently into platitudes. Chicago, he writes, ''is a state of mind.'' His book's title comes from a line on a postcard Liebling received from a disgruntled local. Instead of responding in detail to the New Yorker's complaints, Steinberg, a columnist at The Chicago Sun-Times, argues that payola is both the city's distinguishing feature and his own. ''Some reporters never accept a free lunch; I never turn one down,'' he writes.
The book's plot builds up to Steinberg's defense for having pulled strings to get his brother a job at the county treasurer's office. More interesting are the chapters about ordinary people, like ''Driving With Ed McElroy,'' a portrait of an old-school publicist whose friendship Steinberg describes as ''a Chicago kind,'' by which he means favors done and returned. Yet a majority of Steinberg's boilerplate observations prevent ''You Were Never in Chicago'' from rising above his silly argument for the unique charm of Chicago's nepotism. And Steinberg seems to think that Chicago's grungiest corners should be preserved exactly as they are -- the grungier the better. ''Nelson Algren would vomit'' seeing his old neighborhood transformed into chic Wicker Park, Steinberg complains, in a city filled with empty storefronts and vacant lots.
An insider gets close to give you a picture the visitor can't see. The picture Steinberg, Coen and Chase paint is how living here bullies writers into repeating the same earnest, desperate story. Reading these books, I wondered if women writers would do better. But that question raised another one: Where are the women writers? In a 2009 Granta issue about Chicago, out of 22 writers, four were women; of those, only one -- the septuagenarian Marxist poet Anne Winters -- was living here at the time. Hey, Granta: There are cutting-edge women writers in the City of Big Shoulders, like Nami Mun and Eula Biss. Don't let all the tough-guy sentimentalism fool you.
Ex-Chicagoans -- whatever their gender -- can bring a fresh eye to the city's problems. Thomas Dyja's robust cultural history, ''The Third Coast,'' weaves together the stories of the American artists, styles and ideas that developed in Chicago before and after World War II -- the blues, Mies van der Rohe's Modernist architecture, Gwendolyn Brooks, Richard Wright, and ''Kukla, Fran and Ollie.'' This tragedy, written with greater wit than the insider accounts, contends that by the mid-'50s the American mass market, which flourished here along with big-name brands like McDonald's and Schwinn, snuffed out Midwestern geniuses with radical roots.
Dyja, who now lives in New York but grew up in Chicago, still keenly feels the city's wounds. ''The real struggle for America's future -- whether it would be directed by its people or its institutions -- took place in postwar Chicago.'' This book begins with the death of the architect Louis Sullivan, whose ornate buildings defined the 19th-century Windy City, and then skates from Robert Maynard Hutchins's University of Chicago to Emmett Till, from Chicago's notorious housing problems to Nelson Algren's love affair with Simone de Beauvoir.
Some of this is familiar, but Dyja zooms in on the qualities Chicagoans value and does it better than anyone else I've read: informality; the desire to be ''regular''; the conviction among artists that ''the process was as important as the product.'' These attributes created hospitable conditions for such distinctive genres as Modernist architecture, storefront theater, improv comedy, poetry slams, oral history (perfected by the city patron saint Studs Terkel) and outsider art, even as they alienated writers and artists interested in more than functionality and social reform. Saul Bellow complained about the lack of cafes. ''There were greasy-spoon cafeterias, one-arm joints, taverns. I never yet heard of a writer who brought his manuscripts into a tavern.''
Like other chroniclers of mid-20th-century Chicago, Dyja partly blames the 1955 election of Richard J. Daley for the city's decline. But he goes further, harnessing Daley's support of segregation and the political machine to Chicago's cultural disintegration: Playboy's founding in 1953 not only commercialized sex, it exemplified the city's shift from a rich, idiosyncratic art lab championing the individual to a place where only the affluent mattered, a city ''demolishing . . . what was best about itself.'' The city's former strengths betrayed it. ''Democratizing the arts and knowledge was a Faustian bargain: it put them into the marketplace where the market would determine their 'value.' ''
Still, Dyja stumbles when he condemns the University of Chicago, which he depicts as ''a place where attacking and defending ideas was honored more than analyzing them.'' Having studied there, I can say that the university's ethereal, argumentative commitments provide a welcome relief from the crude trade-school mentality at many other institutions of higher learning. At the same time, I have often wondered if geographical isolation -- the campus is seven miles away from downtown, connected by a highway that circumvents the poor neighborhoods in between -- breeds myopia even more devastating than that in the rest of the city. Did Milton Friedman ever see the burned-out projects as he sped along Lake Shore Drive?
Dyja's book ends with the demolition of almost 6,000 buildings, many of them by Louis Sullivan, between 1957 and 1960. (Only 21 of Sullivan's structures remain.) And Dyja, whose book jacket boasts that Studs Terkel once described him as ''a real Chicago boy,'' falls victim to a bit of wistfulness too: ''Chicago never became the city it could have been.''
So Chicago is not Detroit, not yet. But the city is trapped by its location, its past, and what philosophers would have called its facticity -- its limitations, given the circumstances. Boosterism has been perfected here because the reality is too painful to look at. Poor Chicago, indeed.

 CORRECTION:
A review on April 21 of three books about Chicago referred imprecisely to another book in which the reviewer found information about the history of the city's boosterism and about a 1909 urban development plan. The information cited is contained in the introduction and notes to a new edition of the 19th-century guidebook ''Chicago by Day and Night,'' edited, introduced and annotated by Paul Durica and Bill Savage, not in the text of the guidebook itself. The review also misstated the guidebook's original publication date. It was 1892, not 1893.
The review misstated the year and occasion on which a notorious remark by the former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, caught on an F.B.I. wiretap, was made public. The remark, ''I've got this thing, and it's [expletive] golden,'' which referred to the governor's power to fill President-elect Barack Obama's vacated Senate seat, was made public in 2008 when Blagojevich was arrested on corruption charges, not ''during his 2011 trial.''
And the review also referred imprecisely to the occasion on which Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old band majorette, performed a week before her shooting death in Chicago. It was at events associated with Barack Obama's second inauguration, not at the inauguration itself.

HEADLINE: Scientific Management Redux: The Difference Is in the Data

BYLINE: STEVE LOHR


HIGHLIGHT: Companies are increasingly using data-driven testing and measurement in the hiring and evaluation of employees &#8212; a field called work force science. The enthusiasm for worker measurement and testing is not new, but the ability to collect and mine so much data on worker behavior is. It could open the door to new insights into what makes workers productive, innovative and happy on the job. 

 BODY:
I wrote a Sunday column about the rise of what is being called "work force science."Lots of companies are embracing the trend, but anyone familiar with business history might reasonably ask, What's really new here?
Certainly, the current enthusiasm for worker measurement and trait testing has its echoes in the past. Frederick Winslow Taylor's time-and-motion studies of physical labor, like bricklaying and shoveling coal, became the "scientific management" of a century ago. 
And for decades, major American corporations employed industrial psychologists and routinely gave job candidates personality and intelligence tests.
Companies pulled back from such statistical analysis of employees in the 1970s, amid questions about its effectiveness, worker resistance and a wave of anti-discrimination lawsuits. Companies apparently figured that if any of their test results showed women or minorities doing poorly, it might become evidence in court cases, said Peter Cappelli, director of the Center for Human Resources at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
Today, worker measurement and testing is enjoying a renaissance, powered by digital tools.
What is different now, said Mitchell Hoffman, an economist and postdoctoral researcher at the Yale School of Management, is the amount and detail of worker data being collected. In the past, he said, studies of worker behavior typically might have involved observing a few hundred people at most - the traditional approach in sociology or personnel economics.
But a new working paper, written by Mr. Hoffman and three other researchers, mines data from companies in three industries - telephone call centers, trucking and software -- on a total of more than one million job applicants and more than 70,000 workers over several years.
The measurements can be quite detailed including call "handle" times and customer satisfaction surveys (call centers), miles driven per week and accidents (trucking), and patent applications and lines of code written (software).
Their subject is worker referrals, and the paper is titled, "The Value of Hiring Through Referrals."
Selecting new workers who are recommended by a company's current employees has long been seen as a way to increase the odds of hiring productive workers. It makes sense that the social networks of a company's workers would be a valuable resource to tap, and many companies pay their employees referral bonuses.
The researchers found that referred employees - across the three industries - were 25 percent more profitable than nonreferred workers. But the referral payoff comes entirely from recommendations from a company's best workers, whose productivity is above average.
"A recommendation from Joe Shmoe the dud is worse than hiring a nonreferred worker," Mr. Hoffman noted.
The paper suggests that companies might want to rethink across-the-board referral policies.
"The previous work on worker referrals has been mostly anecdotal and impressionistic," said Stephen Burks, an economist at the University of Minnesota, Morris, who was a co-author of the paper. "It hasn't been quantified in this way before, the way you can with these rich data sets."
But another co-author, Bo Cowgill, points to a challenge in work force science, and for much of the emerging social science using Big Data. Mr. Cowgill, a doctoral student at the University of California, Berkeley, spent six years as a quantitative analyst at Google. So he has plenty of first-hand experience in sophisticated data handling.
The data in work force science is observational data rather than data from experiments, which is the gold standard in science. What much of Big Data research lacks, Mr. Cowgill said, is the equivalent rigor of randomized clinical trials in drug-testing. That is, controlled experiments.
Observing how large numbers of people behave, Mr. Cowgill noted, can be extremely valuable, pointing to powerful correlations. But without controlled experiments, he added, you often do not get to the deeper understanding of the causes of observed behavior - understanding causation rather than merely identifying correlation.
"Some people feel that knowing correlations are enough," Mr. Cowgill said. "Not me, and most economists would agree."
But other economists say this kind of Big Data research is just getting under way - and already yielding significant results. "I wouldn't sell short being able to see the correlations," said Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at M.I.T.'s Sloan School of Management. "That is a big step in itself. And this is the way science works. You start with measurement and it progresses to experiment."

HEADLINE: Is American Nonviolence Possible?

BYLINE: TODD MAY


HIGHLIGHT: Facing ourselves squarely at this difficult moment might provide a better lesson for the future than allowing ourselves to once again give in to blind fury. 

 BODY:
 The choice is not between violence and nonviolence but between nonviolence and nonexistence. 
- Martin Luther King Jr.
We are steeped in violence. 
This past week was of course a searing reminder: Monday's bombing at the Boston Marathon and the ensuing manhunt that ended on Friday with the death of one suspect and the capture of another, his brother, dominated the news. But there were other troubling, if less traumatic reminders, too. On Tuesday, a 577-page report by the Constitution Project concluded that the United States had engaged in torture after the Sept. 11 attacks. On Wednesday, a turning point in the heated national debate on gun control was reached when the United States Senate dropped consideration of some minimal restrictions on the sale and distribution of guns. Looming above all this is the painful memory of the mass killing at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
Now is as good a time as any to reflect on our responses to the many recent horrors that seem to have engulfed us, and to consider whether we can hope to move from an ethos of violence to one nonviolence. Facing ourselves squarely at this difficult moment might provide a better lesson for the future than allowing ourselves to once again give in to blind fury.
We might begin by asking the question, Who are we now? 
Clearly, we are a violent country. Our murder rate is three to five times that of most other industrialized countries. The massacres that regularly take place here are predictable in their occurrence, if not in their time and place. Moreover, and more telling, our response to violence is typically more violence. We display our might - or what is left of it - abroad in order to address perceived injustices or a threat to our interests. We still have not rid ourselves of the death penalty, a fact that fills those in other countries with disbelief. Many of us, in response to the mindless gun violence around us, prescribe more guns as the solution, as the Republicans sought to do during the gun debate. And we torture people. It is as though, in thinking that the world responds only to violence, we reveal ourselves rather than the world.
Why is this? How has the United States become so saturated in slaughter?
There are, of course, many reasons, but three stand out, one of which is deep and longstanding and the others of more recent vintage. The deep reason lies in our competitive individualism. Americans are proud of our individualism, and indeed it is not entirely a curse. To believe that one has a responsibility to create oneself rather than relying on others for sustenance has its virtues. No doubt many of the advances - scientific, technological and artistic - that have emerged from the United States have their roots in the striving of individuals whose belief in themselves bolstered their commitment to their work. However, the dark side of this individualism is a wariness of others and a rejection of the social solidarity characteristic of countries like Denmark, Sweden, New Zealand and, at least to some extent, France. We make it, if we do make it, but we do so alone. Our neighboring citizens are not so much our fellows as our competitors.
The second reason is the decline of our ability to control events in the world. We might date this decline from our military failure in Vietnam, or, if we prefer, more recently to the debacle in Iraq. In any event, it is clear that the United State cannot impose its will as it did during much of the 20th century. We live in a different world now, and this makes many of us insecure. We long for a world more cooperative with our wishes than the one we now live in. Our insecurity, in turn, reinforces our desire to control, which reinforces violence. If we cannot control events in the world, this must be a result not of our impotence or the complexity of the world's problems but of our unwillingness to "man up." And so we tell ourselves fairy tales about what would have happened if we had committed to victory in Vietnam or bombed one or another country back to the Stone Age.
The third reason is economic. The welfare state has been in decline for more than 30 years now. The embrace of classical liberalism or neoliberalism erodes social solidarity. Each of us is an investor, seeking the best return on our money, our energies, our relationships, indeed our lives. We no longer count on government, which is often perceived as the enemy. And we no longer have obligations to those with whom we share the country, or the planet. It is up to each of us to take our freedom and use it wisely. Those who do not are not unlucky or impoverished. They are simply imprudent.
Competitive individualism, insecurity, neoliberalism: the triad undergirding our penchant for violence. This, as much as anything else, is the current exceptionalism of America. Others are not our partners, nor even our colleagues. They are our competitors or our enemies. They are hardly to be recognized, much less embraced. They are to be vanquished.
What would the alternative, nonviolence, look like? And what does it require of us?
We must understand first that nonviolence is not passivity. It is instead creative activity. That activity takes place within particular limits. To put the point a bit simply, those limits are the recognition of others as fellow human beings, even when they are our adversaries. That recognition does not require that we acquiesce to the demands of others when we disagree. Rather, it requires that our action, even when it coerces the other (as boycotts, strikes, sit-ins and human blockades often do), does not aim to destroy that other in his or her humanity. It requires that we recognize others as fellow human beings, even when they are on the other side of the barricades.
This recognition limits what we can do, but at the same time it forces us to be inventive. No longer is it a matter of bringing superior firepower to bear. Now we must think more rigorously about how to respond, how to make our voices heard and our aims prevail. In a way it is like writing a Shakespearean sonnet, where the 14-line structure and iambic pentameter require thoughtful and creative work rather than immediate and overwhelming response.
To recognize someone's humanity is, in perhaps the most important way, to recognize him or her as an equal. Each of us, nonviolence teaches, carries our humanity within us. That humanity cannot always be appealed to. In some cases, as with the tragedy at Sandy Hook, it can even become nearly irrelevant. However, in all but the most extreme cases nonviolence summons us to recognize that humanity even when it cannot serve as the basis for negotiation or resolution. It demands that we who act do so with a firm gaze upon the face of the other. It demands the acknowledgment that we are all fragile beings, nexuses of hope and fear, children of some mother and perhaps parents to others: that is, no more and no less than fellow human beings in a world fraught with imponderables.
Can we do this? Are we capable at this moment of taking on the mantle of nonviolence?
The lessons are already there in our history. The civil rights movement is perhaps the most shining example of nonviolence in our human legacy. After 9/11, after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy, and now, in the immediate on-the-ground responses to the Boston bombing, Americans pulled together with those they did not know in order to restore the web of our common existence. We are indeed violent, but we have shown flashes of nonviolence, that is to say moments where our competitive individualism, our insecurity, our desire for the highest return on our investment of time and money, has been trumped by the vividness of the likeness of others. Granted, these are only moments. They have not lasted. But they teach us that when it comes to nonviolent relations with others, we are not entirely bereft.
What would it require for these lessons to be become sedimented in our collective soul? There is much work to be done. We must begin to see our fellow human beings as precisely that: fellows. They need not be friends, but they must be counted as worthy of our respect, bearers of dignity in their own right. Those who struggle must no longer be seen as failures, but more often as unlucky, and perhaps worthy of our extending a hand. Those who come to our shores, whatever our policy toward them, must be seen as human beings seeking to stitch together a decent life rather than as mere parasites upon our riches. Those who are unhealthy must be seen as more than drains upon our taxes but instead as peers that, but for good fortune, might have been us.
None of this requires that we allow others to abdicate responsibility for their lives. Nor does it require that we refuse, when no other means are available, to defend ourselves with force. Instead it calls upon us to recognize that we, too, have a responsibility to more than our own security and contentment. It commands us to look to ourselves and at others before we start casting stones.
Would this end all senseless killing? No, it would not. Would it substitute for the limits on guns that are so urgently needed? Of course not. While the recently rejected limits on guns, however timid, might have provided a first public step toward the recognition of the requirements of our situation, our task would remain: to create a culture where violence is seen not as the first option but as the last, one that would allow us to gaze upon the breadth of space that lies between an unjust act and a violent response.
The philosopher Immanuel Kant said that the core of morality lay in treating others not simply as means but also as ends in themselves. Nonviolence teaches us nothing more than this. It is a simple lesson, if difficult to practice - especially so at a moment like this when our rage and grief are still raw. But it is a lesson that has become buried under our ideology and our circumstances. We need to learn it anew.
Learning this lesson will not bring back the life of the Martin Richard, Krystle Campbell or the other murdered victims in Boston. It will not return to health those who were injured on that day. It won't bring back Trayvon Martin or the children of Sandy Hook. But it will, perhaps, point the way toward a future where, instead of recalling yet more victims of violence in anger and with vows of retribution, we find ourselves with fewer victims to recall.
 Todd May is Class of 1941 Memorial Professor of the Humanities at Clemson University, and the author of, most recently, "Friendship in the Age of Economics." He is currently working on a book on the philosophy of nonviolence.

HEADLINE: Our Feelings About Inequality: It's Complicated

BYLINE: ILYANA KUZIEMKO and STEFANIE STANTCHEVA


HIGHLIGHT: Americans are aware of rising inequality, and the more they know about it, the more concerned they are. But that concern doesn&#8217;t translate into support for wealth redistribution. 

 BODY:
How much do Americans care about rising income inequality? Surveys send mixed signals.
In a poll released last year by the Pew Research Center, two-thirds of Americans agreed that there were "strong conflicts between the rich and poor" - up substantially from when the question was asked in 2009 - but in a Gallup poll taken at the height of Occupy Wall Street, in the fall of 2011, reducing the income and wealth gap was low on respondents' list of priorities for government action.
It seems like a paradox: Americans are increasingly worried about the gap between rich and poor, but are hesitant to have the government do anything about it.
An experiment we conducted, described in more detail below, may help explain the contradiction. Americans who were given more information about rising inequality expressed significant concern about the problem, but that concern did not always translate into greater support for redistributive policies. Our work identified a possible explanation for this seeming disconnect, and it is a sad one: the more people focused on inequality, the less they trusted the government. 
How much Americans care about income inequality and the extent to which they want the government to address it are two distinct questions that are often conflated. Democrats and Republicans agree that America faces a long-run fiscal imbalance that in the coming decades will most likely require cutting social services, raising taxes or both - policies that directly influence income distribution. Who will bear the brunt of this rebalancing will depend on whether the government uses tax and other policies to counteract rising income inequality with greater redistribution.
Since the 1970s, income inequality in the United States has increased at a historic rate. In 1970, the richest 1 percent of Americans enjoyed 9 percent of total national pre-tax income. In 2011, by contrast, that share had risen to 19.8 percent. And this large increase in inequality has not been softened by more progressive tax policy. Tax rates on the top 1 percent of taxpayers have fallen over the same period.
Such a reshaping of the income distribution was unlikely to go unnoticed, and indeed, surveys show that Americans are generally knowledgeable about the rise in income inequality. Using survey data from 2002, the political scientist Larry M. Bartels showed that three-quarters of Americans believed inequality has increased over the previous two decades. The majority of those respondents said this trend was a "bad thing."
And yet over the past 30 years, Americans have also become less supportive of government efforts to redistribute from high- to low-income households. Between 1991 and 2010, roughly 28 percent of Americans in the General Social Survey - a continuing survey of opinions and attitudes in the United States, conducted by the University of Chicago - agreed that the federal government should "improve the standard of living of all poor Americans." (Forty-five percent were neutral, and 27 percent agreed that "it is not the government's responsibility, and that each person should take care of himself.")
This was a sharp decline - 5 percentage points on average - in support for redistribution relative to those surveyed between 1975 and 1990.
The survey has also revealed that the share of respondents who believe that the rich should pay proportionally more of their income in taxes than the poor is substantially lower now than in 1987. Gallup polls reveal a similar decrease.
What explains Americans' unwillingness to translate their concerns over inequality into government action? Along with the economist Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, and the psychologist Michael I. Norton of Harvard Business School, we surveyed over 5,000 Americans online in 2011 and 2012. We randomly assigned half of our respondents to complete an online 10-minute tutorial about the increase in income inequality over the last decades. When respondents entered their current household income, the interface calculated a painful counterfactual: what their income would have been had economic growth since 1980 been equally shared among all American households.
In addition, the tutorial emphasized the role that public policy could play in reducing inequality, presenting charts showing that, historically, periods with higher top tax rates have not necessarily been periods of low economic growth. If lack of knowledge is responsible for lack of support for redistribution, our tutorial should have had a meaningful effect on respondents' policy preferences.
Our respondents did, in fact, react to our tutorial by increasing their already significant concern about inequality: the tutorial raised the share of respondents who indicated that inequality was a "very serious problem" by over 40 percent.
However, our results also revealed - with one key exception - that support for redistribution increased to a much smaller degree. Our tutorial had only a small effect on support for increasing taxes on millionaires and raising the minimum wage, and no effect on support for other policies that help low-income families, like the earned-income tax credit and food stamps.
What was the exception? Our tutorial informed participants that only about 1 of every 1,000 households was wealthy enough to pay the estate tax. (The tax is currently levied on individual estates worth more than $5.25 million.) Seeing this information sharply increased support for the estate tax. Other surveys have shown that Americans wildly overestimate the share of households subject to the estate tax. The effect of information on increased support for the estate tax has been demonstrated by researchers, in other contexts. It appears that in situations where the public is highly misinformed, providing simple facts can have a big impact on policy views.
But why didn't greater knowledge about inequality translate into support for policies to ameliorate it?
Our experiment suggested an answer: Those who saw our tutorial became 20 percent less likely to agree that government could be trusted at least "some of the time" - a surprisingly large effect. By emphasizing to respondents the level and growth of income inequality over the last several decades, our tutorial appears to have simultaneously undercut their trust in government's ability to fix the problem. After all, if the government let things get this bad, respondents might logically conclude that it is also unable to do much to fix the situation.
Indeed, the General Social Survey has shown that confidence in government has dropped over the past 30 years. From 1976 to 1989, 23 percent of respondents, on average, reported having "hardly any" confidence in Congress. Since 1990, that number has risen by more than 11 percentage points. The survey has revealed an almost identical erosion of confidence in the executive branch of the federal government. Respondents reacted to our inequality tutorial by reporting lower trust in government, raising the possibility that Americans may have reacted to 30 years of rising income inequality by reducing their trust in government.
Whether or not the rise in inequality has itself lowered Americans' faith in government, the low opinion in which Americans hold their government may well limit their willingness to connect concern with inequality to government action.
Our results have differing implications for people on both ends of the political spectrum. On one hand, liberals can take heart in the news that Americans are deeply troubled about the current level of income inequality. On the other hand, conservatives may be glad to hear that despite this concern, Americans have a healthy skepticism that government can be trusted to do much about it.
Our research suggests that merely talking more about inequality is unlikely to change Americans' policy preferences. Americans are already aware of inequality and are troubled by it. Proponents of greater redistribution can probably save their breath pointing out that inequality is a problem. Instead, they face what seems to be a much more difficult task: convincing them that their government is up to the task of addressing it.

HEADLINE: New Leader Named for Enforcement Unit at S.E.C.

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: On Monday, Mary Jo White named Andrew J. Ceresney, her longtime lieutenant in corporate law and the prosecutor&#8217;s office, as co-head of the S.E.C.&#8217;s enforcement unit. 

 BODY:
 1:58 p.m. | Updated 
A new cop has joined the Wall Street beat, as the Securities and Exchange Commission prepares shakes up the leadership of its enforcement unit. 
Mary Jo White, who took over the S.E.C. as chairwoman this month, named Andrew J. Ceresney as co-head of the commission's enforcement arm on Monday. Mr. Ceresney has served as Ms. White's longtime lieutenant as both a corporate defense lawyer at the law firm Debevoise & Plimpton and earlier in his career as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan.
He is expected to share the S.E.C. role with George S. Canellos, who became the commission's interim enforcement chief this year when Robert S. Khuzami departed the agency. It is unusual, if not unprecedented, for the enforcement unit to be run jointly.
"I am excited to be charged with implementing Chairman White's mandate of bold and unrelenting enforcement and thrilled to be teaming again with George," Mr. Ceresney, 41, said in a statement.
But the joint leadership is likely to be temporary, people briefed on the matter said, as Mr. Canellos, who has been at the S.E.C. nearly four years, is expected to return to private practice well before the end of President Obama's second term. Mr. Canellos, 48, also served as a federal prosecutor under Ms. White when she was United States attorney in Manhattan. He is also a former colleague and friend of Mr. Ceresney.
"George and Andrew are two of the best lawyers and finest people I know," Ms. White said in the statement. "They are a perfect combination to lead the talented enforcement division professionals who protect investors and keep our markets safe and vibrant."
Mr. Ceresney's appointment would be Ms. White's first major personnel announcement as chairwoman, and could renew concerns about a revolving door at the agency that shuttles lawyers from the government to the private sector, and back again.
While at Debevoise, Mr. Ceresney represented a number of the nation's largest banks and their former top executives, including Kenneth D. Lewis, the former chief executive of Bank of America, who came under scrutiny related to the bank's takeover of Merrill Lynch during the financial crisis. He also defended JPMorgan Chase related to an inquiry into the bank's foreclosure practices.
He will join Mr. Canellos in taking the helm of an enforcement arm that is in a transition period. While Mr. Khuzami revamped the division in the wake of the financial crisis, some longtime officials in the unit complain of low morale and a dwindling number of marquee investigations.
That said, the S.E.C. enforcement division continues to bring prominent insider-trading cases, a hallmark of Mr. Khuzami's tenure. This month, the commission brought a case against a senior partner at the accounting firm KPMG for leaking secret information about his corporate clients to his golfing buddy.
Mr. Ceresney did not reply to a request for comment. The enforcement chief post does not require Senate confirmation.

HEADLINE: A Modern City in East Midtown?

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. M. STERN. 
Robert A. M. Stern, architect, is dean of the Yale School of Architecture and a co-author of a series of books about architecture and urbanism in New York.

 BODY:
WE are told that New York needs to be lofted back into global competitiveness. That the city isn't modern enough. Take the area around Grand Central Terminal. With 80 percent of the building stock in the neighborhood now over 50 years old, we hear, our city is falling behind, and current zoning restrictions inhibit redevelopment.
Last summer the Department of City Planning released its East Midtown study, envisioning a taller, denser, shinier future for the neighborhood around Grand Central. New and more liberal regulations that will allow bigger office towers are on their way to the City Council for approval before the end of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's current term. But what is a modern city, exactly? And is New York really in danger of falling behind new global cities like Shanghai?
With district improvement bonuses, the City Planning study proposes to double the developable floor area on some sites around Grand Central, allowing enough additional square footage to give us a neighborhood of towering office buildings, some as tall as 1,300 feet or more. (For reference, the Chrysler Building is 1,046 feet to the top of its spire.) 
I'm nearly always an advocate of density: it's socially beneficial and environmentally responsible. And I like tall buildings as much as the next architect, especially if I'm asked to design them.
But the advantages of density can go only so far without the infrastructure to support it. And the appropriateness of tall buildings is a question of where and when, and what they contribute to the public realm. Let's all admit that the Pan Am Building, now MetLife, was a mistake in 1963, and is still a mistake from an urbanistic point of view. It disrupted the vista down Park Avenue that had become an essential part of our city.
Are we preparing to make the same mistake again, on multiple sites? The rezoning study makes no mention of protected-view corridors. Can we guarantee that in the future the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building will not be lost in thickets of taller buildings?
And what of our streets and subway platforms? I commute through Grand Central several times a week, and at 6:20 a.m., when I catch my train to New Haven, the terminal is already full of people. When I return at 6:30 or 7 p.m., I can hardly make my way to the stairways and escalators that lead to the Lexington Avenue subway platforms.
How will the added workers quartered in these new buildings get from their trains to their desks? The plan says that special assessments and payments in lieu of taxes will guarantee ''pedestrian network improvements as development occurs.'' There is nothing wrong with privately financed infrastructure improvements. But the study, if I read it correctly, gets it backward: first you put in the infrastructure, then you build the buildings. Look at the example of Grand Central, the private enterprise that spurred all this development in the first place.
What lessons should we take from other great cities? In the early 1990s, Shanghai organized a special economic zone that led to the development of a financial hub in Pudong, on land previously occupied by warehouses and wharves. Towers sprouted to create an instant iconic skyline, but with a regrettable, scaleless urban moonscape below.
Should we in New York in 2013 emulate the Shanghai of the 1990s? Or should we heed the lesson the Chinese themselves have subsequently learned, that saving old buildings and neighborhoods is essential to the continued vitality of great cities? In Shanghai, the pre-World War II buildings along the Bund, which loom so very large in the city's appeal, have been saved and repurposed. Nearby, at Xintiandi, a historic residential neighborhood of stone houses and tight alleys has been transformed into a chic, walkable retail and entertainment district.
Terminal City, a sophisticated mix of hotels, clubs, office buildings and residential blocks at the heart of East Midtown, was built on platforms bridging the rail yards north of Grand Central. It was a bold plan to create valuable real estate where once there had been urban blight. As much as anything, this development created what the world knows today as Midtown Manhattan.
Some judicious pruning is no doubt appropriate, but are the right areas being targeted? In the center of the study's bull's-eye diagram are buildings worth preserving: George B. Post's Roosevelt Hotel, the Yale Club by James Gamble Rogers, Carrère & Hastings's historically important Liggett Building and Arthur Loomis Harmon's extraordinary Shelton Club Hotel, now a Marriott, which inspired artists like Georgia O'Keeffe to some of their best work.
Those and other distinguished buildings have come to define the area around Grand Central, but are not yet official landmarks. Instead of blindly targeting what is oldest for replacement, as the study does, why not develop a thoughtful preservation plan that takes a broad look at what is worth saving?
In fact, the best path toward ensuring the future of East Midtown may well be that of preservation. Preservation, which too many in the real estate community reflexively oppose, has been a better stimulant for development than rezoning. SoHo and the Flatiron district were two of the most moribund parts of the city in the 1960s and '70s; once they were designated as historic districts, the fortunes that poured in made them more vital than ever.
We can do the same in East Midtown. The historic hotels and older office buildings of Terminal City could be repurposed for residential uses (and, I might add, the Yale Club is doing just fine). Some of these older buildings, their futures uncertain, may look a little dowdy today, but I'm confident that the stability that landmark designation provides would lead owners and developers to rediscover their intrinsic value.
Our diversity, and the fact that we don't look like Pudong, is the reason many creative types choose New York over the bland banalities of Silicon Valley, just as in London, they've chosen Clerkenwell over Canary Wharf, and in Paris, just about anywhere over La Défense.
Why do tourists flock here? Because we are what we are. As we go forward, we need to evolve, not copy someplace else. We can't sacrifice our legacy for the benefit of a small group of property owners, especially when other, less controversial sites, with the potential for visionary large-scale urbanism on par with the potential that Terminal City seized 100 years ago, are gaining momentum.
At its most fundamental level, the problem with the so-called planning study is that it's not a plan. It trusts that developers will build world-class buildings, and that we'll sort out the public realm as we go. It looks to improve East Midtown by adding world-class office stock, but it dices the neighborhood into independent development zones with little broader thinking.
There's nothing of the unified vision that gave us Rockefeller Center, with its iconic Channel Gardens, its world-famous ice rink and its shop-lined indoor passageways that connect office buildings to subways. The proposed East Midtown up-zoning doesn't give anything back to New York. It's all about real estate and not about place-making, or should I say, place-saving.
Even with 80 percent of its building stock over 50 years old, East Midtown is today, in the words of the planning study, ''the best business address in the world.'' Let's keep it that way.

HEADLINE: In an Overhaul, Clorox Aims to Get Green Works Out of Its Niche

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
GREEN WORKS, Clorox's line of environmentally friendly housecleaning products, is using Earth Day to introduce a fund-raising promotion on Twitter as part of an overall revamp of its marketing strategy.
The brand -- introduced in 2008 with a controversial endorsement by the Sierra Club -- has carried prices at least 20 percent higher than traditional housecleaning products and has been promoted with retailers' natural and organic products.
In January, however, Green Works recommended that retailers eliminate its price premium and promote its products with traditional housecleaning products. The new policies will be phased in starting this summer. 
Clorox's contract with the Sierra Club, which involved a $1.3 million payment to the environmental organization, will expire this December; the Sierra Club logo, which has appeared on all Green Works packaging, will be eliminated from new, bolder packaging that will begin appearing this summer as part of the overhauled marketing strategy.
The new strategy -- which Green Works' brand manager, Shekinah Eliassen, said was meant to promote its products as being ''affordable, effective, accessible and approachable'' -- no doubt stems from a precipitous decline in sales.
An August 2012 report on environmentally friendly cleaning products in the United States by Packaged Facts, a market research company, said that although Green Works' dollar sales jumped more than 50 percent in 2009 to $53 million, they had fallen to $32 million for the year ending May 13, 2012, based on data from the IRI Group.
Similarly, Packaged Facts estimated that although Green Works generated about 20 percent of all dollar sales in the green household cleaner category in 2009, that figure had fallen to 13 percent in May last year, according to IRI Group data.
''When Green Works was first launched, it came out of the gate with a lot of investment by Clorox,'' said Jason Gere, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. ''Initially it started to do well, but then the macroeconomic environment took over. Clorox realized that in this consumer-led recession, having products even as environmentally friendly as Green Works' are, but charging a 20 percent-plus premium to conventional cleaners, was not working.''
The line's association with Clorox also may have been detrimental, said Ali Dibadj, a senior analyst at Sanford Bernstein. He said the connection meant Green Works ''did not appeal to the classic green consumer. So they're deciding to go after conventional consumers at a lower price point.''
Mr. Gere, who estimated that Green Works likely generates about 5 percent of Clorox's total sales, said the company had ''done themselves a favor by adjusting the price gaps, and with Green Works sold in the cleaning section with traditional products, consumers probably will be willing to try it to see if they like it.''
According to Kantar Media, Clorox spent more than $25 million a year on advertising by DDB, part of the Omnicom Group, for Green Works in 2008 and 2009, the vast majority on television and magazine advertising. Kantar Media said that figure dropped to almost $600,000 -- spent mostly on Internet advertising -- in 2011, a figure that doubled to $1.2 million last year.
Rebecca Boston, Green Works' public relations and digital strategist, said the brand decided last year to aim its marketing at ''digitally savvy'' mothers, ages 18 to 49, ''who spend a lot of time online. That's where we needed to reach them.''
To that end, Green Works hired Calgary, Alberta-based Critical Mass, a digital agency controlled by the Omnicom Group, to develop an advertising strategy driven primarily by social media; officials said Clorox would spend $10 million on the campaign through mid-2014.
Green Works is celebrating Earth Day on Monday with a program that will let Twitter users post a joke to Green Works' Twitter account. For every Twitter post through the end of May, Green Works will donate a dollar, up to $20,000, to the Environmental Media Association's school gardens project. The tagline of the initiative is, ''You don't have to be serious to be green.''
In January, Green Works introduced a YouTube series called ''Green Housewives,'' which parodies people who have made being environmentally correct a status symbol. In February, Green Works ran a ''Tweethearts'' campaign that allowed participants to send environmentally friendly, virtual Valentine's Day cards via Twitter. The March social media initiative was a six-second game of charades on Vine, a video clip app, for St. Patrick's Day; its message was, ''You don't have to put on a charade to be green.''
Chris Gokiert, president of Critical Mass, said the social media initiatives -- which are being promoted with digital banner advertising -- are intended to ''help customers become owners of and advocates for the brand.''
The campaign also involves a new Green Works Web site, introduced in January, and magazine advertising in April, May and June issues of women's magazines and People. One ad says, ''You don't have to be perfect to be green,'' while another says, ''You don't have to be a trust fund baby to be green.''
Kevin Tuerff, president of EnviroMedia, an Austin-based environmental marketing company, said the new social media strategy could ''enhance brand awareness, though it may not translate into sales.''
Wendy Nicholson, who follows Clorox for Citi, said organic personal care products generally have been more successful than organic household products. ''People tend to care more about all-natural, organic products going into the body, as opposed to being used on their dishes or clothes,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Chinese Auto Buyers Grow Hungry for Larger Cars

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- The models wore traditional cheongsam dresses and medieval Chinese armor as well as the usual rainbow of shiny miniskirts at the Shanghai auto show this weekend, but the many midsize cars and sport utility vehicles on display made it look almost like an American auto show.
Gone are the days when buyers in China, the world's largest car market since 2009, mostly purchased fuel-sipping compacts and subcompacts. Their shift toward larger and ever-more-numerous vehicles is not only driving up China's oil import bill and contributing to pollution but is also fattening automakers' profits -- and manufacturers made clear over the weekend that they plan to infuse the market with large vehicles.
General Motors announced that it would introduce nine new or restyled S.U.V. models in China in the next five years, and disclosed that it would build four more factories and add 6,000 jobs to accommodate its ever-rising sales here.
A Chrysler executive said that his company would start making Jeep Cherokees in Changsha in southern China by the end of next year. And China's domestic carmakers showed a wide range of S.U.V.'s, the heftier the better. 
Sedans were also bigger than at previous Chinese auto shows. Ford promoted its Lincoln brand, which it is bringing to China. Many manufacturers gave prominence to luxury cars, a nod to the rising affluence in China of the upper middle class and the wealthy.
''Our focus is on luxury vehicles and S.U.V.'s going forward,'' said Bob Socia, president of G.M. China, which has been neck-and-neck for years with Volkswagen as the Chinese market leader.
''Not long ago, both were considered niche segments,'' he said. ''Both are now mainstream and growing rapidly.''
S.U.V. sales jumped 49 percent in March from a year ago as new models poured into the market. Overall auto sales in China climbed 13 percent in March and are on track for almost 21 million vehicles sold this year. By comparison, the latest forecasts in the United States this year are for a little more than 15 million vehicles. Both totals include sales of pickup trucks and other light commercial vehicles.
Mr. Socia predicted that S.U.V. sales would double by 2015, to four million vehicles. But that would still leave them trailing midsize car sales, which have surged to five million cars a year.
That has made midsize cars not only the largest market segment in China, but also bigger than the entire auto market in Japan, or the combined auto markets of Germany and Britain, said Jim Farley, Ford's executive vice president for global marketing, sales and service and of the Lincoln brand.
Having opened one assembly plant in Chongqing last year, Ford is in the process of building another assembly plant, an engine factory and a transmission factory in Chongqing, as well as assembly plants in Hangzhou and Nanchang.
Ford is predicting that the annual Chinese market will soar to 30 million cars and trucks by 2020. General Motors is forecasting 35 million by 2022.
Fuel consumption concerns in China often focus more on the sheer number of vehicles being sold than on the fuel economy of each one. But while China is a negligible market for the true behemoths that remain fairly popular in the United States, like the Chevrolet Tahoe and the Lincoln Navigator, the upward creep in vehicle size in China toward midsize cars and S.U.V.'s is complicating policy makers' efforts to limit total oil use.
S.U.V.'s and midsize cars in China tend to be a little smaller than in the United States. The S.U.V.'s are almost entirely what the auto industry refers to as crossover utility vehicles, which are built on car platforms instead of the heavier pickup truck underbodies that Detroit relied on in the 1980s and '90s.
Midsize cars in China tend to be what are classified as lower midsize cars in the United States, like the Ford Fusion, sold here as the Ford Mondeo. Upper midsize cars, like the Toyota Camry, are also gaining ground but are not quite so popular.
The shift toward bigger cars and S.U.V.'s, despite punitive taxes of as much as 40 percent on models with large engine displacements (more than 4 liters) is prompting concern in Beijing. Policy makers there are weighing whether to follow the example of the Obama administration and the European Union in increasing gas mileage regulations.
Stricter rules could hurt sales of the largest models, but automakers have already been preparing by offering many cars and S.U.V.'s with slightly smaller engines than are used in the United States. ''The most important discussion around this area is the changing fuel-economy requirements,'' Mr. Farley said.
Much of the change in Chinese automotive tastes is culturally driven. Until the last few years, sport utility vehicles were dismissed as looking too much like farm vehicles, at a time when many recent Chinese arrivals in cities were eager to shed any link to their rural pasts.
Hatchbacks were also unpopular, as a big glass window in the back of a vehicle instead of steel-enclosed trunk struck many buyers as unsafe, particularly after the crime waves that rolled through many Chinese cities in the 1980s and '90s.
But public safety has improved in China, suburban and rural retreats from polluted cities have become fashionable and tens of millions of Chinese are now traveling overseas and becoming aware of the international popularity of higher-riding vehicles.
''S.U.V.'s were definitely uncool to drive here, and now something is changing -- they're cool,'' said Michael Dunne, an automotive consultant specializing in Asia.
Personal injury lawsuits from rollovers have been costly for S.U.V. manufacturers in the West, but such litigation tends to be very rare in China. Virtually all of the vehicles sold in China are manufactured either by Chinese automakers or, more often, by multinationals in joint manufacturing ventures with Chinese automakers. Most Chinese automakers in turn are owned by local governments that also have considerable control over local courts, making the automakers nearly invulnerable to private litigation.
Air pollution has become a big issue in China, particularly after severe smog early this year in Beijing. But Western and Chinese studies have attributed most of the smog to coal-fired power plants, factories and diesel-powered trucks and buses, not gasoline-powered cars.
One question mark hanging over the auto industry is the Communist Party's austerity and anticorruption campaign, in place since November. The campaign has hurt many luxury restaurants and some luxury retailers, especially in Beijing.
But auto executives insisted that the program's effects on their sector had been more muted. Torsten Müller-Ötvös, the chief executive of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Ltd., said that sales in China of his company, a subsidiary of BMW, were up only slightly in recent months from a year earlier. But he attributed slower growth mainly to an inevitable stabilization of the Chinese luxury market as it has matured, not the austerity campaign.
''Growth isn't any longer as explosive as it had been in the years before, but we are still satisfied,'' he said, while declining to provide sales data for China.
For now, manufacturers in China are so focused on the Chinese market that exports are limited and mainly aimed at other emerging markets, with little sign of large-scale shipments to industrialized countries. Mr. Socia of G.M. and other executives said that their factories could barely keep up with demand in China.
John Burton, the general manager of the Fiat and Chrysler joint venture with the Guangzhou Automobile Group, declined to speculate on where and whether the company might export Jeeps from China.
''Potentially we could,'' he said, ''but if the Chinese market sucks them up then they'll stay here.''

HEADLINE: Amazon Gains On iTunes In Music Sales

BYLINE: By NICK BILTON. 
Nick Bilton, whose Disruptions column normally appears on this page, is on vacation.

 BODY:
Amazon is helping Apple celebrate the 10th anniversary of iTunes by gaining momentum on music downloads in the United States.
According to a new study released by NPD Group, the market research firm, in 2012 Amazon accounted for 22 percent of paid music downloaded in the United States. This is up from 15 percent in 2011. 
The report, ''Annual Music Study 2012,'' found that Apple still dominates the music download world, with 63 percent of all paid downloads taking place through iTunes.
Amazon's rise seems to be attributed to updates of the company's color Kindle Fire tablets last year. These tablets are capable of playing music directly purchased from AmazonMP3, the online retailer's digital music service. The Kindle Fire provides access to more than 18 million movies, TV shows, magazines and books, according to Amazon.
Although Amazon does not share numbers about sales of its Kindle Fire devices, calculations by Forrester Research estimate that Amazon sold close to five million Kindle Fire tablets by the end of last year. In comparison, Apple has sold more than 100 million iPads.
Although there has been huge growth in customers using streaming music services, including Pandora, Rdio and Spotify, NPD Group reported that the number of music downloads in the United States has remained relatively unaffected by these new music outlets.
''NPD estimates that average per-buyer spending on music downloads increased 6 percent, year over year, due largely to increases in music purchasing by teens, along with an increase in the number of consumers purchasing both single song tracks and full albums,'' the company said.
The report said 44 million Americans purchased at least one song or album last year.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Cancer Centers Racing to Map Patients' Genes

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
Electric fans growl like airplanes taking off and banks of green lights wink in a basement at Mount Sinai's medical school, where a new $3 million supercomputer makes quick work of huge amounts of genetic and other biological information.
Just a couple of miles away, a competitor, Weill Cornell Medical College and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell hospital are building a $650 million research tower. Across the street is a newly completed $550 million tower housing labs for another competitor, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
Major academic medical centers in New York and around the country are spending and recruiting heavily in what has become an arms race within the war on cancer. The investments are based on the belief that the medical establishment is moving toward the routine sequencing of every patient's genome in the quest for ''precision medicine,'' a course for prevention and treatment based on the special, even unique characteristics of the patient's genes. 
Among other projects, Harvard Medical School has its Center for Biomedical Informatics, which among a broad array of approaches uses mathematical modeling to predict when genetic information could lead to more effective treatment. Phoenix Children's Hospital opened the Ronald A. Matricaria Institute of Molecular Medicine in December, recruiting researchers from Los Angeles and Baltimore and planning to sequence the genomes of 30 percent of their childhood cancer patients in their search for better therapies.
Johns Hopkins, with its focus on public health, wants to develop a ''systematic genomic sequencing program'' over the next two years that will combine genomic analysis with a patient's environmental exposure, family history and other factors to support preventive medicine, said Scott Zeger, vice provost for research.
''There will be a moment in time when whole genome sequencing becomes ubiquitous throughout health care,'' said Peter Tonellato, director of the Harvard personalized medicine lab and a clinical investigator in pathology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. ''Let's say we figure out all the individuals who might have a cancer, and we can predict that with a relatively high level of accuracy. Then presumably we can take steps to avoid those, let's say, decades of treatment.''
Sequencing an entire genome currently costs in the neighborhood of $5,000 to $10,000, not including the interpretation of the information. It is usually not reimbursed by insurance, which is more likely to cover tests for genetic mutations that are known to be responsive to drugs. The treatments themselves, which are sometimes covered, typically cost several times that.
Even optimists warn that medicine is a long way from deriving useful information from routine sequencing, raising questions about the social worth of all this investment at a time of intense fiscal pressure on the health care system.
''What's the real health benefit?'' said Dr. Robert C. Green, a Harvard professor and a medical geneticist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. ''If you're a little bit cynical, you say, well, none, it's foolish.''
Dr. Green is part of a federally sponsored research project that is looking at the economic and medical impact of whole genome sequencing. ''One of the most prominent downsides is you start chasing risks for a whole lot of disease you'll never have, and generate a lot of cost for little benefits,'' he said.
He was not ready to dismiss the efforts of Mount Sinai and others, though. ''The other side of the question is, what was there to look up on the Internet when the first person got a personal computer? Very little.''
The race entails large sums spent not only on construction and technology but also recruitment, salaries and incentives for scientists like Weill-Cornell's Dr. Lewis Cantley, who was lured from Harvard, or Eric E. Schadt, plucked from the biotech world to head the Mount Sinai Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology.
NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell announced a new Institute for Precision Medicine, headed by a prostate cancer expert, in January. (The newly fashionable term ''precision medicine'' is an updated version of another genomics buzzword, ''personalized medicine.'') ''I am not in this for competition,'' said Dr. Laurie Glimcher, dean of Weill Cornell Medical College. ''I consider it collaboration, and I think we all have the same goal in mind, which is to cure disease.''
As Weill Cornell was courting Dr. Cantley, Memorial was pursuing another Harvard eminence, Dr. José Baselga, to be its physician in chief. ''It's a small world,'' Dr. Baselga, a breast cancer specialist, said, recalling that he and Dr. Cantley had exchanged notes on what each was being offered.
Memorial sequenced 16,000 tumors last year, mainly in lung cancer patients, Dr. Baselga said. In addition to the research building just completed on East 68th Street, a new outpatient building on East 74th Street, to be finished in 2018, will have whole floors dedicated to early-phase clinical trials.
The promise of whole genome sequencing can be seen in trials like one for bladder cancer at Memorial, where the effects of a drug normally used for breast cancer were disappointing in all but one of about 40 patients, whose tumor went away, Dr. Baselga said. Investigators sequenced the patient's whole genome. ''The patient had a mutation in one gene that was right on the same pathway as the therapy,'' Dr. Baselga said. ''And that explained why this worked.''
At Mount Sinai, Dr. Schadt, 48, an all-around risk aficionado who rides a BMW S 1000 RR Superbike, says he will use the mathematical principles of weather and markets forecasting to assess the risk of disease, and, given a disease, determine the subtype and best drugs to use.
Mount Sinai has collected what it calls an electronic ''biobank'' of information on 24,000 patients, who have agreed to participate in DNA sequencing and research over their lifetimes.
Some of that information will be fed into the supercomputer, which is named Minerva, after the Roman goddess of wisdom. Data storage alone is a challenge: one genome is 300 gigabytes of raw data per patient sample. Minerva's supervisor is Patricia Kovatch, 44, a computer engineer who led the team that built Kraken, the world's third fastest computer, in 2009, while working for the University of Tennessee at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
So much hiring has been going on surrounding personalized medicine at Mount Sinai, she said, that ''it feels like a start-up.''
At this point, scientists have only an imperfect understanding of how snippets of genetic material can determine a patient's chances of getting many diseases, especially more common ones. And patients are often reluctant to enroll in clinical trials of drugs still in development. But by setting up the right infrastructure -- collecting and sequencing patient DNA, identifying patients who could benefit from a particular drug and aggressively recruiting patients for trials -- the academic medical centers hope to play a bigger role in the development of new drugs, which could lead to lucrative patent royalties.
''The pharmaceutical companies need the expertise of academic medical centers, they need our patient groups to participate,'' said Dr. Dennis Charney, dean of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
Those groups could include patients like Kieran P. Holohan, a 45-year-old lawyer who received a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia in 2009. After his chemotherapy and the disease's remission, his original doctor pushed him to have a bone-marrow transplant to prolong the remission. A friend from his rugby club, a geneticist, told him that ''this has a lot to do with chromosomes,'' he recalled, and sent him to a doctor at Weill Cornell, Gail J. Roboz.
A relatively new laboratory test found that Mr. Holohan's leukemia had a mutation that meant that his chances of survival would not necessarily improve with the risky transplant. So he opted for more chemotherapy, and his cancer is still in remission.
''They didn't go with a suit off the rack,'' he said. ''This was bespoke medicine.''
His doctor is more cautious. ''Unfortunately, cancer is cured three times a day in the media,'' she said. But that does not mean that there might not be truly customized treatments for cancer 10 years down the line, she said.
Dr. James M. Crawford, chair of pathology at Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, said his institution, a competitor in some ways with the Manhattan medical centers, was ''quite literally on the fence'' about whether to join the race or to ''let more data emerge before we decide we are going to commit more resources to this.''
''What is the ultimate utility of this personalized medicine?'' he said. ''As a medical profession but also as a society we have not answered this question to our satisfaction.''

HEADLINE: In Europe, Paid Permits For Pollution Are Fizzling

BYLINE: By STANLEY REED and MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
LONDON -- On a showery afternoon last week in West London, a ripple of enthusiasm went through the trading floor of CF Partners, a privately owned financial company. The price of carbon allowances, shown in green lights on a board hanging from the ceiling, was creeping up toward three euros.
That is pretty small change -- $3.90, or only about 10 percent of what the price was in 2008. But to the traders it came as a relief after the market had gone into free fall to record lows two days earlier, after the European Parliament spurned an effort to shore up prices by shrinking the number of allowances.
''The market still stands,'' said Thomas Rassmuson, a native of Sweden who founded the company with Jonathan Navon, a Briton, in 2006. 
Still, Europe's carbon market, a pioneering effort to use markets to regulate greenhouse gases, is having a hard time staying upright. This year has been stomach-churning for the people who make their living in the arcane world of trading emissions permits. The most recent volatility comes on top of years of uncertainty during which prices have fluctuated from $40 to nearly zero for the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide.
More important, though, than lost jobs and diminished payouts for traders and bankers, the penny ante price of carbon credits means the market is not doing its job: pushing polluters to reduce carbon emissions, which most climate scientists believe contribute to global warming.
The market for these credits, officially called European Union Allowances, or E.U.A.'s, has been both unstable and under sharp downward pressure this year because of a huge oversupply and a stream of bad political and economic news. On April 16, for instance, after the European Parliament voted down the proposed reduction in the number of credits, prices dropped about 50 percent, to 2.63 euros from nearly 5, in 10 minutes.
''No one was going to buy'' on the way down, said Fred Payne, a trader with CF Partners.
Europe's troubled experience with carbon trading has also discouraged efforts to establish large-scale carbon trading systems in other countries, including the United States, although California and a group of Northeastern states have set up smaller regional markets.
Traders do not mind big price swings in any market -- in fact, they can make a lot of money if they play them right.
But over time, the declining prices for the credits have sapped the European market of value, legitimacy and liquidity -- the ease with which the allowances can be traded -- making it less attractive for financial professionals.
A few years ago, analysts thought world carbon markets were heading for the $2 trillion mark by the end of this decade.
Today, the reality looks much more modest. Total trading last year was 62 billion euros, down from 96 billion in 2011, according to Thomson Reuters Point Carbon, a market research firm based in Oslo. Close to 90 percent of that activity was in Europe, while North American trading represented less than 1 percent of worldwide market value.
Financial institutions that had rushed to increase staff have shrunk their carbon desks. Companies have also laid off other professionals who helped set up greenhouse gas reduction projects in developing countries like China and India.
When the emissions trading system was started in 2005, the goal was to create a global model for raising the costs of emitting greenhouse gases and for prodding industrial polluters to switch from burning fossil fuels to using clean-energy alternatives like wind and solar.
When carbon prices hit their highs of more than 30 euros in 2008 and companies spent billions to invest in renewables, policy makers hailed the market as a success. But then prices began to fall. And at current levels, they are far too low to change companies' behaviors, analysts say. Emitting a ton of carbon dioxide costs about the same as a hamburger.
''At the moment, the carbon price does not give any signal for investment,'' said Hans Bünting, chief executive of RWE, one of the largest utilities in Germany and Europe.
This cap-and-trade system in Europe places a ceiling on emissions. At the end of each year, companies like electric utilities or steel manufacturers must hand over to the national authorities the permits equivalent to the amount gases emitted.
Until the end of 2012, these credits were given to companies free according to their estimated output of greenhouse gases. Policy makers wanted to jump-start the trading market and avoid higher costs for consumers.
Beginning this year, energy companies must buy an increasing proportion of their credits in national auctions. Industrial companies like steel plants will follow later this decade.
Companies and other financial players like banks and hedge funds can also acquire and trade the allowances on exchanges like the IntercontinentalExchange, based in Atlanta. Over time the number of credits is meant to fall gradually, theoretically raising prices and cutting pollution.
The reality has been far different because of serious flaws in the design of the system. To win over companies and skeptical countries like Poland, which burn a lot of coal, far too many credits have been handed out.
At the same time, Europe's debilitating economic slowdown has sharply curtailed industrial activity and reduced the Continent's overall carbon emissions.
Steel making in Europe, for instance, has fallen about 30 percent since 2007, while new car registrations were at their lowest level last year since 1995.
Big investments in renewable energy sources like wind and solar also reduced carbon emissions, which have fallen about 10 percent in Europe since 2007.
As a result, there is a vast surplus of permits -- about 800 million tons' worth, according to Point Carbon. That has caused prices to plunge.
The cost of carbon is far too low to force electric utilities in Europe to switch from burning coal, a major polluter, to much cleaner natural gas. Just the opposite: Britain increased coal burning for electricity more than 30 percent last year, while cutting back gas use a similar amount, and other West European nations increased their coal use as well.
''The European energy scene is not a good one,'' said Andrew Brown, head of exploration and production at Royal Dutch Shell. ''They haven't got the right balance in terms of promoting gas.''
Fearing that prices might go to zero because of the huge oversupply, the European authorities proposed a short-term solution known as backloading, which would have delayed the scheduled auctioning of a large portion of the credits that were supposed to be sold over the next three years. But the European Parliament in Strasbourg voted the measure down on April 16.
Lawmakers were worried about tampering with the market as well as doing anything that might increase energy costs in the struggling economy.
''It was the worst possible moment to try to implement something like that,'' said Francesco Starace, chief executive of Enel Green Power, one of the largest European green-energy companies, which is based in Rome.
The European authorities, led by Connie Hedegaard, the European commissioner for climate change, have not given up on fixing the system. But analysts like Stig Scholset, at Point Carbon, say that there is not much the authorities can do in the short term and that prices may slump for months, if not years.
That means more tough times for financial institutions. Particularly troubled is the business of investing in greenhouse gas abatement projects like wind farms or hydroelectric dams in developing countries like China. JPMorgan Chase paid more than $200 million for one of the largest investors in these projects, EcoSecurities, in 2009.
Financiers say these projects used to be gold mines, generating credits that industrial companies could use to offset their emissions elsewhere. But so many credits have been produced by these projects -- on top of the existing oversupply of credits in Europe -- that they are trading at about a third of a euro.
Market participants say they see many rivals pulling back from world carbon markets. Deutsche Bank, the largest bank in Germany, has cut back its carbon trading. Smaller outfits like Mabanaft, based in Rotterdam, have also left the business.
Anthony Hobley, a lawyer in London and president of the Climate Market and Investors Association, an industry group, estimates that among the traders, analysts and bankers who flocked to the carbon markets in the early days, half may now be gone.
But carbon trading is unlikely to fade completely.
For one thing, European utilities and other companies now must buy the credits to comply with the rules. And they can buy credits to save for later use, when their emissions increase and the price of credits rises.
Despite Europe's sputters, carbon trading is beginning to gain traction in places like China, Australia and New Zealand.
In London, Mr. Rassmuson concedes that the business has turned out to be more up-and-down than he anticipated when he and his partner set up their firm in a tiny two-man office in 2006.
But he said his firm was benefiting from others' dropping out. He is also branching out into trading electric power and natural gas.
Like many in the carbon markets, he says what he is doing is not just about money.
''Trying to make the world more sustainable is important to us,'' he said. ''It is a good business opportunity that makes us proud.''

HEADLINE: Hagel, in Israel, Presses U.S. Agenda on Deterring Iran

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and ISABEL KERSHNER

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel opened a weeklong visit to the Middle East on Sunday by pressing an American agenda focused on deterring Iran -- including a significant new weapons deal for Israel -- coupled with a strong caution that it would be premature for Israel to opt for unilateral strikes on Tehran's nuclear program.
Mr. Hagel, who was subject to intense, even hostile scrutiny during his confirmation process over whether he was sufficiently supportive of Israel, hailed the ''very special relationship'' between the United States and Israel. He also repeatedly emphasized Israel's right to defend itself ''in a very dangerous, combustible region of the world.'' 
In preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, the United States has said that all options are on the table, including military action. But President Obama and his national security team have argued for more time to pursue diplomacy and economic sanctions. Some Israeli leaders, though, say the timeline for Iran to build a nuclear bomb is short, and they regularly speak of unilateral action.
In recent days, Israeli officials have again discussed their right to act against Iran. But American national security officials and military officers say it is unlikely that a strike by Israel would be sufficient to terminate Iran's nuclear program or halt any ambitions by Tehran to obtain nuclear weapons. Iran has denied it seeks to build nuclear weapons and has said its enrichment program is for civilian use.
On Sunday, Mr. Hagel acknowledged that there might be ''minor'' differences between the United States and Israel on the timeline in which Iran might develop nuclear weapons.
''I think it's important that we all keep our eye focused on the objective,'' he said. ''And there is no daylight there at all -- that Iran is prevented from acquiring that nuclear capacity.''
The current regimen of multilateral economic sanctions on Iran is among the toughest, most effective ever applied, Mr. Hagel said. ''We know through many measurements that those sanctions are hurting Iran -- significantly.''
Even so, he acknowledged that diplomacy and sanctions were not guaranteed to succeed. ''Military options, most of us feel, ought to be the last option,'' he said.
During his travels, Mr. Hagel will be pushing forward with a $10 billion arms package intended to further increase Israel's military edge over other powers in the region while also bolstering the armed forces of two important Persian Gulf allies, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Included in the weapons deal for Israel are tilt-rotor Osprey aircraft, which can be used for transporting troops and patrolling borders and nearby seas, as well as advanced radars for Israeli warplanes.
The United Arab Emirates will be allowed to purchase two dozen F-16 warplanes, and both Saudi Arabia and the emirates will be allowed to buy precision air-to-ground missiles. Those missiles are in a class of weapons described as ''standoff,'' meaning they can be launched from a safe distance against ground targets.
And two systems to be sold to Israel -- a new generation of aerial refueling tankers and advanced missiles that home in on radar signals to destroy air-defense sites -- would be important in any attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Mr. Hagel said the weapons sales served as ''another very clear signal to Iran.'' But American officials also made it clear that the new arms should not be interpreted as tacit approval for Israel to accelerate planning for an attack on Iran.
An Israeli government official said one goal of the visit was to strengthen the personal relationship between Mr. Hagel and his Israeli counterpart, Moshe Yaalon, since both are new in their jobs. Mr. Yaalon, a former military chief of staff and minister of strategic affairs, was named defense minister in mid-March.
Israeli analysts noted that discussions between the two are expected to focus in part on how Israel will pay for the new weapons package. ''An improvised solution is necessary,'' Alex Fishman, a military affairs analyst, wrote Sunday in the newspaper Yediot Aharonot, adding, ''If we have no money, we'll be left with nothing but paper.''

HEADLINE: Teaching the Limits of Media Freedom Is Tricky in the Gulf

BYLINE: By D.D. GUTTENPLAN

 BODY:
DOHA, QATAR -- When Matt J. Duffy first got a job teaching journalism at Zayed University in Abu Dhabi in 2010, he was thrilled.
Besides teaching courses in storytelling, journalistic ethics, and media regulation at Zayed, Dr. Duffy, an enthusiastic blogger, became a frequent contributor to Gulf News, a Dubai newspaper. He also was chairman of a conference on the role of the media in the Arab Spring, started a student chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists, and organized campus celebrations of World Press Freedom Day last May.
Three months later, he was expelled from the United Arab Emirates without any explanation. 
In Doha, the capital of the neighboring Gulf state of Qatar, students at Northwestern University's campus there were discussing recently the relevance of the admonition by the investigative journalist I.F. Stone that ''all governments lie'' to a society whose leaders seldom feel the need to explain their actions. The classroom debate was as spirited and irreverent as it might be on any U.S. campus, and the students -- a mix of Qataris, Gulf-based expatriates and foreigners -- seemed adept at negotiating the contradictions between the uninhibited reporting on Al Jazeera, a network based in Doha and funded by the local government, and the fact that as one student put it, ''If they don't like what you say here, they can deport you.''
''Journalism in the Arab world is in the middle of a revolution. As a result, journalism education is also in a revolution,'' Lawrence Pintak, the dean of the Edward R. Murrow College of Communication at Washington State University, said by telephone. He said that before Al Jazeera started in 1996, television news was an ''oxymoron.''
''Now everyone in the Gulf gets their news on TV,'' he said.
''The Gulf in particular is rife with inherent contradictions,'' Dr. Pintak added. ''This is a society where women are second-class citizens, yet at the same time they poured millions of dollars into Education City, where the sexes mix and where women get a very hard-edged education. It's a feudal society that is at the same time extremely modern.''
The author of ''The New Arab Journalist,'' Dr. Pintak, a veteran Middle East correspondent who also directed the journalism program at The American University in Cairo, described himself as ''a child of Watergate.''
''My generation all wanted to bring down a president,'' he said. ''That sense of the possible is what I see in Arab students today.''
Dr. Pintak said that Al Jazeera's widely respected reporting on the uprisings of the Arab Spring had been a major influence on ''Arab students, who have grown up with all this and want to emulate that kind of reporting. They grew up in very controlled societies. And they want to speak truth to power.''
At Northwestern in Qatar ''students write stories about guest workers, sexuality issues, all kinds of controversial subjects,'' said the dean, Everette E. Dennis, who described the effects of journalism education in the region as ''incremental.''
''At one level, what we do isn't that different from how journalism is taught elsewhere,'' he said. ''Occasionally books are stopped at customs and we have to go to the authorities to explain why we need them. But most of the faculty here feel they can say what they want. And talk in the classrooms is pretty blunt.''
''When you are a guest in someone else's country, what is your role?'' Dr. Dennis asked. ''We see ourselves as part of Qatar's effort to transform itself from a society based on extractive industry to a knowledge-based economy. But there is not a tradition of freedom of the press in the Gulf -- or in the Arab world generally.''
Shaun T. Schafer, the coordinator of the journalism program at Metropolitan State University in Denver, wrote his doctoral thesis on journalism education in the Middle East, drawing in part on his own experience teaching at Cairo University before the Arab Spring. ''There were things you just knew to never write about,'' he said by telephone. ''And it wasn't always political. For example you'd never write a business news feature, because if you mentioned a company by name, everyone would assume you'd been paid off.''
The techniques taught in journalism classes may have been the same as in the West, but most of Dr. Schafer's students saw no alternative to careers in state-controlled media. ''I was teaching them how to conduct interviews, how to write a news story. But then they would go to work for Al Ahram or one of the government-connected conglomerates,'' he said. ''Since the Arab Spring, all that has started to open up.''
Dr. Schafer gives Al Jazeera credit for changing students' attitudes and ambitions, but he laments the network's ''outward-facing'' focus. ''They've developed a really great reputation for looking at everyone else,'' he said. ''It's like being a great investigative reporter and being told 'Don't ever look at the company you work for.' That can lead to a damaging kind of cynicism.''
As Dr. Duffy learned the hard way, for journalism faculty members who do look, retribution can be swift.
''There is a disconnect between what the governments now say they want -- which is a Western-style education -- and the reality on the ground,'' he said by telephone. ''As soon as I got to Abu Dhabi I kept hearing about 'red lines' -- the shorthand they use for taboo subjects. Only you're never sure what they are. Nobody hands you a list of what not to say. It works to create an atmosphere of self-censorship.''
At Northwestern, Dr. Dennis admits that ''the situation in Dubai and the United Arab Emirates generally is pretty harsh, more than it is here,'' referring to Qatar, which ranks 110th on the latest Press Freedom Index issued by the group Reporters Without Borders. The United Arab Emirates is ranked 114th. The United States is 32nd.
But in Qatar, too, there have been disturbing incidents. According to a report on the Inside Higher Ed Web site, several Northwestern journalism students have been briefly detained by the police or security guards while carrying out reporting assignments or taking photographs. Most were quickly released, but one, Usama Hamed, spent 10 days in jail last year after taking photographs at the scene of a local fire after the police closed off the scene, according to Doha News.
''The whole culture of journalism is new in Doha,'' Asma Ajroudi, a junior in the program, told the higher education Web site. ''It's really unusual for a bunch of girls to carry around cameras and notepads and ask questions of random guys on the street.''
''We teach our students what freedom of expression means,'' Dr. Dennis said. ''We also teach the constraints on freedom in any society: libel, obscenity laws, improper use of financial information. Here in Qatar you wouldn't write an attack on the government, or personal criticism of the Emir, or an attack on Islam or the Prophet,'' he added. ''Is that self-censorship? Or is it just respect for local law and custom? We try to encourage a sense of skepticism about all authorities.''
The real test may come when students decide ''they want to be even bolder than their professors,'' said David L. Wheeler, the editor of Al Fanar, a new publication covering higher education in the Arab region. ''As journalism programs expand across the region, it will be interesting to watch how many universities will back up their students when they run into problems with the authorities because of what they write or broadcast, and how many of them will hide under weak excuses.''

HEADLINE: Taiwan Tries to Shore Up Its Defenses Against Samsung

BYLINE: By ANNIE HUANG | THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
TAIPEI -- Technology companies in Taiwan have long viewed Samsung as a major threat to their survival. As exports by Taiwanese makers of smartphones, memory chips and display panels sag, that threat is becoming increasingly clear.
The sales erosion has been driven by a weak global economy and by competition, some of it from South Korea, home of Samsung.
The slide has given rise to fears on this export-reliant island of 23 million that Samsung has deliberately focused on Taiwanese companies in a campaign to undermine their competitiveness in markets around the world.
Business Today, the top Taiwanese business magazine, gave voice to those fears last month in an extensive cover story accusing Samsung Electronics of embarking on a ''Kill Taiwan'' effort aimed at some of the island's leading high-technology companies, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., or TSMC, the world's largest contract maker of chips. 
Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission recently started an investigation into allegations that Samsung had planted unflattering comments about Taiwanese consumer electronics on the Internet to undermine their appeal.
While Taiwanese companies are facing a challenge from Samsung, industry analysts like John Brebeck, an adviser in Taipei for the technology development company Quantum International, says fears that Samsung is trying to crush Taiwan's lucrative technology industry miss the point.
Samsung is trying to make inroads in specific areas where it sees a big profit potential, he said, and these areas are also where Taiwanese companies have a major stake.
''It's not Taiwan as much as it's industry sectors that's motivating Samsung,'' Mr. Brebeck said.
A spokeswoman for Samsung Electronics, Jee Hae-Ryoung, said business strategies like the one described in the ''Kill Taiwan'' article did not exist at Samsung.
That is all little comfort for the Taiwan technology industry, which knows it must remain nimble and innovative to avoid the downward spiral of Japanese companies like Sony, which have been outrun by competitors including Samsung. Taiwanese high-technology exports totaled $98 billion last year, accounting for about 20 percent of the island's gross domestic product.
Fearing they will lose more ground, a number of Taiwanese manufacturers are carving out alliances with companies in Japan and the United States that are also competing with Samsung, in an effort to safeguard market share and give a lift to Taiwan's economy. A noted and longtime Taiwanese collaborator is Apple, which was replaced last year by Samsung as the biggest smartphone maker in the world.
For its part, the Taiwanese government is pressing the island's technology companies to work more closely with local component suppliers in an effort to achieve the kind of business integration that has helped to make Samsung such a formidable rival.
''We hope the tech companies can work together with their suppliers during the early product developing process, rather than wait till the new components are developed,'' said Stephen Su, a marketing analyst with Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute, a state-funded group that develops cutting-edge technologies and transfers them to the private sector.
Mr. Su said a major pilot project in the integration effort involved the smartphone maker HTC, which is trying to use processors made by local chip designers in its new mobile phones.
Until last year, HTC was one of the biggest smartphone makers, cashing in on its status as the first company to make models using Google's Android operation system. Now it is struggling as Samsung and Apple smartphones dominate.
Another emerging battlefield in the Taiwan-Samsung rivalry is the semiconductor industry, long a Taiwanese stronghold.
With its seemingly unlimited supply of capital, Samsung has moved from making memory chips, which store data, to more profitable logic chips, which serve as the brains of computers.
It is also increasing its expansion into the foundry business, which fabricates chips, directly challenging TSMC, which provides application chips to companies like Apple and Qualcomm.
The founder of TSMC, Morris Chang, has called Samsung a ''formidable rival'' but says his company is well prepared to meet the challenge.
In the past year, TSMC has significantly increased its capital spending to move more aggressively into the cutting-edge technologies of 20- and 16-nanometer chips, which are smaller and can run faster on less power.
The new technologies will enable TSMC to make the application processors that will run new iPhones and iPads. Apple currently gets such chips from Samsung, its main rival for smartphones and tablets. But analysts say that Apple's transition will be complicated, because Samsung is involved in part of the processors' design, in addition to fabricating the wafers that foundries normally handle.
''Apple has been waiting until TSMC is ready and able to catch up,'' Mr. Brebeck said. ''They are willing to wait because they want to get away from Samsung. TSMC understands it and is clearly moving rapidly in this direction.''
Apart from the new processors, TSMC has -- as of now -- a clear edge in its foundry business, with a well-established customer base.
Nicholas Chen, an attorney who advises many Taiwanese technology companies, said global companies like Apple might not trust Samsung as a chip supplier, fearing the Korean giant could steal their designs when making its own products.
TSMC's advantage, he said, is that it is a pure foundry that does not make chips under its own brand and is known to be ''proactively disciplined on protecting trade secrets.''
''If somebody is committed to this in this industry, they are clearly the example,'' Mr. Chen said.
Another Taiwanese company under serious threat from Samsung is Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, which makes devices for global clients, including Apple iPhones and iPads, at its huge plants on mainland China.
One of Hon Hai's problems involves its acquisition of Chimei Innolux, a maker of display panels. Since the deal was completed three years ago, Chimei has experienced large losses. A major factor has been its inability to compete with Samsung's capital spending and to produce at a profit the energy-saving Amoled advanced display panel, known for its superior picture quality.
In what appeared to be an effort to address the problem, the Hon Hai chairman, Terry Gou, negotiated last year to acquire a 10 percent stake in Sharp, the struggling Japanese company, which is the only major competitor to Samsung in display panels.
Apple was widely believed to be behind the Hon Hai bid, reflecting its eagerness to find a panel supplier other than Samsung for iPhones, iPads and future iTVs.
But the Hon Hai deal has been put on hold, apparently over Sharp's refusal to involve Mr. Gou in its management. In the meantime the company has sold 3 percent of itself to Samsung.
''Hon Hai is the biggest contract manufacturer -- the most cost-efficient and successful,'' Mr. Brebeck said. ''If you take down that giant, you hit a bunch of Taiwanese firms, and you hit Apple too.''
Mr. Su, of Industrial Technology Research, said that Samsung had the upper hand in attracting top talent, a crucial element in the high-technology battle.
The Korean conglomerate has aggressively sought workers from Japan, China and Taiwan, often luring skilled employees away with higher pay, and has sent large number of Koreans to study abroad and learn about overseas markets, Mr. Su said.
He pointed to flexible panels -- expected to be used for watches, street lighting and a number of other applications -- as the next battleground in the Samsung-Taiwan rivalry.
''Taiwanese makers can maintain their edge for least another three years, but after that it depends on how hard they can work,'' he said. ''The Taiwan government is trying to relax various rules to help our high-tech industries, but we are lagging behind South Korea in this area because they have made it the strategic national goal to attract and facilitate high-tech investments.''

HEADLINE: The Jobless Trap

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
F.D.R. told us that the only thing we had to fear was fear itself. But when future historians look back at our monstrously failed response to economic depression, they probably won't blame fear, per se. Instead, they'll castigate our leaders for fearing the wrong things.
For the overriding fear driving economic policy has been debt hysteria, fear that unless we slash spending we'll turn into Greece any day now. After all, haven't economists proved that economic growth collapses once public debt exceeds 90 percent of G.D.P.? 
Well, the famous red line on debt, it turns out, was an artifact of dubious statistics, reinforced by bad arithmetic. And America isn't and can't be Greece, because countries that borrow in their own currencies operate under very different rules from those that rely on someone else's money. After years of repeated warnings that fiscal crisis is just around the corner, the U.S. government can still borrow at incredibly low interest rates.
But while debt fears were and are misguided, there's a real danger we've ignored: the corrosive effect, social and economic, of persistent high unemployment. And even as the case for debt hysteria is collapsing, our worst fears about the damage from long-term unemployment are being confirmed.
Now, some unemployment is inevitable in an ever-changing economy. Modern America tends to have an unemployment rate of 5 percent or more even in good times. In these good times, however, spells of unemployment are typically brief. Back in 2007 there were about seven million unemployed Americans -- but only a small fraction of this total, around 1.2 million, had been out of work more than six months.
Then financial crisis struck, leading to a terrifying economic plunge followed by a weak recovery. Five years after the crisis, unemployment remains elevated, with almost 12 million Americans out of work. But what's really striking is the huge number of long-term unemployed, with 4.6 million unemployed more than six months and more than three million who have been jobless for a year or more. Oh, and these numbers don't count those who have given up looking for work because there are no jobs to be found.
It goes without saying that the explosion of long-term unemployment is a tragedy for the unemployed themselves. But it may also be a broader economic disaster.
The key question is whether workers who have been unemployed for a long time eventually come to be seen as unemployable, tainted goods that nobody will buy. This could happen because their work skills atrophy, but a more likely reason is that potential employers assume that something must be wrong with people who can't find a job, even if the real reason is simply the terrible economy. And there is, unfortunately, growing evidence that the tainting of the long-term unemployed is happening as we speak.
One piece of evidence comes from the relationship between job openings and unemployment. Normally these two numbers move inversely: the more job openings, the fewer Americans out of work. And this traditional relationship remains true if we look at short-term unemployment. But as William Dickens and Rand Ghayad of Northeastern University recently showed, the relationship has broken down for the long-term unemployed: a rising number of job openings doesn't seem to do much to reduce their numbers. It's as if employers don't even bother looking at anyone who has been out of work for a long time.
To test this hypothesis, Mr. Ghayad then did an experiment, sending out résumés describing the qualifications and employment history of 4,800 fictitious workers. Who got called back? The answer was that workers who reported having been unemployed for six months or more got very few callbacks, even when all their other qualifications were better than those of workers who did attract employer interest.
So we are indeed creating a permanent class of jobless Americans.
And let's be clear: this is a policy decision. The main reason our economic recovery has been so weak is that, spooked by fear-mongering over debt, we've been doing exactly what basic macroeconomics says you shouldn't do -- cutting government spending in the face of a depressed economy.
It's hard to overstate how self-destructive this policy is. Indeed, the shadow of long-term unemployment means that austerity policies are counterproductive even in purely fiscal terms. Workers, after all, are taxpayers too; if our debt obsession exiles millions of Americans from productive employment, it will cut into future revenues and raise future deficits.
Our exaggerated fear of debt is, in short, creating a slow-motion catastrophe. It's ruining many lives, and at the same time making us poorer and weaker in every way. And the longer we persist in this folly, the greater the damage will be.

HEADLINE: Broken Justice in the Bronx

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Quietly over time, the gleaming glass building near Yankee Stadium that houses the Bronx criminal courts has become a place where delay and dysfunction are the norm and central ideals of the American justice system -- especially the promise of a speedy trial -- have been disgracefully subverted.
The state court system has a guideline that requires most felony cases to go to trial or be resolved within 180 days of the suspect's indictment. While criminal courts in every borough in New York City violate that guideline, in the Bronx, the city's poorest borough, 73 percent of all felony cases exceeded the 180-day limit, as of January. 
In recent years, there were more defendants waiting years in jail for their trials in the Bronx than in the rest of the boroughs combined. The Bronx accounted for more than half of the cases in the city's criminal courts that were more than two years old, and for two-thirds of people held for more than five years awaiting trial.
A powerful series by William Glaberson of The Times has painted a devastating portrait of a lackadaisical court culture in which the main actors in the Bronx seem utterly paralyzed or incompetent. None appear to have the necessary drive to ensure that justice is done for the defendants, the victims or the public.
The Bronx district attorney, Robert Johnson, and the prosecutors serving under him show little sense of urgency as cases age. In one ludicrous case, an assistant district attorney actually left on vacation in the middle of a trial she was working on. Defense lawyers have been allowed to exploit delays to help their clients, since witnesses can move away and evidence can become tainted; sometimes the defense lawyers simply delay cases to suit their own schedules. And there are the judges -- many elected through a political machine-controlled process -- who are unable or unwilling to exert strong control over their courtrooms to resolve cases in a reasonable time.
The inordinate delays impose heavy tolls. Innocent people remain in jail for crimes they did not commit. Memories fade, evidence dries up, and witnesses disappear, making convicting the guilty harder. Victims and their families suffer, as does faith in the justice system's ability to protect the public.
In one case, as reported by Mr. Glaberson, Bronx prosecutors did not try a defendant accused of murder until five years after the crime. The defendant ended up going free after the first police officer to testify answered that he could not remember numerous details under questioning by the defense lawyer. In another murder case, which also resulted in a not-guilty verdict, the star witness at the trial four years after the crime testified that he could no longer be sure who pulled the trigger.
As old cases have piled up in the Bronx, conviction rates have declined to less than half in jury trials, far lower than elsewhere in the city and well below the national rate. In 2011, Bronx prosecutors won guilty verdicts in 46 percent of their jury trials, court data shows, down from 67 percent in 1989, when Mr. Johnson took office.
While that dismal record may be partly a product of the skepticism Bronx juries have of the police, it also raises questions about whether the breakdown in the borough's court system is letting dangerous criminals go free. Like many other states, New York has slashed court budgets in the past few years in the face of a harsh recession. But the problem in the Bronx began festering long before that and goes beyond a shortage of resources.
Because of budget problems, the court day has been shortened and now ends at 4:30. But a lot more could be accomplished if judges required all participants in proceedings to show up on time -- something that rarely happens now -- and stopped accepting prosecutors' and defense lawyers' weak excuses for delays.
Part of the blame for the current mess belongs to state court administrators. They should have acted sooner to dismantle the well-meaning but unsuccessful reorganization plan put in place in 2004 by Judith Kaye, then the state's chief judge, and take muscular action to address the Bronx backlog. In a positive step in January, the state's current chief judge, Jonathan Lippman, dispatched a ''SWAT team'' of judges to deal with the delays. According to court officials, they have already cut the number of cases two years or older by 21 percent, mostly by arranging plea deals and dismissing cases.
But the problem runs deep. Changing the culture will require a new commitment by Mr. Johnson, Bronx criminal court judges and court administrators to improve the management and work ethic in every part of the system. It will also require enlisting more seasoned defense lawyers to take cases in the Bronx. Some additional financing for court employees will be needed, too. But no management reform will be sufficient or lasting unless the city's political and judicial leaders raise expectations about what a well-functioning criminal justice system requires.

HEADLINE: Visa Reforms for Skilled Workers

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
The immigration reform bill introduced by a bipartisan group of senators last week would make it easier for skilled workers to come to this country while toughening rules to prevent abuse in temporary work visas. 
Many skilled workers and their families spend a decade or more waiting for employment-based green cards, which are capped at 140,000 a year and are subject to per-country limits. The bill addresses this problem by temporarily raising limits to clear a backlog of 234,000 applications for employment-based permanent visas. It would also exempt spouses and children of workers from the limits, which should free up nearly 80,000 visas a year.
It also creates a ''merit based'' category of green cards while getting rid of permanent visas for siblings of citizens and for people from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. These new visas would be given to people on the basis of points granted for factors like the college degrees they have earned; whether their siblings are citizens; how highly they score in an English proficiency test; and whether they are from an underrepresented country. This proposal is deeply troubling because it appears to buy into the zero-sum thinking that pits employment-based immigration against family-sponsored and diversity immigration. America should welcome both groups of people, not choose between them.
The senators also want to expand the popular H-1B category of work visas to 135,000, from 85,000 -- a quota that is often reached in a matter of weeks or months every year. The new, higher limit would be allowed to increase or decrease by as many as 10,000 visas a year based on demand for them and government unemployment data. In an important provision, people on such visas will be able to switch employers more easily, making it harder for companies to pay workers below-market salaries.
Another provision would clamp down on abuse by imposing higher fees and other restrictions on employers who have a large percentage of their work force on such visas. Over several years, the bill would force these companies, many of which are the United States operations of outsourcing firms from India, to reduce the number of their workers who are foreigners to less than 50 percent.
While some provisions need to be improved, the bill sets the right tone for making America more hospitable to skilled and hard-working immigrants.

HEADLINE: Conservative Tobacco Magnate Wins Presidential Race in Paraguay

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Jonathan Gilbert contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ASUNCIÓN, Paraguay -- Horacio Cartes, a Paraguayan tobacco magnate, faced various challenges during his presidential bid. He was pressed to explain why antinarcotics police officers apprehended a plane carrying cocaine and marijuana on his ranch in 2000; why he went to prison in 1989 on currency fraud charges; and why he had never even voted in past general elections.
Still, voters across the country seemed ready to give Mr. Cartes the benefit of the doubt, handing him a solid victory in Paraguay's presidential election on Sunday. He took 46 percent of the vote against 37 percent for his main opponent, Efraín Alegre of the ruling Liberal Party, with about 80 percent of the voting stations reporting. Electoral authorities declared Mr. Cartes the winner. 
Mr. Cartes's victory returns the presidency to the conservative Colorado Party -- which held a tight grip on power for six decades, until 2008 -- and opens a new phase of international scrutiny of Paraguay, the landlocked nation with a long reputation as a haven for smugglers.
Paraguay's governing institutions were already the focus of condemnation throughout Latin America in June 2012, after legislators here hastily ousted the president, Fernando Lugo, a former Roman Catholic bishop who had been elected amid hopes that he would diminish inequality in one of South America's poorest countries.
Less than a year after Mr. Lugo was removed from office in a Senate trial lasting just a few hours, Mr. Cartes, one of Paraguay's richest men, drew upon the extensive political machine of the Colorado Party, which he joined in 2009.
The race this year was marred by various claims of vote buying, including a video appearing to show a Colorado senator reaching a deal with Liberal Party operatives to buy votes for about $25 apiece in Caaguazú, an eastern department, or province. Still, many voters here shrugged off such accusations as somewhat par for the course in Paraguay.
''We all make errors; nobody is perfect,'' said Mario Gavilán, a carpenter, who voted for Mr. Cartes. ''People are just jealous of his wealth. They want to dirty his name.''
Mr. Cartes, through spokesmen, refused more than half a dozen requests here for an interview, and his campaign advisers tightly limited access to the candidate. But in some of his public statements after his foray into politics, he sought to defend himself against claims that he had been involved in an array of illicit activities.
About his time in prison in 1989 for currency fraud, Mr. Cartes -- who controls a web of companies, including a cigarette manufacturer, a bank, cattle ranches and a soft-drink bottler -- told reporters that he had a ''tranquil conscience'' about a matter in which he was eventually cleared of wrongdoing by Paraguayan courts.
As for the drug-trafficking claim, he contended in a tense television interview in March that the plane carrying the illegal cargo made an emergency landing on an airstrip at one of the ranches he owns. ''I wouldn't want to be president if I had ties to drug traffickers, and I also don't plan to legalize anything,'' he said.
Responding to a host of other accusations against him, including money laundering and the smuggling of cigarettes into neighboring Brazil, Mr. Cartes said at a news conference on Sunday that the claims were attempts to smear him. ''I was a victim,'' he told reporters. ''A lot of things are said in a campaign.''
Across downtown Asunción on Sunday, low expectations about the race were evident in the colorful graffiti painted on dozens of buildings, including phrases like ''Our dreams don't fit in your ballot boxes.''
At several polling stations, voters expressed dismay about having to choose between Mr. Cartes and Mr. Alegre, both of whom share ideologically similar conservative policies. During the campaign, Mr. Alegre had also been accused of irregularities while he served in the cabinet of Mr. Lugo.
''I don't have much confidence in the legitimacy of the elections,'' said Luis Sacú, 33, who works for a real estate agent here. He said he had cast his vote for Mario Ferreiro, a leftist candidate. ''The Colorado Party is so powerful and has so much money, and people are willing to sell their vote for just a few dollars.''
Still, Mr. Cartes struck a chord with some voters, appealing to social conservatives and some in the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church with disparaging comments comparing gay people to ''monkeys'' and saying theatrically that he would shoot himself in his own testicles if his son wanted to marry another man.
While Paraguay's economy is growing thanks to commodities exports, Mr. Cartes will face festering challenges, including glaring disparities in landholdings and income, scrutiny over his own business dealings and a resilient guerrilla organization, the Paraguayan People's Army, which was involved in two attacks on security forces on Sunday in a remote region, leaving at least two people dead, a police officer and a member of the rebel group.
Some voters, while expressing skepticism about Paraguay's political system in general, were ready to support Mr. Cartes. ''Nobody clean gets to the top in our failed democracy,'' said Sebastián Soria, 30, the owner of a marketing company.
Mr. Soria said he had voted for Mr. Cartes. ''Every business he touches, he improves,'' he said. ''If he can bring just a little of that to government, the country will improve.''

HEADLINE: Princeton Chooses Its Provost to Become Its Next President

BYLINE: By VIVIAN YEE

 BODY:
Princeton University announced on Sunday that Christopher L. Eisgruber, a constitutional scholar who has been the university's provost for nine years, would be its next president.
Mr. Eisgruber, 51, is replacing Shirley M. Tilghman, who became the second woman to lead an Ivy League university when she rose to the Princeton presidency in 2001. She announced her retirement last September. 
The announcement followed a six-month search. Mr. Eisgruber -- who graduated from the university in 1983 and returned as a professor in 2001 before becoming its No. 2 officer -- will start on July 1, becoming the university's 20th president.
''Chris Eisgruber has all of the qualities we were looking for in Princeton's next president,'' Kathryn A. Hall, the chairwoman of the board of trustees, said in a statement.
''He has played a central role in many of the key initiatives of recent years, some of which he now will be responsible for bringing to fruition.''
Among those initiatives were a $1.88 billion fund-raising campaign, several large construction projects and an expansion of the university's financial aid program. But Mr. Eisgruber also helped oversee contraction after the 2008 financial crisis, which shrank Princeton's endowment by 22.7 percent, prompting painful cutbacks and layoffs.
In an interview, Mr. Eisgruber defined Princeton's core values as ''our commitment to be simultaneously a great research university and the world's best liberal arts college,'' as well as to achieve greater inclusiveness. He has championed giving students more opportunities to study abroad and has helped forge research partnerships with universities in Asia and Europe.
He has also pushed to expand Princeton's online education offerings, a challenge facing many universities.
''The important thing will be to ask, how can we and other universities participate in that in a way that improves, rather than diminishes, the quality of higher education in this country?'' he said.
''Good education is always going to involve intense engagement and interaction between students and faculty, and it would be a mistake to think new media would make that less important.''
A native of Corvallis, Ore., Mr. Eisgruber majored in physics at Princeton and spent two years as a Rhodes scholar before studying law at the University of Chicago. He was a clerk at the Supreme Court for Justice John Paul Stevens and taught at New York University Law School before returning to Princeton in 2001 as a professor of public affairs and director of its program in law and public affairs.
His elevation after years as provost follows that of Peter Salovey, the provost of Yale University, who was named Yale's president in November.
Mr. Eisgruber's wife, Lori A. Martin, is a partner in the New York office of the law firm Wilmer Hale. Their son, Danny, is a freshman at Princeton High School.
Mr. Eisgruber, who continued to teach and write about legal issues after becoming provost in 2004, said he expected to continue teaching as president, as Dr. Tilghman did.
''Interacting with Princeton students is just such a high and a way of keeping in touch with the enterprise,'' he said.

HEADLINE: City Report Shows More Were Near Poverty in 2011

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
The rise in New York City's poverty rate as a result of the recession has apparently eased, but not before pushing nearly half of the city's population into the ranks of the poor or near-poor in 2011, according to an analysis by the Bloomberg administration.
That year, according to the city's measure, about 46 percent of New Yorkers were making less than 150 percent of the poverty threshold, a benchmark used to describe people who are not officially poor but who still struggle to get by. That represents a rise of more than three percentage points since 2009, when the nation's recession officially ended. 
By the city's definition, a family with two adults and two children could earn $46,416 a year and still fall within 150 percent of the city' poverty level. Unlike the official but rigid federal poverty level, the city's measure balances the added value of tax credits, food stamps, rent subsidies and other benefits against expenses like health and day care, housing and commuting that reflect New York's higher living costs. The city says a two-adult, two-child family is poor if it earns less than $30,949 a year. The federal government sets the level at $22,811.
Though more New Yorkers were working in 2011 than the year before, larger shares of children and working adults were classified as poor in 2011, and the proportions of Asians, noncitizens and Queens residents -- overlapping groups -- each rose by more than four percentage points since 2008.
The city's analysis warned that cutbacks in federal programs could threaten any recovery and place pressure on the next mayor to maintain or expand public assistance.
''The recent increase in the state minimum wage affects the working poor and near-poor, and paid sick days are important, but missing rungs in the ladder make it really hard to climb out of poverty,'' said Nancy Rankin, vice president for policy research and advocacy at the Community Service Society, which lobbies on behalf of the poor.
''The next mayor is going to face a very difficult budget situation in which he or she will struggle to maintain basic services and have little room to expand welfare-related programs or services to needy New Yorkers, a fiscal situation that is getting very little attention in the current mayoral race,'' said Steven Malanga, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative group.
The author of the analysis, Mark Levitan, director of poverty research for the Center for Economic Opportunity, said the near-poor -- people making up to 50 percent above the poverty level -- were often not eligible for food stamps and other benefits because of their higher incomes. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg established the center in 2006 to devise antipoverty strategies.
''After two bad years, things are not getting worse, and that's the beginning of things getting better,'' Dr. Levitan said. ''The city we see in 2011,'' he added, ''is one that's at a turning point. From 2008 to 2010, we see a city deeply impacted by the recession -- big declines in unemployment, earned income and increases in poverty. We get to 2011 and things have leveled off. We haven't turned the corner, but that may occur soon.''
More New Yorkers were poor in 2011 -- 19.3 percent by the federal rate and 21.3 percent by the city's standard -- compared with 16.8 and 19.8 percent in 2007, before the recession. Still, while the city's measure is the highest since it was first calculated in 2005, the official rate is lower in New York than in many other major cities.
While the center's annual report, to be released this week, suggested that a better job market may have reversed the rising poverty in 2012, its outlook for this year and beyond was more problematic.
''Coinciding with the end of the slump in the job market is the end of the recession-related expansion of the safety net,'' Dr. Levitan wrote, which could reduce food stamp benefits on top of cutbacks in unemployment insurance, tax credits and the payroll tax rate.
With some government programs under fire in Washington, Dr. Levitan credited those benefits and others with keeping more people out of poverty. Without food stamps alone, the city's poverty rate would have soared by 3.6 percentage points, to nearly 25 percent.
Housing subsidies and the tax system make the biggest dents in the poverty rate (lowering the rate by 6.2 percent and 3.6 percent) while unreimbursed medical care drains income and drives more people into poverty (another 2.9 percent) than any other nondiscretionary expense.
Poverty rates declined among single adults with children, but rose most among Hispanic and Asian New Yorkers. The report said that since 2008, the rate was ''remarkably'' flat among blacks.
Since 2005, the Bronx has remained the poorest borough. The poverty rate in Manhattan then was about the same as in Queens, but it is now about even with Staten Island, which used to have the lowest share of poor people.
''In the very short term, I'm sort of an optimist,'' Dr. Levitan said. ''Looking further, I see storm clouds with tremendous pressure for austerity. My fear is that we are moving to another dynamic where employment and earnings are rising and the safety net is contracting.''

HEADLINE: Europe's Leaders Hear Call To Do More to Spur Growth

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For another year, the annual spring meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund ended with a single, strong message aimed at Europe: Do more.
Yet in a change, signs suggested that European leaders were starting to agree, with more high-ranking ministers and officials talking up the need to slow the pace of budget cutting and bolster growth on the Continent.
At the outset of the gathering of finance ministers and central bankers last week, the I.M.F. lowered its global growth forecasts, again citing weakness from Europe. And Christine Lagarde, managing director of the fund, separated nations into three groups that might be described as strong, trying and laggards. 
In the first group she placed the developing and emerging economies that are the engine of global growth. In the second she put countries that are gaining momentum in their recoveries, like the United States. The third group, she said, contains countries that continue to struggle with their policy response to the crisis -- not growing, and hindering global growth. That group includes many countries in high-income Europe, including Britain, Germany and Italy.
At a news conference during the meetings, Ms. Lagarde said such countries should try ''anything that works'' to create jobs. That starts ''with growth and a good policy mix, which relies on not just one policy but a set of policies that will include fiscal consolidation at the right pace,'' she said, also citing structural changes and loose monetary policy as necessary.
The debate at the meetings focused on helping to identify that right mix of policies, with officials from the fund and countries including the United States arguing that austerity had sapped too much demand, too soon, from the Continent. In the past, European officials tended to brush off such advice. And some powerful officials continued to do so last week, instead emphasizing budget cutting to soothe financial markets.
''Fiscal and financial sector adjustments remain crucial to regain lost credibility and strengthen confidence,'' said Wolfgang Schäuble, the finance minister of Germany and a powerful voice promoting austerity in Europe. ''At the current juncture, it is in particular the responsibility of the advanced economies, including Japan and the U.S., to follow through with ambitious fiscal consolidation over the medium term.''
George Osborne, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, echoed that sentiment, even as high-level officials at the fund repeatedly criticized the government of Prime Minister David Cameron for its campaign of budget cuts.
''The priority for most advanced economies is still to restore fiscal sustainability,'' Mr. Osborne said in a statement. ''Continued consolidation is needed over the medium term, supported by highly accommodative monetary policy.''
But the fund downgraded its growth estimates for several large European economies, including those of France and Germany, last week. Many have re-entered a period of economic contraction, with their unemployment rates continuing to rise. In light of that, other European officials said a renewed focus on growth -- by slowing budget cuts, changing deficit targets or taking other measures -- might be appropriate.
''They are preaching to the converted,'' Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, was quoted by Reuters.
''In the early phase of the crisis, it was essential to restore the credibility of fiscal policy in Europe because that was fundamentally questioned by market forces,'' Mr. Rehn added. ''Now, as we have restored the credibility in the short term, that gives us the possibility of having a smoother path of fiscal adjustment in the medium term.''
In a communiqué, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of 20 large economies said: ''We have agreed that while progress has been made, further actions are required to make growth strong, sustainable and balanced.''
They urged a closer banking union in the euro zone and for ''large surplus economies'' to take ''further steps to boost domestic sources of growth.''
In her opening remarks, Ms. Lagarde also cited Japan as having continued to struggle with slow growth. But at the spring meetings, Tokyo won plaudits for its ambitious new campaign of fiscal and monetary stimulus to bolster demand and end the deflation that has plagued the economy for more than a decade.
Some finance ministers had questioned the Bank of Japan's aggressive easing of monetary policy, arguing that it was aimed at pushing down the value of the yen and as a result unfairly favoring Japanese exports. If other countries followed suit to try to devalue their currencies, it could set off a round of ''currency wars,'' some warned.
But the Group of 20 communiqué stated that ''Japan's recent policy actions are intended to stop deflation and support domestic demand,'' a tacit nod to the recent round of easing. And the I.M.F. raised its estimates of Japan's growth on the back of the government's new policy moves.
At the meetings, Dr. Jim Yong Kim, the new president of the World Bank, also outlined his policy goals: the effective eradication of extreme poverty in a generation. The world has achieved the Millennium Development Goal of halving extreme poverty by 2015. To cut the rate to 3 percent by 2030, Dr. Kim said, would require strong, inclusive growth.

HEADLINE: Civil Rights, One Person and One Photo at a Time

BYLINE: MAURICE BERGER


HIGHLIGHT: In the midst of the national struggle for civil rights, James Karales, born into an immigrant Greek family in Ohio, turned his camera on the individuals fighting for rights and respect. 

 BODY:
The hands of the father and his young daughter wave emphatically: the two are not in agreement. The man talks. His eyes are closed; he looks pained. The child listens, but gazes at a plate of cookies on the dinner table.
The scene is not unusual: a father is telling his daughter that she will not be going to an amusement park. But he is doing so not because it is a school day, or because he is punishing her. He fears for her safety. 
The father is Martin Luther King Jr.; the child is his 7-year-old daughter Yolanda; and the two are engaged in a conversation that no parent wants to have. He is explaining to the girl for the first time the hazards of segregation and the reasons she cannot visit Fun Town, a popular but restricted theme park in Atlanta.
This photograph, (Slide 6) which first appeared in a 1963 photo essay in Look magazine, is emotionally intimate and psychologically insightful, like many of the images in "Controversy and Hope: The Civil Rights Photographs of James Karales" (University of South Carolina Press). The book, by Julian Cox, provides a singular opportunity to re-evaluate the innovative work of Mr. Karales, who died in 2002, at age 71.
As Dr. King's aide and confidante Andrew Young notes in the book's foreword, Mr. Karales's photographs were distinguished by their ability to reveal the "complexity of emotions intertwined with the hopes and hardships of the struggle." Their personal, contemplative approach was not always in step with a mainstream press enthralled by the high drama of historic speeches, conflagrations and demonstrations. This approach may also have been the reason Dr. King, who was fiercely protective of his family, granted the photographer unprecedented access to them.
Mr. Karales typically favored the individual over the collective, and his photographs are more like artful portraits than the straightforward documentation of momentous events. In his reporting on the Selma to Montgomery march for voting rights in the spring of 1965, for example, he frequently photographed participants - the famous and the unknown - up close, carefully rendering their individuality and state of mind.
Photographer unknown, courtesy of the estate of James Karales James Karales in Vietnam, 1965.
His images of the march resonate with nuances of emotion and psychology: a tight, brooding shot of a young demonstrator in profile; the bitter, scowling face of a segregationist being arrested (Slide 16); a black child nestled contently on the shoulders of a bearded white man (Slide 11); the indelibly memorable photograph of an African-American teenager staring wearily into the camera (Slide 12), the word "vote" emblazoned on his whitewashed forehead.
This intimate viewpoint aligned Mr. Karales more with the strategies of the black press than those of the mainstream media. Just as the mainstream media dispensed profiles about white people - relegating people of color to stereotypical, sensationalistic or communal reporting - publications owned and operated by African-Americans covered the private lives of the ordinary and famous alike.
These profiles, accompanied by photographs or drawings, were the mainstay of one of the earliest black pictorial magazines, The Crisis, edited by the civil rights leader W. E. B. Du Bois. In the civil rights era, the profiles continued to have a central role in the periodicals of the Johnson Publishing Company - Ebony, Jet and Tan, the first black women's magazine - subtly challenging the status quo by emphasizing, rather than concealing, African-American humanity, individuality and psychological nuance.
If Mr. Karales's method was akin to that of the black press, it was driven not by sympathy - the motivation Mr. Cox ascribes to it - but by empathy. Born into an immigrant Greek family in Canton, Ohio, in 1930, Mr. Karales struggled to learn English. He experienced firsthand the hardships of a community routinely viewed as exotic, inferior and not quite American. After working blue-collar manufacturing jobs, he enrolled in Ohio University and studied photography.
Mr. Karales was determined to use his camera in the service of social justice. From his first photo-essay - a tender, keenly observed profile of Canton's working-class, Greek-American community (above) - he strove to reveal the complexity of his subjects by stressing the individual details lost amid collective stereotypes and biases.
Over a half-century career, including a staff position at Look that gave him a national platform, Mr. Karales continually fixed his lens on the marginal, the besieged and the politically fraught: coal miners in the racially integrated but economically depressed town of Rendville, Ohio; racial discrimination in organized religion; the quagmire of the Vietnam War; and segregation in New York City. (Those last photographs went unpublished, perhaps because they upended the era's myth of Northern racial tolerance.)
Nowhere is Mr. Karales's defiance of racial clichés more apparent than in his 1960 Look profile of Richard Adams, a pioneering speech therapist and social worker. The photo-essay inverted racial typecasting: Adams was black, his students were mostly white, and they coexisted not in a Northern city but in rural Iowa. These images of adoring youngsters and their dedicated teacher spoke to the possibility of racial harmony. But they also called into question an abiding myth of integration: that African-Americans had the most to gain from it.
Mr. Karales's focus on the individual succeeded - paradoxically, as Mr. Cox notes - because it added to his work "some sense of a common, shared humanity." By affirming our fundamental similarities, his images implored Americans, in an age of turmoil and transition, to re-examine their own humanity. Rather than presenting predictable scenes of racial disunity, they challenged a nation to face the individuals it had reduced to collective symbols of fear, condescension and hate. There, in the midst of crowds and chaos, he found one person, one image.

HEADLINE: ABB to Buy Power-One for $1 Billion

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The Swiss engineering company ABB has agreed to buy the American renewable energy firm Power-One for $1 billion. 

 BODY:
LONDON - The Swiss engineering company ABB agreed on Monday to buy the American renewable energy firm Power-One for $1 billion. 
Power-One makes so-called solar inverters, which are used to channel solar energy into electricity grids. ABB is offering Power-One stockholders $6.35 a share, 57 percent above its closing share price on Friday. 
ABB said the acquisition would help increase its market share in the global solar power market, which is expected to grow by around 10 percent annually over the next decade, according to the International Energy Agency. 
Despite the expected growth in the renewable energy industry, many green energy firms like Solyndra and Suntech Power have fallen victim to a global economic slowdown that has cut demand for electricity across the Western world, while subsidies for wind and solar projects have also been reduced.
Unlike other solar companies that have faced tough financial headwinds, Power-One, the world's second-largest maker of solar inverters after SMA Solar Technology of Germany, reported a pretax profit of around $120 million last year. It employs more than 3,000 people, mostly in the United States, China and Slovakia, according to a company statement. The company's share price, however, has fallen 66 percent from a record high in 2010.
The deal for Power-One is expected to close in the second half of the year.
Credit Suisse and the law firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton advised ABB, while Goldman Sachs and the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher advised Power-One.

HEADLINE: Replicating Research: Austerity and Beyond

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Powerful political arguments have been made on flawed data, and it&#8217;s time that such research was better policed, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. 
The Harvard economists Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff ironically titled their much-celebrated book on financial instability and economic growth "This Time Is Different," asserting that the last crisis was not unique. Rather, they contend it was the most recent manifestation of an age-old tendency for both governments and private investors to delude themselves about the dangers of debt.
Doubly ironic, then, that Thomas Herndon, a graduate student in my department, was seeking to replicate an article that Professors Reinhart and Rogoff published in 2010 for an econometrics class when he discovered evidence of errors in their cross-national analysis of the impact of national debt on economic growth. Efforts to replicate influential research seldom get much attention, but this time was different. 
It's worth asking why. It's also worth asking how the chance of similar errors might be minimized in the future.
I won't recapitulate the details of the controversy, which received immediate attention on The New York Times site (in both Economix and in Paul Krugman's column and blog) and in other news media, including The Washington Post, The Financial Times and National Public Radio. 
Professors Rogoff and Reinhart have conceded that they overstated the negative effect of high levels of government debt on economic growth but insist that the error did not undermine their larger argument.
As much of this news coverage emphasized, the political stakes are high, because the paper in question has been frequently invoked as justification for austerity, in the concerted efforts to cut public spending both in this country and in Europe.
Journalists may also have been receptive because confidence in austerity policies has already begun to dissipate as a result of poor outcomes in Europe (a recurrent theme in Professor Krugman's columns) and growing evidence of cruel consequences, like increased hunger among Greek children.
Further, journalists know the sound of a good story: a graduate student enrolled in a distinctly unconventional economic department in a financially pinched public university found an obvious mistake in research published in the leading journal of the profession by two prestigious Harvard faculty members. He joined forces with two faculty members, Michael Ash and Robert Pollin, to publish an online critique.
Because the mistake concerned calculation of some weighted averages in an Excel spreadsheet it could be more easily explained than a more technical statistical problem.
Less attention has been devoted to the timing of the revelation. It's easier to describe the tiny bit of blood on Goliath's forehead than to explain why it took almost three years for a pebble to reach that target.
It seems pretty clear that efforts to ensure that published results can be replicated have not been stringent enough. Although many important journals now require authors to make data sets and calculations available online, the May Papers and Proceedings issue of the American Economic Review, in which the original article was published, stipulates only that "papers are published only if the data used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available to any researcher for purposes of replication."
Professors Rogoff and Reinhart, who drew some of their data for the article from publicly available sources and also made a larger data set available on the Web site for their aforementioned book, were not required to make the actual data or spreadsheet on which they based their specific calculations available to other researchers. Dean Baker of the Center for Economic Policy and Research complained publicly soon after the original article was published.
Mr. Herndon was able to obtain the now-famous spreadsheet only about two weeks ago, after e-mailing the authors repeatedly and explaining that he planned to publish a replication based on analysis of highly similar data yielding results significantly different from theirs.
Related difficulties have afflicted other economists seeking to replicate influential published articles. Setting rules is easy. To what extent are journal editors willing to actually monitor conformity and impose sanctions on those who fail to document their work in sufficient detail? Bruce McCullough of Drexel University, who has published extensively on these issues, suggested in an e-mail to me that editors have the power to prevent publication or to shame violators publicly.
On the other hand, detailed monitoring is time-consuming and costly. Austerity in both university and publisher budgets militates against it.
Further, as Dan Hamermesh of the University of Texas at Austin points out, the professional incentives to perform replications are weak and editors are seldom enthusiastic about publishing them. Indeed, replications that confirm previous results typically get less attention than those that controvert them.
As Professor Hamermesh puts it, "economists treat replication the way teenagers treat chastity - as an ideal to be professed but not to be practiced."
This combination of weak incentives and weak norms weakens the reliability of economic research.
Still, the younger generation is often out front on replication because they relish a chance to cross swords with their elders. Significant example of controversies initiated by junior economists include Jesse Rothstein's critique of Caroline Hoxby's research on school choice and Justin McCrary's critique of Steven Levitt's research on electoral cycles in police hiring. Maybe graduate students should be even more actively encouraged to police the profession.
Replication problems aren't unique to economics. Considerable evidence suggests that all scientists are prone to unconscious bias and subtle misperceptions and what are called "shoehorn effects," trying to make results conform to expectations.
The most important remedy may lie in efforts to encourage the kinds of theoretical, political and cultural diversity that provide intrinsic motivation to challenge the conventional wisdom.
Two University of Chicago economists, George Stigler and Gary Becker, wrote a famous article entitled "De Gustibus Non Est Disputandum" - there's no arguing over tastes.
In my department, our slogan is De Omnibus Est Disputandum: argue about everything.

Reddit readers did not solve the bombing, but entrepreneurs did introduceEvidenceUpload.org to aid the investigation. Boston restaurants rallied to the cause. 
 The Economy: Apple, Gold and Cupcakes

 Tweet of the Week 
@tompapa - This is a good week to stay under the covers.
 The Week's Bests 
 Joe Weisenthal says everyone should be thrilled by the gold crash: "The huge corpus of economic research, which has informed the U.S.'s efforts to stimulate the economy, is not a pile of garbage. You can do a lot without blowing things up, as the gold bugs claimed would happen. And more broadly, this represents a breaking of the fever, and perhaps a return to thinking that humans aren't such a horrible disappointment."
 Leslie Young explains what a good boss should be doing: "A good boss will not be smug and complacent with their performance. There is always room to grow and even bosses have something they can always do better. Being a leader entails a lot of responsibility and a good boss knows that they are accountable to the customers and the employees should something go wrong. Bad bosses are overconfident and think that they know everything there is to know. Good bosses think otherwise."
 This Week's Question: Do you consider yourself a good boss?

HEADLINE: Schwarzman's Scholarship in China

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Stephen A. Schwarzman is starting a scholarship for study in China. | Mary Jo White is expected to name a co-head of the agency&#8217;s enforcement arm. | Businesses are declaring new identities as real estate trusts to reduce federal tax bills. | In Europe, volatility in carbon permits suggests the market is not doing its job. 

 BODY:
Stephen A. Schwarzman, head of the Blackstone Group, is creating a $300 million scholarship for study at a Chinese university "that he hopes will rival the Rhodes scholarship in prestige and influence," The New York Times reports. Backed by a group of mostly Western blue-chip companies with interests in China, the Schwarzman Scholars program, whose endowment is one of the largest single gifts to education in the world, will pay for 200 students every year from around the globe to attend a one-year master's program at Tsinghua University in Beijing.
"The program's creation underlines the tremendous importance of China and its market to Wall Street financiers and corporate leaders, who have become increasingly anxious as security and economic frictions grow between China and the West," The Times writes. A third of the endowment comes from Mr. Schwarzman's personal fortune, a third comes from donors and the remaining $100 million is expected to be raised by the end of this year, according to Mr. Schwarzman.
As long as the Chinese economy continues to grow two to three times as quickly as the American economy, and European growth remains sluggish, tensions are likely to rise, Mr. Schwarzman said. "The idea was to deal with this problem in a generational manner," he said in a video interview with The Times. 
NEW LEADERSHIP FOR S.E.C. ENFORCEMENT UNIT | Mary Jo White, the new leader of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is expected to name Andrew J. Ceresney as co-head of the agency's enforcement arm, DealBook's Ben Protess and Peter Lattman report. Mr. Ceresney, a longtime lieutenant to Ms. White both at Debevoise & Plimpton and earlier in his career as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, is expected to share the S.E.C. role with George S. Canellos, who became the interim enforcement chief last year.
"It is unusual, if not unprecedented, for the enforcement unit to be run jointly. The joint leadership is likely to be temporary though, people briefed on the matter said, as Mr. Canellos, who has been at the S.E.C. nearly four years, is expected to return to private practice well before the end of President Obama's second term."
TRUST DESIGNATION IS HOT CORPORATE TREND | Businesses as diverse as private prisons, billboards and casinos are declaring new identities as real estate trusts, in an aggressive move to reduce their federal tax bills, Nathaniel Popper writes in The New York Times. "The trust structure has been around for years but, until recently, it was generally used only by funds holding real estate. Now, the likes of the Corrections Corporation of America, which owns and operates 44 prisons and detention centers across the nation, have quietly received permission from the Internal Revenue Service to put on new corporate clothes and, as a result, save many millions on taxes."
One Wall Street analyst characterized the real estate investment trust designation as a "golden ticket" for corporations. "I've been in this business for 30 years, and I've never seen the interest in REIT conversions as high as it is today," said Robert O'Brien, the head of the real estate practice at Deloitte & Touche.
ON THE AGENDA | Data on existing home sales for March is out at 10 a.m. Caterpillar reports earnings before the market opens, while Netflix reports earnings on Monday evening. Gregory J. Fleming, head of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, is on CNBC at 7 a.m. Barry Rosenstein of Jana Partners is on CNBC at 11:15 a.m.
EUROPE'S CARBON MARKET SPUTTERS | The carbon market in Europe, "a pioneering effort to use markets to regulate greenhouse gases, is having a hard time staying upright. This year has been stomach-churning for the people who make their living in the arcane world of trading emissions permits," The New York Times writes. "More important, though, than lost jobs and diminished payouts for traders and bankers, the penny ante price of carbon credits means the market is not doing its job: pushing polluters to reduce carbon emissions, which most climate scientists believe contribute to global warming. "
COHEN'S REAL ESTATE DEALINGS | Steven A. Cohen is on something of a real estate shopping spree, according to a report in The New York Post. Already, Mr. Cohen has bought a Hamptons property for $60 million, as his hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors contends with government scrutiny of its trading. In addition, according to The Post, Mr. Cohen "snapped up 145 Perry St. in the West Village for $38.8 million, according to public records of the sale." The newspaper continues: "There is chatter he bought another city apartment, this one at the Abingdon, also in the West Village, while he renovates 145 Perry."

HEADLINE: Schwarzman's Scholarship in China

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Stephen A. Schwarzman is starting a scholarship for study in China. | Mary Jo White is expected to name a co-head of the S.E.C.&#8217;s enforcement arm. | Businesses are declaring new identities as real estate trusts to reduce federal tax bills. | In Europe, volatility in carbon permits suggests the market is not doing its job. 

 BODY:
Stephen A. Schwarzman, head of the Blackstone Group, is creating a $300 million scholarship for study at a Chinese university "that he hopes will rival the Rhodes scholarship in prestige and influence," The New York Times reports. Backed by a group of mostly Western blue-chip companies with interests in China, the Schwarzman Scholars program, whose endowment is one of the largest single gifts to education in the world, will pay for 200 students every year from around the globe to attend a one-year master's program at Tsinghua University in Beijing.
"The program's creation underlines the tremendous importance of China and its market to Wall Street financiers and corporate leaders, who have become increasingly anxious as security and economic frictions grow between China and the West," The Times writes. A third of the endowment comes from Mr. Schwarzman's personal fortune, a third comes from donors and the remaining $100 million is expected to be raised by the end of this year, according to Mr. Schwarzman.
As long as the Chinese economy continues to grow two to three times as quickly as the American economy, and European growth remains sluggish, tensions are likely to rise, Mr. Schwarzman said. "The idea was to deal with this problem in a generational manner," he said in a video interview with The Times. 
NEW LEADERSHIP FOR S.E.C. ENFORCEMENT UNIT | Mary Jo White, the new leader of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is expected to name Andrew J. Ceresney as co-head of the agency's enforcement arm, DealBook's Ben Protess and Peter Lattman report. Mr. Ceresney, a longtime lieutenant to Ms. White both at Debevoise & Plimpton and earlier in his career as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, is expected to share the S.E.C. role with George S. Canellos, who became the interim enforcement chief last year.
"It is unusual, if not unprecedented, for the enforcement unit to be run jointly. The joint leadership is likely to be temporary though, people briefed on the matter said, as Mr. Canellos, who has been at the S.E.C. nearly four years, is expected to return to private practice well before the end of President Obama's second term."
TRUST DESIGNATION IS HOT CORPORATE TREND | Businesses as diverse as private prisons, billboards and casinos are declaring new identities as real estate trusts, in an aggressive move to reduce their federal tax bills, Nathaniel Popper writes in The New York Times. "The trust structure has been around for years but, until recently, it was generally used only by funds holding real estate. Now, the likes of the Corrections Corporation of America, which owns and operates 44 prisons and detention centers across the nation, have quietly received permission from the Internal Revenue Service to put on new corporate clothes and, as a result, save many millions on taxes."
One Wall Street analyst characterized the real estate investment trust designation as a "golden ticket" for corporations. "I've been in this business for 30 years, and I've never seen the interest in REIT conversions as high as it is today," said Robert O'Brien, the head of the real estate practice at Deloitte & Touche.
ON THE AGENDA | Data on existing home sales for March is out at 10 a.m. Caterpillar reports earnings before the market opens, while Netflix reports earnings on Monday evening. Gregory J. Fleming, head of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, is on CNBC at 7 a.m. Barry Rosenstein of Jana Partners is on CNBC at 11:15 a.m.
EUROPE'S CARBON MARKET SPUTTERS | The carbon market in Europe, "a pioneering effort to use markets to regulate greenhouse gases, is having a hard time staying upright. This year has been stomach-churning for the people who make their living in the arcane world of trading emissions permits," The New York Times writes. "More important, though, than lost jobs and diminished payouts for traders and bankers, the penny ante price of carbon credits means the market is not doing its job: pushing polluters to reduce carbon emissions, which most climate scientists believe contribute to global warming. "
COHEN'S REAL ESTATE DEALINGS | Steven A. Cohen is on something of a real estate shopping spree, according to a report in The New York Post. Already, Mr. Cohen has bought a Hamptons property for $60 million, as his hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors contends with government scrutiny of its trading. In addition, according to The Post, Mr. Cohen "snapped up 145 Perry St. in the West Village for $38.8 million, according to public records of the sale." The newspaper continues: "There is chatter he bought another city apartment, this one at the Abingdon, also in the West Village, while he renovates 145 Perry."

HIGHLIGHT: What happened to that steely determination? 

 BODY:
When it comes to inflicting pain on the citizens of debtor nations, austerians are all steely determination - hey, it's a tough world, and hard choices have to be made. But when they or their friends come under criticism, suddenly it's all empathy and hurt feelings. 
We saw that in the case of Olli Rehn, whose friends at the European Commission were outraged, outraged when I pointed out, using slightly colorful language, that he was repeating an often-debunked claim about economic history. And today we see it in Anders Aslund's defense of Reinhart and Rogoff against what he calls a "vicious" critique by Herndon et al.
Aslund praises R-R for providing
an important corrective to the view that fiscal stimulus is always right - a position that is common across the Anglo-American economic commentariat, led by Paul Krugman in the New York Times.
This is a curious thing for him to say, because it's an outright lie; as anyone who has been reading me, Martin Wolf, Brad DeLong, Simon Wren-Lewis, etc. knows, our case has always been that fiscal stimulus is justified only when you're up against the zero lower bound on interest rates. I can't believe that Aslund doesn't know this; why, then, would he discredit himself by repeating an easily refuted falsehood?
But then, why would he describe Herndon et alas "vicious"? Their paper was a calm, reasoned analysis of how R-R came up with the famous 90 percent threshold; it came as a body blow only because of the contrast between the acclaim R-R received and the indefensible nature of their analysis.
What I think is happening is that austerians have put themselves in a box. They threw themselves - and their personal reputations - completely behind the various elements of anti-Keynesian doctrine: expansionary austerity, critical debt thresholds, and so on. And as Wolfgang Munchau says, the terrible thing was that their policy ideas were actually implemented, with disastrous results; on top of which their intellectual heroes have turned out to have feet of clay, or maybe Silly Putty.
As I see it, the sheer enormity of their error makes it impossible for them to respond to criticism in any reasonable way. They have to lash out any way they can, whether it's ad hominem attacks on the critics or bitter complaints about bad manners.
And by such pettiness the world is governed.

HEADLINE: Taking a Page From Rhodes

BYLINE: PETER THAL LARSEN


HIGHLIGHT: Stephen A. Schwarzman&#8217;s move to contribute $100 million to start a scholarship program in China may not be entirely philanthropic, but there will still be many beneficiaries if it helps Western and Chinese elites understand each other better. 

 BODY:
The Blackstone Group founder Stephen A. Schwarzman is giving something back - to China. 
Mr. Schwarzman is contributing his name, and $100 million of his private wealth, to start a scholarship program at Beijing's Tsinghua University. The program may not be entirely philanthropic: China lost much more investing in his buyout firm's initial public offering. But there will still be many beneficiaries if it helps Western and Chinese elites understand each other better. 
Like the Rhodes Scholarship that inspired it, Mr. Schwarzman's program will pay for the brightest and best to study. In this case, the $300 million program will select some 200 so-called Schwarzman Scholars from the United States, China and other countries to spend a year studying at Tsinghua. Whereas Cecil Rhodes wanted future leaders to visit his alma mater of Oxford University, Mr. Schwarzman is hoping a year in China will help the scholars gain a better understanding of the world's rising economic and political power.
There is bound to be skepticism. Mr. Schwarzman's $100 million pales next to the losses China's sovereign wealth fund had after it invested $3 billion in Blackstone in 2007. Though the shares have recovered somewhat from the depths of the financial crisis, the China Investment Corporation is still nursing a loss of nearly $1 billion. 
Corporate sponsors like BP, Boeing and Bank of America will no doubt view the program as a way to improve their influence on the mainland. And the heavyweight advisory board - which includes the likes of Tony Blair, Nicolas Sarkozy and Henry M. Paulson Jr. - is also noticeably light on Chinese luminaries of equal stature.
Yet these objections do not undermine Mr. Schwarzman's cause. China's rapid rise and insular tendencies mean the country's leaders have little experience and understanding of their counterparts elsewhere. For Western leaders, the country remains mysterious and impenetrable. That has already led to tensions, which are only likely to increase as China flexes its growing economic and political might. 
If Mr. Schwarzman's program helps future leaders gain a better understanding of each other, any less high-minded motivations will be forgotten.

HEADLINE: Earthquake Response and Political Tensions Return to the Spotlight

BYLINE: BILL BISHOP


HIGHLIGHT: The government&#8217;s response to a deadly earthquake is yet another test of its ability to deliver the goods. The administration of President Xi Jinping takes more steps to tackle corruption. 

 BODY:
The challenges continue for China's new leadership. 
An earthquake struck Sichuan Province Saturday morning, killing nearly 200 people and injuring nearly 12,000 as of the most recent official update. This earthquake is not far from where the much larger 2008 Wenchuan earthquake took place, in which almost 87,000 people perished. 
 Several hard-hit areas have only just been reached by rescuers. Although the government and military seem much more prepared for the emergency response than they were in 2008, frustrations are mounting as some survivors face a third night with no shelter and little food or water. This disaster, the first major earthquake in the area, is yet another test of the government's ability to deliver the goods. Beijing knows this and appears to be making all-out efforts at disaster response and propaganda management. 

CHINA'S ECONOMY The economic impact from the earthquake should be limited and may even give a "rebuilding boost" to the local economy. Last week's column discussed reactions to the lower-than-expected first-quarter growth rate for gross domestic product. Today Bloomberg reports that Zhou Xiaochuan, the head of China's central bank, said that the G.D.P. growth rate was "normal" and that China needed to "sacrifice short-term growth for the purposes of reforms and structural adjustments."
 BIRD FLU REMAINS A THREAT The H7N9 avian influenza continues to spread. As of Monday evening the Chinese government has reported 104 cases and 21 deaths. The Beijing girl who was the first case in the capital recovered and returned home last week, and while people are worried, there is no sense of panic. The public Beijing elementary school our children attend issued a notice Monday with hygiene tips to help avoid the flu but so far the school has not started daily temperature checks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is concerned about H7N9's spreading to the United States and has told hospitals to be on lookout for it. 
 REGIONAL TENSIONS The Korean Peninsula has quieted down over the last several days. Wu Dawei, China's North Korean envoy, will be in Washington this week for talks. In Japan, Asahi Shimbun reportedover the weekend that:
Although North Korea continues to have ballistic missiles ready to launch, the reclusive nation indicated it was open to dialogue with close ally China and may be toning down its belligerent rhetoric. According to a source knowledgeable about North Korean affairs, Pyongyang indicated in mid-April that it was willing to talk to Beijing. China will likely send Wu Dawei, China's special representative for Korean Peninsula affairs and chairman of the six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear issues, or some other high-ranking official to Pyongyang for discussions. The Chinese side is expected to call on North Korea to agree to either dialogue with the United States or resumption of the six-party talks.
The China-Japan dispute over islands (the Diaoyus to the Chinese, the Senkakus to the Japanese) in the East China Sea has cooled into a new status quo. But a visit over the weekend to the Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japanese war dead including 14 top World War II war criminals, is likely to increase tensions. 
Japan's deputy prime minister, Taro Aso, went to the shrine while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, trying to avoid angering the Chinese while placating some of his constituents, only sent a "masakaki" tree dedicated in his name. A prominent People's Daily commentator excoriated the Japanese visit in Monday's newspaper and we should not be surprised if over the next few days there is more than just a rhetorical reaction from Beijing. 
 PUBLIC RELATIONS The campaigns against corruption and extravagance may deepen. At a Politburo meeting Friday, President Xi Jinping told Communist Party members to "toe the mass line" to win over the public and to fight formalism, bureaucracy and hedonism. President Xi also reiterated a resolve to fight corruption and the government announced that media outlets, including the American-listed portals Sina, Netease and Sohu, have opened online informant pages for citizens to report corruption. 
On Sunday, Mr. Xi, in his capacity as chairman of the Central Military Commission, approved an order requiring officers to spend time every few years down in the ranks as common soldiers. A commentary on the policy in the Chinese army's newspaper reminded readers that in 1958 Mao Zedong called for every cadre to spend one month a year as a common soldier. These continuing campaigns to "change work styles" and curb corruption are not going away anytime soon, much to the chagrin of luxury purveyors and high-end food and beverage businesses.
The New York Times reported Monday that Beijinghad arrested several anti-corruption activists who had staged public calls for officials to disclose their assets. Asset disclosure is a very sensitive topic. According to The South China Morning Post, at a meeting in late February of the Communist Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection one official apparently said that "disclosure of officials' assets could lead to social unrest."
Beijing knows that public anger over corruption is high. An incident last Friday is just one example. A minor local official in Jiangsu Province was seen at an expensive banquet and then harassed and prevented from leaving by an angry mob. He cried and pleaded for forgiveness but was able to depart only after the police arrived. He was fired Sunday. 
The party is trying to harness popular anger against graft by allowing some oversight online, either through the microblogging site Weibo or the new "informant pages." It is also very cognizant of the risk that things could spiral out of control, so it will keep a tight grip over public participation in the anti-corruption campaign. 
Few outside observers believe corruption can be rooted out without broader political changes, but Mr. Xi appears determined to push this current crackdown farther than most believed.

HEADLINE: S.&P. Seeks Dismissal of U.S. Suit Over Rating of Mortgage Debt

BYLINE: MARY WILLIAMS WALSH


HIGHLIGHT: Standard &#038; Poor&#8217;s says the government is overreaching in its civil case, which asserts that firm inflated its ratings to win business. 

 BODY:
 7:35 p.m. | Updated 
Standard & Poor's, accused of inflating its ratings to win business during the boom in mortgage investments, urged a judge on Monday to dismiss the federal government's civil case against it, saying the Justice Department had built a faulty complaint on "isolated snippets" of conversations rather than evidence of real wrongdoing.
S.& P., the largest ratings agency in the United States, was responding to civil fraud charges filed in February in the first significant federal action against the ratings industry since the mortgage bubble burst. The Justice Department's lawsuit accused S.& P. of knowingly giving complex packages of mortgages higher ratings than they deserved, stoking investor demand for the securities and driving up prices to where they crashed, setting off the global financial crisis. 
"From start to finish, the complaint overreaches in targeting S.& P.," the firm's lawyers, including Floyd Abrams of Cahill Gordon & Reindel, said in a brief filed in United States District Court for the Central District of California, in Los Angeles.
"S.& P.'s inability, together with the Federal Reserve, Treasury and other market participants, to predict the extent of the most catastrophic meltdown since the Great Depression, reveals a lack of prescience, but not fraud," the brief said. To have a valid case, the Justice Department would have had to show that S.& P. knew what the correct ratings should have been, it said, and it had not done so.
S.& P. is seeking to convince Judge David O. Carter that the Justice Department has no case at all. If he rules against the firm, the case will move forward. A hearing is scheduled for May 20.
Separately, S.& P. has been seeking to have more than a dozen similar fraud complaints, filed in state courts by state attorneys general, moved into federal court for pretrial purposes. The states are generally suing under their own consumer-protection statutes, which have a lower burden of proof than a federal case accusing fraud. The Justice Department has called for the state cases to remain in state courts. The department declined to comment.
Much of the Justice Department's 128-page complaint deals with the fact that Standard & Poor's promoted its ratings as "objective, independent," and "uninfluenced by any conflicts of interest," then describes numerous conversations among its employees that suggest a willingness to inflate ratings to please clients - in this case, the banks packaging mortgage securities to be sold.
One S.& P. analyst, for example, sent a message to others at the firm in 2004, warning that Mizuho Securities USA had just decided to take its business to Moody's, a rival, because S.& P. had insisted its securities needed more collateral to receive high ratings. "Our support level was at least 10 percent higher than Moody's," the analyst wrote. "This is so significant that it could have an impact on future deals. There's no way we can get back on this one, but we need to address this now in preparation for the future deals."
In another message, an analyst grumbled, "We rate every deal. It could be structured by cows and we would rate it."
Many of the conversations took place between 2004 and 2006. The Justice Department used them to support its argument that S.& P. had issued ratings it knew were false, but S.& P. countered that the messages merely showed a robust internal debate.
The brief contends that these "snippets" of conversation are devoid of meaning under the federal fraud laws. It says that its many claims of objectivity, independence and "analytic excellence at all times" add up to "classic puffery," the vague and overblown language that businesses often use to describe the virtues of their products and services. S.& P. cited other legal cases in which such claims were found to be "nonactionable." It said puffery was simply "too general to serve as the basis for a fraud claim."
If Judge Carter agrees, S.& P.'s lawyers want all the damaging conversational snippets to be thrown out. That would leave just one final section of the complaint, which lists 33 individual securities known as C.D.O.'s, or collateralized debt obligations. They were rated by S.& P. from March to October 2007. Many of the internal conversations took place earlier, from 2004 to 2006, and even the one about cows, which took place in April 2007, did not refer directly to any of the 33 C.D.O.'s listed by name in the lawsuit.
The C.D.O.'s were created by investment bankers who combined and rearranged parts of another class of mortgage securities, known as residential mortgage-backed securities, which were made up of many residential mortgages, including some classified as subprime.
The Justice Department contends that S.& P. "deceived financial institutions that invested in these C.D.O.'s into believing that S.& P.'s ratings reflected its true current opinion regarding the credit risks of these C.D.O.'s, when in fact they did not." It said the financial institutions lost more than $5 billion on the 33 C.D.O.'s, dealing a blow to their deposit insurers, like the F.D.I.C.
But S.& P. argues in its brief that to have a valid claim of fraud, the Justice Department had to show how the particular mortgage securities within the C.D.O.'s performed, and how that performance had affected the ratings of the entire C.D.O., which it did not do.

HIGHLIGHT: The Mattress Lot in Portland, Ore., makes deliveries by bicycle. 

 BODY:
We recently asked small-business owners to send us photographs that capture the soul of their businesses in a single shot. 
This one comes from Michael Hanna of The Mattress Lot in Portland, Ore.:
We deliver mattresses by bike. We started our mattress and furniture store in 2010 at the height of the recession. Yes, we deliver by truck too. But our customers in Portland, Oregon love it when we can deliver by bike. One of our friends, an architect named Les Lasher, designed and built the bike cart. We can bike queen mattresses to homes in our neighborhood. We're three years into our first ever small business enterprise and we are profitable and we employ ten people.

HEADLINE: Thoughts on the Boston Lockdown

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Was shutting down an entire city last week really a good idea? 

 BODY:
For about thirty minutes late on Friday, during a slightly shamefaced press conference announcing that the authorities had shut down all of Boston to catch a teenage fugitive and then failed to catch him, it looked like there might be a modest media backlash against the decision to put an entire American metropolis on lockdown to hunt a single bomber. But then Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was spotted in a backyard boat, the police and Feds accepted the applause of a grateful city, and the conversation turned swiftly to Miranda rights, radical Islam, and how the press covered the whole grisly affair.
But the question lingers: Was the lockdown actually a good idea? Or, as Ha'aretz columnist Chemi Salev argued last week, did it hand the Boston terrorists, and terrorism more generally, an undeserved victory? Here's his case:
Never, in the history of violence aimed at innocent civilians, have the lives of so many been disrupted so much by the relatively amateurish actions of so few. 
More than a million people cowered in their homes on Friday, under curfew, gripped by fear. The U.S. army and other security forces invaded and occupied an American town. Helicopters, armored vehicles, soldiers in full battle gear and crack SWAT teams sealed off streets and conducted house-to-house searches.
... Of course, the killing of three precious people and the injury of dozens of others are a painful tragedy and an unforgiveable crime.... [But] this was not 9/11, the Bombay bombings or the Beslan slaughter of children, also carried out by Chechen terrorists. It wasn't the Bali nightclub bombings, the downing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie or the destruction of the federal building in Oklahoma. And it didn't come close even to the Tel Aviv Dolphinarium carnage, the killing of students in Maalot or the murder of 39 Palestinians in the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron.
Therefore, in terms of cost-benefit analysis, from the evil terrorist's point of view, the Boylston Street bombings and their after aftermath can only be viewed as a resounding triumph. If the primary goal of terror attacks is to instill fear and intimidate people, to influence governments and to attract world attention, then the Boston bombers have probably succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.
I'm sympathetic to this argument, but let me make one possible case against Salev's point. So far as we can tell, the brothers Tsarnaev were not necessarily hardened fanatics steeled for martyrdom: They seem to have actually believed that they could just return to their normal lives after dropping off a couple of pressure-cooker bombs near the Boston Marathon finish line; once they were identified their attempts at escape betrayed panic and desperation more than suicidal resignation; and the younger brother clearly chose flight and then surrender rather than a guns-blazing suicide by cop. They conducted themselves, in other words, like people who didn't necessarily want to get caught - which suggests that at some level they might have been deterrable, if only they had understood just how impossible it would be to walk away from what happened on Monday.
If that's the case, and if we assume there are other young men like these brothers floating on the fringes of terrorland - slightly dim bulbs who might persuade themselves that they can play terrorist without facing the consequences - there's something to be said for the message that the Boston lockdown sent to them: If you perpetrate an act like this, you will not escape, you will not disappear, you will not enjoy even 24 hours as a symbol of resistance to the Great Satan. You will be caught, and quickly, because we will move mountains to catch you, up to and including shutting down an entire city to ensure that you stay cornered. 
The point of this kind of message is not to deter, say, the next Mohammed Atta. Rather, it's to shrink the pool of amateurs, dilettantes and potential freelancers by establishing an almost crazy-seeming level of American anti-terror resolve.
But of course a strategy like this only works until it doesn't. When terror is out-of-the-ordinary, you can afford an extraordinary response; if it's more common, moving heaven and earth gets self-defeating and even disastrous in a hurry. In this sense, the Boston lockdown was a luxury made possible by the phenomenon I wrote about last week - the surprisingly low rate of terror attacks in the 21st century United States. Because the Marathon bombing was such an unusual event, the city of Boston could muster a sweeping, almost crazy-seeming response without worrying that it would find itself having to do exactly the same thing six months later. But if such attacks started happening more frequently, as they obviously very well could, then last Friday's precedent would put public officials across the country in an extremely uncomfortable bind: Repeatedly reproducing the lockdown might seem like a non-starter, yet not matching what Boston did would open you up to all kinds of scapegoating if, say, an on-the-loose bomber struck again.
This bind is part of why I'm not quite as sanguine about the ripple effects of the lockdown as Megan McArdle is here:
Many progressives, and especially, many libertarians, are criticizing this as an overreaction that involved immense intrusions into personal liberty. An overreaction it may have been, but I'm less worried about the liberty aspect, because as far as I can tell, compliance with the shutdown was pretty much entirely voluntary. I haven't seen any complaints about jackbooted police officers forcing people back into their homes when they tried to come out, and I have heard reports from folks who drove into the office without getting hassled. I'd imagine that most people were quite willing to stay inside for a day if that would help the police capture the marathon bombers.
... I'm actually less worried about this sort of large-scale operation than I am about smaller, more pervasive erosions of civil liberties, like airport security, theaters, and warrantless wiretapping. When it comes to shutting down a city, it's very unlikely that we're going to make a habit of this sort of thing: it's immensely costly for the government, somewhat costly to the economy, and except in very extraordinary instances, people don't like it. On the other hand, stop-and-frisk became widespread, and not-infrequently abusive, precisely because it's invisible to most voters. We should be worried about the seizure of our liberty in small, manageable doses, not enormous chunks.
I agree that we aren't likely to make a habit of it endlessly. But the pressure to do absolutely everything to stop a terrorist, and the sense in many quarters that the Boston lockdown "worked," seems like it might inspire some genuine fiascos in a world where we suddenly had to adjust to a more frequent drumbeat of attacks. (It doesn't take jackboots for an armed house-to-house search to go badly awry.) And yes, I too worry more about the encroachments of security theater than the threat of a police state - but the problem with flirting with the police state approach, even in a voluntary, only-for-a-day way, is that it makes those "small, manageable" encroachments seem, well, smaller and more manageable, and therefore harder to resist.
After all, once you've had snipers in camo on suburban roofs, what's an extra layer of metal detectors here or there?

HEADLINE: The Incredible Shrinking Budget Deficit

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: Because of belt-tightening in Washington and a strengthening economy, the federal deficit is quickly contracting, as reflected in new estimates from Goldman Sachs. 

 BODY:
For four years, during and in the wake of the recession, the federal budget deficit ballooned to more than $1 trillion. But because of belt-tightening in Washington and a strengthening economy, it has started shrinking - and fast. 
The number crunchers at Goldman Sachs have lowered their estimates of the deficit both this year and next, on the back of higher-than-expected revenues and lower-than-projected spending. Analysts started the year projecting that the deficit in the current fiscal year would be about $900 billion. Earlier this year, they lowered the estimate to $850 billion. Now they have lowered it again, to $775 billion, or about 4.8 percent of economic output. 
"Spending in the fiscal year to date is lower than a year ago and the nominal growth rate is lower than it has been in decades," the Goldman economists wrote in a note to clients. "Revenues have also exceeded expectations, with a 12 percent gain fiscal year to date. What is more notable is that the strength in revenues preceded the payroll tax hike at the start of the year, and the spending decline does not seem to reflect sequestration, which has just started to take effect." To translate: the deficit could come in even smaller than currently anticipated because of spending cuts and higher tax rates. 
On the face of it, this sounds like something to applaud: The growing economy is bolstering tax revenue and reducing the need for spending on programs like unemployment insurance. Washington has gotten its act together. The budget is finally coming back into balance. Indeed, Goldman now expects the budget deficit to fall to just 2.7 percent of economic output by the 2015 fiscal year. Many economists consider budget deficits that small to be sustainable - particularly if the federal government is investing in public goods like schools and roads - with the accrued debt paid off by later years' economic growth. 
But a number of budget experts are booing rather than applauding, including the fiscal hawks at the International Monetary Fund. Last week, the fund nudged down its estimates for United States growth in 2013 and 2014. It said it saw many bright spots in the American economy, including the strength of the private sector, but it criticized Washington for imposing too much austerity, too soon, and thus sapping strength from the recovery and preventing the unemployment rate from coming down faster. 
"The growth figure for the United States for 2013 may not seem very high, and indeed it is insufficient to make a large dent in the still-high unemployment rate," the fund said. "But it will be achieved in the face of a very strong, indeed overly strong, fiscal consolidation of about 1.8 percent of G.D.P. Underlying private demand is actually strong, spurred in part by the anticipation of low policy rates under the Federal Reserve's 'forward guidance' and by pent-up demand for housing and durables."
The fund's economists specifically dinged "sequestration," the $85 billion in mandatory budget cuts that Congress promised to undo, but failed to undo, earlier this year. "While the sequester has decreased worries about debt sustainability, it is the wrong way to proceed," the fund said. "There should be both less and better fiscal consolidation now and a commitment to more fiscal consolidation in the future."
In its note, Goldman Sachs did specify a few trends that could widen the deficit this year, like a "negative economic surprise." The investment bank did not elaborate much on what that economic surprise could be, but troubles in the emerging economies that are driving global growth, higher gas prices and an intensification of the financial troubles in Europe seem like plausible candidates, as do natural disasters like hurricanes and droughts.

HEADLINE: The Year in Hacking, by the Numbers

BYLINE: NICOLE PERLROTH


HIGHLIGHT: An annual Verizon report counted 621 confirmed data breaches last year, and more than 47,000 reported &#8220;security incidents.&#8221; 

 BODY:
Security experts like to say that there are now only two types of companies left in the United States: those that have been hacked and those that don't know they've been hacked.
Their latest supporting evidence comes in the form of an annual Verizon report, which counted 621 confirmed data breaches last year, and more than 47,000 reported "security incidents." Those include distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks, in which hackers flood a site with traffic until it falls offline, but do not necessarily break into a company's network.
The victims spanned a wide range of industries. Thirty-seven percent of breached companies were financial firms; 24 percent were retailers and restaurants; 20 percent involved manufacturing, transportation and utility industries; and 20 percent of the breaches affected organizations that Verizon qualified as "information and professional services firms." (The totals exceed 100 percent because of rounding.) 
"The results validate that any business that operates online is at potential risk of suffering a data breach," said Wade Baker, one of the report's principal authors. "We talk to a lot of actors that are flabbergasted that they would be attacked by a group based across the world. But the report shows that no matter the size of the organization - large, small, government agencies, banks, restaurants, retailers - people are stealing data from a range of different organizations and it's a problem everyone has to deal with."
Verizon collaborated with 18 organizations to feed data into this year's report. Three quarters of successful breaches were done by profit-minded criminals for financial gain. But the second most common type of breach was a state-affiliated attack "aimed at stealing intellectual property - such as classified information, trade secrets and technical resources - to further national and economic interests."
Verizon said that only a slim minority - 14 percent - of all data breaches were the work of insiders. Most were the work work of external actors who are often difficult to pinpoint because attackers often route their Web traffic through infected computers around the world. But Mr. Baker said victims were able to trace the attacks back to state-affiliated groups in "two out of three cases."
In those cases, Verizon said that the majority- 30 percent- of all attacks originated in China. Government officials in the United States recently started stepping up diplomatic pressure on China to curtail cyberespionage that originates from within its borders. Last month, the Obama administration demanded that the Chinese government stop the theft of data from American computer networks. And on Monday, cybersecurity was the focus of a meeting between the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, and Gen. Fang Fenghui of China.
Surprisingly, the second most common origin of attacks was Romania, where hackers accounted for 28 percent of all data breaches. The third most common origin of attacks was the United States, which accounted for 18 percent of all attacks.
In 76 percent of data breaches, weak or stolen user names and passwords were a cause. In 40 percent of cases, Verizon said the attackers installed malicious software on the victim's systems; 35 percent of cases involved "physical attacks" in which the attackers did physical harm, to a skimmer at an automated teller machine, for instance.
In 29 percent of breaches, the attackers leveraged social tactics, such as spear phishing, in which a tailored e-mail to the victim purports to come from a friend or business contact. The e-mails contain malicious links or attachments that, when clicked, give the attacker a foothold in the victim's computer network. Verizon said it witnessed four times as many "social engineering" attacks that used this method in 2012 as it did in 2011. That method, Verizon said, was most popular among attackers in cyberespionage campaigns.
The Verizon report also highlighted the lag between the time an organization has been breached and the time it discovers the breach. "The compromise-to-discovery timeline continues to be measured in months and even years, as opposed to hours and days," the report said.

HEADLINE: Civil Rights, One Person and One Photo at a Time

BYLINE: MAURICE BERGER


HIGHLIGHT: In the midst of the national struggle for civil rights, James Karales, born into an immigrant Greek family in Ohio, turned his camera on the individuals fighting for rights and respect. 

 BODY:
The hands of the father and his young daughter wave emphatically: the two are not in agreement. The man talks. His eyes are closed; he looks pained. The child listens, but gazes at a plate of cookies on the dinner table.
The scene is not unusual: a father is telling his daughter that she will not be going to an amusement park. But he is doing so not because it is a school day, or because he is punishing her. He fears for her safety. 
The father is Martin Luther King Jr.; the child is his 7-year-old daughter Yolanda; and the two are engaged in a conversation that no parent wants to have. He is explaining to the girl for the first time the hazards of segregation and the reasons she cannot visit Fun Town, a popular but restricted theme park in Atlanta.
This photograph, (Slide 6) which first appeared in a 1963 photo essay in Look magazine, is emotionally intimate and psychologically insightful, like many of the images in "Controversy and Hope: The Civil Rights Photographs of James Karales" (University of South Carolina Press). The book, by Julian Cox, provides a singular opportunity to re-evaluate the innovative work of Mr. Karales, who died in 2002, at age 71.
As Dr. King's aide and confidante Andrew Young notes in the book's foreword, Mr. Karales's photographs were distinguished by their ability to reveal the "complexity of emotions intertwined with the hopes and hardships of the struggle." Their personal, contemplative approach was not always in step with a mainstream press enthralled by the high drama of historic speeches, conflagrations and demonstrations. This approach may also have been the reason Dr. King, who was fiercely protective of his family, granted the photographer unprecedented access to them.
Mr. Karales typically favored the individual over the collective, and his photographs are more like artful portraits than the straightforward documentation of momentous events. In his reporting on the Selma to Montgomery march for voting rights in the spring of 1965, for example, he frequently photographed participants - the famous and the unknown - up close, carefully rendering their individuality and state of mind.
Photographer unknown, courtesy of the estate of James Karales James Karales in Vietnam, 1965.
His images of the march resonate with nuances of emotion and psychology: a tight, brooding shot of a young demonstrator in profile; the bitter, scowling face of a segregationist being arrested (Slide 16); a black child nestled contently on the shoulders of a bearded white man (Slide 11); the indelibly memorable photograph of an African-American teenager staring wearily into the camera (Slide 12), the word "vote" emblazoned on his whitewashed forehead.
This intimate viewpoint aligned Mr. Karales more with the strategies of the black press than those of the mainstream media. Just as the mainstream media dispensed profiles about white people - relegating people of color to stereotypical, sensationalistic or communal reporting - publications owned and operated by African-Americans covered the private lives of the ordinary and famous alike.
These profiles, accompanied by photographs or drawings, were the mainstay of one of the earliest black pictorial magazines, The Crisis, edited by the civil rights leader W. E. B. Du Bois. In the civil rights era, the profiles continued to have a central role in the periodicals of the Johnson Publishing Company - Ebony, Jet and Tan, the first black women's magazine - subtly challenging the status quo by emphasizing, rather than concealing, African-American humanity, individuality and psychological nuance.
If Mr. Karales's method was akin to that of the black press, it was driven not by sympathy - the motivation Mr. Cox ascribes to it - but by empathy. Born into an immigrant Greek family in Canton, Ohio, in 1930, Mr. Karales struggled to learn English. He experienced firsthand the hardships of a community routinely viewed as exotic, inferior and not quite American. After working blue-collar manufacturing jobs, he enrolled in Ohio University and studied photography.
Mr. Karales was determined to use his camera in the service of social justice. From his first photo-essay - a tender, keenly observed profile of Canton's working-class, Greek-American community (above) - he strove to reveal the complexity of his subjects by stressing the individual details lost amid collective stereotypes and biases.
Over a half-century career, including a staff position at Look that gave him a national platform, Mr. Karales continually fixed his lens on the marginal, the besieged and the politically fraught: coal miners in the racially integrated but economically depressed town of Rendville, Ohio; racial discrimination in organized religion; the quagmire of the Vietnam War; and segregation in New York City. (Those last photographs went unpublished, perhaps because they upended the era's myth of Northern racial tolerance.)
Nowhere is Mr. Karales's defiance of racial clichés more apparent than in his 1960 Look profile of Richard Adams, a pioneering speech therapist and social worker. The photo-essay inverted racial typecasting: Adams was black, his students were mostly white, and they coexisted not in a Northern city but in rural Iowa. These images of adoring youngsters and their dedicated teacher spoke to the possibility of racial harmony. But they also called into question an abiding myth of integration: that African-Americans had the most to gain from it.
Mr. Karales's focus on the individual succeeded - paradoxically, as Mr. Cox notes - because it added to his work "some sense of a common, shared humanity." By affirming our fundamental similarities, his images implored Americans, in an age of turmoil and transition, to re-examine their own humanity. Rather than presenting predictable scenes of racial disunity, they challenged a nation to face the individuals it had reduced to collective symbols of fear, condescension and hate. There, in the midst of crowds and chaos, he found one person, one image.

HEADLINE: Fed Still Owes Congress a Blueprint on Its Emergency Lending

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
After the Federal Reserve lent more than $1 trillion to big banks during the 2008 financial crisis, Congress required the central bank to devise specific ways of protecting taxpayers when doling out emergency loans to financial institutions.
But nearly three years after that overhaul became law, the Fed still has not established these regulations.
The delay involves a crucial but little-noticed part of the Dodd-Frank act, the sweeping financial sector overhaul that Congress passed in July 2010. One part of the legislation focused on the Fed. While the government used many different tools to shore up the financial system during the crisis, Congress was well aware that the Fed played a decisive role. 
The central bank made huge loans to scores of domestic and foreign banks as markets seized up, dwarfing bailouts like the Troubled Asset Relief Program. But the identities of the borrowers were not disclosed at first, stoking concerns that the Fed had carried out a vast stealth bailout of Wall Street.
Against that backdrop, Dodd-Frank required the Fed to develop policies and procedures to safeguard taxpayers when making emergency loans ''as soon as is practicable.'' To some banking specialists, the delay suggests the Fed is stalling because it values the need to act freely in times of crisis.
''The Fed might be thinking, 'We don't want to make a lot of rules that might hinder us from acting in an emergency situation that we can't anticipate,' '' said Michael Bradfield, a former general counsel at the Fed.
When asked, Barbara Hagenbaugh, a spokeswoman for the Fed, did not say when the new rules would be completed.
Even without freshly written rules from the Fed, the Dodd-Frank legislation immediately introduced measures to make the central bank more accountable. For example, the Fed must now file regular and detailed reports to Congress if it undertakes any emergency lending.
Still, the overhaul went much further to set conditions on Fed loans during a crisis, and it is these measures that the central bank has yet to complete.
It has to have policies in place to prevent losses on emergency loans. For instance, the assets pledged to the Fed in return for the loans would have to be sufficient to absorb losses should the borrower default.
In an interesting twist, Congress also requested that when a bank participates in an emergency loan, its chief executive must certify that the bank is not insolvent at the time. The Fed would need to set out procedures for doing that.
''I think the Fed should have reasonably broad discretion to deal with systemic issues,'' Mr. Bradfield said. ''But then the question is, What's systemic and what's really needed, and what conditions ought to accompany that lending?''
A person familiar with the Fed's thinking says any future emergency lending would still be bound by the demands of Dodd-Frank, even if the Fed has not issued rules by then. The central bank would still be obliged by the law to take careful steps to avoid losses, for instance.
Some banking analysts agree. ''If something suddenly came up, they would make decisions based on Dodd-Frank, even if they had not previously published rules about how they would do this,'' said Douglas J. Elliott, a fellow at the Brookings Institution.
Mr. Elliott also says the Fed may be focusing on writing other important rules stemming from Dodd-Frank. ''It's reasonable that they have not given a priority instead to a rule about a hypothetical future crisis,'' he said.
Still, unlike other rules, whose writing requires cooperation with several other agencies, the Fed can complete these itself after consulting with the Treasury Department. In addition, these emergency lending guidelines are likely to be far less complicated than regulations like the Volcker Rule, which aims to define the types of trading that banks are allowed to do.
Senior Fed officials have already been voicing concern about aspects of the financial system that were shored up by crisis loans. For example, Daniel K. Tarullo, the Fed governor who oversees regulation, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV last week that he was still concerned about ''too big to fail'' banks borrowing in credit markets ''that are subject to runs and liquidity freezes.''
Also last week, another Fed governor, Jeremy C. Stein, gave a speech that recognized one of the risks involved in the Fed's emergency lending programs. He spoke about moral hazard, the belief that government support can subsidize banks and make them less careful about the dangers inherent in their businesses.
One way to help address the moral hazard problem would be for the Fed to come out with the new rules on emergency lending. Depending on how strict the rules are, the banks might then realize that the Fed will not be a pushover in times of market stress.
But the Fed may find it hard to formulate rules that allow it to stem market panics without bailing out undeserving institutions.
''You don't want to put out rules that make you look vacuous and you don't want to put out rules that tie your hands,'' Mr. Bradfield said.
But whenever the rules appear, the Fed will face political scrutiny on such a contentious subject. ''No rule about potential assistance from the Fed is going to be easy under the highly politicized conditions that exist today, with everything they do subject to criticism, especially if it helps financial institutions,'' Mr. Elliott said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Their Home Is a Castle, Like It or Not

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

 BODY:
AMSTERDAM, N.Y. -- Susan Phemister assumed it would be easy to flip a castle.
She and her husband, Manfred, had been flipping real estate in zip-zip fashion since the mid-1990s, and had made a killing each time. In 1997, while working in London, they bought a condo for $170,000 and sold it the next year for $245,000. In 1999, they bought again, for $285,000, and sold a year later for $350,000. Then they moved back to New York, bought a three-bedroom place in Park Slope, Brooklyn, for $565,000 and four years later, in 2005, sold it for $1 million.
That's when the Phemisters decided the time was right to buy a castle -- a 36,000-square-footer in classic red brick, complete with 2 turrets and 134 windows -- for sale at what appeared to be the low-low price of $800,000. They spent $400,000 on renovations, which won them a preservation award, and in 2007 put it back on the market at a price fit for a king, $2 million. 
''The plan was for the family to live here for two years,'' said Ms. Phemister, a media executive and mother of three. ''Then we'd sell and make the extra million we'd need to buy a brownstone.''
Unfortunately, as is now widely known, that was when the American economy took a downward turn, and, as Ms. Phemister said, ''The market for castles in upstate New York dried up completely.''
In the five years since, the castle has been taken off the market and put back on several times -- for $1.95 million, $1.25 million fully furnished (including a mounted bison head and 20 stuffed pheasants), $1 million and now, for $895,000.
And yet, even at 2005 prices, it remains the Phemisters' castle.
''We love living here,'' Ms. Phemister said. ''It's just that it's someone else's turn to live in a castle.''
In many ways there is nothing different about the Phemisters' experience from what has happened to millions of other middle-aged Americans who benefited from a generation of upwardly trending real estate prices only to wake one morning, and, in an awful moment of truth, realize that they had pushed their luck once too often.
But the fact that it is a castle, rather than, say, a high ranch, is a reminder of how big Americans allowed themselves to dream during the boom times and how long the consequences have lingered.
For the record, the castle is the Amsterdam Armory, built in 1894 by the state for military training, though no one around here calls it anything but the castle, nor would any real estate broker hoping for a 6 percent commission ever say, ''A man's home is his National Guard armory.''
From the beginning, the Phemisters understood that flipping a castle would require an elaborate plan.
She took a corporate job that would assure benefits and a guaranteed income (a vice president for Thomson Reuters).
Mr. Phemister, 55, has his own business -- CD music distribution -- which allows him to work out of the castle while anchoring life for their three children, now ages 12, 11 and 9.
''Our whole life is a cost-benefit analysis,'' said Ms. Phemister, who is 47.
On Mondays, she is often out of bed before 4 a.m. to drive the 30 minutes from here to Albany. Then she rides the train two and a half hours south to Pennsylvania Station, so she can be at her desk by 7:30. She spends three days in New York, renting rooms in people's homes for $50 a night. Wednesdays, she is on the 4:40 p.m. back to Albany and for the rest of the week works from the castle. ''I love that I can be up at 6 a.m., walking the dog around the castle and answering messages on my phone,'' she said.
Mr. Phemister has 100,000 CDs taking up thousands of square feet of the castle basement. (It would not be fair to say ''dungeon,'' since there are lots of windows and the Phemisters do not torture anyone, except, given their long days, themselves).
It wasn't just the real estate collapse that made castle life so exhausting.
As the music industry shifted from CDs to online downloads, Mr. Phemister's business shrank by half.
To make up the income, they rented out the castle to TV crews (HGTV's ''You Live in What?'') and filmmakers. For the movie ''American General,'' a documentary about Benedict Arnold, the director used the castle's 10,000-square-foot gymnasium to restage the Battles of Saratoga.
But that income was not dependable, so a few years ago they started a bed-and-breakfast, which, they say, brings in $60,000 a year. The only problem is that to maximize revenue, it is run entirely by Mr. and Mrs. Phemister, neither of whom truly needs another job.
Indeed, Mr. Phemister already has another job, coaching youth soccer.
So instead of the castle working for the Phemisters, the Phemisters are working for the castle.
Last year the castle was one of eight buildings -- including the TWA terminal at Kennedy Airport -- to win an excellence award from the Preservation League of New York State.
There have been several potential buyers, including a man who was looking for a good place to store his taxidermy collection; a medieval re-enactment group; and a software executive interested in using it as a country retreat and data center.
A man who owns a military museum and antiques store spent four days visiting but ultimately decided against it because his wife did not want to leave California.
When Ms. Phemister talks to people about the joys of castle life, they often roll their eyes and say, ''Sure it's great to live in a castle, but what about the heating bills?'' Not as bad as they might be. By setting up a zone heating system, they were able to hold the 2012 utility bills -- electric, gas, oil and water -- to $13,076.25, though on the coldest winter days, everyone wears a hoodie and loads up on hot cocoa.
Taxes last year were $17,532.87, about half of what homeowners in the wealthiest suburbs of Westchester County pay for noncastle residences.
In the end, people can find a million reasons not to buy a castle: Some have complained that there is not enough parking, others would prefer a castle that is deep in the woods. The fact is, the only reason to buy a castle is that you have a terrible yearning to live in a castle. ''It's the supercool factor,'' Ms. Phemister said.
The Phemister children are too young to remember Brooklyn, so castle life seems normal to them. They have friends over for dodge ball tournaments in the gym, sleepovers in the turrets, hide-and-seek in dimly lighted passageways.
They are known around town as the castle children, which is mostly -- but not totally -- a good thing. ''Sometimes,'' says Vivienne, who is in the sixth grade, ''people just want to be my friend because I live in a castle.''

HEADLINE: U.S. and China Put Focus on Cybersecurity

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The United States and China held their highest-level military talks in nearly two years on Monday, with a senior Chinese general pledging to work with the United States on cybersecurity because the consequences of a major cyberattack ''may be as serious as a nuclear bomb.''
Cybersecurity has become a sudden source of tension between the two countries. China has bristled over the growing body of evidence that its military has been involved in cyberattacks on American corporations and some government agencies. Last month, the Obama administration demanded that the Chinese government stop the theft of data from American computer networks and help create global standards for cybersecurity. 
At a news conference on Monday after talks with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the Chinese general, Fang Fenghui, said he would be willing to set up a cybersecurity ''mechanism,'' but warned that progress might not be swift.
''I know how difficult it is,'' General Fang said. ''Anyone can launch the attacks -- from the place where he lives, from his own country or from another country.''
General Dempsey arrived in Beijing on Sunday for his first visit to China. His predecessor, Adm. Mike Mullen, held talks in Beijing in July 2011.
General Dempsey's three-day visit comes as mistrust has mounted between Beijing and Washington over a host of issues, including differences over North Korea, Washington's strengthened military posture in the Asia Pacific region, China's assertiveness in the South and East China Seas and basic problems of how the two militaries should communicate in a crisis.
China invited General Dempsey for the talks after the lengthy transition process to a new Chinese government was completed in March. His arrival followed the first visit by Secretary of State John Kerry more than a week ago, and Obama administration officials say they hope the almost back-to-back talks will yield a starting point for better relations after a rocky period of drift.
At the news conference, General Fang, who is the chief of the People's Liberation Army General Staff and a member of the powerful Central Military Commission, also talked of wanting a ''new kind of military relationship that is consistent with the state-to-state relationship.'' He spoke with a confidence that reflected the growing strength of China's military, including expanding its naval presence.
''The Pacific Ocean is wide enough to accommodate us both,'' General Fang said, a suggestion that it was time for the United States to understand the American military would not be able to dominate forever. President Xi Jinping used the same phrase on the eve of his visit to Washington as vice president in February 2012.
General Dempsey did not allow the remark to go unnoticed. The United States, he said, is looking for a ''better, deeper and more enduring relationship'' with the Chinese military -- but in the context of ''other historic and enduring alliances.''
''We do have treaty obligations,'' he said, a reference to the American alliances with Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Australia. ''We will build and recognize the historic alliances, and there will be points when that creates friction.''
Defending the Obama administration's decision to ''pivot'' toward Asia -- a policy widely interpreted as a response to China's expanding influence -- General Dempsey said it was not as though ''we've disappeared and are about to reappear.'' He said he had told General Fang in their private conversation before the news conference that the United States sought to be a ''stabilizing'' factor and that the absence of the United States in the Asia Pacific region would be ''destabilizing.''
After a decade of concentrating on Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States will now carry out an Asia Pacific policy of ''three mores,'' General Dempsey said, bringing more interest, more engagement and more quality assets to the region.
General Fang raised the issue of North Korea's latest nuclear test, a detonation in February just 100 miles from China's northeast border.
''North Korea has already concluded a third nuclear test, and it could conduct a fourth nuclear test,'' he said.
China is North Korea's main ally and economic patron, and the United States has urged the Chinese to use their influence to halt the North's bombast and threats of nuclear attacks on American targets.
General Fang reiterated that China was opposed to North Korea's developing nuclear weapons, and asked for a reopening of the so-called six-party talks that aimed to persuade the North to abandon its nuclear weapons program. The talks collapsed several years ago.

HEADLINE: A Gift to Cornell Tech School Will Aid an Innovative Program

BYLINE: By ARIEL KAMINER

 BODY:
Cornell Tech, the applied sciences graduate school that Cornell University has planned for Roosevelt Island, has received a gift of $133 million that will help it offer an unusual two-year, two-degree master's program. 
The gift is for a joint project with the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology that had previously been announced. It will now be known as the Joan and Irwin Jacobs Technion-Cornell Innovation Institute, reflecting the donation from Mr. Jacobs, the founder of Qualcomm, and his wife.
Students at the Innovation Institute will specialize in connective media, healthier living or the built environment. At the end of their study, students will receive one master's degree from Cornell and another from Technion. The concentration in connective media is expected to be available in fall 2014; the other two will follow.
Cornell Tech, which promotes an unusually close relationship between university and industry, was the winning entry in New York City's competition for $100 million in cash and $300 million in real estate to go toward the development of an applied sciences campus. Officials have said they were impressed by the idea of collaboration with a prestigious foreign university, as well as by the amount of private financing that Cornell had already secured, most notably $350 million from Charles F. Feeney, who made his fortune from duty-free stores.
Construction of Cornell Tech is expected to begin early next year and last until 2037, at which time the school expects to have 2,000 graduate students, 600 of whom will enrolled in the institute. For now, the seven students in the school's initial -- or beta -- class are studying in donated space in Google's Chelsea office.
Joan and Irwin Jacobs, both Cornell graduates who live in San Diego, have previously made significant gifts to both Cornell and Technion. ''We are delighted to partner with Cornell and the Technion on this unique educational initiative,'' they said in a statement. ''We believe strongly in the mission of this international collaboration to drive innovation and to foster economic development..''
Cornell's president, David J. Skorton, called the gift ''transformative'' and said it would ''support the distinctive international partnership between Cornell and the Technion that is already creating a new model of graduate tech education in New York City.'' Technion's president, Peretz Lavie, said that gift would ''play a major and decisive role in fulfilling Mayor Bloomberg's vision of creating a leading global center of innovation in the heart of New York, enabling the city to become the technology capital of the world,'' and that the institute would ''serve as a bridge between Israel and the U.S.A. and Haifa and New York.''

HEADLINE: Shrinking Europe Military Spending Stirs Concern

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- Alarmed by years of cuts to military spending, the NATO secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, issued a dire public warning to European nations, noting that together they had slashed $45 billion, or the equivalent of Germany's entire military budget, endangering the alliance's viability, its mission and its relationship with the United States.
That was two years ago. Since then, with the Afghan war winding down and pressure from the European Union to limit budget deficits, Europe has only cut deeper.
Now, as President Obama wrestles with his own huge budget deficit and military costs, the responsibility for keeping NATO afloat has fallen disproportionately onto the United States, an especially untenable situation as priorities shift to Asia. 
The United States finances nearly three-quarters of NATO's military spending, up from 63 percent in 2001. And yet among the alliance's 28 nations, experts note, only the United States, Britain and Greece are meeting NATO's own spending guidelines of 2 percent of gross domestic product. Even Britain and France -- the two leading European nations willing to project military might -- are slipping further. France says that by 2014 it may cut deeper still -- to just 1.3 percent of G.D.P., down from 1.9 percent this year. By comparison, the United States spent 4.8 percent of its G.D.P. on the military in 2011.
In 2012, for the first time, military spending among Asian nations, in particular China, exceeded that of the Europeans.
''We are moving toward a Europe that is a combination of the unable and the unwilling,'' said Camille Grand, a French military expert who directs the Foundation for Strategic Research. ''European countries are continuing to be free riders, instead of working seriously to see how to act together.''
Increasingly, without United States assistance, military experts said, Europe's armed forces have trouble carrying out basic operations as its dwindling financial and political commitment has derailed multiple initiatives intended to make the continent more self-reliant.
NATO's deputy secretary general, Alexander R. Vershbow, a former senior Defense Department official, said that ''the financial crisis has been corrosive to the alliance'' and that relations between the European Union and NATO remained ''dysfunctional.''
Even as Britain and France have boasted of operations in Libya and Mali, those interventions have revealed Europe's weakness more than its strength. In Libya, the United States supplied intelligence, drones, fighter and refueling aircraft, ammunition stocks and missiles to destroy air defenses, and in Mali the French required American intelligence, drones, and refueling and transport aircraft.
Senior American officials have warned that unless European countries spend more on defense, they risk ''collective military irrelevance.''
A senior American official said that Washington was eager for partnership in the Middle East and Asia, but that ''Europe's decision to abdicate on defense spending increasingly means it can't take care of itself, and it can't be a valuable partner to us.''
While the United States would like to be able to rely more on its European allies, many experts doubt that even the strongest among them, Britain and France, could carry out their part of another Libya operation now, and certainly not in a few years. Both are struggling to maintain their own nuclear deterrents as well as mobile, modern armed forces. The situation in Britain is so bad that American officials are quietly urging it to drop its expensive nuclear deterrent.
''Either they can be a nuclear power and nothing else or a real military partner,'' a senior American official said.
The challenge is particularly acute as NATO pulls its forces out of Afghanistan after a long, wearying and unsatisfying war, with results widely seen as fragile, even unsustainable. After Afghanistan, with Europeans looking inward and the Russian threat considered more rhetorical than real, some wonder once more about the real utility of NATO.
James M. Goldgeier, dean of the School of International Service at American University in Washington, thinks that NATO has some considerable soul-searching ahead if its European members become increasingly unwilling to operate abroad.
''If NATO isn't outward looking, it's got nothing to do,'' he said. ''It can't go back to managing a threat from Russia, because it's not a real threat.''
A decade of halting European efforts to create a Common Security and Defense Policy has yielded little. A NATO Response Force, agreed to in 2002, was supposed to be an all-terrain rapid reaction force, with rotating membership for land, air, naval and special forces, ready to go anywhere and do most anything with at least 13,000 troops. But it has never been used, except in part to add security to the 2004 Athens Olympic Games and the 2004 Afghan elections and to provide disaster relief.
The European Union had a 1999 goal of 60,000 troops available for battle in a ''Eurocorps.'' That has been quietly abandoned, replaced by battle groups of 1,500 to 2,500 troops, also on a rotating basis among the many and differently equipped member states. The ''lead'' country is supposed to take the political risk and provide most of the troops and most of the money.
''Not every battle group has been what it's made out to be,'' said Tomas Valasek, a defense expert and president of the Central European Policy Institute in Bratislava, Slovakia, with diplomatic understatement. ''Some are more ready than others.''
But the will to participate has also declined. While the intent was to have two battle groups, a shortage of countries willing to participate has meant a quiet halving of ready forces to one battle group.
There is also a French-German brigade, formed in 1987, of some 5,000 men, which proudly marched down the Champs-Élysées on Bastille Day. But it, too, has remained unused. When the French wanted to use it for Mali, the Germans objected.
''It's given military cooperation a bad name,'' Mr. Valasek said. The brigade was supposed to be the foundation for the Eurocorps, the abandoned goal of 60,000 troops ready to deploy for two months, but the reality has been embarrassing.
The Germans also objected to fighting in Libya, and even the European Union's effort to come up with 550 military trainers to help reconstruct the Malian Army became a slow slog of negotiations and preparations; the first of those trainers has only now arrived.
There have been many discussions of how smaller European countries can share capabilities, the way the Baltic States do, and the Dutch and Belgians do for naval training and ship purchasing. There is an old debate about whether some countries will give up their own capabilities -- air forces or navies, for example -- so long as partners agree to protect them.
''The way forward is to permanently pool training, procurement, logistics and maintenance,'' Mr. Valasek said. ''We won't find any more money any time soon.'' In the meantime, a lack of procurement means a steady decline as older weapons systems become obsolete.
Toomas Hendrik Ilves, the president of NATO member Estonia, said that ''it's time for a serious rethink about security policy.''
The United States ''has made it clear that it won't continue to pay what is now 75 percent of all NATO military spending,'' he said. ''That should be sufficient for the European members of NATO to understand that this can't work as now,'' especially with the rise of China.
A Western European ambassador to NATO said that ''we need to think more about how to share the burden and rebalance it, both in decision-making and responsibility,'' especially with the pivot to Asia. France, he said, sees the pivot ''as an opportunity, while the East Europeans see it as a threat.'' After Afghanistan, he said, ''we need an adult conversation about rebalancing.''
James B. Steinberg, a former deputy secretary of state and deputy national security adviser, now dean of the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, said that Washington could cope. ''There's less strategic focus on the remaining security problems in Europe itself,'' which he described as mostly residual, including the Balkans and a post-Soviet equilibrium. That means Washington will not put more resources into Europe, especially as it concentrates on China.
But on broader strategic challenges, including China, Washington ''likes the partnership with Europe for political legitimacy, which is not a function of its military capacity,'' he said. European political support allows the United States to take a broader position in East Asia that is not simply bilateral.
No one knows where the next crisis will emerge, Mr. Steinberg said, but it is useful to have NATO there, even acting as a limited coalition, as in Libya. If the United States represents 75 percent of NATO spending, ''that's a modest price to pay when the next crisis comes along.''
Whatever NATO's weaknesses, ''if it were gone, it would be very, very hard to recreate.''

HEADLINE: Sales of Used Homes Dipped in March

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of used homes dipped in March as the supply remained tight. But the pace remained ahead of last year's.
The National Association of Realtors said Monday that sales fell 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.92 million, from 4.95 million in February. The February figure was revised lower.
Still, sales in March were 10.3 percent higher than a year earlier. 
Sales have remained mostly unchanged in the last four months -- largely, analysts have said, because of a limited supply of homes. Economists still predict the housing market will continue to recover this year.
The low supply, combined with rising demand for housing, could accelerate construction in coming months. The Realtors' group said buyer traffic was 25 percent higher than a year ago.
''A disappointing result for U.S. existing-home sales, but with inventories still very tight, the outlook remains favorable,'' Jennifer H. Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note to clients.
A steady housing recovery is providing support to the economy this year. Builders are starting work on more homes, increasing construction jobs. And home prices are rising. Higher prices tend to make homeowners feel wealthier and encourage more spending.
But the pace of purchases of used homes has been little changed in recent months, partly because of the tight inventory. The supply of available homes has fallen nearly 17 percent in the last year to 1.93 million.
At the current sales pace, that supply would be exhausted in 4.7 months, less than the six months typical in a healthy market.
The supply rose 1.6 percent from February to March. The Realtors' group says it expects a much bigger increase in supply this month as the spring selling season began.
The tight supply helps explain rising prices. The median price rose 11.8 percent from February to March to $184,300, the biggest one-month gain since 2005.
The higher median price partly reflects bigger increases in sales of more expensive homes. Sales of homes priced from $500,000 to $750,000 jumped 25.3 percent from a year earlier. By contrast, sales of homes priced from $100,000 to $250,000 rose just 7.1 percent.
First-time buyers, who usually drive housing recoveries, are playing a smaller role in the current rebound. They accounted for 30 percent of sales last month, the same as in February. First-time buyers usually make up about 40 percent of buyers in a healthy market.
One bright sign in the report is that the percentage of so-called distressed sales fell sharply. Distressed sales include foreclosed homes and homes in which the size of the mortgage exceeds the value of the home.
Those sales fell to 21 percent of the total in March, down from 25 percent in February. That is the lowest proportion since the Realtors' group began tracking the figure in October 2008.
Steady hiring and near-record-low mortgage rates have helped increase sales.
Since the housing bubble burst more than six years ago, banks have imposed tighter credit conditions and required larger down payments. Those changes have left many would-be buyers unable to qualify for very low mortgage rates.
Mortgage rates dropped last week to near-record lows. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 3.41 percent from 3.43 percent. That is not far from the record low of 3.31 percent last November.

HEADLINE: A Presidential Pat For Young Scientists

BYLINE: By ASHLEY SOUTHALL

 BODY:
Praising the work of young scientists and inventors at the third White House Science Fair, President Obama on Monday announced a broad plan to create and expand federal and private-sector initiatives designed to encourage children to study science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
After browsing the 30 or so projects on display in the White House's public rooms and the East Garden, Mr. Obama said he was committed to giving students the resources they need to pursue education in the disciplines, collectively known as STEM. Earlier, the White House announced efforts aimed at increasing participation in those fields, particularly among female and minority students, as well as those from low-income and military families. 
''This is not the time to gut investments that keep our businesses on the cutting edge, that keep our economy humming, that improve the quality of our lives,'' Mr. Obama told an audience in the East Room that included 100 students from 40 states, business leaders and science-minded celebrities, among them Bill Nye, the television host and science educator, and LeVar Burton, who appeared in ''Star Trek: The Next Generation.''
''This is the time to reach a level of research and development that we haven't seen since the height of the space race,'' he said.
According to a summary in his 2014 budget request, Mr. Obama has designated $180 million for programs to increase opportunities for participation in STEM programs, from kindergarten through graduate school, for groups historically underrepresented in those fields.
An additional $265 million would be directed to support networks of school districts, universities, science agencies, museums, businesses and other educational entities focused on STEM education, and to finance the creation of a corps of master teachers. Of that, $80 million would go toward furthering the president's goal of adding 100,000 math and science teachers over a decade.
The White House is promoting the programs as part of an ''all hands on deck'' effort that includes an AmeriCorps program that places volunteers in STEM-focused nonprofit organizations; a summer camp for children to design and build projects; a corporate mentorship program; and the expansion of a program to increase access to Advanced Placement courses for students in military families.
In an effort to reach more low-income students, AmeriCorps plans to place 50 volunteers in For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology, or First, a nonprofit organization that sponsors robotics competitions and technology challenges. Technology companies including SanDisk and Cisco have formed the US2020 mentoring campaign with the goal of having at least 20 percent of the firms' employees spending at least 20 hours a year mentoring or teaching by 2020.
This summer, the Maker Education Initiative will host Makers Corps for students to design and build projects that are personally meaningful.
Among the projects on display at the White House were a cloud computing program that improves cancer detection; a fully functional prosthetic arm that costs only $250 to build; an emergency water sanitation system powered by a bicycle; video game designs, which were included at the fair for the first time; and a robot shaped like an Etch A Sketch that paints with watercolors.
Sylvia Todd, 11, a sixth-grader from Auburn, Calif., who built the robot, explained to Mr. Obama and, later, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell that her project had been inspired by similar robots displayed at an earlier competition.
''Everyone was using pens and pencils, and I just wanted to get really creative,'' she said.
Afterward, Sylvia summed up her experience: ''mind-boggling.''

HEADLINE: Flights Delayed Across Country Amid Budget-Cut Furloughs of Air Controllers

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD and JAD MOUAWAD; Matthew L. Wald reported from Washington, and Jad Mouawad from New York. Kevin Sack contributed reporting from Atlanta.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Flights were delayed by up to two hours across the country on Monday, the first weekday that the nation's air traffic control system operated with 10 percent fewer controllers. Pilots, gate agents and others were quick to blame furloughs caused by mandatory across-the-board budget cuts, but the Federal Aviation Administration said it was too soon to tell.
The agency said in a statement, however, that ''travelers can expect to see a wide range of delays that will change throughout the day depending on staffing and weather-related issues,'' and that there were special ''staffing challenges'' at radar centers in New York, Dallas-Fort Worth, Jacksonville and Los Angeles. At those centers, controllers had to space airplanes farther apart so that they would not have to take on more planes than they could manage at a time. 
The F.A.A. said it would not have a firm count of how many delays were the result of air traffic control staffing until Tuesday.
The agency said the public can get a snapshot of overall delays at its Web site, faa.gov.
Delays piled up throughout Monday as the airlines, including US Airways, JetBlue and Delta, were forced to cancel some flights because of cutbacks. Shuttle flights between Washington and New York were running 60 to 90 minutes late. But Southwest Airlines said it did not see any unusual delays.
Airline executives were furious over how the aviation agency handled the government-inflicted chaos, and privately said the agency was seeking to impose the maximum possible pain for passengers to make a political point. The airlines had hoped that Congress would intervene and restore some of the financing, but so far lawmakers have not acted to help the F.A.A.
The pilots' union, and trade groups representing large airlines and regional carriers, filed a suit on Friday seeking to avert the furloughs. The F.A.A. calculated that the furloughs would affect up to 6,700 flights a day. There are 30,000 to 35,000 commercial flights a day.
On Capitol Hill on Monday, Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, said: ''Americans arriving at the airport to take off on their summer vacations already face long lines at security checkpoints. Soon they'll face long waits in the terminal as well.''
In fact, while employees are being furloughed across the federal government, the aviation system is unusually visible, said Paul S. Hudson, the president of FlyersRights.org, the largest airline passenger organization. ''The federal government does not supply direct services to the American public in most areas,'' he said. ''This is one that they do.'' He said that members of Congress were ''playing chicken'' over the budget, but that they amounted to ''a direct shot to the throat of the economy as well as to air travelers directly.''
Passengers found the delays irritating.
Lauren Bernstein, a television producer, was waiting at Newark Liberty International Airport for a flight to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where she was meeting three friends, all turning 30 this month, for a one-week vacation. The United Airlines flight was supposed to leave at 11:34, and about noon, gate agents announced that it would be in the air by 1 p.m. Dunkin' Donuts in hand, and episodes of ''House of Lies'' loaded into her iPad, she waited.
''It's frustrating,'' she said. ''You obviously don't want them to try to put too many planes in the air with not enough people, and have safety issues. But there needs to be some solution.''
''Luckily, I do not have a connection,'' she said. Her flight landed nearly two hours late.
Other passengers took the delays in stride, at least for now. Bill Perry, 48, a trucking company manager from Chattanooga, Tenn., said he had no problem waiting half an hour to help the government balance its budget. ''We need to tighten up anyway, so this isn't any big deal to me,'' Mr. Perry said.
At Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, Roger Eldredge, a Delta gate agent, sought to deflect blame in explaining to passengers that Flight 486 to La Guardia would be leaving at 4:20 p.m. rather than 3:40 p.m. ''If you've watched the news the last couple of days,'' Mr. Eldredge announced, ''you may understand the delay. It has nothing to do with Delta. It has to do with F.A.A. furloughs.''
Mr. Eldredge's partner at the gate, Derek John, said the delays, typically 30 to 60 minutes, had lengthened on Monday afternoon as the slowdown compounded across the country. Mr. John said he had heard passengers grumble that Washington should solve the fiscal crisis. ''But I don't argue with safety,'' he said, ''so it makes sense to me.''
The controllers themselves, who face 11 unpaid days between now and the end of September, are complaining more loudly. ''Our nation's aviation system should never have been allowed to be turned into the political football that it has become,'' the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said on Friday.
The F.A.A. cuts began Sunday, but airlines initially reported few problems. By Sunday evening, the situation had changed, according to a United Airlines spokeswoman, Megan McCarthy.
Some experts said it was possible that even if the reduced staffing persisted, the F.A.A. would improve its management as it got used to the situation.
One expert on air traffic, Daniel A. Baker, a spokesman for FlightAware of Houston, said that it was always difficult to parse what had caused delays, but that some appeared to be coming from staffing problems. ''It can ruin your afternoon, but it's not what people had pictured,'' he said, adding that many feared worse.

HEADLINE: Fueling Up for the Long Haul

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL and CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
The natural gas boom has already upended the American power industry, displacing coal and bringing consumers cheaper electricity.
Now the trucking industry, with its millions of 18-wheelers moving products like potato chips, underarm deodorant and copy paper around the country, is taking a leap forward in switching from petroleum to cleaner-burning natural gas. And if natural gas remains cheap, consumers may benefit again.
This month, Cummins, a leading engine manufacturer, began shipping big, new engines that make long runs on natural gas possible. A skeletal network of refueling stations at dozens of truck stops stands ready. Major shippers like Procter & Gamble, mindful of both fuel costs and green credentials, are turning to companies with natural gas trucks in their fleets.
And in the latest sign of how the momentum for natural gas in transportation is accelerating, United Parcel Service plans to announce in the next few days that it will expand its fleet of heavy 18-wheel vehicles running on liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., to 800 by the end of 2014, from 112. The vehicles will use the new Cummins engines, produced under a joint venture with Westport Innovations. 
U.P.S., like the rest of the industry, still has a long way to go in the conversion, but the company hopes to make natural gas vehicles a majority of its new heavy truck acquisitions in two years.
The company is benefiting from incentives provided by various states and the federal government, which offer tax credits and grants for installing natural gas fuel stations and using vehicles fueled by natural gas.
''By us doing this it will help pave the way and others will follow,'' said Scott Wicker, chief sustainability officer at U.P.S.
''Moving into L.N.G. is a means to get us onto what we see as the bridging fuel of the future and off of oil,'' he said. ''It's the right step for us, for our customers and for our planet.''
The move could also cut the country's oil import bill. There are currently about eight million heavy and medium-weight trucks consuming three million barrels of oil a day while traveling the nation's highways. That is nearly 15 percent of the total national daily consumption and the equivalent of three-fourths of the amount of oil imported from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Roughly two-thirds of the diesel used as transportation fuel nationwide feeds three million 18-wheelers, the main trucks hauling goods over long distances.
In the last four years, the natural gas shale drilling boom has produced a glut of inexpensive fuel, leading producers to argue that the country should wean its commercial and municipal transportation systems from a dependence on imported oil to domestically produced natural gas.
It is cheaper, saving truckers as much as $1.50 a gallon, and it burns cleaner, making it easier to meet emissions standards. The domestic fuel also provides some insulation from the volatile geopolitics that can drive up petroleum prices.
Still, manufacturers and fleet owners have been slow to switch, partly because natural gas vehicles can cost almost twice as much as conventional trucks and because only a few gasoline stations have the specialized equipment needed to dispense the fuel.
Now, as name-brand manufacturers and chains like Nike and Walmart have pressed for transportation of their goods by natural gas vehicles and companies like U.P.S., FedEx and Ryder System have started exploring the option, truck makers have begun bringing natural gas vehicles to the market. Major manufacturers, including Navistar and Volvo, have plans to offer long-haul natural gas vehicles.
Clean Energy Fuels -- a company backed by the financier T. Boone Pickens and Chesapeake Energy -- has peppered major routes with 70 stations, many at truck stops operated by Pilot Flying J. (The truck-stop company, whose chief executive is Jimmy Haslam, owner of the Cleveland Browns, is separately under investigation for potential rebate fraud.)
Clean Energy has plans to complete 30 to 50 more by the end of the year. Shell has an agreement to build refueling stations at as many as 100 TravelCenters of America and Petro Stopping Centers while ENN, a privately held Chinese company, hopes to build 500 filling stations as well.
That emerging network ''really has changed the interplay between the shippers and the contracted carriers,'' said Andrew J. Littlefair, Clean Energy's chief executive. ''The whole deal's beginning to change.''
Though the network is growing rapidly, it has a long way to go. As of May 2012, only 53 L.N.G. fueling stations were in the United States, more than two-thirds concentrated in California, along with 1,047 compressed natural gas stations around the country, according to the Energy Department. In comparison, there were 157,000 fueling stations selling gasoline.
Vehicle use of natural gas in the United States is still negligible but it has been growing. Among fleets whose vehicles travel shorter routes, like transit buses, refuse haulers and delivery trucks, use of compressed natural gas is much further along. Last year, more than half of newly purchased garbage trucks ran on compressed natural gas.
The federal Energy Information Administration last year projected that if enough L.N.G. filling stations were built and economic conditions were right, sales of heavy-duty natural gas vehicles could increase to 275,000 in 2035, equivalent to 34 percent of new vehicle sales, from 860 in 2010. But estimates vary. Citigroup recently forecast that 30 percent of the heavy truck fleet would shift to natural gas by the end of the decade, but some in the transportation industry put that figure much lower.
L.N.G. trucking is slowly gaining traction internationally as well -- especially in Canada and Europe -- although conversion in the United States, where gas is relatively inexpensive, is expected to be faster. Trucking industry experts project that 5 percent of the European heavy trucking fleet could run on natural gas by 2015, rising to as much as 15 percent by 2020.
''Natural gas will be a part of that play in commercial vehicles, but our view is, it's not going to replace diesel,'' said Roe C. East, general manager of the natural gas business at Cummins. He added that natural gas could capture as much as 10 percent of the heavy-duty truck market in North America in the next five years.
One obstacle is cost. There are some tax incentives, and the Obama administration funneled stimulus money to various projects. ENN, the Chinese company, for instance, has teamed up with a small company now operating as Blu in Utah that used federal stimulus money to help open a natural gas fueling station in Salt Lake City in 2011.
But industry executives say that the incentives are not enough to get the system going and solve what Bill Logue, chief executive of the FedEx Freight Corporation, called the ''chicken-and-egg dilemma'' of which comes first, the trucks or the stations.
''We believe that public policy supporting the development of natural gas infrastructure is critical and should be prioritized,'' he said in an e-mail message. ''Individual drivers and private companies cannot realistically be expected to resolve the dilemma themselves.''
Another issue arises alongside the very appeal of the fuel: its low price.
Because natural gas is now in demand to meet so many different energy needs -- including industrial electricity and home heating -- prices could rise, as they have in recent months, especially if the Obama administration begins approving the fuel for export to countries where gas commands a much higher price, as some producers and lawmakers are pressing the Energy Department to do.
As U.P.S. executives explain it, the economics for the switch to natural gas are complex.
Prices for L.N.G. and diesel fuel vary around the country, so the company matches its L.N.G. trucks with states where it can get the lowest-cost gas on long-term contracts and the most generous grants. The rule of thumb, according to U.P.S., is that truck operators save 30 to 40 percent per mile driven on gas over diesel.
A big part of the equation is a 50-cent-per-gallon tax credit the federal government offers to companies that use L.N.G., but that is scheduled to expire at the end of the year.
(There are also federal taxes that work against gas use, including a 12.5 percent federal excise tax on new heavy trucks that is more onerous on L.N.G. vehicles because they are far more expensive.)
''The economics are getting better and better to where it's less of a leap of faith than it used to be,'' said Kurt Kuehn, chief financial officer of U.P.S., although there is still risk because the upfront cost is so high. It still takes seven or eight years for the savings from replacing diesel with the cheaper fuel to cover that cost, he said. For many companies, that may prove too long to wait.
But Clean Energy executives say that the margin between the fuel prices is so wide that the time for recouping the investment is shortening -- perhaps to as little as one to three years.
Mr. Pickens, a Clean Energy board member who has been an advocate for switching the national trucking fleet to natural gas, said that even if the price of natural gas rose by roughly 50 percent, to $6 per thousand cubic feet, truck fleets would most likely still save money.
''Natural gas will always be less than diesel,'' he said, ''because the price of oil is set globally by OPEC and they have to have a price high enough to keep their social commitments and stay in power.''
Mr. Pickens predicted that a majority of the nation's long-haul truck fleet would be fueled by natural gas in seven years because 70 percent of the 18-wheelers operate in defined regional areas, and a natural gas truck can drive 600 miles on a single fill-up.
''I promise you it will all fit together and the stations will be there,'' he said.

HEADLINE: No Bunker-Buster Bomb in Israel's Weapons Deal With U.S.

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER and DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
TEL AVIV -- American and Israeli defense officials welcomed a new arms sale agreement on Monday as a major step toward increasing Israel's military strength, but Israeli officials said it still left them without the weapons they would need if they decided to attack Iran's deepest and best-protected nuclear sites.
The mixed message came as Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and his Israeli counterpart, Moshe Yaalon, reaffirmed their commitment to stopping Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, while sidestepping a continuing disagreement between the two countries about how close to allow Iran to get toward such a goal.
In public, Mr. Hagel again said that Israel had the right to decide by itself how to defend the country, and both officials said military action should be a last resort. But a close adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday that ''the fundamental difference of views on how much risk we can take with Iran is re-emerging.'' 
The new weapons sale package includes aircraft for midair refueling and missiles that can cripple an adversary's air defense system. Both would be critical for Israel if it were to decide on a unilateral attack on Iran.
But what the Israelis wanted most was a weapons system that is missing from the package: a giant bunker-busting bomb designed to penetrate earth and reinforced concrete to destroy deeply buried sites. According to both American and Israeli analysts, it is the only weapon that would have a chance of destroying the Iranian nuclear fuel enrichment center at Fordo, which is buried more than 200 feet under a mountain outside the holy city of Qum.
The weapon, called a Massive Ordnance Penetrator, weighs about 30,000 pounds -- so much that Israel does not have any aircraft capable of carrying it. To do so, Israel would need a B-2 bomber, the stealth aircraft that the United States flew nonstop recently from Missouri to the Korean Peninsula to underscore to North Korea that it could reach its nuclear sites.
The Obama administration has been reluctant to even discuss selling such capability to the Israelis.
Iran has consistently denied that it wants nuclear weapons and has called its uranium enrichment activities peaceful.
The Fordo site has become an increasing source of concern to the Israelis. When they referred last year to Iran's entering a ''zone of immunity,'' Israeli officials said the phrase referred to the moment when the facility would be complete, and immune from attack by Israeli forces. All the centrifuges that enrich uranium at the site have since been installed, but only about a quarter of them are now operating.
Israel has asked the United States for weapons like the Massive Ordnance Penetrator in the past and has been turned down. American officials declined to say whether the yearlong negotiations with Israel that resulted in the new arms package had included a discussion of the new bomb.
Instead, they pointed to a decision by President Obama to send advanced refueling tanker planes to Israel that would make it possible for the country's fighter aircraft to reach as far as Iran. A similar refueling capability was turned down during the administration of President George W. Bush.
George Little, the Pentagon press secretary, said the arms package to Israel was ''unprecedented'' and would ''guarantee and augment our strong ally's qualitative military edge for a generation to come.''
The debate is about more than just equipment. Israel's position has been that Iran cannot be allowed to build up too large a stockpile of medium-enriched uranium that could allow it to then race for a bomb. When Mr. Netanyahu addressed the United Nations in New York last September, he drew a red line across a cartoon picture of a bomb, which aides later said indicated that Iran would not be allowed to amass enough medium-enriched uranium to get enough fuel to make a single weapon.
But most of Iran's production of that uranium is occurring inside the mountain at Fordo. So far, Iran has stayed just below Mr. Netanyahu's red line, converting some of the fuel to a metallic form that can be used in a nuclear reactor -- but that would take significantly more time to further enrich it to bomb-grade material. To the United States, this has offered up more time for a diplomatic solution. To many Israeli officials, it is a ploy, intended to buy time as Iran installs a new generation of centrifuges that could speed its production.
''It's all about timetables,'' said Dore Gold, the president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs and a member of Mr. Netanyahu's inner circle of strategists. ''If you say the goal is to halt Iran in the enrichment phase, you don't have much time. If you are waiting for Iran to weaponize'' -- the position the Obama administration has taken -- ''maybe you can give it another year or more.''
Mr. Yaalon suggested that there was still time. ''There are other tools to be used and to be exhausted, whether it is diplomacy, economic sanctions,'' he said.
Mr. Yaalon avoided mentioning another element of the strategy: sabotage of the Iranian program, which has included cyberattacks on enrichment facilities and the assassination of Iranian scientists. He urged support for Iranians who oppose the current government in Tehran, especially in advance of a presidential election scheduled for June.
But without ''a credible military option,'' Mr. Yaalon warned, ''there is no chance'' that the Iranian government will curtail its nuclear ambitions.
During a news conference with Mr. Yaalon at the Israeli Ministry of Defense, Mr. Hagel pledged that the United States would sustain its commitment to ensuring Israel's ''qualitative military edge,'' and he was emphatic in discussing Iran.
''Iran will not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon,'' Mr. Hagel said. ''Period.''
That was far more definitive than anything he said in his confirmation hearing. There he talked about a strategy of containing Iran -- a strategy that seemed at odds with Mr. Obama's stated position -- before correcting himself for the record to align with the administration's position.
The United States has promised Israel $3.1 billion in military financial assistance in this fiscal year, the highest amount ever. Mr. Hagel cited the $460 million the United States has already given to Israel for its missile-defense systems and noted the $220 million request for the next fiscal year.
After his meetings in Tel Aviv, Mr. Hagel toured northern Israel by helicopter, crossing into the Golan Heights occupied by Israeli forces. The flight took him within a couple of miles of the Syrian side of their disputed border and about 30 miles from the Syrian capital, Damascus.
On Monday evening, Amos Yadlin, the former head of military intelligence in Israel, told the annual conference of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies that while any Israeli attack would only delay Iran's program, ''this delay could be important because we may have a regime change.''
Mr. Yadlin, now the director of the institute, described the tactical differences between the United States and Israel on dealing with Iran as a ''time gap.''
''Israel has defined what the trigger is, what the red line is,'' he said. Iran, he concluded, ''is already there.''

HEADLINE: E.U. Objects to U.S. Regulations on Capital Requirements

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The European Union's top financial regulator has objected to U.S. proposals about capital requirements for branches of foreign banks, saying they would be costly, unfair and potentially damaging to the global economy.
The protest, made last week and circulated on Monday by E.U. officials, comes as large swathes of the banking sector in Europe emerge from a long period of state support after a financial crisis that included the collapse of several banks.
The requirement, meant to ensure banks have adequate capital, could put European lenders at a ''competitive disadvantage'' to their U.S. counterparts, Michel Barnier, the European commissioner for the internal market, warned Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, in a letter on April 18. 
The proposed requirements for so-called foreign banking organizations also ''could spark a protectionist reaction from other jurisdictions, which could ultimately have a substantial negative impact on the global economic recovery,'' Mr. Barnier wrote.
In addition, European bankers have warned that the proposals could become an obstacle in talks over a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between the United States and the European Union, which was proposed in February by President Barack Obama.
The rules mark a significant change because U.S. authorities have long allowed the capital requirements on branches of foreign banks to be mainly supervised by their home countries. Pressure grew to overhaul that policy after the Fed was forced to give emergency loans to foreign banks caught up in the financial crisis.
The Fed's Board of Governors issued the proposal on foreign banks for public comment in December as part of efforts to implement enhanced capital requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act, which beefed up financial oversight in the United States.
''The U.S. operations of large foreign institutions have changed in recent years -- marked in part by significantly greater reliance on potentially unstable, short-term wholesale funding and rapid growth in their capital markets activities,'' said a spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve. ''The Federal Reserve has proposed a set of targeted adjustments to its regulatory framework for foreign banking organizations to address these new risks, create a more consistent regulatory structure for all firms operating in the United States, and promote U.S. financial stability, which is essential for global financial stability.''
One of the main concerns in Europe was a requirement that called for foreign banks to maintain separate liquidity buffers for their U.S. branches, while many American banks would be subject to a single liquidity requirement for their global operations.
The Fed was ''completely disregarding'' whether foreign banks were already governed by standards that were already as robust as U.S. standards in their home countries, Mr. Barnier wrote.
Mr. Barnier's protest has strong support from industry groups like the European Banking Federation, which explained its ''serious concerns'' about the measure in a six-page letter from the federation's chief executive, Guido Ravoet, to the secretary of the Fed's Board of Governors, Robert deV. Frierson, on April 18.
The rules would mean U.S. lenders operate under rules ''not comparable to how U.S.-headquartered banking organizations are regulated,'' warned Mr. Ravoet, whose federation is made up of national associations that count major lenders like Deutsche Bank of Germany and Barclays of Britain among their members.
Some foreign banks could choose to close down their American operations and so ''U.S. financial markets and the broader U.S. economy would suffer, especially at a time when the U.S. economic recovery remains fragile, and global economic conditions remain uncertain,'' he wrote.
The rules also ''could pose another obstacle to the successful conclusion of the T.T.I.P. negotiations, which are expected to be complex and ambitious,'' wrote Mr. Ravoet, using the acronym for the proposed transatlantic trade pact.

HEADLINE: Government Deficits Fall In Europe; Debt Rises

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- An austerity push in Europe helped to reduce government budget deficits in 2012 for a fourth consecutive year, official data showed on Monday, but in relation to gross domestic product, national debt burdens grew. 
Outlays exceeded revenue by 3.7 percent in the 17-nation euro zone, down from 4.2 percent in 2011, Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, reported from Luxembourg. For all 27 nations of the union, the government deficit fell to 4 percent from 4.4 percent.
Euro zone debt measured as a percentage of gross domestic product rose to 90.6 percent, from 87.3 percent in 2011. For the union, debt rose to 85.3 percent of G.D.P. from 82.5 percent a year earlier.
Ben May, an economist in London with Capital Economics, noted that the numbers appeared impressive, comparing favorably with those of the United States and Britain, where government deficits last year exceeded 8 percent of G.D.P., and with Japan, where the deficit was more than 10 percent.
''But the fact that most economies' deficits have fallen by less than expected and that the consolidation has coincided with deeper-than-anticipated recessions confirms that the costs have been large,'' Mr. May wrote. He noted that Germany, which last year posted a small budget surplus, accounted for about 60 percent of the improvement.
France's deficit last year, at 4.8 percent of G.D.P., fell short of President François Hollande's target of 4.5 percent. Spain posted a budget deficit of 10.6 percent, worse than the 10.2 percent the European Commission had forecast. Both countries face a struggle to meet their financial targets for 2013, economists say.
Greece, the member of the European Union most battered by the crisis, posted a deficit of 10 percent of G.D.P., up from 9.5 percent a year earlier. Its debt fell to 157 percent of G.D.P. from 170 percent after a bailout in which bondholders were forced to write off part of their Greek holdings.
Austerity took hold in Europe when, after the credit bubble collapsed, speculative attacks began on the sovereign debt of euro members like Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus. Led by Germany, governments responded with a reaffirmed commitment to hold their deficits to a maximum of 3 percent of G.D.P. and debts to no more than 60 percent.
Fiscal hawks say that deficit spending is merely a means of pushing the cost of politically unpopular action onto future generations. But austerity, whereby government spending is cut and taxes increased, reduces demand in the overall economy and drives up unemployment, at least in the short term.

HEADLINE: Daylong 'Warning Strike' Grounds Most Lufthansa Flights

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
PARIS -- A widespread strike all but grounded the German flag carrier Lufthansa on Monday, affecting around 150,000 passengers around the world amid a battle over wages as the airline pushes ahead with a $2 billion restructuring program.
The airline, Europe's largest by passengers carried, said it had to cancel all but 32 of its 1,700 scheduled flights worldwide after unions representing more than 33,000 ground crew and other staff, half its German work force, called the action. The full-day ''warning strike'' at Germany's biggest airports -- including Frankfurt, Munich and Hamburg -- was the second such action in a month by members of the country's powerful services union, ver.di. The union is seeking a 5.2 percent wage increase, job guarantees and a shorter, 12-month contract period. 
The contract talks come as Lufthansa, like other large network carriers across Europe, struggles to keep a lid on operating costs. In the European market, Lufthansa and its peers are losing market share to leaner and nimbler rivals like Ryanair, easyJet and Air Berlin. On long-distance routes, they are being squeezed by rapidly expanding Middle Eastern carriers like Emirates and Etihad.
Lufthansa said it had managed to operate a small number of long-distance flights Monday, most of them to U.S. destinations. At Frankfurt, where Lufthansa is based, only 6 of 50 scheduled intercontinental flights took off: to Kennedy International Airport in New York, as well as Philadelphia and Atlanta in the United States; Madras, India; Nagoya, Japan; and Kuwait City. From Munich, only three trans-Atlantic flights -- to Charlotte, North Carolina; Chicago and Miami -- departed out of 17 scheduled. All three daily flights to the United States from Düsseldorf -- to Newark Liberty International Airport, Chicago and Miami -- operated as scheduled.
The airline said it had managed to warn roughly 100,000 -- or two-thirds -- of its affected passengers over the weekend and was making arrangements to rebook them on other flights or refund their tickets.
The delays for Lufthansa passengers came as some flights in and out of New York, Washington and other U.S. airports were delayed by several hours Monday as federal budget cuts led to furloughs of air traffic controllers. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has begun restricting air traffic at peak times because it has too few controllers to safely monitor busy air corridors.
The walkout in Germany on Monday was the latest in a series of labor disputes at Lufthansa that began last year and has been fueled by a restructuring plan, announced last May, that seeks to shave more than &#x20ac;1.5 billion, or almost $2 billion, from annual costs by 2015. The plan foresees the elimination of around 3,500 jobs -- about 2,500 of them in Germany -- largely through attrition and voluntary, early retirements. Lufthansa's global work force currently stands at around 117,000.
Staff costs have risen steadily at Lufthansa over the past decade and now represent more than 22 percent of the airline's total operating costs as a share of revenue -- on a par with its fuel bill, which reached &#x20ac;7.4 billion last year.
By contrast, labor costs as a share of revenue are less than 10 percent at Europe's largest low-cost carrier, Ryanair, and 12.4 percent at easyJet, according to the Center for Aviation in Brussels.
Claudia Lange, a Lufthansa spokeswoman, said the strike, which was announced Friday and in which roughly 12,000 staff participated, was unexpected, given that the airline had improved its pay offer during the most recent round of negotiations, which ended April 17. She said management's latest offer included raises of up to 3 percent, but sought to extend the contract period to 29 months in order to provide more predictability in wage costs. Ver.di's most recent contract with Lufthansa was for 22 months.
''It is surprising that the union is going on strike at all,'' said Ms. Lange, who said she could not recall the last time Lufthansa had faced such a widespread labor-related disruption. ''Until now, the negotiations have been fairly constructive.''
The airline's offer, she added, also includes a one-time bonus payment equivalent to 1 percent of annual wages if the company achieves an operating profit margin of 3 percent in 2014. The margin was 1.7 percent last year, down from 2.9 percent in 2011 and 3.9 percent in 2010.
Martina Sönnischen, a ver.di spokeswoman, dismissed Lufthansa's offer as ''scandalous,'' saying that it still represented a small fraction of what the union had demanded and failed to address the question of job guarantees.
''This is not a starting point for a serious discussion,'' she said.
Ms. Sönnischen declined to say whether the union planned further work stoppages in the run-up to the next round of talks, slated for April 29-30.
Tactical warning strikes of several hours' duration are commonly used by German unions during wage negotiations as a means of increasing the pressure on employers. Last month, a half-day warning strike by ver.di led to the cancellation of 700 Lufthansa flights after a previous round of talks ended without an agreement.
The warning strike Monday was unusual in that it lasted a full day. Ms. Lange said the company predicted that the financial impact of the strike would be in the ''two-digit millions'' of euros.
Lufthansa's restructuring efforts have begun to bear fruit despite a weakening European economy and stubbornly high fuel prices. The company reported a net profit of &#x20ac;990 million for last year, bolstered by asset sales, compared with a loss of &#x20ac;13 million in 2011. But it suspended dividend payments to shareholders in order to make more cash available to finance its turnaround.
Lufthansa said that flights would resume Tuesday, but that passengers should expect significant delays until at least early afternoon.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Japan Banks Court Overseas Borrowers

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan's banking titans are hiring Spanish-speaking bankers to win new business in Latin America and handing out loans to junk-grade borrowers in the United States as they flee meager returns at home.
Lenders like Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, or SMFG, have increased overseas lending since the euro zone debt crisis sent European rivals packing. The move abroad was given new impetus this month after the central bank unveiled a stimulus plan that has further eroded razor-thin loan margins and cut returns on Japanese government bonds. 
Banks including Mizuho Financial Group are pushing ahead to identify new overseas borrowers, including corporations with little connection to Japan and developers of natural resources seeking copious funding. Their ventures abroad, while still modest in comparison with their domestic operations, point to their growing risk tolerance in emerging markets, and it remains to be seen whether their efforts will pay off.
''We now arrange deals that are very different from what we used to do in the past -- that is, those with very strong local flavor with no involvement of Japanese companies,'' said Takayuki Sakai, chief manager of project finance at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, a core unit of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.
The bank is looking to increase lending denominated in local currencies, instead of the usual dollar-dominated loans, he said.
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ has been beefing up its project finance business in Latin America, hiring specialist bankers who speak Spanish and Portuguese to gain better access to projects involving exclusively local parties.
Last summer, the bank hired Ralph Scholtz, BNP Paribas's Latin America project finance managing director, as its region's project finance team head. It also hired a Portuguese-speaking banker from HSBC Holdings.
The bank said Latin America is a promising market for project financing, highlighting plans in Mexico to build gas pipelines, and development of copper mines and auxiliary facilities like power plants in Chile.
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group does not disclose data on dollar-based overseas loans.
The outstanding overseas loans of two domestic rivals, SMFG and Mizuho, totaled $277 billion as of December, an increase of 66 percent from March 2010.
Sumitomo Mitsui Banking, a unit of SMFG, said a team of its U.S. bankers was taking aim at small and medium-size local businesses, including those with credit ratings of BB or lower.
The bank declined to disclose interest margins for those noninvestment grade borrowers. Industry sources say loans to BB-rated borrowers have spreads of 1.7 to 1.8 percentage points over A-rated ones.
There is a limit to what banks can earn from loans to clients with top-notch credit status, said Hideo Kawafune, senior vice president at SMBC's international banking unit.
''Our current loan portfolio is a bit weighted on high credit rating borrowers, and we would like to expand lending to customers in the BB+ to BB- class,'' Mr. Kawafune said.
The bank is increasing loans to U.S. municipalities after poaching a public finance team from a U.S. bank in 2008. Recent transactions include a $209 million loan to New York City Water Financing Authority.
Mr. Kawafune said loans to non- investment grade corporations and municipalities in the United States still represented a small portion of loans, 10 percent to 20 percent over all. But their growth is outpacing the rest of the bank's overseas lending, he said.
Mizuho Corporate Bank, a unit of Mizuho Financial, said acquisition financing for non-Japanese companies was likely to drive its overseas loan growth this year.
The bank is working on financing for two multibillion-dollar merger and acquisition deals involving corporate clients based in North America and Europe, Mizuho bankers said, without elaborating, citing bank-client confidentiality agreements. Mizuho Corporate Bank has said it was taking aim at big companies like BP, Prada and I.B.M. in the Americas, Europe, East Asia and Oceania.
Kazuya Nakagawa, senior vice president at Mizuho's international coordination division, said merger and acquisition finance was relatively profitable, compared with loans to blue-chip companies.
Such finance is attractive in that it provides short-term loans to borrowers, and thus does not tie up the bank's capital for long.
It could also lead to additional businesses, like issuing bonds, when the borrower switches to a more permanent mode of financing upon the completion of the acquisition, according to Mizuho bankers.

HEADLINE: Heated Questions and Divisions Emerge at Immigration Bill Hearing

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After months of heated negotiations, a bipartisan group of eight senators finally achieved compromise, coming together to unveil a broad overhaul of the nation's immigration laws. But at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the legislation Monday, a new set of divisions began to emerge, offering an early glimpse at the partisan politics likely to be on display as the immigration bill winds its way through the Senate.
At the marathon session, which featured testimony from 23 people, both lawmakers and witnesses raised charged questions. Could an immigration overhaul be done in separate pieces, without including a path to citizenship? What protections, if any, do same-sex couples deserve? How should the Boston bombings affect the immigration debate? The tempers of legislators flared, and at one point the hearing needed to be gaveled back to order. 
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and the chairman of the committee, took issue with conservative commentators and Republican lawmakers who suggested that any debate about an immigration overhaul should take into account that the two suspects in the Boston bombing emigrated to the United States from Kyrgyzstan.
''Last week, opponents of comprehensive immigration reform began to exploit the Boston Marathon bombing,'' Mr. Leahy said. ''Let no one be so cruel as to try to use the heinous acts of these two young men last week to derail the dreams and futures of millions of hard-working people.''
At the committee's first hearing to review the new legislation on Friday, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the committee, said that immigration changes should be done carefully, ''particularly in light of all that's happening in Massachusetts right now and over the last week.''
(On Monday, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, seemed to underscore the concerns of some Republicans when he sent a letter to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, arguing that in light of the Boston bombings, ''we should not proceed until we understand the specific failures of our immigration system.'')
The mood quickly turned tense when Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and a member of the bipartisan group that drafted the new legislation, seemed to criticize his fellow senators, who, he said, ''are pointing to what happened, the terrible tragedy in Boston, as, I would say, an excuse for not doing a bill or delaying it many months or years.''
''I never said that!'' said Mr. Grassley, raising his voice and leaning forward in his chair to look at Mr. Schumer. ''I never said that!''
''I don't mean you, Mr. Grassley,'' Mr. Schumer said, as Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, accused Mr. Schumer of ''demeaning the witnesses,'' and Mr. Leahy banged his gavel to restore order in the hearing room.
The two brothers suspected of perpetrating the bombings came to the United States through the existing legal immigration system, under a 2002 asylum petition by their father, who said he was worried about his safety because of his activities in Chechnya. One of the brothers had become a naturalized citizen, and the other was here legally on a visa, though his citizenship was still under review after a routine background check revealed that he had been interviewed by the F.B.I. in 2011.
Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, touched on another sensitive point when he suggested that instead of passing a broad bill, the Senate should take a piecemeal approach, focusing on areas ''where there is wide bipartisan agreement.''
''I don't think that there is any issue in this entire debate that is more divisive than a path to citizenship for those who are here illegally,'' he said. ''In my view, any bill that insists upon that jeopardizes the likelihood of passing any immigration reform bill.''
Though the bipartisan group has insisted that any legislation must be comprehensive -- Democrats, in particular, fear that they would not be able to secure support for a path to citizenship if lawmakers were allowed to vote on that issue separately -- Mr. Cruz seemed to echo some House Republicans, who have suggested breaking the bill up into smaller parts and focusing on its less controversial components.
Another touchy point -- that the bill currently does not include same-sex couples for family unity consideration -- came up during the testimony of Jim Kolbe, a former Republican congressman from Arizona who is gay and who endured a yearlong separation from his partner, a Panamanian immigrant, when the man's work visa expired.
''Families like mine are left behind as part of this proposal,'' Mr. Kolbe said. ''Equally important, U.S. businesses and our economy suffer because of the omission of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender families from the bill introduced last week.'' Several Republican members of the bipartisan group have explicitly said that adding such protections would doom the legislation.

HEADLINE: Internet Sales Tax Bill Gains Ground in Senate

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It has been labeled a tax grab and a bureaucratic nightmare by conservative antitax activists, an infringement on states' rights and a federal encroachment on the almost-sacred ground of Internet commerce.
Yet legislation to help states force online retailers to collect sales taxes easily cleared its first procedural hurdle on Monday evening, and even its fiercest opponents are looking to the House for a last stand. The Senate voted 74-20 to take up the legislation for debate and amendment.
''I'm not above believing in miracles,'' said Dan Holler, a spokesman for Heritage Action, the activist arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation, which has made opposition to the Internet tax bill a ''key vote'' -- so far with little impact. 
The bill, known as the Marketplace Fairness Act, is that rare piece of legislation that has turned Democrat against Democrat, Republican against Republican and business against business, while uniting states as different as New Hampshire, Montana and Oregon -- which have no sales taxes -- against virtually every other state.
An odd confluence of events has swung the political momentum to one side. Less than a week after the Senate could not muster 60 votes to expand gun background checks supported by a vast majority of voters, lawmakers from both parties are poised to steamroll opponents and greatly broaden the imposition of sales taxes on the Internet.
Under the bill, online retailers would collect an estimated $22 billion to $24 billion that now goes uncollected. A final vote is expected in the Senate by the end of the week. When the House will take up the issue is uncertain.
''We think this is inevitable, with states looking for revenue, with the growth of e-commerce,'' said Stephen Schatz, a spokesman for the National Retail Federation, which has said for years that brick-and-mortar retailers were at a competitive disadvantage against online giants.
''Inevitable'' is not a word used often for legislation that Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform mobilizes against and eBay rallies millions of its users to oppose, as they have with this bill. But sometimes the stars align. State and local governments are pleading to lawmakers to help fill their budget holes with legislation that technically does not raise a penny in federal taxes.
''What it means is a lot of money for states and localities,'' Senator Richard Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and one of the bill's champions, said on Monday.
Old-fashioned retailers are going bust, leaving towns marred by vast, empty storefronts. Those that remain complain of ''showrooming,'' when shoppers inspect their wares, then leave the store to buy the same products on the Internet, finding lower prices and avoiding sales taxes.
Republicans including Senators Mike Enzi of Wyoming and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee are as adamantly in favor of the bill as Democrats.
Finally, Senate Democratic leaders needed a bill to move to quickly after gun legislation all but died last week, and the Internet tax bill was ready.
President Obama on Monday threw his support behind the bill, which the White House said ''will level the playing field for local small business retailers that are in competition every day with large out-of-state online companies.''
The bill would allow states to require all Internet sellers to collect sales taxes for the state and local governments of the buyers. State governments would be required to provide software free to Internet retailers to calculate sales taxes. Online retailers with out-of-state sales of less than $1 million a year would be exempt.
Opponents predict a bookkeeping nightmare. Online retailers would have to keep track of more than 9,000 sales-tax regimes. Internet companies in states with no sales taxes -- Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon and Delaware -- would have to build a collection apparatus from scratch.
Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, called the legislation ''a targeted strike against the Internet and a targeted strike against the digital economy.''
Many of the largest Web retailers have already begun collecting sales taxes. Amazon.com has joined a vast constellation of brick-and-mortar retailers in collecting taxes, leaving eBay to fight an increasingly lonely battle. In March, the Senate held a test vote of sorts, a nonbinding amendment to the Senate budget that mirrored the Marketplace Fairness Act.
It passed 75 to 24 and won the votes of some of the Senate's most ardent conservative Republicans, including Senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma.
Shifting his company's position, eBay's chief executive, John J. Donahoe, has begun pressing for compromise, a $10 million exemption that would shield virtually all of eBay's sellers.
For many opponents, the fight is already shifting to the House, where an identical measure by Representative Steve Womack, Republican of Arkansas, has collected 55 co-sponsors from both parties. Mr. Womack said on Monday that he had held several meetings with Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, including one where Senators Enzi and Alexander joined the pitch.
For House members from both parties, Mr. Norquist's voice may be no match for the hometown retailers, Mr. Womack said.
''I'm just hopeful we can send a life vest to our traditional retailers,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Game Theory: Jane Austen Had It First

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER

 BODY:
It's not every day that someone stumbles upon a major new strategic thinker during family movie night. But that's what happened to Michael Chwe, an associate professor of political science at the University of California, Los Angeles, when he sat down with his children some eight years ago to watch ''Clueless,'' the 1995 romantic comedy based on Jane Austen's ''Emma.''
Mr. Chwe (pronounced CHEH), the author of papers like ''Farsighted Coalitional Stability'' and ''Anonymous Procedures for Condorcet's Model: Robustness, Nonmonotonicity and Optimality,'' had never cracked ''Emma'' or ''Pride and Prejudice.'' But on screen, he saw glimmers of a strategic intelligence that would make Henry Kissinger blush.
''This movie was all about manipulation,'' Mr. Chwe, a practitioner of the hard-nosed science of game theory, said recently by telephone. ''I had always been taught that game theory was a mathematical thing. But when you think about it, people have been thinking about strategic action for a long time.'' 
Mr. Chwe set to doing his English homework, and now his assignment is in. ''Jane Austen, Game Theorist,'' just published by Princeton University Press, is more than the larky scholarly equivalent of ''Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.'' In 230 diagram-heavy pages, Mr. Chwe argues that Austen isn't merely fodder for game-theoretical analysis, but an unacknowledged founder of the discipline itself: a kind of Empire-waisted version of the mathematician and cold war thinker John von Neumann, ruthlessly breaking down the stratagems of 18th-century social warfare.
Or, as Mr. Chwe puts it in the book, ''Anyone interested in human behavior should read Austen because her research program has results.''
Modern game theory is generally dated to 1944, with the publication of von Neumann's ''Theory of Games and Economic Behavior,'' which imagined human interactions as a series of moves and countermoves aimed at maximizing ''payoff.'' Since then the discipline has thrived, often dominating political science, economics and biology departments with densely mathematical analyses of phenomena as diverse as nuclear brinkmanship, the fate of protest movements, stock trading and predator behavior.
But a century and a half earlier, Mr. Chwe argues, Austen was very deliberately trying to lay philosophical groundwork for a new theory of strategic action, sometimes charting territory that today's theoreticians have themselves failed to reach.
First among her as yet unequaled concepts is ''cluelessness,'' which in Mr. Chwe's analysis isn't just tween-friendly slang but an analytic concept worthy of consideration alongside game-theoretic chestnuts like ''zero-sum,'' ''risk dominance'' and ''prisoner's dilemma.''
Most game theory, he noted, treats players as equally ''rational'' parties sitting across a chessboard. But many situations, Mr. Chwe points out, involve parties with unequal levels of strategic thinking. Sometimes a party may simply lack ability. But sometimes a powerful party faced with a weaker one may not realize it even needs to think strategically.
Take the scene in ''Pride and Prejudice'' where Lady Catherine de Bourgh demands that Elizabeth Bennet promise not to marry Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth refuses to promise, and Lady Catherine repeats this to Mr. Darcy as an example of her insolence -- not realizing that she is helping Elizabeth indirectly signal to Mr. Darcy that she is still interested.
It's a classic case of cluelessness, which is distinct from garden-variety stupidity, Mr. Chwe argues. ''Lady Catherine doesn't even think that Elizabeth'' -- her social inferior -- ''could be manipulating her,'' he said. (Ditto for Mr. Darcy: gender differences can also ''cause cluelessness,'' he noted, though Austen was generally more tolerant of the male variety.)
The phenomenon is hardly limited to Austen's fictional rural society. In a chapter called ''Real-World Cluelessness,'' Mr. Chwe argues that the moralistic American reaction to the 2004 killing and mutilation of four private security guards working with the American military in Falluja -- L. Paul Bremer III, leader of the American occupation of Iraq, later compared the killers to ''human jackals''-- obscured a strategic truth: that striking back at the city as a whole would only be counterproductive.
''Calling your enemy an animal might improve your bargaining position or deaden your moral qualms, but at the expense of not being able to think about your enemy strategically,'' Mr. Chwe writes.
The darker side of Austen is hardly unknown to literary scholars. ''Regulated Hatred,'' a classic 1940 paper by the psychologist D. W. Harding, argued that her novels explored containment strategies against the ''eruption of fear and hatred into the relationships of everyday social life.''
But Mr. Chwe, who identifies some 50 ''strategic manipulations'' in Austen (in addition to a chapter on the sophisticated ''folk game theory'' insights in traditional African tales), is more interested in exploring the softer side of game theory. Game theory, he argues, isn't just part of ''hegemonic cold war discourse,'' but what the political scientist James Scott called a subversive ''weapon of the weak.''
Such analysis may not go over well with military types, to say nothing of literary scholars, many of whom see books like Mr. Chwe's or ''Graphing Jane Austen,'' an anthology of Darwinian literary criticism published last year, as examples of ham-handed scientific imperialism.
''These ostensibly interdisciplinary efforts are sometimes seen as attempts to validate the humanities by attaching them to more empirical disciplines,'' said Jonathan Kramnick, a professor of English at Johns Hopkins and the author of the 2011 essay ''Against Literary Darwinism,'' who has not read Mr. Chwe's book. ''But for some, myself included, literary studies doesn't need to attach itself to any other discipline.'' Even some humanists who admire Mr. Chwe's work suggest that when it comes to appreciating Austen, social scientists may be the clueless ones. Austen scholars ''will not be surprised at all to see the depths of her grasp of strategic thinking and the way she anticipated a 20th-century field of inquiry,'' Laura J. Rosenthal, a specialist in 18th-century British literature at the University of Maryland, said via e-mail.
As for Mr. Chwe, he said he was happy if he could spread Janeism among the game-playing wonks. And which Austen character would he want leading America in a nuclear showdown?
Easy, he said with a laugh: ''I would want Austen herself.''

HEADLINE: In Gun Bill Defeat, a President Who Hesitates to Twist Arms

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senator Mark Begich, Democrat of Alaska, asked President Obama's administration for a little favor last month. Send your new interior secretary this spring to discuss a long-simmering dispute over construction of a road through a wildlife refuge, Mr. Begich asked in a letter. The administration said yes.
Four weeks later, Mr. Begich, who faces re-election next year, ignored Mr. Obama's pleas on a landmark bill intended to reduce gun violence and instead voted against a measure to expand background checks. Mr. Obama denounced the defeat of gun control steps on Wednesday as ''a shameful day.''
But Mr. Begich's defiance and that of other Democrats who voted against Mr. Obama appear to have come with little cost. Sally Jewell, the interior secretary, is still planning a trip to Alaska -- to let Mr. Begich show his constituents that he is pushing the government to approve the road. 
The trip will also reinforce for Mr. Begich and his colleagues a truth about Mr. Obama: After more than four years in the Oval Office, the president has rarely demonstrated an appetite for ruthless politics that instills fear in lawmakers. That raises a broader question: If he cannot translate the support of 90 percent of the public for background checks into a victory on Capitol Hill, what can he expect to accomplish legislatively for his remaining three and a half years in office?
Robert Dallek, a historian and biographer of President Lyndon B. Johnson, said Mr. Obama seems ''inclined to believe that sweet reason is what you need to use with people in high office.'' That contrasts with Johnson's belief that ''what you need to do is to back people up against a wall,'' Mr. Dallek said.
''Obama has this more reasoned temperament,'' he said. ''It may well be that it's not the prescription for making gains. It raises questions about his powers of persuasion.''
Some supporters said the imperative of the moment requires more force from Mr. Obama. ''He needs to turn up the heat every way he can and every chance he gets because it's not political points or poll numbers that are at stake but lives,'' said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a New York Democrat who has sponsored a gun control bill in the House.
The White House on Monday defended the president's efforts on the gun legislation, saying he had made a vigorous effort to lobby wavering senators. ''He made numerous phone calls and had numerous meetings,'' said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary. ''And his entire team here engaged in this process completely and thoroughly.''
But the president has long struggled to master his relationship with Congress. During his first two and a half years in office, he favored what aides called an inside approach, working quietly in back rooms to convince lawmakers of the logic of his positions. That worked better when Democrats controlled both the House and the Senate, and he passed legislation to expand health care, regulate Wall Street and spend hundreds of billions of dollars to stimulate the economy.
After Republicans took control of the House in the 2010 midterm elections, Mr. Obama grew exasperated by talks that rarely seemed to lead to deals. As a result, he adjusted to an ''outside strategy'' and used campaign-style rallies around the country to put pressure on lawmakers. That won him victories on a payroll tax cut and keeping student loan rates low, but when he tried it on gun control, it failed.
''There have been very few consequences for those that defeat the legislation, and that's what allows the legislation to be defeated,'' said former Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, who retired in 2011. But Mr. Dorgan said that in the modern era, constituent pressure is the key. ''Put some real pressure on back home. The pressure back home is more important than pressure from the White House.''
William M. Daley, Mr. Obama's chief of staff from 2011 to 2012, wrote in The Washington Post that Democratic donors should hold back their support. ''So I'll have some advice for my friends in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles: Just say no to the Democrats who said no on background checks,'' Mr. Daley wrote.
White House officials insisted the president had mobilized the full weight of his office to wage a public campaign on behalf of the gun legislation. The president deputized Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a veteran of past gun control battles, to lead the public effort. Behind the scenes, outreach and coordination were managed first by Bruce Reed, Mr. Biden's chief of staff, and later by Denis R. McDonough, the president's new chief of staff.
Not counting dinners that Mr. Obama held with senators, White House officials said he and Mr. Biden participated in more than 45 calls or meetings with 30 senators in March and April.
''I don't know how he could have been more all-in than he's been,'' said Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.
Some Democrats on Capitol Hill agreed, saying that Mr. Obama's reputation for not imposing discipline had more to do with the current nature of legislating in Washington, where the two parties have grown increasingly polarized. Several also noted that presidents can no longer use earmarks -- the pet projects of legislators that are now banned -- to help grease a bill's passage. Aides to Mr. Obama said such incentives would not have worked anyway for Democrats worried about the power of the gun issue.
''President Obama is not Lyndon Johnson, and this is not the 1960s,'' said Representative Mike Thompson, a California Democrat and chairman of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. Mr. Johnson had large Democratic majorities in Congress during much of his presidency. ''It's a different time and different people, and everyone has their own way of doing things. This president can be every bit as convincing as any president before him.''
Mr. Obama's former campaign operation has already pledged to go after Democrats who opposed gun control. In remarks after the gun legislation died Wednesday, Mr. Obama hinted that retribution might come after all. ''If this Congress refuses to listen to the American people and pass common-sense gun legislation, then the real impact is going to have to come from the voters,'' he said.
In the case of Mr. Begich, though, it is unclear whether Mr. Obama will punish him, and to what end. The administration has agreed only to reconsider its decision to block the road in Alaska, not to reverse it. And yet, the president also wants to keep a Democrat in Alaska to help hold onto control of the Senate.
''It certainly is the $64,000 question,'' Mr. Dallek said.

HEADLINE: S.&P. Seeks Dismissal of U.S. Civil Suit Over Rating of Mortgage Debt

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
7:35 p.m. | Updated Standard Poor's, accused of inflating its ratings to win business during the boom in mortgage investments, urged a judge on Monday to dismiss the federal government's civil case against it, saying the Justice Department had built a faulty complaint on ''isolated snippets'' of conversations rather than evidence of real wrongdoing.
S.& P., the largest ratings agency in the United States, was responding to civil fraud charges filed in February in the first significant federal action against the ratings industry since the mortgage bubble burst. The Justice Department's lawsuit accused S.& P. of knowingly giving complex packages of mortgages higher ratings than they deserved, stoking investor demand for the securities and driving up prices to where they crashed, setting off the global financial crisis. 
''From start to finish, the complaint overreaches in targeting S.& P.,'' the firm's lawyers, including Floyd Abrams of Cahill Gordon & Reindel, said in a brief filed in United States District Court for the Central District of California, in Los Angeles.
''S.& P.'s inability, together with the Federal Reserve, Treasury and other market participants, to predict the extent of the most catastrophic meltdown since the Great Depression, reveals a lack of prescience, but not fraud,'' the brief said. To have a valid case, the Justice Department would have had to show that S.& P. knew what the correct ratings should have been, it said, and it had not done so.
S.& P. is seeking to convince Judge David O. Carter that the Justice Department has no case at all. If he rules against the firm, the case will move forward. A hearing is scheduled for May 20.
Separately, S.& P. has been seeking to have more than a dozen similar fraud complaints, filed in state courts by state attorneys general, moved into federal court for pretrial purposes. The states are generally suing under their own consumer-protection statutes, which have a lower burden of proof than a federal case accusing fraud. The Justice Department has called for the state cases to remain in state courts. The department declined to comment.
Much of the Justice Department's 128-page complaint deals with the fact that Standard & Poor's promoted its ratings as ''objective, independent,'' and ''uninfluenced by any conflicts of interest,'' then describes numerous conversations among its employees that suggest a willingness to inflate ratings to please clients -- in this case, the banks packaging mortgage securities to be sold.
One S.& P. analyst, for example, sent a message to others at the firm in 2004, warning that Mizuho Securities USA had just decided to take its business to Moody's, a rival, because S.& P. had insisted its securities needed more collateral to receive high ratings. ''Our support level was at least 10 percent higher than Moody's,'' the analyst wrote. ''This is so significant that it could have an impact on future deals. There's no way we can get back on this one, but we need to address this now in preparation for the future deals.''
In another message, an analyst grumbled, ''We rate every deal. It could be structured by cows and we would rate it.''
Many of the conversations took place between 2004 and 2006. The Justice Department used them to support its argument that S.& P. had issued ratings it knew were false, but S.& P. countered that the messages merely showed a robust internal debate.
The brief contends that these ''snippets'' of conversation are devoid of meaning under the federal fraud laws. It says that its many claims of objectivity, independence and ''analytic excellence at all times'' add up to ''classic puffery,'' the vague and overblown language that businesses often use to describe the virtues of their products and services. S.& P. cited other legal cases in which such claims were found to be ''nonactionable.'' It said puffery was simply ''too general to serve as the basis for a fraud claim.''
If Judge Carter agrees, S.& P.'s lawyers want all the damaging conversational snippets to be thrown out. That would leave just one final section of the complaint, which lists 33 individual securities known as C.D.O.'s, or collateralized debt obligations. They were rated by S.& P. from March to October 2007. Many of the internal conversations took place earlier, from 2004 to 2006, and even the one about cows, which took place in April 2007, did not refer directly to any of the 33 C.D.O.'s listed by name in the lawsuit.
The C.D.O.'s were created by investment bankers who combined and rearranged parts of another class of mortgage securities, known as residential mortgage-backed securities, which were made up of many residential mortgages, including some classified as subprime.
The Justice Department contends that S.& P. ''deceived financial institutions that invested in these C.D.O.'s into believing that S.& P.'s ratings reflected its true current opinion regarding the credit risks of these C.D.O.'s, when in fact they did not.'' It said the financial institutions lost more than $5 billion on the 33 C.D.O.'s, dealing a blow to their deposit insurers, like the F.D.I.C.
But S.& P. argues in its brief that to have a valid claim of fraud, the Justice Department had to show how the particular mortgage securities within the C.D.O.'s performed, and how that performance had affected the ratings of the entire C.D.O., which it did not do.

People fall behind on their bills for many reasons -- a recession that costs them jobs, a divorce, an illness. Now comes a further obstacle to getting their lives in order: employers who screen job applicants based on credit histories. 
A bill before the New York City Council would prohibit employers from using credit histories in hiring except in the very few cases where credit checks are required by law. It would be the strongest such law in the country.
About 60 percent of employers use credit checks to screen applicants, even though research has shown that people with damaged credit are not automatically poor job risks. Besides, the credit agencies that compile and sell records on about 200 million Americans make mistakes.
A report issued earlier this year by the Federal Trade Commission found that one in five consumers who participated in the study had errors in credit reports. In more than 5 percent of the cases, the mistakes were serious enough to lower the person's credit score, making it likely that more would be charged for car loans or mortgages. If used by potential employers, these erroneous reports could shut people out of the job market.
The City Council put a human face on this problem at a hearing earlier this month. A 30-year military veteran who had been deployed in Iraq testified that he had been turned down for a job as an airport passenger screener with the Transportation Security Administration because of a mistake on his credit report. By the time he got the mistake resolved, he said, the job had been filled. ''Even if I did owe the bogus debt,'' he said, ''I don't see how it disqualifies me from screening passengers. A credit report does not prove what a person's character is or is not.''
By using credit histories, employers have created a disadvantaged class that could be permanently locked out of the economy. The City Council could fix that, at least in New York City, by passing this bill.

HEADLINE: Gold's Declining Price Is a Reversion to the Mean

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: The sharp slide in the price of gold has led to much hand-wringing but should cause little surprise, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
Since the beginning of the economic crisis in 2008, conservatives have been predicting that inflation is right around the corner. They base this prediction on the vast increase in the money supply that the Federal Reserve brought about in order to keep the financial system from imploding. Because a too-rapid rise in the money supply did indeed bring about inflation in the 1970s, conservatives believe that a repetition of that experience is inevitable. 
Many conservatives jumped heavily into the gold market in 2009 based on their expectation of inflation or even hyperinflation. They believe that gold is the best possible hedge against inflation because it is something real, whereas "fiat money" is essentially worthless.
Initially, gold investors were rewarded. The price of gold roughly doubled between 2009 and 2011, from about $900 an ounce to about $1,800 an ounce. Since then, however, the gold price has fallen fairly steadily, reaching about $1,600 an ounce before a sharp break in the last two weeks that brought the price down to about $1,400 an ounce. (Kitco, a precious metals dealer, is a good source of recent gold price data.)
The rise in gold also led some conservatives to renew their advocacy of the gold standard. They believe that all our economic problems are fundamentally caused by the unstable value of money, which results from Federal Reserve manipulation. The Lehrman Institute, a well-financed conservative organization, has been actively promoting a return to the gold standard.

The core argument for the gold standard is that the real price of gold doesn't vary over time. All nominal price changes result solely from changes in inflationary expectations, gold standard advocates believe. They point to research by the economists Roy W. Jastram and Stephen Harmston to the effect that over very long time periods the real, inflation-adjusted gold price is roughly constant.
What gold standard advocates tend to forget, however, is that the "very long time periods" part of the analysis means over centuries. The short-run price of gold basically indicates nothing insofar as monetary policy is concerned. As a thinly traded market, gold is often subject to manipulation and prone to bubbles and crashes.
Warren Buffett warned about a gold bubble in a 2011 letter to investors in his company, Berkshire Hathaway, in which he said:
Gold, however, has two significant shortcomings, being neither of much use nor procreative. True, gold has some industrial and decorative utility, but the demand for these purposes is both limited and incapable of soaking up new production. Meanwhile, if you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will still own one ounce at its end.
What motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow. During the past decade that belief has proved correct. Beyond that, the rising price has on its own generated additional buying enthusiasm, attracting purchasers who see the rise as validating an investment thesis. As "bandwagon" investors join any party, they create their own truth - for a while.
Over the past 15 years, both Internet stocks and houses have demonstrated the extraordinary excesses that can be created by combining an initially sensible thesis with well-publicized rising prices. In these bubbles, an army of originally skeptical investors succumbed to the "proof" delivered by the market, and the pool of buyers - for a time - expanded sufficiently to keep the bandwagon rolling. But bubbles blown large enough inevitably pop. And then the old proverb is confirmed once again: "What the wise man does in the beginning, the fool does in the end."
In the long run, the price of all assets revert to their fundamentals. For the last four years, gold speculators have implicitly believed that the rise in gold represented an adjustment to the fundamental fact of underlying inflation resulting from expansion of the money supply. But in that time, the actual rate of inflation has not confirmed gold's signal. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.7 percent in 2009, 1.5 percent in 2010, 3 percent in 2011 and 1.7 percent in 2012.
Inflation so far in 2013 has been so modest that some analysts are anticipating deflation - a falling price level, the opposite of inflation. The Wall Street Journal reports that prices for gourmet cupcakes are crashing. Even a longtime "inflation hawk," James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, is now warning that downward price pressure is becoming a problem that may require the Fed to further ease monetary policy.
In an recent paper, the economists Claude B. Erb and Campbell R. Harvey present strong evidence that the gold market was severely overbought. The increase in gold prices did not represent a change in the trend of inflation. As the chart indicates, even with the sell-off, the price of gold is still high and has a long ways to fall to get back to the "golden constant" that gold-standard advocates cite as proof that the dollar should be pegged to gold.
Most gold bugs consider themselves to be libertarians and support the gold standard and gold as an investment because of their deep distrust of government. But the greatest libertarian of the 20th century, the economist Milton Friedman, always thought that the gold standard was nuts. His argument was put forward most thoroughly in a 1961 academic journal article, "Real and Pseudo Gold Standards."
I was going to close this post by making fun of a just-published book, "$10,000 Gold: Why Gold's Inevitable Rise Is the Investor's Safe Haven" and suggest putting it on the same shelf with "Dow 36,000," published in 1999, or "Are You Missing the Real Estate Boom? The Boom Will Not Bust and Why Property Values Will Continue to Climb Through the End of the Decade - And How to Profit From Them," published in 2005. But then I noticed that the publisher of the gold $10,000 book also published "Gold Bubble: Profiting from Gold's Impending Collapse" in April 2012, so I will let it pass.

HEADLINE: Why I Pay What I Pay

BYLINE: PAUL DOWNS


HIGHLIGHT: Am I paying my people too much, too little, or just the right amount? 

 BODY:
Sometimes, when I sit down to write, I focus on documenting a recent experience. Other times, I think about things that I would like to know about other businesses but have never seen publicly discussed. This post is the latter. It's about how business owners decide what to pay their employees.
I've been thinking about wages and wondering whether I am paying my people too much, too little, or just the right amount. I don't have a good way to answer that question, but I thought that it might be interesting for me to list what I expect to get for various hourly wages, starting at the minimum and working up the scale. I'll be eager to see your thoughts in the comment section. 
I have to preface the list with a little background. My willingness to pay a given wage to a given person is influenced both by the relative scarcity of trained woodworkers with the skills I need and by the cost of living in my location, suburban Philadelphia. I am also going to omit, for the purpose of simplicity, the cost of benefits that we offer (paid vacation, retirement plan, health insurance and, coming soon, profit sharing). My benefit costs for each of my workers depends on that person's years with the company (we offer more vacation time for longtime employees) and family structure, which drives health insurance purchases.
I also want to stick to wages for shop-floor workers. There is a lot of chatter about manufacturing jobs in the media, and these are generally hourly positions. The salaried and administrative positions in my company do not fit into any neat categories, because of the specialized nature of our work. So I'm not going to include them in the analysis. That said, let's start at the bottom:
Minimum wage (in Pennsylvania, $7.25/hour): I don't expect much for this, beyond a pulse. I don't think it's enough for any adult to live on, as it would be difficult to afford a stable living and transportation situation. It might be appropriate for the unskilled, youths or temporary workers, but that is not what I want.
$10/hour: This is my starting wage. For this I expect workers without much in the way of skills but who are reliable about showing up on time and work at a steady pace. They should be able to learn simple tasks (taking out trash, unloading materials) and perform them correctly. They should understand English well enough to take simple directions.
$12/hour: If the $10/hour employees work out and show some ability to learn the simpler technical tasks that we perform while we build our products, I can pay them a little more. I would expect them to perform a set of simple tasks on a regular schedule without supervision and to demonstrate a willingness to work on a flexible schedule. They should also have a valid driver's license and be willing to work a flexible schedule and long hours when we need to make out-of-state deliveries. (They will be paid overtime for more than 40 hours of labor per week.) They should understand complex spoken English.
This is also where we start workers who have the desire to become skilled woodworkers but have had no training. This class of workers requires significant attention from management and co-workers, so we can't pay them much. They need to demonstrate a good work ethic, curiosity and willingness to take direction. And, they need to show some talent, which we call "good hands." This ability is not evenly distributed in the population, and it cannot be taught.
$13.50/hour: This wage is for workers who can speak English sufficiently to convey technical information back to the supervisor. For a worker on the training path, a raise to this level would be a reward for steady progress in acquiring our specialized skill set, and continued reliability and hard work.
$15/hour: This is where I start workers who have had general training in woodworking but do not have experience in the specialized skills that we use. Most woodworking training programs emphasize skills that are, in my shop, obsolete. We do not work with hand tools very often and our equipment is much more sophisticated than that found in schools. So workers fresh out of technical school will need significant training, and we will also have to determine whether they have good hands and a good work ethic.
$18/hour: I would pay this for workers who have had both technical schooling and some experience in another wood shop and whose skills and work ethic have been vouched for by former bosses. I still need to see whether these workers can perform at our level of speed and accuracy, which is higher than the industry average. And we will still need to put a significant effort into expanding their skill set to include the specialized work that we do.
$20/hour: This is what I pay workers who have been with me for sufficient time to learn our procedures and perform at a level where they can do most tasks most of the time without error. As custom makers, we do a very wide variety of projects and have an enormous library of designs. It takes a while for workers to encounter every item we make, because we do not produce every one of our designs regularly. I keep workers in this wage range until they can do a wide range of items without problem. Also, at this level they should not need constant attention from management.
$25/hour: These employees should have mastered every aspect of their jobs. They should be able to manage a helper if required. And they should be able to contribute ideas that improve our operations. This is also where I would start workers who come to us with previous experience doing work similar to ours. Most workers who can make that claim have many years of experience in other shops and a wide range of skills. Unfortunately, many of those skills are no longer needed in modern manufacturing. But their mastery indicates a dedication to acquiring and upgrading skills.
$30/hour: This is foreman-level pay, earned by a worker with complete mastery of both our particular skills and the wider demands of the trade. This worker should be an energetic and innovative leader, able to monitor all the activity in the shop, to provide direction to other workers when required and drive innovation in our procedures. This person will work closely with me and with the office staff and is likely to work a lot of overtime, which enhances pay.
So that's my wage picture. You might break it down this way: the first $10/hour gets you reliability, the next $10/hour gets you a skill adequate to do our regular production, and the next $10/hour buys all of the extras. One of the paradoxes is that many of those extras are skills that we do not actually use anymore. Anyone who has been around long enough to get to master level has experienced the revolution in manufacturing that I have seen since I started my business in 1986. Back then, the machines were dumb and the workers were brilliant. Now the machines are a lot smarter, and some of the requirement for employee brilliance has been eliminated. Since we are custom makers, however, we occasionally end up doing something that could be done by machine but will require a lot of investment in programming and tooling. It is faster to push it out to the shop floor and let them figure it out. That's when the master-level workers shine.
I want to close by repeating that this is what happens in my own shop. Different companies, in different industries, and in different locations, may end up with very different numbers. I welcome any thoughts on what I have written.

HEADLINE: EBay Joins Sales Tax Fight

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: EBay is fighting efforts to require online merchants to collect state and municipal sales taxes from customers. | Andrew J. Ceresney, the new co-director of the S.E.C.&#8217;s enforcement unit, is confronting a fresh batch of challenges. | The Fed has yet to establish rules to protect taxpayers when doling out emergency loans. | Netflix reports surprising growth in its subscriber base. 

 BODY:
It was once Amazon that led a lobbying campaign in Washington to prevent online merchants from having to collect state and municipal sales taxes from customers. Now, eBay has taken up the cause as the issue is moving through Washington in earnest for the first time, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column. A bill introducing such a tax cleared a procedural hurdle in the Senate, setting it up for a vote this week.
John Donahoe, eBay's chief executive, made his thoughts known over the weekend in an e-mail to tens of millions of eBay merchants. "This legislation treats you and big multibillion-dollar online retailers - such as Amazon - exactly the same," wrote Mr. Donahoe. "It may harm your ability to grow and costs jobs, including yours."
Mr. Sorkin writes: "Mr. Donahoe, who deserves credit for turning around eBay in recent years, isn't trying to protect the mom-and-pop store or the struggling artist, he's trying to keep substantial businesses with real revenue from paying taxes." 
"In the end, it is unclear whether the Republican-controlled House will approve tax legislation if it clears the Senate, as expected. But when consumers make purchases, either in a store or online, they should be prepared to pay the requisite sales tax. And, yes, merchants and lawmakers should provide the way to collect it."
NEW LEADERSHIP FOR S.E.C.'S ENFORCEMENT TEAM | Andrew J. Ceresney, a former federal prosecutor turned defense lawyer who on Monday was named a co-director of the enforcement unit of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is confronting a fresh batch of challenges. "Mr. Ceresney will inherit a unit that is on pace to file the lowest number of enforcement cases in a decade, according to S.E.C. figures provided to The New York Times," DealBook's Ben Protess writes. "In the last six months, through March 31, the number of cases is down 23 percent from the same period a year ago - a sharp contrast from recent years when the agency trumpeted its record-high numbers."
"Some longtime S.E.C. officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly, also question whether their focus on insider trading cases distracts from investigations of broader significance. What's more, the officials say that the S.E.C. opened fewer investigations in the 2012 fiscal year than the previous year, presenting a potential obstacle to Mr. Ceresney, who will take the reins with George Canellos, an agency veteran."
AWAITING A BLUEPRINT ON FED LENDING | "After the Federal Reserve lent more than $1 trillion to big banks during the 2008 financial crisis, Congress required the central bank to devise specific ways of protecting taxpayers when doling out emergency loans to financial institutions," DealBook's Peter Eavis writes. "But nearly three years after that overhaul became law, the Fed still has not established these regulations. The delay involves a crucial but little-noticed part of the Dodd-Frank act, the sweeping financial sector overhaul that Congress passed in July 2010. One part of the legislation focused on the Fed. While the government used many different tools to shore up the financial system during the crisis, Congress was well aware that the Fed played a decisive role."
ON THE AGENDA | Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, are to speak at the National Press Club in Washington about their plan to address too-big-to-fail institutions. Data on new home sales for March is out at 10 a.m. Delta Air Lines, US Airways and United Technologies report earnings before the market opens. Apple and AT&T report earnings on Tuesday evening.
NETFLIX SURPRISES WALL STREET | In a recent interview with GQ, a Netflix executive said the company's goal was "to become HBO faster than HBO can become us." By one measure, the company now has more subscribers than HBO in the United States. On Monday, Netflix said its revenue in the first quarter topped $1 billion for the first time, largely because it quickly added subscribers to its streaming service, gaining about two million in the United States during the quarter. The company's stock soared in trading after hours, passing $200 a share for the first time since 2011.
"After the subscriber data was released, analysts rushed to note that Netflix, with 29.2 million such subscribers, had apparently surpassed HBO. Michael Olson, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, also pointed out that Netflix's two million new subscribers beat industry expectations of about 1.7 million," The New York Times writes.

Sparkling prose, from the Bronx to Paris to the obit page, over just a few days last week. 
Metro, 4/15:
Courts in Slow Motion, Aided by the Defense
 The grand exhibition hall of dawdlers that is the Bronx courthouse features procrastinating prosecutors, sluggish jailers and unhurried judges. But the true masters of delay are the defense lawyers. For them, muddled memories and lost witnesses - the passage of time itself - are the ingredients for getting clients off. ... 
Delays are a New York court epidemic. But the Bronx is a special case, with more old criminal cases languishing longer than anywhere else in the city. The results have bolstered the conventional wisdom that delays lead to acquittals: fewer than half of the jury trials in the Bronx end in convictions, a startlingly low rate that suggests either more innocent people are being tried or more guilty people are being freed.
Bill Glaberson's series on the dysfunctional court system in the Bronx had great reporting, but also elegant writing - as in this lead and key paragraph from the portrait of a defense lawyer who epitomizes the problems. 
Metro, 4/11:
Sometimes, Riders Find a Cabby Worth Praising
 There is perhaps no more judgmental perch than the back seat of a New York City taxicab. 
Every driver is too distracted, every fare too high. Every route appears imperfect, particularly in hindsight. 
But about twice a day, in a land unrivaled in its capacity to appear unimpressed, taxi passengers in New York have something nice to say about their cabbies - their experience so memorable that they take the unusual step of telling the city about it.
Another day, another delightful transit tale from Matt Flegenheimer.

Hollande Finds His Gift Camel Was Consumed
 PARIS - As if President François Hollande of France did not have enough trouble with a stagnant economy and a scandal over his former budget minister's secret overseas bank accounts, now his camel has been eaten.

He refrained from smoking, drinking, cursing and gambling, each of which had been refined to a high, exuberant art in the Times newsroom - the last of these to such a degree that at midcentury the newspaper employed two bookmakers-in-residence, nominally on the payroll as news clerks. ...
Mr. Phillips joined The Times as a copy boy in November 1952, later working as a clerk on the city desk and in the Washington bureau. In 1955, he was made a cub reporter and consigned to prove his mettle in the paper's Brooklyn office, then a dank, decrepit outfit near Police Department headquarters in the borough's nether regions. 
His account of life there, written for Times Talk, the newspaper's house organ ("It is impossible to tell a plainclothes detective from a mugger here. You just have to wait to see what they do"), so delighted the newspaper's management that his sentence was commuted to service in the main newsroom.
Margalit Fox's obit of this memorable Timesman was full of great detail and wonderful flourishes.
 
 Danglers Ahead 
My colleague Ken Paul offered three new examples of dangling modifiers, perhaps our most common grammatical lapse.
 While browsing through real estate agencies in New York City, a little déjà vu can be unavoidable. 
With a participle construction or other modifying phrase like this, the person or thing being describe should come right after the modifier. Here, the modifier dangles because "browsing" does not refer to "a little déjà vu." Rephrase.
 But on Saturday, traveling in Zabul Province in southern Afghanistan on a day trip to deliver books to schoolchildren, Ms. Smedinghoff's promise was cut short by a Taliban car bomb. 
Grammatically, the participle "traveling" seems to refer to "promise" - not what we meant.
 Married to Nicole Rowe, they have three children, all conceived and born during his sentence. 
He, not "they," is married to Nicole Rowe; rephrase.
 
 In a Word 
This week's grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled with help from colleagues and readers.
 Judges have since also blocked his revamp of teacher tenure rules and a change of the state retirement system (the administration has appealed the rulings and is pushing for legislative action should they stand). 
Avoid this jargony use of "revamp" as a noun. Overhaul, revision, revamping would all be options here.
 "What we all know is when you leave it up to kids and schools, the poor kids and kids of color will be disproportionately not in the curriculum that could make the most difference for them," said Kati Haycock, president of the Education Trust, a nonprofit group that advocates for racial minorities and low-income children. 
"Advocate" is best as a transitive verb: He advocates lower tax rates. Avoid the "for" construction.
 The debate will pit the A.F.L.-C.I.O. counsel, Damon Silvers, who opposes the change in the formula, and Robert Greenstein, executive director of the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, which has long supported changes to entitlement programs as part of a bipartisan deal to protect other federal spending on, for example, antipoverty programs, the nation's infrastructure and education. 
Make it "pit ... against."
 Dr. Edwards, a flamboyant and colorful physiologist who courted the press and vigorously debated his critics, and with his colleague, Dr. Patrick Steptoe, essentially changed the rules for how people can come into the world. 
This overstuffed sentence ran off track and ended up not a sentence at all.
 Part of the reason was the emergence of Mr. Gandee, who became especially popular with the show's fans. But one of the regular elements of the show for cast members was an activity called "mudding," which consisted of driving all-terrain vehicles off-road near Mr. Gandee's hometown, Sissonville, W.V. 
Abbreviate the state "W.Va."
 They have parlayed that fortune into Winklevoss Capital. Their first two investments were in Hukkster, a start-up shopping Web site and SumZero, an online community for professional money managers. 
We needed a comma after "Web site."
 And until her retirement last summer, the head of school was a woman, for nearly two decades. 
She was a woman for two decades, and now? Watch where you put those phrases.
 James Dolan, chief executive of Cablevision, which kept on its board three directors who received support from less than half of shareholders. 
We are describing a number, not an amount; make it fewer, not less.
 Mr. Winters shined as a guest on TV talk shows and kept audiences in stitches with characters like Maude Frickert, a sweet-seeming grandmother with a barbed tongue. 
For this intransitive use, make the past tense "shone."
 When you transfer bitcoins to someone else, it's as if you handed over a paper bag filled with $100 bills in a dark alley. And sure enough, as best as anyone can tell the main use of bitcoin so far, other than as a target for speculation, has been for online versions of those dark-alley exchanges, with bitcoins traded for narcotics and other illegal items. 
This expression doesn't use a second "as"; make it "as best anyone can tell."
 One of the reasons Augusta National officials are loath to see their Masters field inch toward 100 players is because there are only so many hours of daylight, and the pace of play has shown no signs of quickening. 
Make it "One of the reasons ... is that," or otherwise rephrase.
 The Jackie Robinson I saw in "42" was different than and yet the same as the Jackie Robinson I knew as a baseball writer with the long-deceased Brooklyn Eagle and New York Journal-American. 
Make it "different from."
 For observers, his 12 starts have whet the appetite for more. 
Make it "have whetted."
 One of the two people said that, in part, baseball, which has no subpoena power, felt compelled to pay money for documents because its officials had been concerned that more than one player was trying to do the same. 
"Pay money" is redundant; just say "pay."
 With the growing concern that many young people may be sharing or abusing these drugs, it is crucial that parents and doctors are vigilant about overmedication. 
The use of the indicative verb "are" suggests that parents and doctors are, in fact, vigilant, and that this fact is crucial. The hortatory sense we wanted here - that they should be vigilant - requires the present subjunctive: "it is crucial that parents and doctors be vigilant."
 In Republican-controlled Florida, state law prohibits third parties from installing the rooftop solar panels and then selling power to the homeowner, relieving the homeowner of large upfront costs. 
Hard to read. At first glance, it seems that the state law is relieving homeowners of upfront costs, but that's not what we meant.

HEADLINE: The Gun Vote and 2014: Will There Be an Electoral Price?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Among the 26 incumbent senators who will face elections next year, there was a near perfect relationship between their states&#8217; rates of gun ownership and their votes on the background check amendment. 

 BODY:
Did the senators who voted against a proposal last week to expand background checks on gun buyers take an electoral risk?
At first glance, it would seem that they did. Background checks are broadly popular with the public. Overwhelming majorities of 80 to 90 percent of the public say they favor background checks when guns are purchased at gun shows, at gun shops or online. Support for background checks drops when guns are bought through informal channels, or gifts from family members - but the amendment that the Senate voted upon last week, sponsored by the Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Pat Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, would have exempted most of these cases.
And yet, the Senate did not behave as though this was a piece of legislation favored by 80 percent or more of the public. The analysis that we posted last week suggested that, if anything, senators who are up for re-election in 2014 were less likely to vote for the bill. 
It's worth considering in more detail how the senators' re-election status might have affected their votes. Doing so yields a more subtle conclusion than we'd reached initially. Senators who are up for re-election in 2014 were more sensitive to attitudes toward gun-ownership in their states. However, this influenced behavior in both directions. Senators running for re-election were especially likely to vote for Mr. Manchin's amendment if they represented states with low rates of gun ownership, but especially unlikely to do so if they came from states where gun ownership is common.
This can be seen in the chart below. Among the 26 incumbent senators who will face elections next year (this definition excludes those senators who have announced their retirements), there was a near perfect relationship between the states' rates of gun ownership and their votes. Among the 12 senators running for re-election in states where the gun ownership rate is below 42 percent, all but one (John Cornyn of Texas) voted for Mr. Manchin's amendment. Among the 14 senators running where the gun ownership rate is above 42 percent, all but one (Mary Landrieu of Louisiana) failed to do so.
One reason it seems senators running for re-election were less likely to vote for the background-check amendment is because those facing elections next year come disproportionately from states with high rates of gun ownership. Some 18 of the 26 election-bound senators are from states where the gun ownership rate is above the unweighted national average of 38 percent, while just eight come from states where gun ownership rates are below that average.
The senators who are not up for re-election next year were still modestly sensitive to the gun-ownership rates in their states, but were more likely to override this for partisan or ideological considerations. Among this group, 14 senators voted against Mr. Manchin's amendment despite the gun ownership rate being under 42 percent in their states. (All of these were Republicans except for Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader, who voted against the amendment for procedural reasons.) Conversely, eight senators (all Democrats) voted for the amendment despite gun-ownership rates above 42 percent in their states - including four of the five Democrats in states where the gun ownership rate exceeds 50 percent.
The same data is presented in another way in the chart below, which reflects the results of a logistic regression analysis on the two groups of senators. (Mr. Reid, because of his procedural vote, is not considered in the analysis.) The chart illustrates the conclusion we had reached before: senators up for re-election in 2014 were much more sensitive to the gun-ownership rates in their states, and it represented a much clearer predictor of their votes.
But while this provides a useful description of how the senators voted, it does not address the question that we posed initially. Were the senators who voted against background checks taking an electoral risk by doing so? Some states, certainly, are more resistant to laws that would restrict gun ownership. Nevertheless, if as much as 80 or 90 percent of the public supports background checks like the ones Mr. Manchin proposed, the bill would be reasonably popular even in states where gun ownership is common.
Sean Trende, of Real Clear Politics, published a series of arguments on Monday that helps to explain the dilemma. At the core of Mr. Trende's thesis is the idea that the public might not view Mr. Manchin and Mr. Toomey's amendment quite so literally as the polls imply. Instead, they might view it as a proxy for the senator's overall attitude toward gun regulation and gun rights - without worrying so much about the details. Polls that ask the public about their broader view toward gun regulation find much more equivocal results. A related consideration is that the National Rifle Association will score the vote on background-checks amendment - so a vote for it could have harmed a senator's overall record on gun rights as judged by the N.R.A.
A counterargument is offered by Nate Cohn of The New Republic, who suggested that the N.R.A.'s power to influence elections may be overblown - or at least that it shouldn't outweigh other electoral considerations when a bill as apparently popular as Mr. Manchin and Mr. Toomey's amendment comes up for a vote.
Whether Mr. Trende or Mr. Cohn is right is something of a judgment call, but it is easy enough to split the difference between them. Mr. Trende is correct that some members of the public may look beyond the literal text of the legislation in deciding how they feel about a bill - either because they are poorly informed about what it does, or because they will attribute symbolic importance to a vote. (He cites the Democrats' health care bill in 2009 and 2010 as one example: many individual components of the bill polled fairly well, but the overall legislative effort did not.) But even if this is true for many members of the public, it would take a lot to counteract 80 or 90 percent face-value support.
My view, in other words, is that polls showing 90 percent support for background checks will tend to overstate how well the Democrats' position might play out before the electorate in practice, though public opinion was on their side on this vote.
Moreover, few of the Republican senators who are up for re-election in 2014 are vulnerable for any reason. Only one, Susan Collins of Maine, comes from a state that Barack Obama carried, and she voted for Mr. Manchin's bill.
In fact, the safety of the Senate Republicans may have enabled them to vote against the amendment, at least in part, for a tactical reason: to protect their colleagues in the House. This is not to suggest that Republicans are likely to lose the House - but there are 17 House Republicans in districts carried by President Obama last year. By preventing the background-check bill from securing the 60 votes necessary to pass the Senate, the Republicans may have prevented their House counterparts from having to take a tough vote.
Thus, Democrats are not in much of a position to capitalize on the vote from the standpoint of individual seats in Congress in 2014. To the extent that the issue plays favorably for Democrats in 2014, it is likely to be for symbolic reasons - because they are able to persuade voters that it reflects a Republican Party that is outside the mainstream.
This is not necessarily a hopeless strategy - particularly if Democrats can weave the background-check vote into a broader narrative about the Republican Party having become too conservative. But it does mean that, from an electoral standpoint, the symbolic implications of the vote outweigh the substantive ones. For Democrats to have much of a chance to win back the House - bucking the historical trend of the president's party faring poorly in midterm years - the Republican Party will first and foremost have to be perceived as out-of-touch on the economy.

HEADLINE: A.T.M. Surcharge Fees on the Rise

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: A.T.M. fees are generally highest in areas of little competition, like airports or amusement parks. 

 BODY:
qAnyone who uses A.T.M.'s to get cash knows that you usually pay a penalty for using a machine outside your own bank's network. A recent government report documents just how much those fees have increased in recent years. 
Average A.T.M. surcharges - the fee a bank charges someone who is not a customer for using its machine - have increased by 20 percent over the last five years, a recent report from the Government Accountability Office finds.
The average surcharge for banks and credit unions rose to $2.10 in 2012, from $1.75 in 2007 (adjusted for inflation). The surcharges ranged from 45 cents to $5, the report found.
In contrast, the average "foreign" fee - the fee a bank charges its own customers for using a machine not in its network - has remained flat, the report found.
It's unclear just what bank, in what market, is charging $5 surcharge fees, since the report is based on aggregate data and didn't name names. Some big banks, notably, JP Morgan Chase, tested $4 and $5 surcharge fees in some markets two years ago, but quietly dropped them.
Generally, banks don't want their A.T.M. surcharge fees to be so high that they turn away potential customers, one bank official told the G.A.O. investigators. Rather, they want account holders from competing banks to use their machines - and then, perhaps, open accounts at their bank.
Fees are generally higher, bank officials told the government investigators, in areas of low competition, like airports, or amusement parks.
The report estimates there are about 420,000 A.T.M.'s in the United States. About half are operated by financial institutions, which determine the fees charged. The other half are operated by independent firms that work with merchants to set fees.
Most users of the independently owned A.T.M.s pay surcharges, although there are some fee-free networks. Based on an analysis of about 100 A.T.M.'s. run by independent operators, the G.A.O. found the average surcharge for such machines was $2.24, and ranged from $1.50 to $3. (But it said some operators could charge fees that are higher or lower.)
Have you encountered a $5 A.T.M. surcharge? What is the highest surcharge you have paid?

HEADLINE: In New York City, Cheaper (and Later) Pedicures

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Why those with higher incomes pay relatively less for things in New York (and find greater availability) than in other American cities. 

 BODY:
I have written a column for The New York Times Magazine about the cost of living in New York, which is actually relatively cheap if you're wealthy and have standard wealthy-person tastes. It was based largely on research by Jessie Handbury, an economics professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, which looked at the groceries that rich versus poor people buy, and how much those different bundles of groceries cost in rich versus poor cities.
In a high-income city like New York, grocery costs are 20 percent lower for high-income people than they are in a low-income city like New Orleans (whereas costs are about 20 percent higher for low-income people in the rich city than the poor city). That's because there's a very high concentration of highly skilled people here, so there are a lot of vendors competing for the business of those high-income people, effectively lowering costs and increasing the variety of products that appeal to this consumer group.
Professor Handbury looked specifically at food, but she said that for most things you buy, there are probably positive externalities that come from living around a lot of people who have tastes similar to yours. 
"The results are generalizable to other products that have increasing returns to scale and where we think there's differentiated demand across income types," she said. "That pretty much holds up, I think, up to housing. You don't have increasing returns to scale with housing, because you have such an inelastic supply there." ("Inelastic supply" means that supply can't adjust easily in response to changes in price; I'll have more about New York housing costs in a subsequent blog post.)
I was interested to see whether prices of other, relatively supply-elastic services that cater to high-income people are cheaper here than they are elsewhere. Getting local pricing data along these lines is difficult, though, since the usual cost-of-living measures are based on the basket of goods that the typical consumer purchases, not the high-income consumer.
Fortunately I came across Centzy, a company that is compiling pricing and hours data for local businesses as part of a search engine service.
Centzy's co-founder and chief executive, Jay Shek, said that the company defined a taxonomy of businesses that they want to cover and the information they want to know about each. Then they purchased phone-book listings (just as companies like Yelp and Google do) for these businesses. At any given time Centzy employs 40 to 100 people, mostly in low-cost places like India and the Philippines, to cold-call companies and ask about pricing and availability for a standard menu of services. The listings data are imperfect; Mr. Shek says about 15 percent of listings the team dials each month are out of date, miscategorized or otherwise unreachable, and that a Centzy representative will generally call up to four times during standard business hours before giving up on a company's existence. Because of errors in the listings data, it's hard to know exactly what share of local businesses Centzy has data for. Mr. Shek notes, though, that they use the same methodology for every city, so it seems unlikely that their numbers would show any bias toward any particular city.
Centzy currently has information on the prices and hours at 400,000 local businesses in the top 10 United States metropolitan areas, with better coverage for beauty services and spottier coverage for less-commodifiable services, like yoga classes (whose prices are hard to standardize, because sometimes yoga studios and gyms charge by the class, the monthly membership, or some other package deal). I asked Centzy to compile data for me on the prices and hours for some beauty services that probably disproportionately cater to high-end clients.
Here are the prices for manicures (just standard, regular manicures, not including acrylic or shellac) and pedicures in New York versus other cities:
For these services, at least, the average price was cheaper in New York than in the other cities (although there was of course a range of prices within cities).
Another service I asked Centzy about, massages, showed New York prices to be about in line with those in other cities, and even a few cents more expensive. Based on a thoroughly nonscientific survey of my more spa-going friends, though, I am told that there is probably more heterogeneity in both quality and variety among massages than in manicures and pedicures. So it may be harder to compare the average price for this service across cities if the composition of the massages offered is different (which it probably is, given different tastes and income levels in each place).
One way in which New York definitely seems to offer rich people a better deal on these services, though, is in hourly availability.
You know that whole "city that never sleeps" reputation? Well, it shows up at salons and spas. Here are the total average weekly hours for businesses in each of the top 10 cities that sell these services (and note that there is substantial overlap between businesses selling manicures and those selling pedicures, so the hours are pretty similar):
As you can see, salons and spas have much longer hours here. In New York, about one in 10 (10.5 percent) of salons will sell you a pedicure at 9 p.m., according to Centzy's data; in the other cities, fewer than one in 100 salons will be open at that time (unweighted average of 0.5 percent).
Greater availability at more hours effectively lowers prices for the people who consume these services. That's because economists don't think about prices just as the sticker price of goods or services, but rather how consumers prefer an entire bundle of goods over another, based on what we observe about their purchasing choices. (Economists like to measure the cost of different things people consume in terms of price per util, an economic measure of happiness.)
Restaurants might be a bit more expensive here, but they offer more variety, are open much later, and nearly all of them deliver. And more highly skilled people consume those varied, late-night deliveries, which they could not get at any price in a lower-skill city like Detroit. Similarly, people in New York have the choice to get a pedicure at noon, but often enough they choose the 9 p.m. one - hence we assume they prefer it (maybe because they want to work late, get drinks with friends, or some other reason). Let's say we moved a customer who usually gets her pedicures at 9 p.m. from New York to Houston, where just 0.2 percent of salons are open at 9 p.m. In her new locale, she wouldn't be able to get her desired service at the time she wants it, even if she were willing to pay a lot more for it, since there aren't currently enough customers like her in Houston to support staying open that late.
Those kinds of trade-offs in quality and availability represent costs to consumers that may not be obvious in just the sticker price of a good or service.

 7:27 P.M. | Boat Owner Corrects Record on Discovering Suspect 
For a moment, Dave Henneberry wondered if it was his own blood in his boat.
Mr. Henneberry, the Watertown, Mass., man who owns the boat in which Dzhokhar Tsarnaev managed to elude a daylong dragnet, described for the first time in an interview with WCVB-TV how he came across the bombing suspect. The discovery, he said, played out differently than has been reported. 
"I know people say there was blood on the boat - he saw blood and went in," he said. "Not true."
When Watertown residents were told Friday that they could leave their homes, Mr. Henneberry went out to his boat, the Slip Away II. He climbed three steps up the ladder, and when he could see into the boat, he looked on the floor and saw "a good amount of blood."
"And I said, wow, did I cut myself last time I was in the boat a couple of weeks ago and forget?" he said. "No, no."
Then Mr. Henneberry saw the body - but not a face. 
"Oh my God," is what went through his head, Mr. Henneberry recounted in his distinct Boston brogue. 
He jumped off the ladder, he said, and called 911. 
Mr. Henneberry called himself an "incidental hero," explaining: "I wasn't out on the prowl. I was out to see my boat."

 5:30 P.M. | $20 Million Raised for Victims, Mayor Says 
#OneFund admin Feinberg outlines timeframe when money will be distributed; Victims to receive checks by July 4th http://t.co/vKakF2oYQX
- Bernice Corpuz (@BerniceWBZ)23 Apr 13
Mayor Thomas M. Menino said that One Fund Boston, created with the support of local businesses to help the victims of the twin bombings at the Boston Marathon, had raised $20 million in just a week.
"I have gotten many calls from around the world," Mr. Menino said Tuesday afternoon about the outpouring from 50,000 individuals and businesses in response to the explosions that killed three people and injured more than 250 others. More than a dozen people lost all or part of an arm or leg, hospital officials have said.
"We will be there for them because that is what Boston is all about," he said.
Heading up the distribution effort will be Kenneth R. Feinberg, a lawyer who has overseen compensation funds for victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the shootings at Virginia Tech and other disasters.
Mr. Feinberg said Tuesday afternoon that he would hold two town-hall-style meetings to hear from victims and begin a process that would allow them to apply for assistance next month.
As our colleague Abby Goodnough reports, many of the wounded, even those with health and disability insurance, face a lengthy period of rehabilitation and high medical costs.
Ms. Goodnough reports that Mr. Feinberg faces a daunting task in "deciding who will be eligible for payouts from a new compensation fund and how much each person wounded in the bombings and family of the dead deserves."
At the same time, friends and relatives have set up dozens of smaller funds for individual victims, including Jeff Bauman.
 5:00 P.M. | Defense Lawyers on the Tsarnaev Case 
On Tuesday, The Boston Herald quoted several prominent defense lawyers, who told the newspaper that the case against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, who is charged with the use of a weapon of mass destruction and the malicious destruction of property - federal counts that could lead to his execution - was anything but a slam-dunk for prosecutors.
Tamar R. Birckhead, who represented Richard C. Reid, the so-called shoe bomber, told The Herald that the government's criminal complaint was "circumstantial." 
"You have to ask, is that proof beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly carried explosives in that knapsack and with the intent to bring about mass destruction?" Ms. Birckhead said. "And that's how a defense attorney could analyze it and ask a jury to think about it. The burden of the U.S. government is to prove each element of each of these charges beyond a shadow of a doubt."
, who represented Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the advocate of assisted suicides, told The Herald that a competent defense lawyer should have little trouble exploiting flaws in what is known so far about the government's evidence.
"This case is ripe for somebody who's got the courage to stand up and talk about the system and the railroading of criminal defendants," Mr. Fieger said. "Nothing about the outcome is assured."
Ronald S. Sullivan Jr., director of the Harvard Criminal Justice Institute at Harvard Law School, said that despite what has been presented to the public as clear evidence against Mr. Tsarnaev, the prosecutors will carry a heavy burden not only of proving the charges beyond a reasonable doubt but also of establishing that he knowingly planted a bomb. A fundamental principle of criminal law, Mr. Sullivan said, is "the confluence of a guilty mind and a guilty act."
And while federal authorities say that Mr. Tsarnaev has already acknowledged playing a role in the bombings, Mr. Sullivan went through several possible defense scenarios, among them challenging the government's contention that the backpack seen in a surveillance video being carried by the man identified by the authorities as Mr. Tsarnaev was the same backpack that contained explosives. 
But the most fertile ground for defense, he said, might be whether Mr. Tsarnaev was aware of what he was doing - if, indeed, he is the same man who placed the backpack bomb on the ground near the finish line of the Boston Marathon.
"What if the older brother said, 'Let's do a prank and fill these backpacks with fireworks and set them off,' even if it was being done for political reasons," Mr. Sullivan said. "And Tsarnaev says that after what happened, 'I was terrified, so I ran.' "
A more traditional defense in such cases, he said, is what lawyers call a "slow plea," meaning that during the course of a trial, the defense is less intent on contesting prosecutors' evidence than on mitigating the culpability of the client - for instance, by seeking to establish that the younger Tsarnaev was the soldier rather than the general in the bombing plot.
Mr. Sullivan said that was often the difference between a death sentence and life in prison.

 4:31 P.M. | Bomb Survivor Says She Will Run Marathon Next Year 
Adrianne Haslet-Davis is one survivor of the Boston Marathon bombing whose story has appeared in multiple media outlets in recent days: a professional dancer from Washington State who lost her left foot in the blast, and has vowed not only to dance again but to run in next year's marathon. 
In an interview with The Boston Herald, Ms. Haslet-Davis, 32, recounted the moment she awoke after the amputation of her foot with her mother, Chauni Haslet, sitting at her bedside.
"My foot feels numb, like it's asleep," Adrianne said, through a fog of pain medication. "My foot feels like it's falling off the bed."
At that moment, Chauni Haslet, who had flown in from Seattle, gave her daughter the news she believed already had been conveyed by doctors.
"Adrianne," her mother whispered, "dear, your left foot ... it's gone."
Doctors at Boston Medical Center amputated a portion of her left leg below the knee after she and her husband, Adam Davis, were injured by one of the bomb blasts as they stood outside a restaurant on Boylston Street. 
Her husband, who had recently returned from a military deployment in Afghanistan, was sprayed with shrapnel but managed to fashion a tourniquet from his belt and fasten it to Ms. Haslet-Davis's leg in the moments after the explosion. She told The Herald that when she realized that her foot was mangled and "practically detached," she "started screaming my head off."
In those first minutes after the blast, before first responders reached them, Ms. Haslet-Davis said she was convinced that she would die and began to say goodbye to her husband. In the week since the bombing, according to The Herald, she has not only survived but become determined to reclaim her life. 
"I told my husband I loved him and I was so sorry all this had to happen," she said. "If this was going to be the last time we saw each other, I wanted him to know how much I loved him. Then I told him we'd make it through this, that I wasn't ready to leave him yet."
Adrianne Haslet-Davis greeted me yesterday with: "I've been better, but I'm doing OK." When asked about the dark moments, she bellowed, "Hell, yeah, I've had plenty. I've thrown my walker across the room and haven't used it yet. But I realized you have to be selfish about the things that matter the most. My husband. The job I love. Dancing is my life. Yeah, having my foot blown off, that really sucks. But I can't wallow in woe is me.
"I can't let some (expletive) come along and steal my whole life. So, I'll dance again. And next year, though I've never been a runner, yes, I plan to run the marathon."
Ms. Haslet-Davis also spoke to an ABC affiliate in Seattle about her memories of the attack.
"I remember the impact of the air and the bomb hitting my chest and pulling me back," she said. "I didn't feel heat from it. I just felt air and then I fell to the ground, and we almost fell on top of each other like a pretzel."
"We sat up and then I said, 'Wait, my foot hurts,' and then he held up my foot and then we both just screamed bloody murder."
"It's very sad, and I absolutely want to dance again," she told the Seattle ABC station. "I just want people to know that you can come out of a situation that might seem like the end of the world, and come out stronger."

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's medical condition has been upgraded to fair, according to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which announced the news on Tuesday afternoon.
 2:47 P.M. | Statement From Suspect's Wife 
A lawyer for Katherine Russell, the wife of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, released a statement on Tuesday saying that reports about her husband and her brother-in-law's involvement in the Boston Marathon bombing came as "an absolute shock."
The lawyer, Amato A. DeLuca, also said that Ms. Russell, who grew up in North Kingstown, R.I., and met Mr. Tsarnaev when she was a college student at Suffolk University, was "doing everything she can to assist with the investigation."
 Public Statement on Behalf of Katherine Russell: 
Our firm is representing Katherine Russell and she has asked us to make a short statement. As you know from news reports, Katie married her husband in June of 2010. Since then, she has been living in Cambridge, raising her child and working long hours, caring for people in their homes who are unable to care for themselves. Katie grew up in Rhode Island and has always remained close to her parents and sisters here, as well as her extended family. She is fortunate to have the support of her loving family now, as they, too, struggle to come to terms with these events and the deep sorrow we all feel following the events of last week. Meanwhile, she is doing everything she can to assist with the investigation.
The injuries and loss of life - to people who came to celebrate a race and a holiday - has caused profound distress and sorrow to Katie and her family. The reports of involvement by her husband and brother-in-law came as an absolute shock to them all. As a mother, a sister, a daughter, a wife, Katie deeply mourns the pain and loss to innocent victims - students, law enforcement, families and our community. In the aftermath of this tragedy, she, her daughter and her family are trying to come to terms with these events.
Thank you.
 1:19 P.M. | How to Recover Belongings From Bombing Site 
Boston officials have announced three ways for people to recover any personal property left behind after the marathon bombing.
Items that were determined to have no value as evidence in the F.B.I. investigation will be turned over to the Boston Police Department, which will try to deliver them personally to their owners if they contain identifying information. Otherwise, items can be collected in the following ways, according to a statement on the city's Web site:
 1) Visit in person at One Schroder Plaza, Media Room - 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. beginning Tuesday 4/23 to Friday 4/26. Bring proper identification. Parking will be available on Tremont Street. Please follow direction of officers.
2) Email lostproperty.bpd@cityofboston.gov with name, phone number, email address and description of items lost (as detailed as possible). You will be contacted if the item is in possession of B.P.D.
3) Call the mayor's hotline at 617-635-4500 with a description of lost items. You will receive a follow-up call from B.P.D.

"The outpouring of love and support over the last week has been tremendous," Martin's parents, Bill and Denise, said in a statement distributed by a spokesman for the family. "This has been the most difficult week of our lives, and we appreciate that our friends and family have given us space to grieve and heal."
The family said they planned to hold a public memorial for Martin in the coming weeks.
 12:35 P.M. | City Allows Some Visits to Boylston Street Area 
Residents and businesses in the Copley Square area will be allowed to return in incremental stages throughout the day on Tuesday, although Boylston Street will remain closed to vehicle traffic, according to the city government.
City officials have not said when the neighborhood will reopen to the public, and businesses are likely to remain closed because deliveries and personal vehicles are still not being permitted in the area. However, those who live and work in Copley Square, the site of last week's bombing, will be escorted into the area by city employees, who will help with damage claims. 
More than 400 businesses have been unable to reopen since Boylston Street, one of the area's main thoroughfares, was deemed a closed crime scene, according to a report in The Boston Globe.
 is tallying six-figure losses and waiting to clean a lobby still stained by blood.
A few doors down, Sugar Heaven needs to dispose of $20,000 worth of melted chocolate, sanitize candy bins and collect phones, purses and other baggage.
And at Marathon Sports, Colin Peddie, the president of the running shop, said the task of repairing windows and cleaning carpets would be the easiest part of reopening the popular store, where employees just days ago were wrapping tourniquets around injured spectators.
"We still have to get together as a company and discuss what happened and come to grips with it," Peddie said. "Everyone handles those emotions differently. We have to make sure we're listening to each other and start to rebuild."
According to the Globe report, hundreds of area businesses have signed up with the city to receive updates on the reopening of Boylston Street. Local officials said on Monday that access to the area would follow a staggered schedule, with residents and business owners escorted to their properties at specific times from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
The economic impact of the bombing has yet to be determined, but business leaders interviewed by The Globe said they feared that it could be significant. For many retailers in the area, the day of the marathon is among the busiest of the year.
"I have never seen such a large group of retail employers being affected for this long of a period in Massachusetts. The economic losses are hard to measure but certainly were in the hundreds of millions regionwide," said Jon Hurst, president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts.
"For the directly affected Copley and Newbury Street region, which is so dependent upon retail and restaurants, the collective lost business and wages must already be in the tens of millions. Some of this will never be recovered."

 12:26 P.M. | Arrested Kazakh Students May Have Known Suspects 
Two students from Kazakhstan who were arrested on Saturday on immigration violations in New Bedford, Mass., may have known the two bombing suspects, according to a report in The Boston Globe, which quoted a statement from Kazakh officials. 
The two men are accused of violating the terms of their student visas, the report said. Officials have not released the names of the two men because they are being held on civil immigration violations and not criminal charges.
Kazakhstan's foreign ministry said U.S. immigration officials discovered the students while investigating the Tsarnaev brothers' "possible links and contacts," particularly those who studied with them. The students - two men - are being held in Boston, according to the ministry and a U.S. official.
"During the investigation, it was revealed that two students from Kazakhstan had violated the U.S. visa regime in the course of their studies. They were consequently arrested until the full clarification of the circumstances is achieved," the ministry said in a statement.
The New Bedford Standard-Times reported that the students were arrested at an apartment complex on Saturday by "agents wearing F.B.I. and Department of Homeland Security jackets," the day after they and one other person were taken in for questioning and subsequently released. It described those questioned on Friday as "two college-aged males and one college-aged female."
The Standard-Times reported that earlier on Saturday, two young women left the apartment complex in a van with diplomatic plates, which may have belonged to the consulate of Kazakhstan. 
Earlier Saturday afternoon, a silver mini-van with consulate license plates arrived at the Carriage Drive apartment along with the F.B.I. and Homeland Security, and stayed a half an hour longer than the agents. The van left with two women, neither of whom appeared to be restrained. One was carrying a pink backpack as she exited the apartment and ran into the van, which sped away as the women told reporters they did not wish to comment.
A police officer, Lt. Robert Richard, told The Standard-Times that the authorities believed that the arrested students were friends or classmates of one of the bombing suspects, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, where he was a student. A gardener interviewed at the apartment complex agreed.
Henry Fernandes, who was tending to his garden at the time of the raid, said he had seen the tenants around the apartment complex, which is a popular area for UMass Dartmouth students to live.
"They looked like regular college kids," he said. "Whenever you see a college-age kid around here, I just figure they are from UMass."
 11:47 A.M. | Private Funeral Held for M.I.T. Officer 
As The Boston Globe reports, a private funeral was held on Tuesday morning for Sean A. Collier, 26, a campus police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was shot in his patrol car on Thursday night in Cambridge's Kendall Square, not far from where the bombing suspects lived. Commissioner Edward Davis of the Boston Police Department described the shooting as an assassination. 
The shooting focused the manhunt for the suspects in the Cambridge and Watertown area, leading to a gun battle on a residential street in Watertown. One of the suspects, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, died. His younger brother, Dzhokhar, escaped from the scene but was captured on Friday evening while hiding in a boat.
On Wednesday, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will attend a memorial service for Officer Collier at M.I.T., which is expected to draw thousands of law enforcement agents from across the country. 
 11:33 A.M. | Americans See Terrorist Attacks as Part of the Future 
Americans were transfixed by the news coverage of the Boston Marathon bombing last week, and most say that occasional acts of terrorism will continue to be a part of life in this country, according to two new surveys. 
Three-quarters of Americans consider occasional terrorist acts to be part of the nation's future, up from nearly two-thirds a year ago, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Thursday through Sunday, while facts about the investigation and the pursuit of the suspects were still developing.
Americans were divided on whether the government could prevent attacks like the one in Boston, with 49 percent saying it could do more and 45 percent saying there was not much it could do. Still, 6 in 10 said the government had made the country safer from terrorism since Sept. 11, 2001, while about a third said its actions had not had much of an effect. Republicans were more likely than Democrats or independents to say the government's steps had increased security.
Nearly two-thirds of Americans said they followed news about the Boston attack very closely, expressing as much interest as they did for events like the 2002 sniper shootings in the Washington area, the beginning of the Iraq war in 2003 and the Wall Street bailout in 2008. In 2001, nearly 8 in 10 Americans said they were following news of the Sept. 11 attacks very closely.
While television was the source most widely turned to for information, nearly half of Americans said they followed the Boston news online or on a mobile device. And despite a number of factual missteps by news organizations during the week, 72 percent of Americans rated the news coverage as excellent or good.
A Washington Post poll released on Monday and conducted last Wednesday and Thursday, while the suspects were still at large, found that a majority of Americans were concerned that there would be more major terrorist attacks in the United States. 
Nearly a third of Americans said they were worried about future attacks a great deal, up from about 2 in 10 in 2008. But most said they were not concerned about the possibility of an attack in their own community. Only 6 percent said they had changed their daily activities after the marathon bombing; after the Sept. 11 attacks, 53 percent said they had altered their daily lives.
The Post poll also found that two-thirds of Americans said terrorists would find a way to stage major attacks no matter what the federal government did.
Both polls were conducted by telephone nationwide using land lines and cellphones. The Pew poll was conducted among 1,002 adults and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points. The Post poll was conducted among 588 adults and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus five percentage points.

 11:03 A.M. | Number of Injured Rises to 282 
The number of people being treated for injuries related to last week's twin bombings at the Boston Marathon has risen to 282 from an initial estimate of 170, according to a report in The Boston Globe. The increase comes as people have started seeking treatment for problems that many assumed would go away on their own, like hearing loss or minor shrapnel wounds, doctors told The Globe.
"One of the best examples is hearing issues," said Nick Martin, a spokesman for the Boston Public Health Commission. "People might have first thought their hearing problems would be temporary." Instead, hearing loss or continuous ringing or buzzing in their ears remained. Others sought delayed care for minor shrapnel wounds.
State health officials told The Globe that 48 people remained hospitalized in the greater Boston area on Tuesday, including two in critical condition: a 7-year-old girl at Boston Children's Hospital and a man in his 60s at Boston Medical Center. 
All of the injured who made it to hospitals survived, and the only wounded person connected to the attacks to arrive at a hospital and later die was one of the suspects, Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Nevertheless, doctors have cautioned that the survivors of the bombing face a long recovery, according to The Globe. 
Still, many of the patients - among them 14 who had limbs amputated - are facing daunting recoveries. The 7-year-old girl remains in intensive care and had surgery last week for extensive leg injuries.
"She'll recover, and I expect that within the next couple of days she'll come off the critical list," said Dr. David Mooney, director of the trauma program at Boston Children's, who has been involved in her treatment. "She's much better than she was; her improvement has been slow and steady."
An earlier version of the 5:30 p.m. update misstated the day Kenneth Feinberg and Mayor Thomas Menino made statements. It was Tuesday afternoon, not Wednesday.

HEADLINE: EBay Joins Sales Tax Fight

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: EBay is fighting efforts to require online merchants to collect state and municipal sales taxes from customers. | Andrew J. Ceresney, the new co-director of the S.E.C.&#8217;s enforcement unit, is confronting a fresh batch of challenges. | The Fed has yet to establish rules to protect taxpayers when doling out emergency loans. | Netflix reports surprising growth in its subscriber base. 

 BODY:
It was once Amazon that led a lobbying campaign in Washington to prevent online merchants from having to collect state and municipal sales taxes from customers. Now, eBay has taken up the cause as the issue is moving through Washington in earnest for the first time, Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column. A bill introducing such a tax cleared a procedural hurdle in the Senate, setting it up for a vote this week.
John Donahoe, eBay's chief executive, made his thoughts known over the weekend in an e-mail to tens of millions of eBay merchants. "This legislation treats you and big multibillion-dollar online retailers - such as Amazon - exactly the same," wrote Mr. Donahoe. "It may harm your ability to grow and costs jobs, including yours."
Mr. Sorkin writes: "Mr. Donahoe, who deserves credit for turning around eBay in recent years, isn't trying to protect the mom-and-pop store or the struggling artist, he's trying to keep substantial businesses with real revenue from paying taxes." 
"In the end, it is unclear whether the Republican-controlled House will approve tax legislation if it clears the Senate, as expected. But when consumers make purchases, either in a store or online, they should be prepared to pay the requisite sales tax. And, yes, merchants and lawmakers should provide the way to collect it."
NEW LEADERSHIP FOR S.E.C.'S ENFORCEMENT TEAM | Andrew J. Ceresney, a former federal prosecutor turned defense lawyer who on Monday was named a co-director of the enforcement unit of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is confronting a fresh batch of challenges. "Mr. Ceresney will inherit a unit that is on pace to file the lowest number of enforcement cases in a decade, according to S.E.C. figures provided to The New York Times," DealBook's Ben Protess writes. "In the last six months, through March 31, the number of cases is down 23 percent from the same period a year ago - a sharp contrast from recent years when the agency trumpeted its record-high numbers."
"Some longtime S.E.C. officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly, also question whether their focus on insider trading cases distracts from investigations of broader significance. What's more, the officials say that the S.E.C. opened fewer investigations in the 2012 fiscal year than the previous year, presenting a potential obstacle to Mr. Ceresney, who will take the reins with George Canellos, an agency veteran."
AWAITING A BLUEPRINT ON FED LENDING | "After the Federal Reserve lent more than $1 trillion to big banks during the 2008 financial crisis, Congress required the central bank to devise specific ways of protecting taxpayers when doling out emergency loans to financial institutions," DealBook's Peter Eavis writes. "But nearly three years after that overhaul became law, the Fed still has not established these regulations. The delay involves a crucial but little-noticed part of the Dodd-Frank act, the sweeping financial sector overhaul that Congress passed in July 2010. One part of the legislation focused on the Fed. While the government used many different tools to shore up the financial system during the crisis, Congress was well aware that the Fed played a decisive role."
ON THE AGENDA | Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, are to speak at the National Press Club in Washington about their plan to address too-big-to-fail institutions. Data on new home sales for March is out at 10 a.m. Delta Air Lines, US Airways and United Technologies report earnings before the market opens. Apple and AT&T report earnings on Tuesday evening.
NETFLIX SURPRISES WALL STREET | In a recent interview with GQ, a Netflix executive said the company's goal was "to become HBO faster than HBO can become us." By one measure, the company now has more subscribers than HBO in the United States. On Monday, Netflix said its revenue in the first quarter topped $1 billion for the first time, largely because it quickly added subscribers to its streaming service, gaining about two million in the United States during the quarter. The company's stock soared in trading after hours, passing $200 a share for the first time since 2011.
"After the subscriber data was released, analysts rushed to note that Netflix, with 29.2 million such subscribers, had apparently surpassed HBO. Michael Olson, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, also pointed out that Netflix's two million new subscribers beat industry expectations of about 1.7 million," The New York Times writes.

HEADLINE: Polls Show Growing Resolve to Live With Terror Threat

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Public opinion surveys conducted since the marathon bombings in Boston indicate that most Americans don&#8217;t feel personally threatened by terrorism, and an increasing share of the public is skeptical about sacrificing personal freedoms for security. 

 BODY:
Public opinion surveys conducted since the bombings last week at the Boston Marathon indicate that most Americans - while convinced future attacks are quite likely - don't feel personally threatened by terrorism, and an increasing share of the public is skeptical about sacrificing personal freedoms for security. 
Concern about another terrorist episode in the United States has increased after the events in Boston, which led to the deaths of four people and wounded more than 260. But there has not been the upsurge in concern over such an attack that there was in the aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001, in New York City. The post-Boston polls have also shown that Americans' personal sense of threat - as opposed to the generalized threat that the country faces - remains low. 
Just after the 9/11 attacks, a Washington Post poll found that the threat of another major terror attack was something that worried nearly 9 in 10 Americans either "a great deal" or "somewhat." 
In the most recent Washington Post survey, roughly 7 in 10 respondents were worried either a great deal or somewhat. That figure increased just slightly from the last time the newspaper asked this question, in September 2008. 
A Pew Research survey released Tuesday reinforced those results. It found that while 75 percent of Americans expect acts of terrorism to be a part of life in the future (up by 11 percent from a year ago), worry about terrorism has not increased.
The Boston bombings have also not added to Americans' personal sense of threat, according to the recent polls. The Washington Post poll found that only 40 percent of respondents were concerned about an attack in their community, while a Fox News poll released last Wednesday showed 34 percent of respondents were worried about a terrorist attack where they live or work. That's unchanged since Fox last asked that question, in May 2006.
In addition, the post-Boston polling did not find an increased willingness to give up personal freedoms in the fight against terrorism. That contrasts with the period after the Sept. 11 attacks, when Americans told pollsters they were much more willing to trade some civil liberties for safety.
A Fox News poll in October 2001 found that nearly 3 in 4 respondents would give up some personal freedom. A majority of respondents in 2006 still said they would give up freedoms.
But the most recent Fox News survey found that - for the first time since before 9/11 - more respondents were unwilling (45 percent) than willing (43 percent) to sacrifice personal freedoms to reduce the threat of terrorism. The same pattern is evident in the Washington Post's poll.
Americans' continued focus on civil liberties in the wake of the events in Boston may be a sign of a growing resolve to live with the threat of terrorism. The recent Fox survey found that only 18 percent of the 619 registered voters interviewed nationwide said the Boston bombings would change the way they led their everyday life (5 percent said it would change "a lot," and 13 percent said "a little").
The recent Washington Post poll asked "have you or has anyone in your household started avoiding crowded places such as shopping malls because of the chance of terrorism, or not?" More than 90 percent of respondents said no.
Finally, a Rasmussen Reports poll of 1,000 likely voters conducted after the events in Boston found that more than half of the respondents - 54 percent - said economic threats were a greater danger to the country than terrorism. That is almost unchanged from a Rasmussen survey conducted in late January, more than two months before the bombs were detonated in Boston near the marathon finish line.

HEADLINE: Naming the New Twitter-Induced Flash Crash

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: What should we call the midday market freakout related to The A.P.&#8217;s hacked Twitter feed? 

 BODY:
 4:14 p.m. | Updated One more proposal I liked, from Boston University's Austin Frakt: "hash crash." 
The Associated Press's Twitter feed was hacked today, and the hacker tweeted a message saying the White House had been attacked. Rest assured, there was no attack, but traders freaked out long enough about the hoax to make the Dow do this:
So will this sharp plunge (and quick reversal) get a nifty nickname like the "flash crash" did? I nominated "Tweet Retreat" on Twitter, and got some of these other suggestions in response:

HEADLINE: Mixed Martial Arts Gets a Lift From Cuomo

BYLINE: JESSE MCKINLEY


HIGHLIGHT: As the Assembly mulls whether to take up the legalization of mixed martial arts this session, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said, &#8220;I think we need economic activity, especially in upstate New York.&#8221; 

 BODY:
ALBANY - After years of being knocked around - and knocked out - of legislative sessions in New York, mixed martial arts seemingly got a little shot of good news from the governor's corner on Tuesday. 
Speaking in a radio interview, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo gave a light embrace to popular and often bloody sport, saying the state - one of only two to ban professional mixed martial arts events - needed jobs, no matter how pugnacious they are. 
"I think we need economic activity, especially in upstate New York," said Mr. Cuomo, speaking on WCNY-FM's "Capitol Pressroom." "I think this is a major endeavor that is televised, that is happening all over the country at this point. You're not going to stop it from happening. And I'm interested in the potential economic potential for the state." 
Mr. Cuomo added that he understood "this theoretical debate" about the sport's violence and other objections to it, but seemed more interested in the hard-as-knuckles bottom line. 
"I'd like to know what is the economic impact for the state and are we talking about significant economic advancement," he said. "And if we are, then I think its something we should take seriously."
The governor's remarks came as the Assembly mulls whether to take up the legalization of mixed martial arts this session, after several years in which such legislation was proposed but not acted upon. The current version of the legislation has more than 60 co-sponsors, including nearly half the members of the Assembly. (The State Senate has already given its approval.) 
On Tuesday, Michael Whyland, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the powerful Manhattan Democrat, would say only that "we still need to discuss this with the members of the Assembly Democratic conference." 
Both supporters and opponents of the sport were in Albany on Tuesday to press their case with legislators. 
A collection of women's groups strongly objected to what they see as the sport's inherent sexism and violence. In a statement, Connie Neal, the executive director of the New York State Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said that legislators and the governor should not "condone the negative attitudes and beliefs about violence against women that are glorified in professional human cage fighting." 
But Lorenzo Fertitta, the chief executive of Ultimate Fighting Championship, was also working the halls, flanked by four beefy fighters (and several less well-built executives). Later Tuesday afternoon, the U.F.C. was also promising a demonstration of some of their athletes' skills at the nearby Times Union Center, where mixed martial arts events might be held, if the sport is legalized. Mr. Fertitta said the people of New York - who he said are responsible for about one in every eight dollars spent on mixed martial arts pay-per-view events - deserved to see the face-smashing, body-pounding sport in person. 
 "Obviously it's not for everyone," he said, noting its violence. But he added that he thought "there's an overwhelming majority of the Assembly that would vote for this bill. If they had a chance."

HEADLINE: National Park Sites Are Free This Week, but Two Remain Closed

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: National Park Service sites in New York City are free to visitors from April 20 to 28, but waiting for a chance to visit the Statue of Liberty or Ellis Island free will have to wait until next year, at least. 

 BODY:
[Video: Watch on Youtube.]
 This week, all of the National Park Service sites in New York City are free to visitors - except for the two best known to most of them. 
 The park service has posted a video on YouTube that promotes various monuments and other sites around the metropolitan area, providing little-known facts about them. "Did you know Hamilton Grange National Memorial was placed on a truck and moved down the street?" it asks.
 The occasion for the posting is National Park Week, an annual event when admission fees are dropped. This year, it runs from April 20 to 28.
 But tourists and New Yorkers who had been waiting for a chance to visit the Statue of Liberty or Ellis Island free will have to wait until next year, at least. Both of those sites have been closed since they suffered significant damage from Hurricane Sandy. The statue is scheduled to reopen by July 4. But the park service has not said when the museum on Ellis Island will be ready for visitors again.

HEADLINE: The Liberaltarian Democrats

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: The failure of gun control and the influence of libertarianism. 

 BODY:
I haven't written anything about the entirely predictable demise of the post-Newtown gun control push, but this passage from Politico's coverage of last week's Senate vote seemed worth a comment:
In the end, however, moderates and conservatives in the upper chamber said they simply couldn't deal with a flurry of progressive issues at once - from gay marriage to immigration to guns.
The other three Democratic "no" votes - Max Baucus of Montana, Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Mark Begich of Alaska - were never really in play, sources familiar with the situation told POLITICO. 
One senator told a White House official that it was "Guns, gays and immigration - it's too much. I can be with you on one or two of them, but not all three."
The first paragraph's conservative-versus-progressive frame is useful for understanding why this particular group of issues creates pressures on centrist, purple-state Democrats. But to understand why gun control in particular was the bridge too far, it's worth reaching for a slightly more esoteric political category - namely, "liberaltarianism," a phrase coined in 2006 by Brink Lindsey, then of the Cato Institute, to describe the possibility of a liberal-libertarian rapprochement.
Lindsey had an ambitious vision of what his proposed fusion would involve: Liberals and libertarians would embrace their pre-existing common ground on civil liberties (or what looked like common ground in the Cheney era) and most social issues, and then they would jointly "elaborate a vision of economic policy" that would promote libertarian ideas about free enterprise and a light regulatory footprint as a means to sustaining the liberal vision of a sturdy social safety net. "On the one hand," he wrote, trying to sketch this vision out, "restrictions on competition and burdens on private initiative would be lifted ... At the same time, some of the resulting wealth-creation would be used to improve safety-net policies that help those at the bottom."
I think it's fair to say that Obama-era liberalism hasn't lived up to this conception. Obama isn't the Marxist of conservative paranoia, but his economic vision is far more dirigiste than libertarian - which is a big reason why many of the economic libertarians who had soured on the Bush-era G.O.P. ended up returning to the Republican fold. (Though not Lindsey himself, I should note.) On national security, meanwhile, the Democratic Party is plainly much less libertarian - and the Republican Party, mostly thanks to Rand Paul, slightly more so - than it was when Lindsey was drawing up his form of fusionism.
But on most cultural issues, the Democratic Party clearly has grown steadily more, well, "liberaltarian" since Lindsey coined the term. Again, if you look at things on a right-left axis, as the Politico piece quoted above does, the resistance to even modest gun control measures among many swing-state Democrats seems like the exception to the Obama-era party's leftward shifts on gay marriage, immigration (where the party's Byron Dorgans are all but extinct), and recreational drugs. But if you look at things from a libertarian perspective instead, it's all perfectly consistent - the freedoms of gun owners being of a piece with the freedoms of migrants and pot smokers and gay couples - and an indication that the Democrats are simply becoming more culturally libertarian across the board.
When you combine this trend with the Republican Party's sharp libertarian turn on economics and modest libertarian turn on civil liberties, you could argue that libertarian ideology has never enjoyed more bipartisan influence than it does right now. And yet a thoroughoing synthesis, of the kind that Lindsey hoped for, between libertarianism's economic and social ideas seems as unlikely as ever. Instead, the kind of "liberaltarianism" that's increasingly ascendant is one that combines a highly individualistic view of our social and cultural fabric, and government's role therein, with a statist understanding of government's role in providing economic security - and security, period. As Scott Galupo shrewdly puts it, it's big government as "a guarantor of personal liberation and self-actualization" - unless your form of self-actualization runs afoul of the national security state, in which case you can be tried in a star chamber and executed by drone.
This is where the Democratic Party has been moving, in fits and starts, for some time now, but the Obama era has thrown the combination - an imperial presidency, a corporatist economic policy, and then a libertarian turn on almost every social issue - into sharp relief. It isn't the liberaltarianism that Brink Lindsey had in mind, but it's the liberaltarianism we seem destined to live under for at least a little while to come.

HEADLINE: Threatening Protectionism

BYLINE: VIKAS BAJAJ


HIGHLIGHT: It&#8217;s not just banks who dislike higher capital standards. Now, E.U. officials are complaining about them, too. 

 BODY:
It's not just banks who dislike higher capital standards. Now, European Union officials are complaining about them, too.
The E.U. commissioner in charge of financial services, Michel Barnier, has taken issue with a Federal Reserve proposal to require U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks to comply with U.S. capital rules, kvetching that they would put European banks at a "competitive disadvantage" and "could spark a protectionist reaction." His remarks came in a letter to the Fed circulated by E.U. officials on Monday, according to a story in The Times. 
Mr. Barnier's objections are troubling on many levels. For one thing, far from being protectionist, the Fed's rules create a level playing field for all banks operating in the U.S. Why should European banks doing business here, like Deutsche Bank, have subsidiaries that operate with less capital than an American institution, like Citibank? Would Mr. Barnier be willing to let a General Motors division sell cars in Europe that meet American safety and emission standards but not European ones?

Furthermore, Europe is in no position to lecture the Fed on how to write capital rules given the wobbly state of many of its banks. The E.U. response to problems in the financial systems of countries such as Ireland, Spain, Greece and Cyprus has been slow, confused and, often, damaging. And it is taking far too long to establish a banking union that would help avoid future problems - by centralizing regulation, deposit insurance and a process to wind down failed banks.
Financial firms have generally speaking been better capitalized here than in Europe. In October 2008, less than a month after the failure of Lehman Brothers, my colleague Floyd Norris published a chart that showed the relative size and capital levels of banks in 17 countries. The data showed that American banks' total assets were roughly 12 times the size of their net worth. In other words, every $1 of capital the banks used to fund activities like making loans and investments, was supplemented by $11 of money it borrowed from depositors, bondholders and others. By contrast, Britain's banks had assets that were roughly 24 times their net worth and that number was 52 for Germany, 28 for France and 18 for Spain.
Mr. Barnier's missive against the Fed proposal also suggests that any changes could hurt the trans-Atlantic trade agreement that the United States and European Union recently agreed to negotiate, which sounds rather like a threat. If E.U. officials think the capital standards are truly unfair, they should raise their objections during negotiations, instead of hinting at protectionism.
An earlier version of this post incorrectly characterized the amount of borrowings in an example about bank capital. In 2008, $1 of capital used by American banks was supplemented by $11 of money they borrowed, not $12.

HEADLINE: At Republican Forum, McDonald Promises to Make the Economy His Focus

BYLINE: JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ


HIGHLIGHT: George T. McDonald, 68, sought to use his quirky manner to his advantage as he portrayed his two Republican opponents as out-of-touch plutocrats. 

 BODY:
George T. McDonald, a Republican candidate for mayor, can be an uneven performer in public. He likes to explain his economic plan by arguing that the Bronx should produce more applesauce, and he sometimes jokes about commuting by skateboard. 
The Race for City Hall
But at a forum in Midtown Manhattan on Tuesday night, Mr. McDonald, 68, sought to use his quirky manner to his advantage as he portrayed his two Republican opponents as out-of-touch plutocrats. 
Calling himself the "poorest guy sitting here," Mr. McDonald, who lives in a $1.6 million apartment on the Upper East Side, said he would make reviving the economy a centerpiece of his administration. 
"The recession didn't pass over New York City," said Mr. McDonald, who runs the Doe Fund, a nonprofit job-training program for the homeless. "It may have passed over your friends."
Mr. McDonald then turned to a Republican rival, John A. Catsimatidis, the billionaire owner of the Gristedes grocery chain. "If you think that money alone is going to win an election," he said, "go to Connecticut."
Mr. Catsimatidis grinned, reaching for the microphone. "I'm a man of all the people," he said. "I've been to the South Bronx. I never saw you there."
It was a striking back-and-forth at a forum largely free of disagreement. Nearly 100 people attended the event, which was sponsored by the New York Young Republican Club.
The other Republican contender, Joseph J. Lhota, former chief of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, largely stayed out of the fray. While he praised Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's handling of city affairs, he sought to distance himself from some of the mayor's policies, saying he did not support the emphasis on standardized testing.
Near the end of the forum, in fielding a question on how to reduce poverty in New York, Mr. Catsimatidis said he would put Mr. McDonald in charge of homeless programs.
He looked to Mr. McDonald, who was staring into the distance, seemingly unaware of what had been said.
"George, I complimented you," Mr. Catsimatidis said. "You're very capable."

HEADLINE: A Health Provider Finds Success In Keeping Hospital Beds Empty

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- On a stormy evening this spring, nurses at Dr. Gary Stuck's family practice were on the phone with patients with heart ailments, asking them not to shovel snow. The idea was to keep them out of the hospital, and that effort -- combined with dozens more like it -- is starting to make a difference: across the city, doctors are providing less, but not worse, health care.
For most health care providers, that would be cause for alarm. But not for Advocate Health Care, based in Oak Brook, Ill., a pioneer in an approach known as ''accountable care'' that offers financial incentives for doctors and hospitals to cut costs rather than funnel patients through an ever-greater volume of costly medical services. Under the agreement, hospital admissions are down 6 percent. Days spent in the hospital are down nearly 9 percent. The average length of a stay has declined, and many other measures show doctors providing less care, too. 
This approach is one small part of a growing effort by providers to hold down costs without restricting needed care. Nationwide, health care spending has grown over the last three years at the slowest rate since the federal government started keeping data more than 50 years ago. While the bulk of that is related to the poor economy, changes among insurers and health care providers have contributed as well. If the trend continues, even at a reduced pace, it could help alleviate Washington's long-term deficit problems and ease the strain on family budgets.
''The part that's not driven by the economy, that's the part we can theoretically control,'' said Drew Altman, president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. ''If we can shave even a small percentage off of it, it has a huge impact on public programs, a huge impact on premiums, a huge impact on employers.''
But even as more health systems seek to replicate Advocate's early success, its experience shows just how hard it may be to expand the approach and keep medical costs from resuming their relentless rise.
''It's hard to imagine that you could start from scratch and do this and be successful in three years, said Dr. Lee Sacks, Advocate's chief medical officer, noting that other systems may find it far harder to flip the traditional fee-for-services system on its head. ''We had a running head-start going back to 1995.''
Nonetheless, the Affordable Care Act, President Obama's health care law, has helped encourage a shift to Advocate's payment model. Such agreements were merely a theory four years ago. But an estimated 428 accountable-care organizations now cover four million Medicare enrollees and millions more people with private insurance.
Under Advocate's deal with Blue Cross Blue Shield, certain patients are assigned to the accountable care framework -- about 380,000 -- and their health costs are projected. If Advocate achieves savings below that amount while meeting explicit quality targets, it splits the money with the insurer. If not, its revenue is at risk.
In some ways, accountable care resembles earlier efforts to control medical spending, including the health maintenance organizations that proliferated in the 1980s but fell out of favor, in part because they severely limited patients' choices. But accountable care differs by giving doctors and hospitals a direct financial stake in saving money and a reason to invest in various programs of preventive care rather than relying exclusively on the fees they would normally earn from providing services.
''There's an enormous amount at stake in getting these reforms to work,'' said Alan Krueger, the chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.
To help control costs, Advocate has hired scores of workers to coordinate care and keep an eye on the highest-cost patients, like those who are obese or have diabetes. It started providing doctors' offices with report cards on their performance. Dozens of quality-control measures cover items as varied as blood pressure, rehospitalizations for asthma attacks or the use of expensive imaging machines.
On a blustery spring morning, those changes were visible in Advocate care centers across the metropolitan area. Sumera Khan, a clinical pharmacy specialist, popped into the hospital room of Noraine Scarpelli, an elderly woman with congestive heart failure, to check her prescription drug levels, an additional level of scrutiny that can help prevent complications. In another building, Dr. Karen O'Mara flicked between eight computer screens, peering at intensive care patients miles away, ready to alert a doctor if they looked in distress.
Advocate, a faith-based nonprofit, has an advantage over other health systems just jumping into what is more broadly known as ''value-based care.'' In the late 1990s, well before it forged its contract with Blue Cross Blue Shield, Advocate began taking steps to control costs and improve quality. A decade ago it adopted a ''clinical integration'' program, requiring doctors to work together on patients in common. It was also a pioneer in the use of electronic health records.
''A lot of these early adopters were systems that were already putting things in place,'' said Ani Turner of the Center for Sustainable Health Spending at the Altarum Institute, a national health care research group based in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''In a way, the contracts are rewarding behaviors they were already pursuing.''
So far, Advocate has achieved a small but significant savings of about 2 percent below projected costs, Blue Cross Blue Shield said, but it is not clear whether it can continue to make progress. Already, some Advocate hospital chiefs have expressed fears over losing revenue and warned about the threat to their financial performance. Doctors fret that their incomes may suffer. ''We're doing it because it's the right thing to do for patients,'' said Dr. Stuck, the Advocate family physician. ''We're not making more money.''
At the same time, Advocate and Blue Cross Blue Shield have no way to prevent patients that fall under the accountable-care agreement from seeing doctors outside Advocate's network. That means patients might see doctors without an incentive to cut costs as well as deliver excellent care, eroding or even erasing the cost savings the agreement achieves.
''You're trying to overlay a payment design onto a benefit model that allows a patient to go anywhere he wants,'' said Steve Hamman of Blue Cross Blue Shield, noting that patients can undermine the advantages of the new approach if they ignore the advice or insist on unnecessary tests and procedures. ''We can talk all we want about provider accountability and how important that is. But there is a measure of patient accountability that is critical as well.''
For all the obstacles, most health economists agree that accountable care organizations are one of the most promising recent developments in the giant industry. Kaufman Hall, a consulting firm that studied Advocate's results, said its research showed that the older and the bigger a value-based care system, the more capable it proved at controlling costs -- and the more it was able to influence the larger community of health care providers.
''Doctors who practice with Advocate often also practice at other hospitals,'' said Mark Grube, Kaufman Hall's managing director. ''What is occurring is that even when they are practicing at hospitals that are not under value-based contracts, they've changed how they practice. We're seeing declines in utilization there, too.''
That ultimately might be what helps the accountable care model catch on and hold down spending in the longer term.
''You can see a synergy with all these initiatives,'' said Ms. Turner of the Altarum Institute. ''There are a lot of forces out there trying to move things in the same direction.''

HEADLINE: Make Wall Street Choose: Go Small or Go Home

BYLINE: By SHERROD BROWN and DAVID VITTER. 
Senators Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, are members of the Senate Banking Committee.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
PROGRESSIVES and conservatives can debate the proper role of government, but this is one principle on which we can all agree: The government shouldn't pick economic winners or losers.
In 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the government stepped in and decided which Wall Street banks were so large and interconnected that they would receive extraordinary help from the government to enable them to survive. They were deemed, to use a now ubiquitous phrase, too big to fail. Meanwhile, smaller banks in communities across the country, including Cleveland and Covington, La., in the states we represent, were allowed to fail. They were, evidently, too small to save.
Today, the nation's four largest banks -- JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo -- are nearly $2 trillion larger than they were before the crisis, with a greater market share than ever. And the federal help continues -- not as direct bailouts, but in the form of an implicit government guarantee. The market knows that the government won't allow these institutions to fail.
It's the ultimate insurance policy -- one with no coverage limits or premiums. 
These institutions can then borrow and lend money at a lower rate than regional banks, Main Street savings and loan institutions, and credit unions. This implicit taxpayer subsidy has been confirmed by three independent studies in the last year; one of them estimated it at $83 billion per year. We have, in essence, a financial system that rewards banks for their size, not the quality of their operations. It's a ''heads the megabanks win, tails the taxpayers lose'' scenario, one that discourages innovation and competition and is distinctly un-American.
How did we get here? When the government established the Federal Reserve in 1913 as a lender of last resort, to mitigate the severity of financial panics, and then, 20 years later, created deposit insurance in response to the Depression, those protections were intended for commercial banks that provided savings products and loans to American consumers and businesses. At that time, most banks had shareholder equity equal to 15 to 20 percent of their assets.
In the ensuing decades, the expanding federal safety net allowed financial institutions to depend less and less on their own capital. Federal support was stretched far beyond its original focus, as successive generations of lawmakers and regulators allowed financial institutions to enter the business of insurance, securities dealing and investment banking.
We want to reverse this dangerous trend with bipartisan action aimed at ending ''too big to fail'' in a practical, responsible fashion. On Wednesday, we will introduce legislation to ensure that all banks have proper capital reserves to back up their sometimes risky practices -- so that taxpayers don't have to. We would require the largest banks to have the most equity, as they should.
Our bill aims to end the corporate welfare enjoyed by Wall Street banks, by setting reasonable capital standards that would vary depending on the size and complexity of the institution. Economic and financial experts on both the left and the right agree that capital is a vital element of financial stability. Adequate capital levels lower the likelihood that an institution will fail and lower the costs to the rest of the financial system and the economy if one does.
Unfortunately, existing capital rules are insufficient to prevent another crisis and are either too complex to administer or too easy to manipulate. Andy Haldane, the executive director for financial stability at the Bank of England, has estimated that an average large bank would have to conduct more than 200 million calculations to figure out whether it meets the capital regulations under the so-called Basel II framework, a set of international standards that banking regulators use to determine how much capital banks need at their disposal to guard against risk.
A new set of standards known as Basel III is still being implemented. But it would take years to finalize, and even the new proposed standards are too weak: in many scenarios, for every $1 of equity a bank used, it could borrow $24. That means that the bank could become insolvent if its assets declined by as little as 4 percent. As we know from the housing meltdown, that is far too narrow a margin of error.
Requiring the largest banks to finance themselves with more equity and with less debt will provide them with a simple choice: they can either ensure they can weather the next crisis without a bailout, or they can become smaller. Banks will argue (in fact, they've already started arguing) that requiring them to have more equity will force them to reduce lending and, ultimately, cause the economy to contract. But banks would not be required to sell assets under our proposal; they will simply be required to raise more money by selling stock, rather than going to the debt markets. To raise capital, they could seek new equity investments, retain more earnings, limit dividends and stock repurchases, curtail bonuses or any combination thereof.
The market already requires community banks to have higher equity levels. A community banking survey by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation showed that community banks currently maintain capital ratios approaching 10 percent of their assets. These banks would be unaffected by our proposal, and midsize and regional banks would be required to maintain an 8 percent capital requirement.
In contrast, megabanks had capital ratios of about 3.5 percent of their assets in 2007, and about 6.9 percent in 2012, according to a recent Goldman Sachs analysis of our plan. Under our proposal, megabanks (those with at least $400 billion in assets, of which there are currently seven) would face a 15 percent capital requirement -- instead of the 8 percent to 9.5 percent requirement being discussed by international regulators. Our 15 percent standard would be consistent with the historic levels of equity that banks had to maintain before the advent of the ''too big to fail'' safety net. Requiring the largest banks to rely more on shareholders and less on creditors would minimize the risk of a financing crunch if losses from bad investments were to pile up.
Our proposal also curtails the expansion of the government safety net for Wall Street by limiting taxpayer support to traditional banking operations. Under our legislation, financial institutions would be prohibited from transferring nonbank liabilities -- like derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending -- into federally supported banks that benefit from deposit insurance. This would ensure that the government safety net protects only the commercial bank, not the risky investment-banking arms of the megabanks. If the megabanks want to remain large and complex, that's their choice -- but Americans should not have to subsidize their risk-taking. If they fail, their executives and investors -- not taxpayers -- should pay the price.
We expect a full-throated effort by the megabanks to resist our proposal. The good news is that there is a real and growing bipartisan consensus around our approach. It has drawn support from key regulators like Thomas M. Hoenig, a conservative who is vice chairman of the F.D.I.C. and a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and Daniel K. Tarullo, a progressive regulator and a member of the Fed's board of governors. Our banking system -- and the broad economy -- will be the stronger for it.

HEADLINE: Two Groups in Grief Refuse to Stand Still

BYLINE: By JESS BIDGOOD

 BODY:
BOSTON -- In the days after the marathon bombings, the slogan ''We are one Boston'' became a rallying cry for this bleeding city. It flashes on L.E.D. signs that display route numbers on the front of city buses. It is echoed in the name of the One Fund Boston, a charity set up to aid victims of the attack, which killed three people and injured, at last count, 264.
It is a fortifying call, unifying varied neighborhoods and groups around a theme of recovery, including two distinct communities that are now, in parallel, grappling with the death of one of their own: the Ashmont section of the city's Dorchester neighborhood and the thousands of Chinese citizens who flock to Boston to study. 
For a week, the historic clock in the center of Ashmont was stopped at 2:50 p.m., the time the bombs went off on April 15 near the Boston Marathon's finish line. ''That was sort of the point where no one knew what was going on,'' said Jeffrey Gonyeau, the only person with keys to the clock, who made the decision to halt it. ''Time sort of stopped, not only for us but also for the Richard family.''
By the next morning, residents knew that one of the victims was from Ashmont: Martin Richard, an 8-year-old boy who was at the finish line with his family. His mother, Denise, and his sister, Jane, were grievously injured.
The clock sits at the center of Peabody Square, the main intersection in Ashmont, a neighborhood that has undergone a rejuvenation -- thanks in part to Martin's father, Bill Richard, one of its dedicated civic activists.
As a former president of St. Mark's Area Main Street, a civic group, he played key roles in a renovation of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority train station here and the development of the Carruth Building, whose shops and condominiums brought a much-needed economic boost.
Parts of Ashmont are known for near-constant social activity, and the Richards play a central role in that, too. ''From feeding hot dogs to the volunteers after our annual neighborhood cleanup day in April to hosting a summer ice cream social for kids, the Richards are the go-to people,'' said Pat O'Neill, who is the president of the neighborhood association for the Ashmont-Adams enclave, where the Richards live.
Martin's death, and the injuries of his mother and sister, left the community wondering how and where to direct its ample energy to give back to the family, which also includes another son.
''They're super type-A personalities,'' said Chris Douglass, the owner and executive chef of two Ashmont restaurants -- one of which, Tavolo, has become an informal meeting place for people to grieve and find ways to help the family. ''We're going to have a blood drive and fund-raiser, and they want to break the record for the biggest blood drive in the history of the state.''
Mr. Gonyeau said, ''This is a neighborhood of planners and doers,'' adding, ''Everybody is just getting ready, laying groundwork for when the family needs our help.''
On Monday, with the two suspects in the bombings accounted for and plans to help the Richards beginning to percolate -- for instance, a group of neighbors intends to provide the family with as many meals as possible -- Mr. Gonyeau restarted the clock.
But in some ways, it is difficult to imagine moving forward here with some aspects of the community's life -- especially those in which the Richards would normally play a role. Like the float that they and others had planned to create for the Dorchester Day parade on June 2 out of the colorful Ashmont booth that had been built for Dorchester's annual chili cook-off.
''Those plans are on hold now,'' Mr. Douglass said. ''I just don't think that we have the spirit right now to sort of do what our plan was. It was kind of, I don't know, silly, and we're just not ready to be silly, I guess.''
As Ashmont began to reckon with the Richards' loss last week, a group of Chinese students studying at Boston University, 20 minutes north, was frantically trying to find Lu Lingzi, 23, a graduate student in statistics who had gone to the marathon with friends. Shuang Guo, a senior, learned that Ms. Lu could not be found after the blasts, so she dispatched members of the club she runs, the Chinese Students and Scholars Association, to look for her. ''We sent out a group to search at all of the hospitals in Boston,'' Ms. Guo said.
Eventually, they heard from the dean's office, which had a message from Boston University's Police Department. ''B.U.P.D. has found a girl that might have been Lingzi Lu,'' Ms. Guo said, describing the message, ''but they found her at the examiner's office.''
Many of the students in the association, including Ms. Guo, had never met Ms. Lu. But she was also among 2,065 Chinese students at Boston University.
''There's a huge Chinese community in Boston. Whatever happens, we stick together, even though we don't know this girl,'' Ms. Guo said. ''We understand because we all have families waiting for us at home. We're so alike.''
China sends more students to study in the United States than any other country. They are drawn by the prestige of the American education system and, for some, the possibility of long-term work. According to the International Institute of Education, there were 194,029 in the United States in the 2011-12 academic year, a 23 percent increase over the previous year.
Ms. Lu had long wanted to be one of those students, her father, Lu Jun, said at a memorial held for her at Boston University on Monday night.
''Lingzi used every opportunity and made every effort to learn about international acceptance requirements,'' he said in Chinese in a tearful eulogy.
The memorial drew more than 850 people, many of them Chinese citizens who said they saw their own stories in her.
''I'm also am an only child, and my parents are back in China,'' said Boayuan Tian, 28, of Cambridge. ''I couldn't imagine if that happened to me, how my parents would react.''

HEADLINE: F.A.A. Says Furloughs Delayed 1,200 Flights

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The furlough of air traffic controllers delayed more than 1,200 flights on Monday, the first weekday of the unpaid leaves, the Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday as lawmakers criticized the agency for how it was handling the automatic budget cuts.
Apart from the furloughs, the F.A.A. counted more than 1,400 delays for weather and other reasons. On Tuesday, it said there were delays in the New York area and in Washington because of ''staffing challenges,'' but it did not say what fraction of the delays were due to furloughs. 
''Travelers can expect to see a wide range of delays that will change throughout the day depending on staffing and weather-related issues,'' the agency said in a statement. The staffing problems are mostly in radar rooms, not control towers, it added.
There are 30,000 to 35,000 commercial flights a day in the United States. Some travelers were delayed a few minutes, but others missed connections and were delayed for hours. Some later flights were delayed or canceled because the airplanes they were to use had arrived so late.
FlightStats.com, a company that monitors airline performance, counted nearly 7,000 delays on Monday, from all causes. A company spokeswoman, Sarena Regazzoni, said that the number ''seems heightened but not excessive.''
Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, the West Virginia Democrat who is the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the ranking Republican member, sent a letter to the transportation secretary, seeking more information and complaining that ''the administration's response to our inquiries has consistently been slow and disturbingly limited.''
The two senators said that the F.A.A. administrator, Michael P. Huerta, had provided ''only general statements'' to the committee about how it would handle budget cuts resulting from the so-called sequester, while giving a detailed briefing to the airlines.
The airlines, though, complained that their briefing was cursory. Airline officials said that the F.A.A. had passed out copies of an analysis of likely delays, but then demanded all the copies back. (In a news briefing last week, Mr. Huerta and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood displayed a complicated slide showing the projected impact at a variety of airports, but did not give out copies or post it on the Web, as is their usual practice.)
But those complaining about the cuts have not specified just where the F.A.A. should find the more than $600 million it says it must wring out of the system.
The air traffic controllers' union, whose members are facing 11 unpaid days between now and the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, on Tuesday described the delays so far as ''just the beginning of what promises to be a huge economic disruption if the furloughs are not stopped.''
''The F.A.A. has been forced to cancel all training, halt work on critical modernization and NextGen projects, and are even using overtime at some of the busiest facilities,'' the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said. NextGen is a satellite-based system that is supposed to raise air traffic capacity and cut delays.
Using overtime ''is actually costing the F.A.A. money, eliminating any savings that are supposedly being achieved for sequestration,'' the union said. ''It's simple math -- furloughing controllers earning base while paying others base pay plus an additional 50 percent will not result in savings.''
Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, and Senator Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas, held a news briefing to urge the F.A.A. to delay the furloughs. This month, they introduced a bill to block the agency from shutting down control towers at dozens of small airports.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, proposed that all of the across-the-board cuts be canceled for the rest of the fiscal year, and ''paid for'' by declining war spending -- a position Republican budget hawks have long scoffed at.
Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, objected, and the move died. But Democrats said the move would be the first in a revived effort to address cuts that are beginning to bite.

HEADLINE: Tiny and Trendy, a Food Company Is Aiming for National Exposure

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Organic Avenue, the tiny purveyor of high-end juices, fresh salads and specialty foods like cashew scallion cream cheese and Thai collard wraps, has hired a new chief executive with the goal of turning its new owner's dreams of a national chain into reality.
Martin Bates, who turned around Pret a Manger's faltering business in the United States, will take charge of Organic Avenue in June. His task is to extend the appeal of its products beyond the trendy, celebrity-studded customer base it has built in New York City through a variety of national outlets, including online direct delivery services, exercise gyms and its own fleet of new stores. ''We need to mainstream the healthy, organic offering we've got,'' Mr. Bates said in an interview Tuesday. 
''I drink green juices and have done for the last year or so, but living the life of a vegan is not for me. I think there are lots of other people like me out there.''
Organic Avenue is famous for its juices and juice cleanses, as well as its orange and white bags that are often caught in paparazzi shots of rail-thin actresses in Manhattan's stylish SoHo neighborhood. Juice is fast becoming a big business, and everyone from Starbucks to restaurant impresario Danny Meyer is diving in.
The company also has a toehold in another fast-expanding market, that for ready-to-go vegan and vegetarian foods. ''They're capitalizing on two significant trends, pressed organic juices and vegan,'' said Maxwell Goldberg, a former Wall Street banker who has turned himself into an overnight organic sensation with his blog about organics, livingmaxwell.com, and a new online directory of organic juice, pressedjuicedirectory.com. ''There is nothing bigger in organics right now than pressed organic juice, period.''
The market for vegan and vegetarian food choices, too, is growing fast, driven by consumer concerns ranging from health and economics to the environment and animal welfare. More families are having ''meatless Mondays,'' and dining on tofurkey -- a tofu-based turkey product; other fake meats are going mainstream as well, spawning a fast-growing crowd of consumers who identify themselves as ''flexitarians.''
A survey in 2011 by Harris International for the Vegetarian Resource Group found that 5 percent of Americans never eat meat, while 33 percent said they were eating vegetarian or vegan meals more often.
It is that broader range of consumers Organic Avenue hopes to reach. Last week, the company introduced its first cooked vegan product, the Quinoa Bowl, a mix of red and white quinoa, a grain high in protein that is tossed with vegetables and spices. It comes in three varieties -- Mexi-Fresh Veggies, Turmeric Tomato Cauliflower and Sweet Yam and Celery -- and Jonathan Grayer, founder of Weld North, the investment firm that holds a controlling stake in the company, said sales have ''been crazy'' so far.
''We want to grow this business around helping people who want food that's better for them,'' Mr. Grayer said. ''That doesn't mean they have to be vegan. They certainly don't have to favor raw. They don't even have to be organic; they just have to want to be healthier.''
Mr. Bates arrived in the United States in 2008 at a time when Pret a Manger's American operations had fallen on hard times. The chain, based in Britain, had arrived with a bang and the backing of McDonald's eight years earlier, rapidly opening 16 stores in New York. But its offerings of minimalist European-style wraps and baguettes failed to catch on.
The business was bought by a private equity firm, Bridgepoint Capital, and Mr. Martin, who was in charge of operations for all the Pret shops in Britain outside of London, was dispatched to New York to find a fix.
He quickly realized that what worked in London might not work here. The chain was proud of its espresso drinks and had installed expensive espresso machines in its New York stores -- but Americans prefer drip coffee. It added poultry meats, tuna fish salad and cheese to its sandwiches in deference to American taste and offered bigger portions.
''We had tried to transplant London shops into New York, and that didn't work,'' Mr. Bates said. ''We tweaked a few menu items and focused on maintaining high standards for good food and amazing service, the basic stuff, really, but we had to treat the business as American.''Pret a Manger now has more than 50 shops in New York, Boston, Chicago and Washington, and Mr. Grayer is hoping Mr. Bates will open a similar number of Organic Avenue stores over the next several years. Weld North also wants to sell its products in other outlets. ''Martin was a master of doing that for Pret,'' Mr. Grayer said.
Mr. Bates also will be charged with figuring out what mix of business will best propel Organic Avenue's business. The company is best known for its juices and juice cleanse regimens, but it has a growing home delivery business.
''We are in the very late stages of forming partnerships with gyms and fitness clubs, which have a big interest in our products, but we're also looking to put Organic Avenue into high-end retailers,'' Mr. Grayer said, hinting that a high-end women's clothing store might soon become another outlet.
There again, Mr. Bates has experience. Last year, Pret a Manger opened a shop inside Target's first urban store, CityTarget in Chicago.
Mr. Bates said, however, that he was ''relishing the opportunity to help out and drive the strategy for manufacturing for Organic Avenue. Wholesale also will be new to me, and I'm excited to be involved with that.''
Perhaps tellingly, he said his favorite Organic Avenue product was Dragon's Breath, a juice that incorporates ginger, lemon and cayenne pepper. ''Caution,'' the company's Web site warns. ''This shot is not for the faint at heart!''

HEADLINE: Goodbye To All That

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
On April 13, Prime Minister Salam Fayyad of the Palestinian Authority resigned. It was an easy development to miss, but not one to be ignored. It was very bad news, because Salam Fayyad was the ''Arab Spring'' before there was an Arab Spring. That is, he was what the Arab Spring was supposed to lead to: a new generation of decent Arab leaders whose primary focus would be the human development of their own people, not the enrichment of their family, tribe, sect or party. That Fayyad's brand of noncorrupt, institution-focused leadership was not sufficiently supported by other Palestinian leaders, the Arab states, Israel and America is really depressing. It does not bode well for the revolutions in Egypt, Syria or Tunisia -- none of which have a Fayyad-quality leader at the helm. 
Who is Salam Fayyad? A former economist at the International Monetary Fund, he first came to prominence when he was named finance minister of the Palestinian Authority in 2002, after donors got fed up seeing their contributions diverted for corruption. Shortly after he became prime minister in 2007, I coined the term ''Fayyadism'' -- the all-too-rare notion that an Arab leader's legitimacy should be based not on slogans or resistance to Israel and the West or on personality cults or security services, but on delivering decent, transparent, accountable governance.
Fayyad ''dried up all slush accounts and went against Yasir Arafat's orders by insisting on paying all security officials by direct bank account (rather than with cash given to their commanders based on a questionable list of personnel),'' wrote Daoud Kuttab, a prominent Palestinian journalist, in The Jewish Daily Forward. ''Fayyad also became the first Arab government official to publish his government's entire budget online, ushering a new transparency not seen in the entire Arab region.''
Fayyad also played the leading role in rebuilding the Palestinian security services in the West Bank, which even the Israeli military grew to respect, and in trying to build Palestinian institutions, on the argument that the more Palestinians built their institutions -- finance, police, social services -- the more Israel's denial of them of a state will be unsustainable.
''Fayyad's embrace of economic transparency, which included U.S.-led audits, was instrumental in attracting increased international aid,'' noted David Makovsky, director of the project on the Middle East peace process at The Washington Institute. ''Despite a deep worldwide recession, the I.M.F. reported 9 percent growth for the West Bank between 2008 and 2010. ... As late as the second half of 2011, public support for Fayyad's government was at 53 percent, 19 points ahead of the Hamas government in Gaza.''
Hamas hated Fayyad, and many Palestinian Authority officials were jealous of him, but success protected him until 2011. President Mahmoud Abbas, frustrated by the right-wing Israeli government's refusal to strike a land-for-peace deal, decided to seek recognition of Palestinian statehood at the United Nations. The United States retaliated by cutting off aid, and Israel did so by withholding Palestinian tax receipts. I thought it foolish for Abbas to go to the U.N., but I thought it irresponsible for America's Congress to cut off aid to the Palestinians for doing so -- when we've never retaliated for the even more obstructionist building of settlements by Israel.
The loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in aid tanked the Palestinian economy. Public-sector workers went unpaid, and Fayyad had to impose austerity. Abbas and some of the old guard in his Fatah party, who never liked Fayyadism, ''used Fayyad as a scapegoat for Palestinian economic troubles, in part out of resentment at his efforts to constrain patronage and corruption,'' noted Makovsky. ''Blaming Fayyad for the latest downturn is especially audacious,'' he added. After all, last fall, Fayyad ''broke his hand in a meeting with Fatah members as he banged it on the table, vehemently arguing that it was irresponsible to go to the U.N. unless there were sufficient reserves to cover an aid slowdown.'' Fayyad finally got fed up and quit.
My four takeaways:
1. For Palestinians, particularly Abbas and Fatah, who so easily turned their most effective executive into a scapegoat, if there is no place for a Salam Fayyad-type in your leadership, an independent state will forever elude you.
2. Hamas and the Israeli settlers are both really happy today. Fayyad's aim to build a decent Palestinian state in the West Bank, at peace with Israel, was a huge threat to both of them. They both prefer permanent struggle so they both can claim there is no one to talk to on the other side and, therefore, they never have to change policies.
3. Thanks, American Congress and Israeli government. Your mindless, repeated cutoffs of cash to Fayyad's government helped undermine the best Palestinian peace partner Israel and the U.S. ever had. Nice job.
4. ''There is nothing inevitable about a liberal order emerging from any of these Arab awakenings,'' argues the pollster Craig Charney. Indeed, to produce that outcome takes someone like a Fayyad with the consistent help of external parties as well as a loyal base at home ready to see it through. In the end, Fayyad had neither. Add another nail in the coffin of the two-state solution.

HEADLINE: Ginger's Youthful Adventures

BYLINE: By EUGENIA BONE

 BODY:
Most of us know fresh ginger as that thick-skinned, aggressively spicy little fist in the winter greenmarket, or that shrunken knob in the crisper drawer of the refrigerator. But in April and May, if you look hard enough, you'll discover a whole new root: spring ginger.
Spring ginger is young ginger. It has the same handlike shape of the mature root, but rather than tough and fibrous, it is juicy and plump, with a pink blush. Mild and tender enough to eat raw in salads, it has an almost translucent skin that is so thin it doesn't need peeling; you can practically rub it off. Just wash it and trim the cut surfaces.
Spicy ginger is sometimes used in South Asian cooking to mask unpleasant tastes. But spring ginger's subtle spice doesn't compete with other delicate flavors, so you can slice it into a stir-fry and still get a gingery flavor without a mouthful of heat. Or you can pair spring ginger with a sea-scallop carpaccio and still taste the shellfish. It makes a delightful syrup, to dribble on panna cotta or poached pears, or to make a quick ginger ale. 
The most reliable place to find it is in Asian markets, like those in Chinatown in Manhattan, where seasonal fruits and vegetables can be found in the supermarkets, the outdoor stands and the pushcarts lining Canal Street.
Despite the name, spring ginger -- the immature rhizome, or subterranean stem, of Zingiber officinale -- is a fall crop, imported from countries south of the Equator where the growing season is the opposite of ours. And the nomenclature is even more confusing: labels like spring ginger, pink ginger, baby ginger and young ginger refer to the same plant at different stages in its 11-month growing season. (But the names are hardly codified, so which one is used often depends on the user.)
The earliest harvest, at five months, is called baby ginger, a creamy white bulb with vibrantly colored pink shoots, like a breakfast radish. It is traditionally used to make gari, the pink ginger pickle served in Japanese cuisine. Because of its tender, undeveloped fibers (it's the veal of ginger), baby ginger is ideal for candying. It is fairly unlikely you will see baby ginger in Chinatown, as the vast majority of ginger is imported, and the baby variety doesn't travel well.
What is commonly called spring ginger (and in Chinatown, young ginger) is more mature. ''It's actually teen ginger,'' said Bill Cox, who grows baby ginger on his Casselmonte Farm in Powhatan, Va.
Fully mature ginger is found in markets year-round. Its pungency comes from nonvolatile compounds called gingerols, which are concentrated in the skin. The spiciness of ginger increases with its maturity and toughness: where there's more hide, there's more heat.
Because ginger is a tropical crop, growing it to maturity in states other than Hawaii requires heated greenhouses to get the plants through the winter. They are expensive, and American farmers are hard-pressed to compete with producers of cheap imported mature ginger. ''The economics of supplemental heat do not make sense,'' Mr. Cox said.
But in the last few years, baby ginger has emerged as a specialty crop in the continental United States. The plants are started in the spring and the baby ginger is harvested in the fall. The entire crop is sold to restaurants and at farmers' markets in the surrounding region at premium prices of $5 to $20 a pound.
Most ginger seed in the country comes from one source, Puna Organics in Hawaii. East Branch Ginger, that company's representative in the continental United States, has sold seed to more than 500 growers in 39 states, including New Jersey and New York.
Garrett Miller and Melissa Madden, owners of Good Life Farm in Interlaken, N.Y., sold about 3,000 pounds of baby ginger last year to a variety of outlets, including Greene Grape Provisions, a grocery and wine shop in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. The root's texture, Ms. Madden said, is like an apple's. ''It's surprising how many people are eating it raw.''
Olivia Kirby grew baby ginger last year on the Farm at Locusts on Hudson in Staatsburg, N.Y., the private estate of the hotelier André Balazs. ''It worked out fantastically,'' she said. The ginger was sold to restaurants, including Mr. Balazs' Standard Grill in Manhattan, where the chef, Dan Silverman, used it to make pickles and juice, and to prepare fish crudo dishes.
Baby ginger is still a niche product but worth keeping an eye out for in the fall, when it is harvested in the Northern Hemisphere.
But right now, spring ginger is abundant and easy to use. It keeps for up to two weeks in the refrigerator, wrapped in plastic. It should stay moist, so wrap it in a damp paper towel. It can be frozen as well, packed in freezer bags. The younger the ginger, the more damage freezing does to the texture, so it will be too pulpy to chop; try grating the ginger directly into dishes while it is still frozen. You can also submerge ginger in a neutral spirit like vodka, and it will over time impart a delicate, spicy flavor.
In Chinatown, spring ginger is not available every day, but when one vendor has it, they all do. Check the vegetable stands on Mott Street south of Grand Street, or ask for the young ginger at the Asia Market Corporation at 71 ½ Mulberry Street, where it is kept in a cooler in the back. At New York Mart at 128 Mott Street recently, a gorgeous array of spring ginger had been thrown on top of the mature ginger. In Jackson Heights, Queens, Patel Brothers, a nationwide chain of Indian groceries, was selling it last week for $4.50 a pound.
From a distance it all looks the same, but take a sniff and you'll catch the lovely aroma. It can cost up to $10 a pound, but it's worth it.
Recipe: Ginger's Youthful Adventures; Scallop Carpaccio With Ginger
2 tablespoons finely chopped spring ginger
1 garlic clove, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, or to taste
1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste
1 pound very fresh (day boat, if possible) deep sea scallops
Ground black pepper
2 tablespoons minced parsley, for garnish
1. In a food processor or blender, combine the ginger, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 cup olive oil and 1 tablespoon lemon juice. Pulse just enough to make a mostly smooth but not liquefied purée. Adjust salt, oil and lemon juice to taste. (Alternatively, the ginger, garlic and salt may be mashed together with the side of a knife or using a mortar and pestle, then mixed with the oil and lemon juice.)
2. Using a sharp knife, slice the scallops as thinly as possible into disks. Combine the sliced scallops and ginger mixture in a bowl, and allow to rest at room temperature for 15 minutes, or refrigerate for up to 2 hours. The scallops may be served chilled, or, for more intense flavor, at room temperature.
3. To serve, on 4 individual plates or on a platter, arrange scallops in a single layer, slightly overlapping them. Sprinkle with pepper and garnish with parsley.
Yield: 4 servings
Recipe: ; Panna Cotta With Ginger Syrup
Vegetable oil or nonstick spray
2 cups heavy cream
1/2 cup sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons powdered ginger
1 packet (1/4 ounce) powdered unflavored gelatin
1/2 cup ginger syrup (see recipe)
Ground black pepper, for garnish
1. Lightly oil or spray 4 4-ounce ramekins, and set aside. In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the cream, sugar and ginger. Whisk until sugar is dissolved, then remove from heat.
2. In medium bowl, combine the gelatin with 3 tablespoons water. Add cream mixture to the gelatin, pouring it through a fine strainer if ginger has not thoroughly dissolved in the cream. Whisk until the gelatin has dissolved.
3. Pour the mixture into ramekins. Refrigerate until chilled and firm, 4 to 6 hours. (Do not chill more than 12 hours or the panna cotta will become rubbery.)
4. To serve, run a sharp knife around the edge of each panna cotta. Place ramekin upside down on a serving plate and tap bottom with knife; panna cotta should fall out. If it doesn't, use knife tip to release panna cotta from bottom. Garnish with ginger syrup -- warm, room temperature or cool -- and a few grinds of pepper.
Yield: 4 servings
Adapted from David Lebovitz
Recipe: ; Ginger Syrup
8 ounces spring ginger, peeled and sliced into thin disks
1 1/2 cups sugar
2 or 3 2-inch-long strips lemon zest (optional)
1 small dried hot pepper (optional)
1. In a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the ginger, sugar, lemon zest and hot pepper (if using) and 2 cups water. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a boil.
2. Reduce heat to low and simmer 30 minutes. Remove pepper, if using, and continue simmering until syrup is reduced by half, about 30 minutes. Do not reduce too much or syrup will crystallize when cool.
3. Remove syrup from heat and allow to cool. Strain it, reserving the ginger for another use (like candied ginger) if desired. Pour syrup into a jar or bottle, and refrigerate for up to a week; flavor will fade after that. (To make a quick ginger ale, put 2 teaspoons in 1/2 cup soda water and stir.)
Yield: 1 1/2 cups

HEADLINE: Lebanese Firms Accused by U.S.

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The United States accused two Lebanese money exchange houses on Tuesday of helping launder funds for an international drug trafficking ring and of financing the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. 
The Treasury Department labeled the exchange houses, Kassem Rmeiti and Halawi Exchange, ''primary money laundering concerns,'' which will most likely cut them off from the American financial system.
The Treasury and the Drug Enforcement Administration said that tens of millions of dollars in drug proceeds and other illegal funds moved through the exchange houses, which do mostly cash transactions.
The move is part of a multiyear inquiry that has exposed what the government says are links between South American drug traffickers and Middle Eastern militant groups like Hezbollah.
''Drugs and terrorism coexist across the globe in a marriage of mutual convenience,'' said Derek Maltz, who heads the D.E.A.'s Special Operations Division.
South American drug traffickers are eager to expand into lucrative markets in Europe and the Middle East via new shipment routes through West Africa, he said. And militant groups like Hezbollah have found it harder to get money directly from governments since the Sept. 11 attacks, when the United States cracked down on financing.
American officials say Hezbollah gets money from Iran, which has been hit with financial sanctions over its nuclear program.
''Hezbollah is both a full-fledged terrorist organization, lavishly funded over the years by Iran, and an enterprise that increasingly turns to crime to finance itself as the economic pressure on Iran mounts, and Iran's financial situation becomes more tenuous,'' said David Cohen, Treasury's under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Jumps After Recovery From Twitter-Led Drop

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
United States stocks climbed on Tuesday in a broad rally, recovering from sharp declines set off by a bogus Associated Press Twitter post about explosions at the White House.
A false post by hackers about two explosions at the White House that supposedly injured President Obama provoked a steep drop in stocks, before they quickly recovered minutes later.
Thomson Reuters data showed the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 14.6 points, or 0.93 percent, in the space of three minutes when the post hit the market. With the S.&P. 500 valued at about $14.6 trillion at the time of the false Twitter post, the plunge briefly wiped out $136.5 billion of the index's value. 
''If that was true that had happened, that's a justified sell-off, but because people suffer from information overload, people tend to overreact and don't wait to substantiate things -- that is the downside to a 24-7 news cycle,'' said Jason Weisberg, managing director of Seaport Securities Corporation in New York.
''You want instantaneous pricing; you want all the advantages of the technology. Well then, you have to live by the negatives that the speed and expediency provide.''
The move was a reminder of the May 6, 2010, tumble in markets now known as the flash crash, when the Dow industrials dropped more than 600 points, eventually piling up a loss of about 1,000 points, in a few minutes before largely recovering.
Stocks had seen a solid advance before the tweet, lifted by a host of strong corporate earnings, including Travelers Companies, Netflix and Coach.
After the closing bell, Apple, maker of iPads and iPhones, climbed 4.9 percent to $425.95 after reporting second-quarter earnings and announcing plans to double the amount of capital it returns to shareholders.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 152.29 points, or 1.05 percent, to close at 14,719.46. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 16.28 points, or 1.04 percent, to finish at 1,578.78. The Nasdaq composite index advanced 35.78 points, or 1.11 percent, to end at 3,269.33.
Netflix shares jumped 24.4 percent to $216.99 while Coach shot up 9.8 percent to $55.55. They were the S.&P. 500's two biggest percentage gainers.
Shares of the movie streaming service Netflix shot higher after it reported strong subscriber growth and earnings that beat expectations. Coach stock leapt after the company, which makes and sells upscale leather goods, reported higher-than-expected quarterly sales.
Travelers helped lift the Dow, up 2.1 percent at $86.35 after the insurer posted earnings that topped expectations and increased its dividend.
Earnings season has been largely positive, with more than 68.9 percent of S.&P. 500 companies that have reported results so far beating expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. Since 1994, 63 percent have surpassed estimates on average, while the beat rate is 67 percent for the last four quarters.
''We are encouraged to see the market focusing on fundamentals, because we had been in a period where the macro trade was pretty much driving things -- whatever the global macro event was or political event was seemed to be affecting the movement of the markets for a period of time,'' said Paul Mangus, head of equity research and strategy at Wells Fargo Private Bank in Charlotte, N.C.
The benchmark S.&P. 500 index has risen 2.4 percent over the last three sessions.
Analysts see earnings growth of 2.3 percent this quarter, up from expectations of 1.5 percent at the start of the month.
Housing stocks ranked among the best performers, after Barclays raised its rating on the homebuilding sector to positive from neutral. The sector also got a lift from encouraging housing data, with new-home sales in the United States up 1.5 percent in March.
The PHLX housing sector index rose 3.8 percent, led by a 9.3 percent gain in Toll Brothers to $34.13.

HEADLINE: Camelot in Canada?

BYLINE: By BRUCE MCCALL. 
Bruce McCall, a writer and illustrator, was born and raised in Simcoe, Ontario, and lives in New York City.

 BODY:
CANADA has never had much truck with serial ruling clans. The closest we've come to a dynasty was Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians, a dance band (not actually by appointment of Her Majesty the Queen; that self-conferred honorific was meant to charm impressionable Americans) made up of four brothers, and sometimes a sister, who ruled generation after generation wherever it is that dance bands rule. But packing an orchestra with that monogenerational cluster seemed less dynastic than incestuous.
There are no Kennedys or Bushes in Canadian politics, let alone anything like the successive Kims: Il-sung, Jong-il and Jong-un. We have no shortage of dimwits and blowhards in high office, but ours have never run in families. Maybe the idea of a dynasty is just too gaudy, too overreaching for a culture that can't help sounding modest even when it tries to brag -- which explains why Canadian show-offs are almost inevitably banished to the United States. And let it be borne in mind that dynasties are curiously often coupled with financial, political and moral corruption. This is an impossible trifecta in Canadian life. It's against the law. 
And yet. Enter Justin (at last, a politician with a movie star/pop idol/ski bum name!) Trudeau -- the 41-year-old newly elected head of the Liberal Party and putative candidate for prime minister in the 2015 election. That is, if he can revive a party that has withered down to a political nub since the glory days of its most swashbuckling prime minister, Justin's father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau.
A dynasty needs first of all to be founded by one larger-than-life superhero or supervillain, hungry for the power of command. That talent gets transmitted to the next generation and the next, though sometimes the genes get watered down and all that's passed down is the title (I give you Bashar al-Assad, chinless nincompoop heir to his Syrian strongman daddy).
Pierre Trudeau filled that superhero role; he sometimes even wore a cape. In his 15 years of prime ministership -- from 1968 to 1979, and again from 1980 to 1984 -- he displayed such un-Canadian panache that he triggered a public enthusiasm known as Trudeaumania. Even the Americans took notice. Not that his predecessors and successors weren't often worthy sorts, but Mr. Trudeau stands out among them. A rich Montreal lawyer who bridged the often fraught divide between French and English Canada, he married a hard-partying young fox and never even tried to hide how smart he was.
Trudeaumania would ebb over the years, abetted by a lousy economy, as well as the country's need for relief from the intensity of a Type-AAA personality running a nation where ''introvert'' was never a dirty word. Mr. Trudeau was eventually no longer anybody's darling, and by 1984 he was gone from public life.
Have we been waiting, these three long decades, for the return of his heir? Square-jawed, with great hair and a winning smile and a decorous young wife, smooth and personable as a TV game show host, Trudeau the younger evidently intends to ride this Kennedyesque package of assets past his earnest but less charismatic rivals and his striking lack of political experience -- not to mention the absence of a detailed agenda for making Canada even greater -- right into that plush swivel chair in the highest corner office in the land.
Canadians are less inclined to go gaga over political razzmatazz than any other Western people except perhaps the Belgians. Our longest-serving prime minister, Mackenzie King (who lived from 1874 to 1950 and spent nearly 22 years at the helm), was a dyspeptic-looking lifelong bachelor who liked to commune with his late mother via crystal ball after a long workday on Parliament Hill. But so what; he was effective at his job, and Canadians always have favored substance over style.
It's clear that it would take a total cultural turnaround for Canadians to anoint the young Trudeau as their leader over more proven political entities.
But that doesn't mean that the political establishment isn't a tiny bit worried. Canadian political life post-Pierre Trudeau has lacked a certain, well, pizazz. Even a sympathetic observer can detect disappointment in a run of prime ministerial personalities about as dynamic as a convention of C.P.A.'s, culminating today in Stephen Harper, the leader of the Conservative Party. People still have a sentimental affection for that halcyon era when Ottawa escaped the designation of dreariest national capital and are a bit beguiled by the young politician's vitality and offhand glamour. The parallel between the age of Eisenhower and the advent of J.F.K. is apt, if not exact. And so, the staid Ottawa political establishment is suddenly faced with the nightmare of a what-the-heck-let's-try-a-fresh-face electoral turnaround.
Canada, Land of Surprises.

HEADLINE: Volume Rises In Las Vegas Arms Race

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
Over the last few years the center of the electronic dance world in the United States has shifted to Las Vegas, where top D.J.'s now earn some of their biggest paychecks from casino megaclubs.
The latest arrival to this scene is Hakkasan Las Vegas, part of an international chain of high-end Cantonese restaurants, which has its grand opening this week.
Developed at the MGM Grand at a reported cost of $100 million, the club is 80,000 square feet of Vegas-style chinoiserie, and is the city's biggest nightclub, according to Neil Moffitt, chief executive of the Angel Management Group, which will manage the club with the Hakkasan company. Along with another new space, Light, it represents the next stage in Las Vegas's evolution as a luxury mecca for electronic dance music, or E.D.M. 
Mr. Moffitt, 46, a veteran of the British dance business, has been the driving force behind the club. He spoke recently about Hakkasan, dance music's role in the Las Vegas hospitality industry and the comparative economics of dance and rock. Here are edited excerpts from that conversation.
Q. How did the nightclubs of Las Vegas reach their current level of competition for the big names in dance music?
A. My first foray into the electronic-music market in Las Vegas was Paul Oakenfold at Ice in 2004. At that time there was the odd stand-alone room that might have a D.J. on Wednesday night. D.J.'s going from L.A. or Chicago would stop off here, get a suntan, a nice dinner and a check. It was never a serious market.
Then in 2007 there was the decline in the gaming market, and all of a sudden casinos are scrambling for revenue. Pure became the market leader. There were rumors about $1 million nights, Paris Hilton here, another celebrity there. And they all looked at it and said, ''Wow, this business can generate a lot of money.''
So nightclub after nightclub started to get built, and over the last six years Las Vegas has invested in bringing a new demographic to this market, which is primarily food and beverage and hospitality driven.
Q. How does Hakkasan fit into this?
A. It's sort of the first of its kind, and it has been built with change in mind. The nearer you are to the restaurant, the more of the DNA of the restaurant is in it. Farther away, whilst it will contain some of the restaurant, it will take on a feel of its own. It doesn't ooze rave; it oozes class.
Downstairs we have the Ling Ling Club, a 10,000-square-foot experience, and a separate, more intimate and V.I.P. environment known as the Ling Ling Lounge, which offers a more relaxed atmosphere with top-notch mixology. Upstairs is the main room, which I could call a gladiatorial, high-energy room with a very intense sound-and-light show. To the right, the Pavilion can act as part of the main room, or independently.
Q. Gladiatorial?
A. If someone were to shoot ''Fight Club 2,'' they could film it in that room. A very intense experience. It reminds me of when we had Tiësto at Godskitchen, my nightclub in Birmingham. I remember getting in the D.J. booth, and the energy in that room.
Q. These days people talk about an ''arms race'' in the E.D.M. business, and no place seems to symbolize that better than Las Vegas and these elaborate new clubs.
A. It's an evolution. For years people have been charged a ton of money to go into mediocre buildings with poor facilities and can't believe they paid that much money to sit next to the toilet. And they leave disenchanted.
Las Vegas itself has evolved. We've been through the financial crisis, and people are selective about where they spend their money. They don't want to go to poor venues and eat poor food. Customers expect a certain level of service and environment. Maybe we still haven't reached the peak.
Hakkasan Las Vegas is a Michelin-star restaurant that has evolved into a nightclub. That's where we are. If some people see that as an arms race, maybe it's just sour grapes.
Q. How do the economics of running these clubs and putting on big dance events compare to the other side of the live-music business?
A. E.D.M. today is what hip-hop was to the MTV generation. We have D.J.'s capable of producing enough ticket sales to compete with Grammy-winning live artists.
If you think about a rock 'n' roll concert, you're lucky if these guys will come onstage and do an hour and 20 minutes. We are getting three to four hours of value out of our D.J.'s. We can get 6,000 or 7,000 people through the doors who are willing to pay to see them, probably at an average ticket price higher than I could get for a live act. And it's a show!
Tiësto was booked to play for me on New Year's Eve at a casino in Atlantic City, in a room that held 5,000 people. I had absolutely no problem selling that out, and no problem making money. Six weeks prior to that I had a date with a live artist who had terrible problems selling out, and no problem losing money. And yet people think this guy is a superstar.
Q. Another big concern is that this is an economic bubble, with D.J. fees rising and $100 million deals being done. Do you agree with that?
A. A lot of people out there are saying that D.J.'s are getting paid too much. It's correct that the fees are escalating. But that's because of demand -- demand from competitors and also demand from consumers. These guys are very sophisticated, with sophisticated management.
No, I don't think the bubble is going to burst in the foreseeable future. But I do think that for people who jump into this world with limited understanding, whether you're promoting a rock act or an E.D.M. act, there will be casualties.

HEADLINE: 'A Chinese Threat to Afghan Buddhas'

BYLINE: By BRENT E. HUFFMAN. 
Brent E. Huffman is a documentary filmmaker and assistant professor at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University. He is expanding the material in this Op-Doc into a feature-length documentary.

 BODY:
When I first traveled to Afghanistan in 2004, I immediately fell in love with the country and its people, and I was optimistic that the young people in Kabul would soon have better lives. Yet my hopes dimmed as I learned about a revolving door of exploitation at the hands of the Russians, Americans and now the Chinese -- who have begun mining Afghanistan's plentiful natural resources and threatening priceless national heritage sites. 
In 2007, the Chinese state-owned China Metallurgical Group Corporation (M.C.C.) won the rights to mine copper at a site called Mes Aynak. Situated in volatile Logar Province, Mes Aynak is home to one of the world's largest untapped copper deposits -- worth more than $100 billion. Yet, as this Op-Doc video shows, the site also houses the astonishing remains of an ancient Buddhist city, which archaeologists are now racing to save. An international team has only until June to finish the excavations, which began in 2009. So far they have uncovered golden Buddhist statues, dozens of buildings and fragile Buddhist manuscripts buried within temples. Yet perhaps 90 percent of the site remains underground and unseen. To finish the job could take decades. In all likelihood, the destruction of the Buddhist sites will begin later this year. The Afghan government is letting this happen -- it's a tragedy that echoes the notorious destruction of the Buddhas at Bamiyan in 2001.
Yet, even after four trips to Afghanistan to report this story, it's difficult for me to know for sure what will become of Mes Aynak. Recent repeated attempts to contact the M.C.C. to confirm the mining timeline for this story have gone unanswered. There is widespread corruption and virtually no government transparency in Afghanistan, and the M.C.C. contract has never been made public.
I have heard arguments in favor of the mining. The copper deal is the largest foreign investment and private business venture in Afghanistan's history. There is hope among some Afghans that this Chinese deal will bring real and positive change to Afghanistan -- jobs, infrastructure and money to help fuel economic growth. Some of the Buddhist artifacts are being rescued, and it's possible that not all of the ancient sites will be destroyed by the mining.
But I worry that nothing positive will come from this mining project. I fear the mineral resource is being undervalued, that money will be lost to corruption in the Afghan ministries and that jobs at the mine will go to Chinese immigrants. Geologists tell me that, as a result of the open-pit style of mining, the site will most likely become so toxic that nothing can ever live there again. Money can come and go, but these precious historical artifacts will be gone forever.

HEADLINE: Howard J. Phillips, Stalwart Conservative, Dies at 72

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
Howard J. Phillips, a pillar of conservative activism who ran for president three times on the ticket of a political party he helped found, died on Saturday at his home in Vienna, Va. He was 72.
The cause was temporal frontal lobe dementia, his sister, Susan Phillips Bari, said.
Along with Richard Viguerie, Paul Weyrich, Terry Dolan and others, Mr. Phillips was a leader of the New Right, a movement that gave more clout to the right wing of the Republican Party in the 1970s and '80s, much as the Tea Party has in recent years. 
Even among stalwart conservatives, Mr. Phillips was known for being especially devoted to the ideological principles of the right, including limited government, traditional family values, strong national defense and opposition to abortion.
''He was our true north,'' Mr. Viguerie, famed for pioneering the political use of direct mail, said in an interview on Monday. ''You could compromise on strategy, but on principle Howie was unswerving.''
Mr. Phillips's integrity as a conservative was on display in President Richard M. Nixon's administration. In early 1973, the president signaled his intention to withhold financing from the Office of Economic Opportunity, an antipoverty agency with roots in President Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty. The president named Mr. Phillips acting director and charged him with dismantling it.
''I believe Richard Nixon epitomizes the American dream and represents all that is great in America,'' Mr. Phillips said at the time.
Nixon was unable to carry out his plans, however, after Democrats successfully sued to prevent him from starving an agency that Congress had authorized. And when Nixon yielded and continued to finance Johnson's Great Society programs, Mr. Phillips considered the president to have broken his word and resigned.
''The thing that changed him was that while he was working for O.E.O., before he became acting director, he went around the country looking at all the grantees,'' Ms. Bari, his sister, said, and concluded that much of the money was supporting liberal advocacy groups.
''Not to what the taxpayers thought they were supporting,'' Ms. Bari said. ''That's what radicalized him.''
In 1974, Mr. Phillips founded the Conservative Caucus, an advocacy group, based in Warrenton, Va. He stepped down as its chairman in 2011.
Mr. Phillips could be a thorn in the side of presidents, even fellow Republicans. He lobbied against President Ronald Reagan's nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court and against the first President George Bush's nomination of David Souter to the court, arguing that they would favor abortion rights.
''Whether he won or lost, he always said that what is right is what he was going to do,'' Charles Orndorff, the administrative vice president of the Conservative Caucus, said in an interview on Monday. ''His honor, as a conservative leader, meant the most to him.''
In 1990, believing that neither major party would enact the policies he favored, Mr. Phillips led the formation of the U.S. Taxpayers Party (later renamed the Constitution Party), which declares that its policies are based on the founding documents of the nation and the original intent of the founding fathers. He was its candidate for president in 1992, 1996 and 2000. His best showing was in 1996, when he received one-fifth of 1 percent of the vote.
Howard Jay Phillips was born in Boston on Feb. 3, 1941, and grew up in nearby Brighton, Mass. His father, Frederick, ran an insurance agency; his mother, the former Gertrude Goldberg, was a homemaker. Though he was raised Jewish, he became a Christian in the 1970s. He was present at the 1960 conference at the home of William F. Buckley Jr. in Sharon, Conn., that created the conservative organization Young Americans for Freedom. Mr. Phillips graduated from Harvard in 1962.
In the mid-1960s he was chairman of the Boston Republican Committee, and in 1968 he managed the Senate campaign of Richard S. Schweiker, a Pennsylvania Republican congressman who unseated Senator Joseph S. Clark, a Democrat. Mr. Phillips worked in several positions in the Nixon administration before landing at the Office of Economic Opportunity.
Somewhat quixotically, he sought the Democratic nomination for senator from Massachusetts in 1978 in order to oppose the Republican incumbent, Edward W. Brooke III, a defender of Great Society programs. Mr. Phillips lost in a primary to Paul Tsongas, who went on to defeat Senator Brooke.
In addition to his sister, Mr. Phillips is survived by his wife, the former Margaret Blanchard, whom he married in 1964; three sons, Douglas, Bradford and Samuel; three daughters, Elizabeth Lants (known by her middle name, Amanda), Alexandra and Jennifer; and 18 grandchildren.
On Monday, Mr. Viguerie recalled the occasional derision that he and Mr. Phillips endured for their political ardor.
''He and I did an interview with Dan Rather at the G.O.P. convention in 1984, and Rather asked us about George H. W. Bush, and we were very critical of his conservative credentials,'' Mr. Viguerie said. ''And the next night, Rather had Bush on, and he said, 'Richard Viguerie and Howard Phillips say you're not a conservative. Well, Mr. Vice President, what about it? Are you a conservative?'
''And he said, 'Yes, Dan, I'm a conservative, but I'm not a nut about it.' ''

HEADLINE: Economists Agree: Solutions Are Elusive

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
Last week the International Monetary Fund hosted a conference of some of the world's top macroeconomists to assess how the most intense crisis to have shaken the industrialized economies since the Great Depression has changed the profession's collective understanding of how the world economy works.
Two things struck me about the conclave. The first was hearing George Akerlof, a Nobel-winning economist from Berkeley, take to the lectern to compare the crisis to a cat stuck in a tree, afraid to move.
The second was realizing how, after five years of coping with the consequences of the disaster, there is still so much uncertainty about what policies are needed to prevent another financial shock from tipping the world economy into the abyss again a few years down the road.
''We don't have a sense of the final destination,'' said Olivier Blanchard, chief economist of the monetary fund. ''Where we end I really don't have much of a clue.'' 
In determining what is a sustainable level of government debt, or whether central banks should focus on anything other than inflation, or what should be done to prevent further bubbles from destabilizing economies, he argued ''we are still very much navigating by sight.''
If you are one of the nearly five million American workers who have been unemployed for over six months, or one of the six million Spaniards, three million Italians or 1.3 million Greeks without a job or a clear prospect of finding one, this amounts to a tragedy.
Considering that the large and complicated financial institutions that set off the crisis five years ago have only gotten larger and more complex, the gap in knowledge is downright scary.
It is scarier to consider how politicians have chosen to ignore much of what the profession has learned from the experience.
Berkeley's David Romer counted six shocks that hit the United States in the last three decades alone. The economy dodged the bullet in two -- the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s and the Russian default in the 1990s, which led to the bailout of a hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management.
It took a hit in three -- the collapse of much of the savings and loan industry in the late 1980s, the 1987 stock market crash and the dot.com implosion. But it got hammered in the last one.
Economists used to think it was obvious how to contain such shocks. No point trying to stop a bubble from inflating, they thought; it would be impossible to identify in the first place. The best a central bank like the Federal Reserve could do is stand ready to cut interest rates after the bubble burst, patch up the financial system and set the economy back on track. In terms of budgets, governments should aim for a prudent level of debt to retain space to borrow and spend when it was needed.
Now, interest rates have been near zero for years, and growth has not been restored to acceptable levels. And few if any of the economists gathered at the International Monetary Fund's headquarters in Washington would venture a guess about what level of debt would be prudent these days.
On the eve of the financial crisis, Spain's net debt was just over 25 percent of its economic output. The ratio of net debt to gross domestic product in Ireland hovered around 11 percent. Martin Wolf, chief economic commentator of The Financial Times, said that Britain's debt ratio was close to a 300-year low, way below its level during the Industrial Revolution.
It wasn't low enough, apparently. Five years later, Ireland's bailout of its banks took its net debt to 102 percent of its economic output. Spain's debt hit 80 percent of G.D.P. And Britain's reached 86 percent -- the highest since the 1960s.
This is of enormous consequence. One lesson from the crisis -- first learned in the 1930s and corroborated in several contemporary analyses -- is that when interest rates lose their power to stimulate the economy, additional government spending can help generate real growth. Still, the fear of ''excessive'' debt has led many governments to cut spending even in the face of economic stagnation.
Countries like Ireland and Spain have pretty much lost their ability to raise money in financial markets. They are now struggling to reduce debt with little success: cutting public spending in the midst of severe downturns only makes economic performance worse, adding to the debt burden.
Yet even in Britain or the United States, which can still borrow at near-record-low interest rates, governments have taken to cutting public spending at the expense of growth and jobs.
Perhaps this is natural. After all, the crisis upended a consensus. Economists and policy makers bred to think that all that was needed to run a prosperous economy was to keep inflation low, strive for fiscal balance and deregulate have found themselves in a more complex world. In this world, financial bubbles matter, capital flows are of dubious merit, low interest rates fail to stimulate growth and government spending becomes the only tool with real traction to spur economic activity.
And there is reason to be cautious. With total government debt in the rich world stuck at around 100 percent of its combined economic output, there is a legitimate fear that a rise in interest rates could tip off a financial death spiral. Moreover, if countries with debt levels well under 50 percent of G.D.P. were so devastated by the crisis, it is hard to imagine what might happen to them if another were to hit them.
Still, the argument against debt is often overstated. Disagreement and uncertainty among economists have given the political systems in Europe and the United States ample license to engage in austerity policies that frankly are proving counterproductive -- making recovery more difficult and painful.
In his assessment at the end of the conference, Mr. Akerlof argued that the response in the United States had been reasonable. From the bank bailout to the fiscal stimulus to zero short-term interest rates, ''the economic policies postrecovery have been close to what a good, sensible economist doctor would have ordered'' for the stranded cat.
But other economists were not quite as sanguine. Indeed, one take-away from the economic conclave is that it may be a fantasy to think that the world's economies can be steeled to withstand a shock like those the financial system can provide. If so, the urgent task is what kind of limits should be imposed on banking and the rest of finance to temper its propensity to careen toward disaster.
Financial regulation is being tightened around the world. Banks are being required to raise more capital than before. Bigger banks face tougher rules. Still, there is no consensus on which new institutions might be needed to monitor and temper finance, or how tough the rules should be.
What good does the modern financial system do, for the rest of us? What determines financial fluctuations and shocks? How do they affect the broader economy? What can governments do to make them less disruptive? Economists have few answers.
''We don't have a clue of what financial stability actually means,'' Mr. Blanchard confessed.
Mr. Romer said, ''Five years into a crisis of this magnitude, we should be, 'Oh my God, the cat has been in the tree for five years, it's time to get the cat down out of the tree and figure out how to make sure the cat doesn't go up the tree again.'''

HEADLINE: In Iceland, A Festival Of Present And Future

BYLINE: By STEVE SMITH

 BODY:
REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- Visitors to Thingvellir National Park, just over 30 miles outside of Reykjavik, can stand on the North American continental plate one minute, and Eurasia the next, by simply crossing a rocky gorge: it's a divergent boundary where the world's face is ripping apart slowly. In Reykjavik a different kind of upheaval was evident last weekend, as the Iceland Symphony Orchestra presented its second annual Tectonics Festival at the Harpa Concert Hall and Conference Center here on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. The festival also engaged in shifting borders, but convergence, rather than separation, was the chief process in play.
Approaching historic Reykjavik by the main harbor road, every traveler will encounter Harpa, a glittering iceberg of a building designed by Olafur Eliasson and built by Henning Larsen Architects. The building's tilted glass-box surfaces and tinted windows play marvels with sunlight; at night, colored lights dance across its face.
Begun by a private company and nearly ended by the 2008 banking crisis, Harpa was completed as a public project. Planned amenities like a hotel and an apartment building were abandoned. But the main center opened in May 2011: a symbol of Iceland's resilience for many, a lavish reminder of past excesses for some. 
This visionary space ideally suits Tectonics, the brainchild of Ilan Volkov, the Iceland Symphony's 36-year-old Israeli chief conductor and music director. Questions posed by Mr. Volkov on the festival's Web page summarize his intent: ''How can an orchestra, the 19th-century beast, be more radical and experimental? Is it possible?''
As is true at the New York Philharmonic's Contact! series, fragmentation is one option. The orchestra played just one concert at full strength, on Friday night in Eldborg (literally, Fire Castle), the Harpa complex's gorgeous, acoustically stunning 1,800-seat auditorium. Alongside Magnus Lindberg's buoyant Clarinet Concerto, with Chen Halevi as the vivacious soloist, were striking premieres by Icelandic composers: Gudmundur Steinn Gunnarsson's glistening ''Grafgata''; Atli Ingolfsson's woozy, bristling Piano Concerto, with the splendid pianist Vikingur Olafsson; and ''Under Takes Over,'' a mysterious sequence of floating tones and lighting effects by Hildur Gudnadottir.
Ms. Gudnadottir, a cellist and vocalist best known to ambient-music devotees, was among several guests whose careers mostly lay outside of classical music circles. Others included the violist Eyvind Kang and the vocalist Jessika Kenney, American performers whose work fuses elements of early music, Asian classical styles, black metal and improvisation; Vicki Bennett, a British artist who creates media-collage art under the name People Like Us; and Eli Keszler, an American composer, percussionist and installation artist.
The festival's principal guest was the composer Christian Wolff, the last surviving member of the so-called New York School surrounding John Cage and Morton Feldman. Not principally known for orchestral works, Mr. Wolff joined members of the Iceland Symphony, Mr. Olafsson, Mr. Kang and other guests in several chamber concerts spread among Harpa's striking recital halls. Combined, the programs spanned Mr. Wolff's career, from the spare, seminal ''Nine'' (1951) to the fitful ''Dijon'' (2012-13).
Fengjastrutur, an Icelandic ensemble that specializes in unorthodox works, offered imaginative accounts of Mr. Wolff's ''Metal and Breath,'' ''Stones'' and ''Groundspace'' alongside its own giddily absurdist creations, involving gunshots, a noisy swap meet and a belly flop into a rubber kiddie pool. The group's realization of Mr. Wolff's text piece ''Pit Music,'' done outdoors in the hole where Harpa's hotel was to have stood, was the first time Mr. Wolff had ever seen the piece enacted, according to a representative of his publisher, Edition Peters.
Some of the festival's greatest pleasures came in witnessing Mr. Wolff's delight as he watched two of his works determinedly undertaken by youth ensembles in Harpa's spacious lobby: Kammerkor Suderlands in ''Wobbly Music,'' on Friday, and the Icelandic National Youth Band in ''Burdocks,'' on Saturday.
Those performances and others showed the extent to which Mr. Volkov meant to celebrate Harpa by using its magnificent spaces and resources to their fullest. On Thursday members of the youth band marched through lobbies on the building's various levels, bouncing Vinko Globokar's clambering ''Crocs en jambe'' against sleek surfaces and angular niches. On Friday the Icelandic Flute Ensemble and its members' young students set the main lobby aglow with Henry Brant's haunting ''Mass for June 16.''
Cross-genre collaborations featured prominently throughout Tectonics. On Thursday Mr. Volkov conducted the Iceland Symphony, Kammerkor Suderlands and Skuli Sverrisson, a bass guitarist and soundscaper, in ''Concealed Unity,'' a sublimely ritualistic, pan-cultural work by Mr. Kang and Ms. Kenney. That evening Mr. Kang and Ms. Kenney improvised sensitively with Mr. Sverrisson, Mr. Wolff and Ms. Gudnadottir.
Still later that night, and again on Friday, the Icelandic ensemble Duo Harpverk played Mr. Keszler's ''Breaker -- Neum'' along with one of his rattling, moaning piano-wire installations. Ms. Kenney participated in breathtaking accounts of two pieces by Feldman, ''Voice and Instruments 2'' and ''For Franz Kline,'' on Friday night, shared with a set of her original works with Mr. Kang.
Spread over two long nights and one well-packed day, Tectonics could feel breathless, with little time to reflect between events. Intimate recitals, a solo performance by People Like Us and a closing event that included the former Sigur Ros keyboardist Kjartan Sveinsson were well filled, but audiences for the Eldborg concerts seemed woefully sparse.
Still, any concert of modern works and premieres that draws more than a hundred listeners can't be deemed a failure, especially in a nation whose population is a fraction of New York's. Plus, the space was needed for practical reasons. Almost everything performed in Eldborg, notably ''Concealed Unity'' and Anna Thorvaldsdottir's ghostly ''Into -- second self,'' dispersed players to balconies surrounding the audience, and used the hall's adjustable acoustic panels and doors.
Through it all, Mr. Volkov was tireless and omnipresent, not only conducting and performing, but also giving informal chats, moving furniture and directing traffic. In May he will introduce a second Tectonics festival in Glasgow, where he is the principal guest conductor of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. Details for another Tectonics event, to take place in Tel Aviv in June, have not been revealed.
How well the concept will travel remains to be seen. But a complex as visionary and audacious as Harpa begs for an equally bold signature event, and Tectonics fit the bill.
The Tectonics Festival Glasgow will take place in Scotland on May 11 and 12; tectonicsfestival.com/glasgow.

HEADLINE: Fearing Price Increases, Iranians Hoard Goods

BYLINE: By THOMAS ERDBRINK and RICK GLADSTONE; Thomas Erdbrink reported from Tehran, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

 BODY:
TEHRAN -- Iranians rushed to supermarkets to buy cooking oil, red meat and other staples on Tuesday, stockpiling the goods over new fears of price spikes from a change in the official exchange rate that could severely reduce the already weakened purchasing power of the rial, the national currency.
The change, less than two months before critical national elections, appeared to cause widespread concern even among Iranians accustomed to chronically high inflation and other problems -- a result, economists here say, of a combination of severe Western sanctions and what many call the government's economic mismanagement. 
Prices of staples long deemed essential are set to increase by as much as 60 percent because of the currency change, which nearly doubles the mandatory exchange rate for importers of goods like medicine, chicken and sugar, but also machinery spare parts and some chemicals.
Under Iran's complicated system of multiple exchange rates, the importers had been paying a rate of 12,260 rials to the dollar, but will now have to pay 24,500 rials to the dollar. The new exchange rate is much closer to the rial's actual market value, which currency traders estimate to be 35,500 rials to the dollar.
The Iranian news media said it would take up to a week for consumers to feel the change, which appeared to accelerate many people's efforts to buy what they could as soon as possible.
In a Sepah department store in downtown Tehran, shoppers could be seen loading dozens of bottles of cooking oil into carts.
''I'm hoarding now, so that I don't lose money later,'' explained a homemaker who identified herself by only one name, Zahra. ''Again, the prices of everything will go up.''
Hassan Davari, a representative of a vegetable oil distribution company, visiting a grocery near Palestine Square in Tehran, found that his product had been swept off the shelves. ''Any goods we have handed over to shops this morning have vanished in a couple of hours,'' he said.
The value of Iran's national currency has fallen by half over the past few years. It has been especially pummeled by the Western sanctions, which have severely curtailed Iran's international banking capabilities and halved its overseas sales of oil, the most important Iranian export. Many economists consider the rial's problems at least a partial cause of Iran's inflation, which is officially around 30 percent but widely believed to be far higher.
Iran's economics minister, Shamseddin Hosseini, acknowledged on Tuesday that inflation was a problem and that the sanctions played a role. But in a briefing for reporters while on a visit to his country's United Nations mission in New York, Mr. Hosseini said the sanctions had also created a contrarian and beneficial result by forcing Iran to become less reliant on imports and more self-sufficient.
''We have no doubt our growth rate is positive,'' he said. The imposition of sanctions, he said, ''forces you to find new ways to be creative.''
The minister also said that Iranians fully supported the government's resistance to the sanctions, imposed in response to Iran's nuclear energy program, which Western nations suspect is a guise for Iran to develop a nuclear weapons capability. Iran contends that the program is peaceful.
The minister maintained that the sanctions were designed to deny Iran the right to develop a broad new range of knowledge-based industries that the big Western powers would like to monopolize. New technologies, he said, ''are forbidden frontiers, other than for themselves -- no one else has permission to cross the threshold.''
Mr. Hosseini also disputed reports that some consumers in Iran had already found that the price of meat had doubled in the latest round of increases. ''I don't know what butcher shop they went to. They must have gotten a raw deal,'' he said. ''Foodstuffs have increased across the board, but not that much.''
The decision to end the preferable exchange rate for ''essential'' products was taken last week by the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, which says it wants to move toward a single foreign exchange rate.
The government's decision is likely to further weaken the rial against the dollar, experts said. But it also appeared to have some internal political motivations.
Mr. Ahmadinejad has been pressuring Parliament to increase the monthly cash distributions given to most Iranians to help cushion the blow of rising prices, which have been caused in part by his effort to phase out subsidies on food and fuels. Mr. Ahmadinejad has called his subsidy overhaul the ''most successful economic plan in the history of Iran.''
But many lawmakers have resisted Mr. Ahmadinejad's pressure, saying they would agree to increase the monthly cash distributions only after the June 14 elections, fearing that doing so beforehand could strengthen Mr. Ahmadinejad's popularity.
The president, who has served the maximum two terms and cannot run again, appears poised to support the candidacy of his close adviser Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, who is much hated by clerics and commanders in the security forces who fear he wants to undermine their power.

HEADLINE: 20 Pounds? Not Too Bad, for an Extinct Fish

BYLINE: By NATE SCHWEBER

 BODY:
PYRAMID LAKE, Nev. -- For most fishermen a 20-pound trout is a trophy, but for Paiute tribe members and fish biologists here the one Matt Ceccarelli caught was a victory.
That Lahontan cutthroat trout he caught last year, a remnant of a strain that is possibly the largest native trout in North America, is the first confirmed catch of a fish that was once believed to have gone extinct. The fish has been the focus of an intense and improbable federal and tribal effort to restore it to its home waters.
''I was in awe,'' said Mr. Ceccarelli, 32, an engineer from Sparks, Nev., of the speckled trout with hues of olive and rose. 
Early settlers told stories of Pyramid Lake Lahontan cutthroats that weighed more than 60 pounds, though the official world record was a 41-pounder caught by a Paiute man in 1925. The explorer who discovered this electric-blue oasis in 1844, John Fremont, called them ''salmon trout.'' Mark Twain raved about their flavor. Clark Gable, the actor, chased them. President Bill Clinton and tribe members called for their restoration.
''When I heard about them I was like, man, I want to see these guys,'' said Desmond Mitchell, 40, a fish supervisor for the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe.
Lahontan cutthroats, Nevada's state fish, evolved in the Great Basin, which was flooded under a giant inland sea called Lake Lahontan during the last ice age. Pyramid Lake, which today lies on a Paiute Indian reservation, was part of that ancient lake, and inside its unique inland water system, which includes the Truckee River and Lake Tahoe, a giant strain of trout evolved.
''Our fish have deep meaning for us, spiritually,'' said Albert John, executive director of fisheries for the tribe. ''And if they could get to 40 pounds again, whoa, that'd be awesome.''
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, fishermen netted scores of Lahontan cutthroats to feed miners and loggers gnawing at the Sierra Nevada Mountains. But the Truckee River, where the fish spawned, was dammed, and its level dropped as water was taken for irrigation. It was also polluted with chemicals and sawdust. And Lake Tahoe was stocked with a nonnative char called lake trout, which gobble baby cutthroat. By the mid-1940s, all the native trout in Pyramid Lake and Lake Tahoe were dead and the strain was declared extinct.
''They never should have gone in the first place,'' said Fred Crosby, 66, owner of Crosby Lodge, the only bar, restaurant, gas station and tackle shop in tiny Sutcliffe, Nev., a poor reservation town on the west shore of Pyramid Lake.
In the mid-1970s, the Paiute Tribe opened a fish hatchery in Sutcliffe and stocked Pyramid Lake with strains of Lahontan cutthroat from nearby lakes. The water in Pyramid Lake is saltier than Lake Tahoe, and that kept out the lake trout. The tribe re-established a Lahontan cutthroat sport fishery and saved Pyramid Lake's endangered Cui-ui sucker from extinction. Anglers bought tribal licenses, hauled ladders out into the lake's bracing water and considered any catch that weighed 10 pounds or more a trophy.
In the late 1970s, a fish biologist identified what he thought were surviving specimens of the vanished Pyramid Lake strain of Lahontan cutthroat in a small creek near a 10,000-foot mountain on the border of Nevada and Utah called Pilot Peak. A Utah man used buckets to stock the rugged stream with trout in the early 1900s, but made no record, federal biologists say. Geneticists recently compared cutthroats from the Pilot Peak stream with mounts of giant Pyramid Lake trout and discovered an exact DNA match.
''They are the originals,'' said Corene Jones, 39, the broodstock coordinator for the Lahontan National Fish Hatchery in Gardnerville, Nev.
In 1995, United States Fish and Wildlife Service biologists harvested cutthroat eggs from Pilot Peak and brought them to the Gardnerville hatchery, just a few years before a devastating wildfire scorched the mountain and killed off the creek. In 2006 federal officials, in cooperation with the tribe, began stocking Pyramid Lake with what many now call Pilot Peak cutthroats. They waited to see how the fish might readapt to its ancestral home.
The answer came from ecstatic anglers. Late last year, a Reno man caught and released a 24-pounder. David Hamel, 27, of Reno, just did the same with a pair of 20-pound cutthroats.
''Biggest fish of my life,'' he said. ''Amazing.''
Since November, dozens of anglers have reported catching Pilot Peak cutthroats weighing 15 pounds or more. Biologists are astounded because inside Pyramid Lake these powerful fish, now adolescents, grew five times as fast as other trout species and are only a third of the way through their expected life span.
Around this arid reservation of burnt sienna mountains and sagebrush tufts, workers from the gas station clerk in the windblown town of Nixon, Nev., to the bartender who sells fishing licenses in Sutcliffe say they have seen a spike in revenue because of the big fish.
''The lake is basically the bread and butter for the tribe,'' said Elwood Lowery, the tribal chairman. The reservation has no casinos because of competition from nearby Reno, he said.
Biologists and Paiute officials are calling the return of Pyramid Lake's original cutthroats a rare win-win-win for native wildlife restoration, the tribe's economy and anglers.
''The fish is now telling its own story,'' said Lisa Heki, 51, complex manager at the Lahontan National Fish Hatchery. ''Along with the fishermen who get to catch them.''

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Increase 1.5%

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of new homes rose 1.5 percent in March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 417,000, adding to evidence of a sustained housing recovery at the start of the spring buying season. 
The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that sales of new homes exceeded February's pace of 411,000, though they were below January's 445,000 -- the fastest rate since July 2008.
New-home sales are still below the 700,000 pace considered healthy by most economists. But the rate has increased 18.5 percent from 352,000 a year ago.
Most economists see more gains ahead, as housing is likely to remain a consistent driver of economic growth this year.
''With increasing signs of a softer U.S. economy springing up in the spring, we can take comfort in the resilience of the housing recovery,'' said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.
Steady job creation and near-record low mortgage rates are spurring more Americans to buy houses. The rise in demand is helping to raise sales and prices in most markets. Higher prices tend to make homeowners feel wealthier and encourage more spending.
A limited supply of both new and previously occupied homes has also helped lift prices.
The inventory of new homes for sale increased 2 percent in March, to 153,000, the second consecutive gain. Still, that's the equivalent of a 4.4-month supply at the current sales pace and historically lean, according to Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.
The median price of a new home rose to $247,000 in March, 3 percent higher than a year ago.
The March sales gain came from a 20.6 percent increase in the Northeast and a 19.4 percent rise in the South. Sales fell 20.9 percent in the West, where problems of supply have hampered home buying. Sales were down 12.1 percent in the Midwest.
Sales of previously occupied homes dipped in March from February, according to the National Association of Realtors. Still, sales were 10.3 percent higher than a year earlier.
The association cited low supply as a reason sales fell in March. But in a positive sign, the inventory of previously occupied homes increased for the second straight month. That suggests more sellers are confident that the recovery will continue and they can sell at a good price.
Low inventories have helped drive more construction of new homes.
Home builders started work on more than one million new houses and apartments in March at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, the first time the number had crossed that threshold in nearly five years. That reflected a surge in volatile apartment building.
Single-family home construction fell in March after reaching the fastest rate in nearly five years.
Still, a low supply of homes for sale is just one of several constraints that could limit sales. Since the housing bubble burst more than six years ago, banks have imposed tighter credit conditions and required larger down payments. That has made it harder for first-time homebuyers to qualify for the low mortgage rates resulting from the Federal Reserve's efforts to ease credit.

HEADLINE: Petraeus to Join CUNY as Visiting Professor of Public Policy

BYLINE: By ARIEL KAMINER

 BODY:
David H. Petraeus, who resigned as director of the Central Intelligence Agency last November after having an extramarital affair with his biographer, will serve as a visiting professor at the City University of New York next academic year, the university announced on Tuesday. 
Mr. Petraeus, who will be the next visiting professor of public policy at the university's Macaulay Honors College, had been approached by many universities, but settled on CUNY because he admires its diversity of students, locations and offerings, his lawyer, Robert Barnett, said in an interview.
In a statement, Mr. Petraeus said he looked forward to leading a seminar ''that examines the developments that could position the United States -- and our North American partners -- to lead the world out of the current global economic slowdown.''
The idea, Ann Kirschner, dean of Macaulay, said in an interview, ''is an interdisciplinary seminar in keeping with his research interest in energy, advanced manufacturing, life sciences and information technology.''
In addition, she said, he will give talks and meet with students about their research projects. ''We're still figuring out how much time he'll be available to us and how to get him as involved as possible in the life of the college,'' she said. His compensation for the one-year position, which begins in August, is ''still in discussion,'' she said.
Matthew Goldstein, chancellor of the CUNY system, said in a statement that ''with his appointment, our students will have a unique opportunity to learn about public policy firsthand from a distinguished leader with extraordinary experience and expertise in international security issues, intelligence matters and nation-building.''
Mr. Petraeus, a highly decorated four-star general who commanded the coalition forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, is far better known for his accomplishments on foreign battlefields than for his time in classrooms, but he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class at the United States Military Academy, then went on to be the top graduate of the United States Army Command and General Staff College.
He earned a master's degree and a doctorate from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, taught at the United States Military Academy and held a fellowship at Georgetown University. While he was still C.I.A. director, his supporters speculated that he might even be named the next president of Princeton.
Many of his accomplishments were detailed in ''All In: The Education of General David Petraeus,'' the best-selling biography by Paula Broadwell. His personal relationship with her came to light last November, and he resigned shortly afterward.

HEADLINE: A Heartland Without Soul

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
''Expand or die.''
That ominous motto of Henry Whipple, a successful Iowa farmer in Ramin Bahrani's new film, ''At Any Price,'' distills the business philosophy of a man driven by ambition. Henry, who farms more than 3,000 acres, is an aggressive, unscrupulous salesman for a company that markets genetically modified seeds. With a too-wide grin that threatens to crack the corners of his mouth and a backslapping friendliness that verges on obsequiousness, Henry is portrayed by Dennis Quaid as a warped caricature of a reassuring American archetype: the down-to-earth family man in the heartland with his feet firmly planted in the soil.
On one level ''At Any Price'' is a critical exploration of agribusiness and its cutthroat, hypercompetitive ways. On a deeper level it is a searching, somewhat ham-handed allegory of American hubris in the 21st century and a bleak assessment of the country's wobbly moral compass. 
Henry's world is in danger of crumbling. He has a loyal, attractive wife, Irene (Kim Dickens), who tolerates his infidelities. And he has strained relationships with his two sons, the older of whom has signaled his lack of interest in the family business by fleeing the nest to climb mountains in South America.
Desperate for the business to remain in the family, as it has for four generations, Henry pressures his neglected younger son, Dean (Zac Efron), to show some enthusiasm for farming and eventually step into his shoes. But the focus of Dean's life is stock car racing. Though he is a fierce, talented competitor with Nascar dreams of glamour and glory, Dean is also a hothead who unleashes contemptuous tirades at his father. During a race at a regional track, he flies into a blind rage at a competitor. When he is injured in a crash, he abruptly turns his back on the sport.
The movie traces an emotional line of descent from Henry's stern father, Cliff (Red West), who disapproves of his son's lack of ethics, to the volatile Dean. Each generation has less self-control and patience than the one before.
In an unnecessary subplot intended to underline their weaknesses, both father and son avail themselves of the charms of a former cheerleader (Heather Graham). The arrogant, impulsive Dean doesn't even bother to conceal the fling from his smart, pretty girlfriend (Maika Monroe).
''At Any Price'' pays close enough attention to the world of high-tech farming to provide a rough outline of its challenges and stresses. It shows how Henry's breed of go-getter freezes small farmers out of their livelihoods. In an uncomfortable scene that demonstrates his ruthlessness, he crashes another farmer's funeral and buys his land right then and there. The movie addresses the patenting of seeds and their illicit use, a clandestine activity that Henry practices only to find himself under criminal investigation.
''At Any Price'' obliquely refers to the controversies surrounding the ownership of genetically modified superseeds developed by corporations like Monsanto. There is no mention of global warming and the worsening drought in America's breadbasket. Henry's cornfields are picture-perfect and his harvests bountiful.
His major competitor, Jim Johnson (Clancy Brown), is a neighboring farmer with a son Dean's age (Ben Marten), who also races cars and whom Dean hates with a venomous passion. The rivalry between these two clans lends the movie a threatening undertone of violence.
Mr. Bahrani, who wrote the screenplay with Hallie Elizabeth Newton, was born in Winston-Salem, N.C., the setting of his last film, ''Goodbye Solo,'' which was the third of his small, indie, neorealist gems studying people struggling on the lower rungs of the economic ladder.
At the two-thirds point, the movie makes a giant leap of faith with a far-fetched, manipulative plot twist that binds Henry and Dean together, whether they like it or not. This turn of events makes allegorical sense yet defies credibility. But if ''At Any Price'' overstates its points, they are still worth making. And the hot-wired performances by Mr. Quaid and Mr. Efron drive them home in a movie that sticks to your ribs and stays in your head.
''At Any Price'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations, strong language and some violence.
At Any Price
Opens on Wednesday in New York and Los Angeles.

The Kingsbridge Armory towers over the northwest Bronx, a massive empty shell that has long defied redevelopment efforts and haunted generations of city leaders.
Now, this enduring symbol of the Bronx's stalled ambitions has once again become the focus of a campaign to bring much-needed jobs and economic revival to the borough. Standing inside the armory's frosty interior on Tuesday morning, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Bronx officials announced that they had reached an agreement with a developer to transform the city-owned building into what they called the world's largest indoor ice sports center.
The agreement, which still requires the approval of the City Council, calls for the Kingsbridge National Ice Center to open inside the existing armory building in 2018. The 750,000-square-foot center would eventually house nine regulation-size ice rinks for skating and hockey -- including a 5,000-seat arena. (The developer said the current largest ice sports center was in Minnesota.) 
The center is expected to create 267 permanent jobs and 890 temporary construction jobs, according to city officials.
The new center would be paid for entirely with $275 million in private money invested by KNIC Partners, a development group founded by Kevin Parker, a former Wall Street executive. KNIC Partners will pay the city $1 a year to lease the armory, as well as 5 percent of its annual gross revenue, which city officials estimate will be about $1 million. Two years after the project is completed, the developer will be given an option to buy the armory and the land at market price.
''The road wasn't easy, no major development project ever is,'' said Mayor Bloomberg, who was flanked by the former New York Rangers star Mark Messier and the Olympic figure skater Sarah Hughes. ''But the alternative -- not reaching an agreement and allowing this armory to remain empty and stand as a symbol of the abandonment that once plagued the Bronx -- was simply unthinkable.''
The ice center plan is the latest in a series of proposals to redevelop the armory, which was completed in 1917 and was once used for war efforts. The city has spent about $30 million to clean up environmental contamination, replace the roof and repair the building's facade.
In 2000, Rudolph W. Giuliani, then the mayor, proposed turning the armory into an entertainment, sports and retail complex, but that never materialized. In 2009, a proposal to turn the armory into a shopping mall pitted the Bloomberg administration against Bronx officials and residents who feared that it would promote low-paying jobs and compete with local merchants. The collapse of that proposal soured relations between the mayor and the Bronx borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr., and helped set off a citywide campaign for living-wage legislation that was adopted by the City Council over the mayor's veto.
But the ice center is expected to face far less opposition. The mayor said his aides had met repeatedly behind the scenes with Mr. Diaz and other Bronx elected officials to coordinate efforts to redevelop the armory. The city's Economic Development Corporation selected the ice center over five competing proposals, including an artisanal marketplace and a velodrome.
City lobbying records show that KNIC Partners helped build support for the ice center by paying $197,500 to James F. Capalino & Associates to lobby Mr. Diaz, the mayor's office and other officials.
John DeSio, a spokesman for Mr. Diaz, said the ice center did not receive special treatment.
Last week, KNIC Partners won community support for the deal by voluntarily signing an agreement with a coalition representing more than 30 groups in the area. The company promised to pay every worker a living wage, which amounts to at least $10 an hour with benefits or $11.50 an hour without benefits. It also agreed to give a hiring preference to Bronx residents, devote over 50,000-square-feet in the armory for community use, provide opportunities for minority and women-owned businesses and give free ice time to schools in poor neighborhoods.
But some Bronx residents expressed disappointment and skepticism over the armory's planned transformation into an ice center.
''We really need that?'' said James Hunt, 25, a dishwasher who grew up in the neighborhood. ''With all the time they've been taking with this, they should have come up with a better idea than an ice rink.''
Nuria Vazquez, 46, a mother of two boys, compared the planned ice center to a charter school that would shower benefits on those fortunate enough to be chosen. ''It's a drop in the bucket,'' she said. ''You'll have so many people competing for those jobs, it will be like winning a raffle.''

HEADLINE: Barclays Earnings Decline Sharply on Restructuring Costs

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The British bank Barclays said on Wednesday that first-quarter pretax profit dropped 25 percent as it set aside money to pay for a major overhaul of its operations. 

 BODY:
LONDON - The British bank Barclays said on Wednesday that first-quarter pretax profit dropped 25 percent as it set aside money to pay for a major overhaul of its operations.
The bank, which announced earlier this year that it would eliminate 3,800 job as part of the closure of several business units, said its investment banking, wealth management and credit card divisions had continued to generate strong earnings despite renewed uncertainty about the global economy.
 Barclays said pretax profit, when adjusted for one-time charges, fell to £1.8 billion ($2.7 billion) from £2.4 billion in the period a year earlier, missing analysts' estimates. 
Including an accounting charge of £251 million on the value of its own debt, Barclays posted a first-quarter profit of £1.5 billion; the bank reported a £525 million loss in the period a year earlier. 
The bank said it had incurred charges in the first quarter of £514 million connected with its restructuring plans, and expected to spend an additional £500 million this year as part of the overhaul.
"While there remains much to do to build a stronger and more resilient Barclays, we are completely focused on executing our transform program and are making good early progress," Antony P. Jenkins, the chief executive, said in a statement.
Shares in Barclays fell less than 1 percent in early morning trading in London on Wednesday.
Barclays has been in flux since it agreed to a $450 million settlement with American and British authorities in June after some of its traders were found to have manipulated global benchmark interest rates for financial gain.
The bank's former chief executive, Robert E. Diamond Jr., stepped down in the aftermath of the rate-rigging scandal, while one of his top lieutenants, Rich Ricci, who headed the investment bank, resigned last week.
The investment bank continued to generate the bulk of the overall pretax profit. That division benefited from a strong first quarter, as global equities markets rebounded and on strong deal activity in the United States. Barclays, for example, is advising Dish Network on its $25.5 billion takeover offer for Sprint Nextel.
Earnings from the firm's trading, advisory and other investment banking services increased 11 percent, to £1.3 billion, or roughly 74 percent of the bank's combined pretax profit. The unit's compensation ratio fell to 41 percent from 43 percent in the period a year earlier.
Pretax earnings from the bank's retail division totaled £299 million, a 28.8 percent increase from the period a year earlier. The firm's wealth management unit also reported a 20 percent increase in its pretax profit, to £60 million, over the same period, according to a company statement.
Like other British banks, Barclays has come under increasing pressure from local regulators to increase capital reserves to protect against financial shocks.
The bank's core Tier 1 ratio, a measure of its ability to weather financial crises, stood at 8.4 percent in the first quarter, a slight increase from the previous quarter, based on accounting rules known as Basel III.
In a bid to increase its capital position, Barclays announced plans last month to buy back up to $1 billion of its debt in a complex deal to improve its funding reserves. The bank has also sold $1 billion of contingent capital, a financial instrument that offers investors a yearly return, but is wiped out if the bank's core Tier 1 ratio falls below a certain limit.
Since becoming chief executive of Barclays last year, Mr. Jenkins has been faced with the challenge of improving the bank's reputation. 
The firm has been required to hand over billions of dollars after it inappropriately sold complex financial products to consumers. Barclays also continues to be under investigation by American and British regulators over payments connected to a group of Qatari investors that provided the bank a cash infusion during the financial crisis. 
In a conference call with reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Jenkins said the bank had not made further provisions in connection with the rate-rigging scandal.
Mr. Jenkins said earlier this year the he would forgo his 2012 bonus, estimated to be worth up to $4.3 million, though he was given deferred share options worth around $8 million last month.

HIGHLIGHT: Fiat may be looking to buy the rest of Chrysler, and more than 500 unclaimed Hurricane Sandy-damaged cars are up for auction next month. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 According to a report Tuesday by Reuters, Fiat appears to be hunting for money to finance a buyout of the 41.5 percent of Chrysler it doesn't own. Talks with financiers may conclude next month, and a deal with the United Auto Workers retiree health care trust, which currently owns the rest of Chrysler, could made by July. Sergio Marchionne, Fiat's chief executive, said that fully merging Chrysler and Fiat could give Fiat cash to offset some of its European losses as well as make Fiat the world's seventh-largest auto group. Analysts estimate that the 41.5 percent share of Chrysler is worth about $4 billion. (Automotive News) 
 More than 500 unclaimed vehicles are up for auction on May 2 and May 7; while mostly flood-damaged, the offerings include some salvageable automotive survivors from Hurricane Sandy. Of more than 3,300 vehicles towed from emergency routes and removed from haphazard locations around New York City after the storm, the leftovers will be sold through the David R. Maltz auction house on Long Island. By law, car owners have up to 10 days to claim a car that's been determined to be abandoned, but city officials said they would work with people whose cars are about to go to auction. The auction house will get 10 percent from the sales, and the rest will go to the city. (The New York Post)
 A Mazda 6 became the first diesel-powered Grand-Am winner over the weekend, taking the checkered flag at the Rolex Grand-Am GX race at Road Atlanta. Based upon the most up-to-date Mazda 6 model, both the first- and third-place cars - the No. 00 Visit Florida Racing Mazda 6 and the No. 70 SpeedSource Mazda 6 - competed with production-based Skyactiv-D Clean Diesel engines.

 As car sales climb in India and China, auto buyers in the two countries are becoming increasingly attracted to larger cars. In India, carmakers foreign and domestic are facing a drop in demand for small, inexpensive, entry-level cars and more of a market for premium compact sedans and hatchbacks. Chinese car buyers are now scooping up more S.U.V.s, crossovers and luxury sedans, driving up the price China pays for imported oil and raising concerns about worsening air pollution.

 The City of Los Angeles announced its acceptance as a host city for the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile Formula E electric car race series Monday, which was also Earth Day. Routes for the race are still undecided, but the series is expected to commence in 2014. City officials said in a release that Los Angeles was chosen because it already has a growing electric vehicle infrastructure in place, including 121 public charging stations and a streamlined permitting process for the home electrical system upgrades needed for some chargers. Some of the other cities chosen to host races on the Formula E Championship circuit are Miami, London, Rome, Beijing, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janiero and Putrajaya, Malaysia. Two additional locations will be announced later. (The City of Los Angeles)

HEADLINE: The Future of Driving

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Driverless vehicles should increase human productivity but will also increase the number of cars on the road, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
Driverless vehicles would be a windfall for households and businesses that acquire them but would probably increase traffic and nationwide fuel usage.
Google and other innovators are working on vehicles that someday might drive themselves with little or no attention from human passengers. The vehicles of the future will have fast, observant computers that automatically communicate position and road conditions with other vehicles on the road.
Driverless vehicles are expected to help children, the blind, the elderly and others who currently cannot safely drive themselves. Helped by their huge amounts of data and computing power, driverless cars are also purported to reduce traffic congestion and nationwide fuel consumption by driving smarter.
But smarter driving will lead to more driving, because smarter driving reduces the cost per mile of vehicle usage. The end result of additional driving could be more traffic and more aggregate fuel consumption.
These days, a driver has three main costs of the trip to consider: fuel consumption, vehicle wear and tear, and time and attention devoted to driving that could be for something else. (Drivers also need to consider other costs of vehicle ownership, such as the purchase price and the cost of insuring the vehicle.)

Fuel and wear and tear cost roughly 50 cents a mile, which is why employers reimburse employees for job-related personal vehicle usage at about that rate. At an average speed of 30 miles an hour (including stops, traffic conditions and so on), each mile takes two minutes of driver time. For those who value their time at more than $15 an hour, the time cost of the trip exceeds the combined fuel and wear and tear costs.
Research has shown that cutting travel costs through reduced gas prices causes people to drive more, for example by eschewing carpools and public transportation. A driverless car should also cause people to use their vehicles for more miles, because they could use their time in the car to sleep, work, watch television, read a book and do other things they might normally do at home.
Households and business may also begin to use vehicles with no human passengers or drivers in order to move goods from one place to another and, by economizing on the human driver costs, they may want to move more goods than they do today.
As people take on additional activities in their personal vehicles, they may also demand larger vehicles that necessarily require more fuel per mile.
Before driverless cars are adopted, a number of hurdles must be cleared. Some refinements in vehicle technology need to be resolved; insurance companies and state regulators must also figure out liability issues. 
Even if driverless vehicles led to more congestion and more aggregate fuel consumption, driverless vehicles would be a welcome technological advance, because the billions of hours that people already devote to driving could be put to alternative uses. 
But expect new driving technologies to increase the number of vehicles on the road.

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The S.E.C.&#8217;s whistle-blower program faces challenges on several fronts. | Apple will more than double its program to return cash to shareholders. | The hedge fund manager Marc Lasry will not be moving to the United States ambassador&#8217;s mansion in Paris. | The S.E.C. has been flooded with calls to require publicly traded corporations to disclose political donations. 

 BODY:
The use of whistle-blowers at the Securities and Exchange Commission has proved effective. A tipster bolstered an investigation into a trading blowup that almost took down Knight Capital; another aided the discovery that Oppenheimer & Company had overstated the performance of a private equity fund; and a whistle-blower helped the government pursue a Ponzi scheme in Texas, Ben Protess and Nathaniel Popper report in DealBook.
But the S.E.C.'s 20-month-old whistle-blower program faces challenges on several fronts. "Some Wall Street firms are urging employees to report wrongdoing internally before running to the government, and one hedge fund, Paradigm Capital Management, was accused in a lawsuit of punishing an employee who had cooperated with the S.E.C., according to court and internal documents," DealBook writes. "Another financial firm, the documents show, pressured an employee to forfeit potential 'bounties or awards' - a possible violation of S.E.C. rules." 
Some lawyers say the S.E.C. takes weeks or months before it responds to a backlog of tips. Still, the agency, which fields dozens of tips a week, has ramped up the whistle-blower team to include 11 lawyers and three paralegals. "You'd be hard pressed to find another whistle-blower program that's quicker," said Sean McKessy, the director of the program. One longtime critic of the S.E.C., Harry M. Markopolos, a securities analyst who suspected the Madoff fraud a decade ago, said: "The question is whether they can turn it into successful enforcement actions."
APPLE'S PLAN TO REWARD SHAREHOLDERS | Apple on Tuesday announced that it would more than double its program to return cash to shareholders through stock buybacks and a higher dividend, with plans to spend $100 billion on the effort through the end of 2015, The New York Times reports. The company said its share repurchase plan, which will increase to $60 billion from the $10 billion it committed previously, was the largest in history. Apple also plans to raise its dividend by 15 percent and pay out $3.05 a share.
The announcement came as Apple reported its first profit decline in a decade. The company's stock, which has been on declining path for months, rose slightly in trading after hours. The effect of the payout to shareholders "may be mitigated pretty quickly" by the company's cash flow, DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced notes.
It was not exactly what the hedge fund manager David Einhorn had been pushing for. But Mr. Einhorn, who runs Greenlight Capital, was nevertheless pleased. He said in a statement: "We applaud Apple's decision to borrow money and return excess capital to shareholders, an idea that was off the table only months ago."
LASRY TO STAY AT AVENUE CAPITAL | The billionaire hedge fund manager Marc Lasry will not be moving to the ambassador's mansion in Paris. Mr. Lasry, the chief executive and chairman of Avenue Capital, told his investors in a letter on Tuesday that he would remain at the hedge fund, ending speculation that President Obama was considering him for the role of ambassador to France. The investor had been a prominent supporter of Mr. Obama during the presidential campaign. "I am very grateful to have been considered," Mr. Lasry said in the letter, which was obtained by DealBook. "I would like to put the speculation to rest and let you know that I will be remaining at Avenue." Mr. Lasry is considered a "key man" in documents for a number of Avenue's funds, according to a person briefed on the matter. A waiver of that provision would have been required for him to assume a new job, and it was becoming clear that not all investors would grant such a waiver, this person said.
ON THE AGENDA | Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group is on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" to discuss his scholarship for study at a Chinese university. Sprint Nextel, which recently received a $25.5 billion takeover offer from Dish Network, reports earnings before the market opens. Zynga reports earnings on Wednesday evening. Senator David Vitter is on Bloomberg TV at 8:15 a.m. Sallie L. Krawcheck, a former executive for both Bank of America and Citigroup, is on CNBC at 10 a.m.
AUSTERITY FUN | Stephen Colbert on Tuesday hosted Thomas Herndon, the graduate student at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who found apparent errors in the work of the Harvard economists Kenneth S. Rogoff and Carmen M. Reinhart, whose research was often cited to justify austerity policies. Or, as Mr. Colbert put it on his show, Mr. Herndon discovered "a few simple spreadsheet errors, and a couple of little staggering omissions that made it slightly fundamentally wrong. Even worse, none of their pie charts contained real pie."
ERRANT TWITTER MESSAGE MOVES STOCKS | The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 150 points after the The Associated Press sent out an erroneous Twitter message, the result of a hack, reporting explosions at the White House that injured President Obama. Stocks soon recovered when it became clear there had been no incident.
SUPPORT FOR FORCING DISCLOSURES OF DONATIONS | "A loose coalition of Democratic elected officials, shareholder activists and pension funds has flooded the Securities and Exchange Commission with calls to require publicly traded corporations to disclose to shareholders all of their political donations, a move that could transform the growing world of secret campaign spending," Nicholas Confessore writes in The New York Times. "S.E.C. officials have indicated that they could propose a new disclosure rule by the end of April, setting up a major battle with business groups that oppose the proposal and are preparing for a fierce counterattack if the agency's staff moves ahead."

HEADLINE: Made in America. Craved Everywhere Else.

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The newly designed $100 bill is finally about to start circulating, and it is likely to be especially popular abroad. 

 BODY:
It is one of our largest exports, a product made in America from start to finish and craved by businesses and consumers around the world. And the latest edition will be released in October. We speak, of course, about the $100 bill. 
The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it is finally ready to introduce a new design after nearly three years of delays because of printing problems and other issues.
You can see a picture here. Resist the urge to print copies in color.
It may seem odd that the world continues to crave paper. Americans are using fewer bills of all denominations. But as I wrote in 2011, "For two decades, since the fall of the Soviet Union, demand has exploded for the $100 bill, which is hoarded like gold in unstable places. Last year Treasury printed more $100 bills than dollar bills for the first time. There are now more than seven billion pictures of Benjamin Franklin in circulation - and the Federal Reserve's best guess is that two-thirds are held by foreigners. American soldiers searching one of Saddam Hussein's palaces in 2003 found about $650 million in fresh $100 bills."
This is great for the United States. "It's like borrowing money from foreigners that most likely will never have to be paid back, at zero interest," the economist Bruce Bartlett wrote earlier this month.
And the product cannot be made more cheaply in China, or anywhere else. 
There is, however, a lively market in knock-offs.

HEADLINE: In Gas-Drilling Fight, Opposites Attract, and Distract

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Filmmakers with clashing views of fracking almost meet up at the Tribeca Film Festival. 

 BODY:
There are passionate and well-meaning people arrayed all around the issues surrounding America's enormous shale-gas resource and the communities on the surface above it. I've met landowners and residents and scientists in Pennsylvania and upstate New York with powerfully articulated positions against and for drilling using hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. 
And then there are the filmmakers. First there was Josh Fox, who rose to prominence in 2010 with "Gasland," a potent attack on fracking, and who unveiled "Gasland Part Two" at the Tribeca Film Festival on Sunday (read an IndieWire interview and film review).
This year saw "Frack Nation," a rebuttal to "Gasland" from Phelim McAleer, a provocative filmmaker with a libertarian bent who shares Fox's penchant for stunts and histrionics. (For an example, see McAleer's hijacking of a question-and-answer session with former Vice President Al Gore at a 2009 journalism conference.)
At the premiere of the Fox's antifracking sequel on Sunday, a batch of ticket holders - mostly landowners from the Marcellus shale region who support gas drilling, but including McAleer - was blocked from entering the theater (see the Artsbeat blog post for Tribeca's dubious explanation). 
I feel bad for the blocked residents of the country's gas lands. Here's video shot by McAleer of the excluded attendees complaining to security. 
I'd like to think that there might have been a chance for an open discussion of the economic and environmental realities in shale-gas country if the tickets had been honored. A set of YouTube videos of the question session after the screening (1, 2, 3) depicts a big group hug, in essence, between the audience and film team.
But given McAleer's track record, the chances for a productive conversation if the pro-fracking group had been allowed in were low.
Still, proper ground rules for post-screening discussions could have limited the chances of disruption and allowed at least a taste of the real divisions in such regions as residents (and elected officials) consider a diverse set of risks and opportunities.
The two films at least provide a great teachable pairing for my communication students at Pace University.
There's more from me in my Tumblr post Monday.

HEADLINE: Caesars Blinds Market With Science

BYLINE: JEFFREY GOLDFARB


HIGHLIGHT: The private equity owners behind Caesars Entertainment have been working overtime in their financial laboratory,the author says. 

 BODY:
The private equity owners behind Caesars Entertainment have been working overtime in their financial laboratory. Apollo Global Management and TPG are following last year's microscopic initial public offering with a spinoff and rights issue concoction. Aiming to raise $1.2 billion, the complex transaction mostly seems designed to buy still more time for the ailing $31 billion leveraged buyout. 
The casino empire may be out of textbook solutions. Shortly after going private in 2006, Caesars rejigged itself several times in a bid to reduce leverage. But it couldn't keep pace with the Great Recession, which took a toll on Las Vegas. An I.P.O. attempt in 2010 faltered. A subsequent effort in 2012 sold less than 1.5 percent of the shares and raised only about $20 million.
Things haven't much improved for Caesars. Last year, net revenue tumbled 4 percent, swinging the company to an operating loss. And $2.1 billion of interest payments on $24 billion of debt exceeded the company's adjusted Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Investment must be constrained. Moody's last month cut the corporate family credit rating to Caa2, narrowly above default.
Hence the convoluted experiment laid out on Tuesday. Caesars is creating Caesars Growth Partners and giving its shareholders the right to buy a piece of the new vehicle through a holding company. Apollo and TPG are kicking in $250 million apiece. Caesars is contributing its Internet operations, handing off about $1.1 billion in debt, and selling the new unit a stake in a casino being developed in Baltimore and the Planet Hollywood in Sin City. Caesars will retain a big economic interest in Growth Partners. In three years, it will have the option to buy back voting control and, after five years, it can liquidate the business.
For all the intricacies, the plan hardly makes Caesars any more the master of its fate. It's also a precarious time to value the online division given the uncertainty surrounding U.S. Internet gambling law. Investors nevertheless sent Caesars shares up by more than a quarter on Tuesday. With the $2 billion company still mostly owned by the two buyout firms and their co-investors, who originally put in $6 billion in equity, the few public shareholders may have been blinded by science.

HEADLINE: Test Your Economic Literacy

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Some sample questions (and answers) from tests on economic fundamentals for high-school seniors, a group whose performance changed little from 2006 to 2012. 

 BODY:
The Department of Education Wednesday released its latest report on the economic proficiency of 12th graders, based on the test scores of nearly 11,000 students tested in 2012. It found little change in average economic literacy compared to test scores from 2006, although students in the lower part of the score distribution (at the 10th and 25th percentiles) made gains. 
In case you want to know how you would stack up against these students, here are some sample questions from the report, followed by the answers.
1. Suppose that the price of grapes increases by a large amount. What will happen in the short term to the quantity of grapes demanded? Explain why.
2. Which of the following best describes an opportunity cost for a student who chooses to quit a full-time job to go to college?
A) Paying state and federal income tax
B) Having a higher level of education
C) Giving up current wages and benefits
D) Paying for housing and meals
3. Which of the following changes is most likely to cause an increase in employment?
A) An increase in consumer spending
B) An increase in interest rates
C) A decrease in business investment
D) A decrease in income 
4. A high rate of unemployment that lasts for several years has economic costs for a nation. What are two of these economic costs?
5. a. Explain why United States steel manufacturers would support a tariff on imported steel.
b. Explain why United States steel workers would support a tariff on imported steel.
c. Explain why United States consumers would be hurt by a tariff on imported steel.
d. Explain why a steel tariff might be adopted even if it hurts United States consumers.
6. Which of the following is one way in which economic growth can help a nation reduce its poverty level and increase its standard of living?
A) Economic growth increases the demand for imports, thereby raising the demand for foreign exchange.
B) Economic growth increases the supply of labor, thereby increasing wages.
C) Economic growth increases disposable income, thereby raising the demand for luxury items.
D) Economic growth increases the demand for labor, thereby raising income levels.

HEADLINE: In Israel, O'Malley Talks Jobs, Foreign Policy and, of Course, 2016

BYLINE: JODI RUDOREN


HIGHLIGHT: Maryland Gov. Martin O&#8217;Malley said Wednesday that he would spend the second half of this year mulling whether to run for president in 2016. He seems already to have a campaign theme: jobs and innovation. 

 BODY:
JERUSALEM - Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland said Wednesday that he would spend the second half of this year mulling whether to run for president in 2016. He seems already to have a campaign theme: jobs and innovation.
At least that's what he insisted was the sole focus of his eight-day trip to Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian territories, and pretty much all he wanted to talk about with a handful of reporters he had summoned to the King David Hotel for coffee. "I'm sure all of you will ask me foreign policy questions," he said as he opened the floor. "I respect your right to ask them, and I hope you'll respect my right to shy away from answering them." 
And so, on the news of the day - apparent differences between the Obama administration and the Israeli military on whether chemical weapons had been deployed by the Syrian military - Mr. O'Malley, a Democrat, deferred to the president's judgment. "It's certainly one of the great challenges," he allowed.
Asked whether the American people, weary from a decade of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, would be ready to engage in another military operation to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, Mr. O'Malley avoided specifics. "I believe that the president will make that call," he said, "and the president will have the primary responsibility of making that case to the American people and also to Congress."
How about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? "All of us hope for peace in the Middle East." 
Governor O'Malley, 50, said it was his third visit to Israel, and that he had brought with him about 50 high-tech executives, Jewish leaders, and Maryland officials for what is essentially a trade mission. After a side trip to Jordan in which he met with Prince Faisal - "What we spoke about was the huge challenge that the ongoing conflict in Syria has for the entire region" - much of his itinerary here is filled with companies that have offices in his home state, including one that makes radar for the vaunted Iron Dome missile defense system.
Mr. O'Malley was also set to meet with President Shimon Peres of Israel; two rising stars in Israeli politics, Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid, both of whom head economic ministries; and Salaam Fayyad, who resigned earlier this month as prime minister of the Palestinian Authority. (Scheduling with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was still being worked out.)
"I'm hoping in discussions with him to learn," Mr. O'Malley said of Mr. Fayyad. "That's part of the obligation that goes along with travel."
The visit comes two months after Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Republican similarly put forth as a potential 2016 candidate, made headlines during his own trip here by referring to Jerusalem as its capital, a point of contention with the Palestinians. Might he face off against Governor O'Malley?
"I plan for the latter half of this year to dedicate some more thought time, reflection time, to the question of whether or not I would run," he said Tuesday. "The key question in running for any office is having a clear and refined understanding of the shared reality we face and the better set of choices we need to make as a people to meet those challenges and to create a better future for our kids."
For the latter half of this week, Mr. O'Malley plans to tour the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum, the Western Wall and the Old City, and attend Mass at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem with his 15-year-old son, one of four O'Malley children who attend Catholic schools, as their father did.
A reporter pointed out that on his way into Bethlehem, he would see the controversial separation barrier Israel has erected in the West Bank. Mr. O'Malley said he had seen something similar in Northern Ireland. "They call it the peace wall," he noted.

HEADLINE: How Do You Find the Best Green Cars?

BYLINE: CHERYL JENSEN


HIGHLIGHT: With more energy efficient car options available than ever before, the number choices can be daunting. Here&#8217;s where two green car rating agencies&#8217; picks coincided. 

 BODY:
Spring is in the air, and Earth Day is just behind us. Apparently, that means it's green car choosing season, at least for the people who take the time to determine such things. But with the list of more environmentally friendly cars and trucks at an all-time high, choosing the best one can be tough.
Kelley Blue Book and the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy tried to make the choice simple by doing the choosing for consumers. Four vehicles made Kelley Blue Book's 10 Best Green Cars of 2013 list and the council's Greenest Vehicles of 2013 list. 
Kelley Blue Book and its online arm, KBB.com, which published the study, rates the values of new and used vehicles, and the council is a Washington-based nonprofit financed by foundations, electric utilities and state and federal agencies. Both companies use different methods to calculate a vehicle's green credentials, so it isn't surprising that only four vehicles showed up on both lists.
Here's a summary of what KBB.com editors said about the four 2013 models that were on both lists:
 Ford Focus Electric 
With Ford's four-door hatchback as its foundation, the Focus Electric starts with a leg up. Toss in some cool features and an advanced powertrain that pairs a 107-kilowatt electric motor with a liquid-cooled lithium-ion battery and the result is a fun, practical runabout.
 Honda Fit EV 
The Fit EV shares most interior and exterior bits with its gas-powered counterpart. Though only 1,100 units will be produced, the lease-only Fit EV impresses as one of the most powerful and energy-efficient electric vehicles available.
 Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid 
With a combined fuel economy rating of 50 miles per gallon, it's hard to believe that anything can top the Toyota Prius. Enter the Prius Plug-in, which adds 11 miles of all-electric driving.
 Volkswagen Jetta Hybrid 
The first gas-electric Jetta is a fun-to-drive European sedan that returns 45 combined m.p.g. and starts under $26,000. The Jetta Hybrid is a triple threat that lets you go green and have fun.
Ford's C-Max was on both lists as well, but each organization chose a different version of the car. The C-Max Energi (a plug-in hybrid) was on the KBB.com list, and the regular C-Max hybrid was on the council's list.
In an e-mail, KBB.com said it made its choices for their "standout mix of efficiency, range, innovation, affordability and overall appeal, as judged by the KBB.com editors." The Nissan Leaf took the No. 1 slot "based in large part on its affordability," while the premium-priced Tesla Model S came in second "on the strength of its desirability, surprising refinement and the longest range of any all-electric."
The council's method seems more scientific and holistic. It considers the emissions associated with a vehicle's full life cycle - from manufacturing to disposal - and the fuel it uses, whether gasoline or electricity. The final calculation includes emissions from electricity generation used to recharge electric vehicle batteries as well as emissions involved in transporting petroleum.
All the vehicles on the KBB.com list are either hybrids, full electrics or plug-in hybrids. On the council's list, the only nonhybrid and nonplug-in vehicles were the Scion IQ and Smart Fortwo (convertible and coupe).

HEADLINE: The Bad Economy Behind the Health Care Slowdown

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: A new study from the Kaiser Family Foundation helps sort out how much of the recent moderation in health care costs is related to causes other than the economy. 

 BODY:
In today's paper, I took a look at a major innovation in health care delivery, one that Obama administration officials think might play a big role in holding down health costs in the future. It is called accountable care, and the general idea is to enlist doctors and nurses in the fight to control spending. 
But how much have such shifts away from fee-for-service medicine already contributed to the big slowdown in health care costs? 
That has been one of the biggest puzzles in health economics - indeed, in all of public economics - in the last few years. Policy makers broadly consider rising health costs to be the single biggest long-term budget challenge, and those same rising costs are eating away at workers' wages. Economists figured that Americans would spend less on health care because of the deep recession and sluggish recovery. But health costs have slowed even more than they expected given the size of the downturn, leading many to surmise that other factors were at work. 
A new study from the Kaiser Family Foundation helps sort out definitively what is the bad economy and what is not. All in all, Kaiser estimates that 77 percent of the cost slowdown is due to the recession, with the remaining quarter due to "continuing changes in the way health care is delivered, but also to rising levels of patient cost-sharing in private insurance plans that discourage use of services." 
A quarter might not seem like much, but in an interview, Drew Altman, the president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, described it as "the whole ballgame" for holding down costs as time goes on. "It's more than just the A.C.A. reforms, those are just beginning," he said, referring to the Affordable Care Act. "But in the long run, those are the most important ones, because they have the force of Medicare and national policy behind them." 
He expects that higher co-payments and deductibles - cases in which an insured person needs to pay more for health care out of pocket - will have a major, underappreciated role in holding down costs in the future, too. "It's this quiet revolution in insurance," he said. 
In the last few years, accountable care organizations have represented a little revolution of their own, moving from being a mere idea to covering millions of Medicare and privately insured patients. 
The one I profiled works like this: Advocate Health Care, a major health system in the Chicago area, struck a deal with the insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois. The two jointly picked about 380,000 people who were insured by Blue Cross and used Advocate's doctors or hospitals. They then projected their expected health costs. If Advocate can keep costs below that amount, the insurer and the provider split the savings. If it cannot, its revenue is at risk. 
That gives Advocate a huge financial incentive to prevent illness, reduce complication rates and cut out unnecessary procedures and tests, all while keeping those 380,000 people coming back to Advocate doctors. And it makes the most expensive patients, often those with multiple chronic conditions, like diabetes and heart disease, centers for cost savings. 
Thus far, the experiment seems to be working. Advocate has started initiatives to prevent asthma attacks, end elective inductions of labor before 39 weeks of pregnancy and reduce readmissions to the hospital after a patient is discharged, among others. Those changes have resulted in a cost reduction of about 2 percent over all. 
Many other health systems have made more incremental steps toward what health economists like to call value-based care, such as accepting bundled payments for a patient's course of treatment, rather than charging an insurer per procedure. Medicare and Medicaid have also been pioneers in paying for quality, not quantity. For instance, Medicare recently instituted a policy of penalizing hospitals when patients are readmitted after being discharged. Hospitals might not like it. But there are signs it is squeezing spending out of the system. 
Indeed, in a recent interview, Secretary Kathleen Sebelius of the Department of Health and Human Services cited falling readmission rates as one of the strongest early signs that the Affordable Care Act is working to bend the health care cost curve.

HEADLINE: Stepping In for Mayoral Candidates, Surrogates Are Left Out of a Debate

BYLINE: STEPHEN FARRELL


HIGHLIGHT: Candidates are calling on surrogates to have a presence at the increasingly frequent mayoral forms being held across the city. But that tactic backfired Wednesday. 

 BODY:
As latecomers slipped into their seats on Wednesday for an early morning mayoral debate on housing development, they could have been forgiven for feeling a bit confused. 
The Race for City HallOn display were photographs of the four advertised speakers, including Joseph J. Lhota, a 58-year-old Republican candidate with a graying sandy beard and what nobody could describe as a full head of hair. 
But standing near his photo was a clean-shaven young man wearing a badge saying "Joe Lhota, New York City M.T.A. Chairman, Speaker" who was less than half Mr. Lhota's age and sported thick, dark hair with spectacles and a pinstriped suit. Needless to say he was not Joe Lhota and he had not been the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
A few minutes earlier, in exactly the same spot, had been standing another man who wasn't who his name tag said he was. This man wasn't John A. Catsimatidis, the Greek-born billionaire who owns the Gristedes grocery chain and is also a Republican candidate for mayor. 
Enter the "surrogates," a new and perhaps short-lived feature of the increasingly frequent mayoral forums being held across New York, sometimes twice a day. 
Such is the profusion of these debates that busy Democratic and Republican candidates find themselves racing from borough to borough, juggling time, priorities and campaign resources as they compete for votes ahead of the election in November.
Hence the appeal of seconding someone else if you can't be in two places at once. However, that tactic backfired on Wednesday, when neither of the surrogates was permitted to address a forum organized by the Associated Builders and Owners of Greater New York, a trade association of the real estate industry.
"We had confirmations up until yesterday morning from four of the candidates who were going to be here," said Dan Margulies, the association's executive director and moderator of the forum that was held at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. "Last evening Mr. Lhota and Mr. Catsimatidis found a conflict and are not going to join us in person. However they did send, or are sending, surrogates. It was decided that it was not appropriate for the surrogates to speak on the platform with the candidates who had the courtesy to keep their commitments."
Even after the audience began filing in, name cards for Mr. Lhota and Mr. Catsimatidis were still on display, but were soon removed. This left the stage free for the two candidates who had shown up: George T. McDonald, an advocate for the homeless who is seeking the Republican nomination, and Adolfo Carrión Jr., an Independence Party candidate and a former Bronx borough president.
Both said they had arrived at the Javits Convention Center that morning expecting to be part of a foursome. "I've not seen surrogates in any of the debates," Mr. Carrión said after the debate. "The hosts made the decision; I think they made the right decision." 
Mr. McDonald said: "I thought that they were going to be here. It's a little insulting to send surrogates at the last minute to say you can't make it."
Watching from the sidelines were Mr. Lhota's replacement, Eric Ulrich, a member of the City Council and a Republican who sits on the Council's housing and buildings committee. In his place, Mr. Catsimatidis had sent Daniel W. Isaacs, the chairman of the New York Republican County Committee. Some audience members said they were "disappointed" at the absences, but one said he understood that candidates had to "pick and choose", and others seemed unclear anyway about who had and hadn't been scheduled to appear.
A spokesman for the Catsimatidis campaign said that the candidate did not mean to offend an industry in which he invests heavily as a real estate developer and builder, but explained that the candidate had to be at another mayoral forum on Staten Island. 
"The main reason he went to that as opposed to this is that's where the Republicans are," the spokesman, Robert H. Ryan, said. "They're in Staten Island, and that's what we have to focus on right now, getting as many Republican votes as possible. Look, there is only so much time in the day, and every group that you can imagine, and some that you can't imagine, are having forums. And a lot of times one comes up after the other. It's not an act of disrespect towards anybody; it's just he can't possibly make everything, so he has to pick and choose what is the best thing for the campaign."
Jessica Proud, a spokeswoman for Mr. Lhota's campaign, said that he had also attended the Staten Island forum, but that he later traveled to the Javits Center and "met and spoke directly with many of the business owners there." She said that as the campaign intensified, "there are going to be a lot of conflicts with the volume of forums that the candidates are being asked to attend, so if we are able to use a surrogate in a case where we can't be in two places at once, we are happy to do that."

HEADLINE: Barclays and Credit Suisse Post Strong Earnings in Investment Banks

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT and JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: A strong performance comes despite a push by European politicians to limit firms&#8217; exposure to financial risks and to promote lending to local economies. 

 BODY:
LONDON - As European policy makers push financial institutions to cut back on their risky trading activity, some of the region's largest banks are becoming more reliant on their investment banking operations to bolster performance.
On Wednesday, the British bank Barclays and a Swiss rival, Credit Suisse, both reported strong first-quarter earnings for their investment banks that helped to offset some sluggish growth in other divisions like retail banking and wealth management.
 The healthy performance comes despite a push by European politicians to limit firms' exposure to financial risks and to promote lending to local economies. 
New tougher capital requirements have forced European banks to shed billions of dollars of assets since the financial crisis began. A proposed cap on banker bonuses that will become effective at European institutions next year has led to fears of a mass exodus of firms' top earners to international competitors.
The two banks' first-quarter earnings reflected the strength of investment banking.
Barclays' quarterly pretax profit for its investment bank rose 11 percent, to £1.3 billion, or $2 billion, or roughly 74 percent of the company's combined pretax profit over the period.
Over all, Barclays' quarterly profit, when adjusted for one-time charges, was £1.8 billion, down 25 percent from the same period last year, which missed analysts' estimates. The fall was linked to £514 million ($784 million) of costs related to a restructuring that includes 3,800 layoffs and a £235 million ($359 million) charge connected to the value of the bank's debt.
Barclays' investment bank benefited from renewed deal activity and a bullish stock market performance in the United States, where it now generates around 50 percent of its revenue. For example, the bank is advising Dish Network on its proposed $25.5 billion takeover of Sprint Nextel. "The reality is that investment banking is becoming more dominant for Barclays," said Ian Gordon, a banking analyst at Investec in London. "The first quarter was a blowout performance."
At Credit Suisse, pretax profit in its investment banking division rose 43 percent, to 1.3 billion Swiss francs, or $1.4 billion, partly driven by a strong performance in the bank's fixed-income sales and trading business. In contrast, earnings from the company's private banking and wealth management business fell 7 percent, to 881 million francs, over the same period.
Credit Suisse reported a net profit of 1.3 billion francs ($1.4 billion) in the first quarter, compared with a profit of 44 million francs ($47 million) in the same period last year, when the bank booked a loss of 1.6 billion francs ($1.7 billion) on the value of its own outstanding debt.
Analysts said the bank's strong earnings were a result of a cost-cutting program started by the chief executive, Brady W. Dougan. The company's investment banking division also benefited from a pickup in global stock markets in the first three months of the year.
"The investment bank was the main driver with impressive cost management," Kian Abouhossein, a banking analyst at JPMorgan Chase in London, said in a research note to investors.
Shares in Barclays fell 1.3 percent in London on Wednesday, while Credit Suisse's stock price rose 1.5 percent in Zurich.
Attention will now turn to other large European banks that will report their first-quarter earnings over the next few weeks.
Deutsche Bank, the largest bank in Germany and one with a major investment banking division, will announce its results on Tuesday, as will the Swiss banking giant UBS. Analysts are expecting a fall in UBS's first-quarter net profit as the company continues to carry out sharp reduction in its investment bank, which includes around 10,000 job cuts, to focus on its wealth management business.
The continued reliance on investment banking at some of Europe's largest institutions follows efforts by politicians and top banking executives to reshape the Continent's financial sector.
Some banks, like UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland, are reducing their exposure to risky trading assets, while others, like HSBC and Standard Chartered, are increasing their operations in fast-growing emerging markets.
Antony P. Jenkins, Barclays' chief executive, also is trying to rehabilitate the company's image after a series of recent scandals. Last year, the bank agreed to a $450 million settlement with the United States and British authorities after some of its traders were found to have manipulated crucial global benchmark rates for financial gains.

HEADLINE: Down Payment Rules Are at Heart of Mortgage Debate

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Many lawmakers, lenders and consumer advocates are now cautioning against rules that would require many borrowers to make large down payments. 

 BODY:
It seemed an easy fix to prevent the excesses of the housing market: make home buyers put more money down.
But as the housing market starts to return and the subprime mess fades from memory, the issue is up for debate.
Lenders and consumer advocates - rarely on the same side of the issue - are now cautioning against down payment requirements. They argue that such restrictions could limit lending, and prevent lower-income borrowers from buying homes. They also contend that the new mortgage rules put in place this year will do enough to limit foreclosures, making down payment requirements somewhat superfluous. 
The arguments seem to run contrary to long-standing beliefs about homeownership. For decades, experts have emphasized the need for a sizable down payment - a rule of thumb being 20 percent - on the premise that borrowers with a sizable chunk of equity in a home are less likely to walk away when things get bad.
"If our goal is to prevent foreclosures, I can't think of anything more effective than requiring a down payment," said Paul S. Willen, a senior economist and policy adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
The issue may not be so black and white. Regulators want to protect borrowers and promote homeownership. But they also want to encourage lending and insulate the financial system from future shocks.
And the subprime debacle has only distorted the debate, say some analysts. "The problem with this conversation is that it's like discussing the future of shipbuilding from the deck of the Titanic," said Roberto G. Quercia, director of the Center for Community Capital at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "There's a lack of perspective."
To underscore his point, Mr. Quercia studied mortgages in a special program for low-income borrowers, typically those with minimal down payments. From 1998 through the end of last year, 5.5 percent of the mortgages ended up in foreclosure, he found. Subprime mortgages made during the last housing boom, regardless of down payment size, had far higher foreclosure rates, roughly 25 percent.
It's a critical issue for Washington. Currently, taxpayers, through the Federal Housing Administration, backstop most of the low-down-payment mortgages. But the aim is to curb the government's involvement in mortgages.
As that happens, policy makers are hoping a major part of the mortgage market will come back. Specifically, they need the return of private bond investors, who once bought trillions of dollars' worth of mortgage-backed bonds with no government backing.
Other than some small bond deals, that market remains dormant. A major reason is that the banks that sell the mortgage-backed bonds are waiting for regulators to complete rules aimed at strengthening this market.
This is where down payments could play a crucial role. The proposed rules require banks to hold a slice of the mortgage-backed bonds they sell to investors. Banks do not like those types of restrictions.
But lenders would not have to keep a piece of the bonds if the underlying loans included features that made them less likely to default. These exempt loans would be called qualified residential mortgages. Regulators effectively proposed that these loans should have a 20 percent down payment.
The proposal prompted widespread objections from consumer advocates, bankers and home builders, who said the plan could shut many borrowers out of the housing market. Banks, they argued, are likely to focus heavily on making qualified residential mortgages. And if those mortgages require high down payments, lenders will be hesitant to make loans with little money down.
Consumer advocates make a nuanced case. They do not deny that down payments reduce the risk of default. But they say defaults can be reduced almost as much by applying other rules that curb lending to certain types of borrowers.
Consider another set of mortgage rules, already put in place this year. These rules emphasize the affordability of the loan. Under them, a borrower's overall monthly debt payments cannot exceed 43 percent of personal income.
In his study, Professor Quercia of the University of North Carolina found that loans that complied with those rules defaulted at a relatively low rate during the housing bust. About 5.8 percent of them went bad, irrespective of how much the borrower put down.
He then calculated the losses on loans to borrowers in the same group who had down payments of at least 20 percent. The default rate on that smaller group was lower, at 3.9 percent.
But that lower rate came at a cost. More than half of the borrowers in his study group had to be excluded from the second calculation, because they didn't have down payments of 20 percent or more. This shows how restrictive a down payment rule could be, said Professor Quercia.
Some real estate analysts are skeptical of this approach. They assert that the new mortgage rules, which do not insist on down payments, may be relatively ineffective at preventing high levels of defaults.
The debt-payments-to-income ratio is not a strong predictor of whether a loan will default, said Thomas A. Lawler, a former chief economist of Fannie Mae who founded Lawler Economic and Housing Consulting, a research firm. "It's not even in the top three," he said.
Also, Mr. Lawler and others who favor higher down payments argue that Professor Quercia's analysis underestimates the psychological and practical importance of the down payment. Borrowers who saved up for down payments may have budgeting skills that later help them make their payments, they argue, and borrowers with equity in their homes are less likely to walk away altogether, rather than try to find a solution.
Supporters of a down payment requirement also make a broader argument. They point out that the financial sector overhaul was not just meant to protect borrowers. It was also intended to make banks and financial markets more resilient to shocks like housing busts. In other words, the legislation always envisioned a trade-off between homeownership and the stability of the financial system.
"The key is what is the right balance between some risk and access," Professor Quercia said. "Just looking at the risks is one-sided."

HEADLINE: When Food Isn't the Answer to Hunger

BYLINE: TINA ROSENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: The Obama Administration&#8217;s proposal to change an outdated food aid restriction would allow the United States to feed millions more people at the same cost. 

 BODY:
When the Indian Ocean tsunami hit in December 2004, killing more than a quarter-million people, the great global humanitarian machine sprung to life. First on the list of donations, of course, was food - bags of food began arriving by airlift and sea, especially into Aceh, the hardest-hit region.
But was it the right kind of aid? The Acehnese who lost their livelihoods needed food, but there was actually plenty of food to be bought. Indonesia's foreign minister told the world not to send rice. The coast had been devastated, but not far inland life was normal- in fact, harvests had been excellent. What was disrupting the food market was not the tsunami, but the sacks of rice that were coming in. So many people were getting rice for free that local markets couldn't sell it. Farmers were undercut and supply chains fell apart.
"It seemed counterproductive to ship in commodities and undermine local producers," said Gawain Kripke, director of policy for Oxfam America. "Shipping in food was doing more harm than good." 
So several aid organizations working locally decided to try something different. They bought local food to distribute to the people to whom they would have otherwise donated food. Save the Children and CARE gave those in need cash or vouchers they could use to get food the way they always had: by going to the market and buying it. Mercy Corps paid residents to clear debris. The Swiss Development Corporation provided cash grants to families hosting the displaced.

The idea of providing money instead of food was not new, but it made up a tiny part of world food aid. Aceh seemed like a good place to try the idea on a wider scale. The projects were, for the most part, successful - cheaper than shipped-in food, and more popular with locals. They provided better nutrition; people who got cash ate more fresh foods than those who got rice. In cash households there was a lot of joint decision making about how to spend it, and while increases in alcohol consumption were low for both groups, it was especially low for those who received cash.
Not every emergency is Aceh. In many places, people go hungry because there is no food. But in a lot of places, food is available and the market is working - people are just too poor to buy it. In those places, giving individuals or charitable groups cash to buy food can make food aid cheaper, faster and fairer. By strengthening and not undercutting local farmers, cash aid also helps countries to avoid hunger later.
With the exception of one country, every major supplier of humanitarian food aid enjoys the flexibility to use whatever form of aid works best - they can send food, buy food in the affected region, or just provide cash or vouchers. But the United States, the largest donor, is still tied to sending sacks of grain and legumes from America. Only 15 percent of American humanitarian food aid can be untied - bought outside the United States.
Now the Obama administration proposes giving America more flexibility. In the 2014 budget it just submitted to Congress, it is upping the untied amount from 15 percent to 45 percent. The proposal also modernizes food aid by ending a second great inefficiency: a process known as monetization. And it is planning to ask American companies to provide not just commodities but also super-nutritious foods for the severely malnourished - in general modernizing food aid.
"As more efficient tools surfaced and best practices evolved, we've learned that the current approach to food aid can become - at times - an impediment to its very own mission," the United States Agency for International Development administrator, Rajiv Shah, said in a speech on April 10.
American food aid is slow and inefficient. The Government Accountability Office reported in 2009 that for sub-Saharan Africa, food bought locally by the World Food Program cost 34 percent less and arrived 100 days faster than food sent from the United States. (Ocean shipping accounts for half the cost of American food aid.) Increasing the amount of aid that can be locally procured to 45 percent would allow the United States to feed four million more people for the same cost, Shah said.
Untying food aid can help in other ways as well. Cash can get to people where food cannot. Earlier in Fixes, I reported on how vouchers and cash were allowing the hungry in Somalia to eat even though it was too dangerous for aid workers to go in. (Here is a follow-up Fixes article on cash and voucher feeding programs in Africa.)
Perhaps most damaging of all, sending food creates a cycle of need. One reason Haiti is perpetually hungry is that free or highly subsidized imported rice has destroyed Haiti's rice farmers, who can't compete. In March 2010, two months after the earthquake, Haiti's President Rene Preval asked the United States to "stop sending food aid, so that our economy can recover and create jobs." (The United States did not stop.) In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, former President Clinton actually apologized for his policies that flooded Haiti with subsidized rice. (Here's a rather startling video.) That was trade, not aid, but the effect was similar.
Shah said in an interview on Monday that for this year, America's 15 percent in untied aid has been used up in opposition-controlled Syria - where aid workers cannot go - and in refugee camps housing Syrians over the border in Turkey, where aid is dispensed with debit cards. "When we introduced cards in the camp in Kilis, we saw local Turkish vendors able to participate, and more welcoming," he said. "And operation costs went down 50 percent - so the camp could accept more refugees."
The bill is being paid elsewhere. Having dispersed its quota of locally procured food aid, the United States had to switch programs in other countries back to bags of American-grown food. The additional cost cut 155,000 people from the program in Somalia and 34,000 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Shah said.
Any real business that tolerated this level of inefficiency and waste would quickly have gone bankrupt. But they exist because when the program began in 1954, its core purpose was not to feed the hungry but to keep American crop prices high by disposing of surpluses. Its original name was the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act. (It was also designed to fight Communism, but that's another story.)
Those rules persist. Most aid is still tied, of course, and at least 50 percent of it must be shipped on American flag carriers - at large expense, as these ships often have a monopoly position. The largest company running these carriers is not American at all, but the Danish shipper Maersk.
In the 2008 farm bill, President Bush asked Congress to increase flexibility to 25 percent. That failed, but the bill did include $60 million in pilot programs using local procurement. They were successful. But the current reform proposals have a better chance. What has changed? For one thing, the United States is now alone in requiring tied aid. And our money is buying less and less. The cost of transporting food has tripled in a decade, according to U.S.A.I.D. And food prices are maintaining record or near-record highs. The result is that 10 years ago, the United States shipped about 5.5 million metric tons of food, and now it ships 1.8 million.
Nor do shippers or agricultural producers need this program. Farm exports are thriving - in 2013 American crop exports are forecast at $142 billion, and only $1 billion of that will be humanitarian food. The food program was established to deal with commodity surpluses, but there are no more commodity surpluses.
The most surprising pillar of food-aid-as usual is an assortment of charitable groups that work on the ground - groups that are very familiar with the system's flaws. One reason is monetization. About a fifth of all American food aid goes not to people but to American organizations such as World Vision or Catholic Relief Services. They sell it to raise money for their programs. No one thinks that turning aid workers into commodities brokers is a good way to finance programs - it's about 25 percent less efficient than cash, and it can have the same malignant effect on local farmers that other food shipments can have.
Some groups have stopped accepting the aid - CARE, for example, stopped in 2009. The organization decided that not only monetization but also giving out food was ineffective, and turned to more long-term development programs. But it's instructive that CARE lost some $45 million annually in the process.
The administration's proposal would end monetization, replacing the $400 million in monetizable aid with $330 million in cash instead; that's equivalent, because cash is so much more efficient.
The third major big idea in the administration's bill is more speculative, but it is ingenious. The expense of shipping sacks of wheat isn't the only problem with sending hungry people commodities. Cereals aren't very nutritious for the malnourished. But American companies make ready-to-use therapeutic foods, like a paste of peanuts with nutrients that has proven miraculous at reviving children suffering from even severe malnutrition. Sealed into what looks like big ketchup packets, the peanut paste doesn't need to be reconstituted (thus avoiding the perils of dirty water) and keeps forever. Because it's highly concentrated, it's efficient to ship. It's made by several companies in the United States, among them Mana, and Shah says that 10 or 12 other new products are in the pipeline. "During critical times of need, these products are the most lifesaving and have the highest impact," he said. "It's a much better way to conduct food assistance."

HEADLINE: Europe Struggles In Shale Gas Race

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
IN eastern Poland, politicians are still hoping to join the shale gas energy revolution, but lately they have had to curb their enthusiasm.
Large reserves of the gas discovered two years ago were initially projected to meet Poland's energy needs for 300 years, but estimates have since been slashed by more than 80 percent. International energy giants like Exxon Mobil and Talisman Energy of Canada have scaled back their investments after disappointing early attempts at extraction. And competition from other fossil fuels, like abundant coal supplies, has made it unprofitable to tap many of the country's new energy fields.
''Poland is certainly not Texas,'' said Kash Burchett, a European energy analyst at the consulting firm IHS in London. ''Shale gas in Europe is unlikely to revolutionize the energy industry like it has done in the U.S.'' 
Across the Continent, both policy makers and the public remain wary of the potential environmental impact of technologies like hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, used to extract shale gas. The fact that Europe is much more densely populated than the United States also makes it difficult to win government approval to tap the new energy deposits, which are often near major cities. Further complicating matters are shortages of technical expertise and drilling rigs, and regulations that differ widely among countries.
''The opportunity is there, but the early exploration efforts have been disappointing,'' said Stephen O'Rourke, a senior gas supply analyst at the energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie in Edinburgh, who estimates that European shale gas may meet a mere 5 percent of demand within the European Union by 2030. ''There's a lot of uncertainty.''
A slowdown in Europe's efforts to exploit its shale gas reserves, roughly 10 percent of the world's deposits, could not come at a worse time for Europe's companies, which are already suffering from a continental debt crisis and anemic growth and are becoming increasingly uncompetitive compared with rivals in the United States.
In America, energy-intensive industries like manufacturing and chemical production have benefited from a drastic fall in fuel costs because of a domestic energy boom in shale oil and gas. Natural gas prices, for example, have fallen by almost 67 percent over the five years, and the United States is on track to become the world's largest oil producer by 2017, according to the International Energy Agency.
Fuel costs for European companies, by contrast, remain roughly double those of their American competitors, while many countries, particularly in Eastern Europe, are dependent on natural gas imports from Russia. Also, the Continent's fossil fuel production has fallen steadily over the last 10 years, even as global demand rises.
Although it has some of the largest deposits of unconventional gas in Europe, France banned fracking in 2011, and Bulgaria and the Netherlands have followed suit with similar measures. Political leaders remain concerned over the potential environmental harm from the technology, while campaigners also have questioned efforts to promote fossil fuels over green technologies like wind and solar power.
''Shale gas isn't a long-term solution to Europe's energy security issues,'' said Antoine Simon, a campaigner at the environmental group Friends of the Earth Europe in Brussels. ''We should be looking to develop our renewables sector.''
Even in countries that support unconventional natural gas, exploration has not been easy.
After early-stage drilling in 2011 caused small earthquakes near the seaside resort of Blackpool in northern England, the British government stopped the practice of fracking. The ban was lifted late last year, though analysts doubt whether British shale gas will be able to compete against natural gas imports, including potentially those from the United States.
The cost of extracting European shale gas, for example, is roughly double that of American reserves, according to Wood Mackenzie estimates, and other alternatives, like liquefied natural gas, which can be imported on ships from Qatar and elsewhere, also are a cheaper option for many of Europe's energy-hungry companies.
Competition will only become more cutthroat. As American companies turn their attention to exporting domestic natural gas, Europe, with its higher energy prices, is seen as an attractive market. Last month, Houston-based Cheniere Energy signed a long-term energy contract -- the first of its kind -- with the British energy company Centrica to ship shale gas from Louisiana starting in 2018. Similar deals are expected to follow.
''Future gas supplies from the U.S. will help diversify our energy mix,'' Britain's prime minister, David Cameron, said in a statement.
Despite the uphill challenge, some companies are still looking to profit from Europe's unconventional natural gas reserves. In Germany, Exxon Mobil, which became a major shale gas player in the United States after acquiring the domestic producer XTO Energy for $31 billion in 2009, continues to drill test wells despite a ban on fracking in parts of the country.
''It is too early to say how much shale gas may be produced,'' said Tristan Aspray, European exploration operations manager at Exxon Mobil. ''The rate of growth of production in the future will almost certainly be less than the U.S.''
And earlier this year, Royal Dutch Shell, Europe's largest oil company, signed a contract with the Ukrainian government worth a reported $10 billion. It plans to explore for shale gas reserves in Ukraine, which is eager to reduce its reliance on Russian imports.
The 50-year agreement, which is dependent on whether preliminary drilling can find shale gas deposits, is expected to be followed by a similar deal with the American energy giant Chevron. The new energy contract, though, has run into vocal opposition from Ukrainian environmentalists and local politicians.
''The primary obstacle to shale gas in Europe is politics,'' said Mr. Burchett of IHS. ''If you don't have permission to drill, you can't move forward.''

HEADLINE: 'Expect the Unexpected'

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
HOUSTON
IF you could close your eyes for just a moment like Rip Van Winkle, and blink them open in 2023, you might see a very different energy world.
Electric cars may be popular. Solar energy could be cheap enough that millions of households and businesses deploy solar panels to generate their power needs. Fossil fuels will probably still dominate, but most trucks and many trains could run on natural gas rather than more polluting diesel. And the United States could be a major oil exporter.
None of this is implausible. Consider the change over the last 10 years. Back in 2003, American natural gas fields were thought to be drying up and energy entrepreneurs were beginning to invest in hugely expensive terminals to import gas, not export it. American oil production continued to plummet.
An awakening Rip today would see a miraculous change: a country on the path to becoming energy independent, a hopelessly quixotic quest only a decade ago. Newly prolific oil fields in North Dakota and Texas are expanding domestic production to levels not seen in a generation. The United States has suddenly become a net exporter of gasoline and diesel fuel. And it is looking for new markets for natural gas as well: new drilling technologies have allowed domestic production to soar over the last five years, causing a glut and price slump. 
''When it comes to energy, the rule of the game is to expect the unexpected,'' said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian. ''So much effort is going into research, development and innovation all across the energy spectrum, 10 years from now we may well see the next game changer.''
Possibly profound changes are taking shape right now. Newly mandated corporate average fuel economy standards are expected to double the number of miles that the average car travels per gallon by 2025. Scientists are working to develop better ways to store electricity to make wind turbines and solar power systems more practical when the wind does not blow and the sun does not shine. Energy-poor Japan has just found a way to extract natural gas from frozen methane hydrate at the bottom of the sea, a development that could open the door to a giant new gas source around the world.
Development of advanced biofuels, made of nonfood materials like algae and switch grass, has been disappointingly slow over the last decade. But breakthroughs are still possible. The first United States commercial advanced biofuels plant opened last fall in Mississippi, and a handful more are expected to start producing 200 million gallons this year. Tesoro, the Texas-based refiner, has agreed to begin buying algae-derived fuel to produce diesel.
A handful of power plants designed to convert coal into combustible gas, which could emit half the carbon dioxide of conventional coal-fired plants, are in the planning stages. Bill Gates is investing heavily in a company called TerraPower, which is working on a fission reactor that, unlike reactors that use enriched uranium and need to be refueled, could run on its own nuclear waste -- thus reducing the threat of proliferation and extending the life of available uranium supplies.
''The room for innovation is simply mind-blowing,'' Mr. Gates told executives at a recent conference in Houston held by IHS Cera, the energy consulting firm. ''Frankly, we need hundreds of ideas because many of them won't succeed.''
Some changes are fairly easy to predict, given the momentum of the current transformations, especially the emergence of natural gas as a dominant fuel both in the United States and abroad. It is entirely possible, if not likely, that American truck fleets, and perhaps even trains, will replace diesel with cleaner-burning natural gas. The rail freight giant Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the country's biggest diesel consumer, plans to test liquefied natural gas in its engines. Plans are afoot to convert idle natural gas import terminals into export terminals that could make the United States a major gas exporter by the early 2020s.
Modular gas-to-liquids plants will probably emerge next to oil fields, to exploit natural gas that is now being released and wastefully flared; the gas can instead be converted into a diesel fuel to power rigs and trucks. Government regulations will force energy companies to adopt safeguards against air and water pollution from hydraulic fracturing. And just as the exploitation of shale gas and oil production has taken off in the United States over the last decade, the next chapter of this revolution will see its expansion across much of the globe over the next decade, from Argentina and Mexico to China and North Africa.
ENVIRONMENTALISTS and fossil fuel producers have different wish lists for the future, of course, but many in both groups see the potential for big and somewhat similar energy changes over the next decade.
Hal Harvey, chief executive of Energy Innovation, an environmental consulting firm based in San Francisco, conceded that transportation fuels ''are not going to change that much in the next 10 years.'' But he said the new auto fuel standards would produce a striking improvement in mileage efficiency as carmakers design far lighter vehicles of new or improved materials that provide strength and safety without mass.
He also foresees ''explosive growth'' in renewable energy sources for electricity, with wind generation systems now running at a cost below that of many older power plants, and costs of solar energy panels coming down by 70 percent over the last three years. ''We are going to see a lot of change in power generation over the next 10 years,'' he said. ''You start to give homeowners the opportunity to self-generate and control their energy costs, and they take that option.''
He noted that California utilities had already signed contracts to comply with a state mandate to produce one-third of their power from renewables by 2020, from roughly 20 percent today. ''The forces are inexorable,'' he concluded.
William Colton, Exxon Mobil's vice president for corporate strategic planning, similarly said that ''oil is going to continue to be dominant in transportation'' over the next 10 years at least.
Nevertheless, he said there should be many more hybrid vehicles on the road by 2023. ''They will be more popular for one reason: Governments are mandating higher economy standards,'' Mr. Colton said. ''The industry will be pushed in that direction.''
Mr. Colton said natural gas would become increasingly important in the power sector, replacing much coal-burning both in the United States and abroad. He also foresees possible scientific breakthroughs for building lighter, cheaper and faster-charging batteries for cars; biological breakthroughs to make biofuel production more economical; and even advances in the development of hydrogen fuel cells to run electric motors on cars, resulting in emissions of only water vapor. But he added that commercialization of any of the possible breakthroughs would take at least another decade.
Much of the future of energy will depend on government policy, of course, and several major decisions in the United States are coming soon.
A major increase in natural gas exports hinges on pending licenses from federal regulators to allow construction of new liquefied natural gas export terminals. Should the Obama administration reject for environmental reasons the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, aimed at moving increasing amounts of Canadian and North Dakota oil to Gulf of Mexico refineries, the decision could hinder American independence from oil produced by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The slumping coal-mining industry needs government approvals of several proposed coal-exporting terminals in the Pacific Northwest, but it probably faces years of delays.
President Obama has proposed an ''energy security trust'' to provide $2 billion in energy research over the next decade, but budget realities could cut subsidies and research for renewable energy. A future Republican administration could decide to ramp up nuclear power, resuscitate coal production or encourage the conversion of automobiles to use natural gas.
Government policies look even more uncertain abroad. In Europe, weakened finances cast doubt on support for solar and wind power in at least some countries, and support for hydraulic fracturing to increase gas production remains tenuous. In many oil-producing countries like Venezuela and Angola, government subsidies for gasoline and other fuels are expanding domestic consumption and eroding the capacity to export.
In the United States, the federal Energy Information Administration, a cautious prognosticator, is projecting explosive growth in domestic oil production in the next three years alone, with production expanding from a current 6.83 million barrels a day to 7.52 million barrels a day in 2016 -- the highest rate achieved in nearly three decades. The agency has also predicted domestic oil production will remain above six million barrels a day through 2040, despite a decline in production after 2019.
Energy demand will grow slowly in the coming years, according to the agency, with coal and nuclear power becoming relatively less important, and natural gas and renewable sources becoming more important. It projects that renewable energy, not including hydroelectric power, will account for 32 percent of the overall growth in electricity generation through 2040.
But even as demand for oil slackens in the United States and Europe because of demographic changes and more efficient vehicles, emerging market economies -- especially those of China, India and the Middle East -- will keep fossil fuels dominant worldwide not only through 2023, but through 2035, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.
Still, China's growing energy demands have also prompted it to invest more than $70 billion a year in nuclear, wind, solar and biomass projects, so the energy priorities set by its new leadership could have profound and even unpredictable global effects.
In an interview, Fatih Birol, chief economist for the International Energy Agency, predicted that the United States as well as China, Europe, Japan and India would institute rules and standards to increase energy efficiency in vehicles, appliances and industry, but such advances would not be enough to stem significant climate change over the coming decades, which he said would be ''deleterious for the planet.''
He said he expected that increasing gas production over the next decade would give the United States a competitive energy price advantage over Europe and Japan. He added, ''The U.S. oil import bill will go down and the trade balance will be an asset rather than a burden to the United States,'' as it has been over the last few decades.
His agency's most recent World Energy Outlook attracted big headlines predicting that the United States will overtake Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world's top oil producer by 2017, and North America will become a net exporter by around 2030. Fulfillment of the dream of energy independence shared by every president since Richard Nixon would be a substantial geopolitical shift, meaning the United States would no longer depend on erratic or unfriendly oil producers like Venezuela or Nigeria.
A recent Citigroup report, ''Energy 2020: Independence Day,'' projects fundamental shifts in oil markets over the next five years. The report foresees wide-ranging changes in trade, shipping and flows of oil and gas that will ripple across continents and especially benefit the United States and Canada. ''This production growth from North America looks bound to place considerable pressure on global oil prices in the half decade ahead,'' it said.
This year, imports of high-quality West African sweet crude will be replaced as pipelines, rail and seaborne transportation will more thoroughly connect new American shale fields with domestic and Canadian markets. With approval of the Keystone XL pipeline and rail connections, more Canadian crude could reach the refineries of the Gulf of Mexico, displacing imports of Venezuelan, Mexican and Persian Gulf heavy crudes. Finally, the supply revolution in the United States and Canada will challenge the influence of the OPEC cartel, as even its recent publications have acknowledged.
The glut of domestic natural gas will mean significant exports by 2023, according to most energy analysts. Companies are petitioning to build more than a dozen export terminals. Though many will probably not be approved or attract necessary capital, it is likely that American exports of liquefied natural gas will reduce European dependence on Russian gas and allow Japan, China, South Korea and other countries to rely less on coal.
The promise of energy independence raises provocative policy questions. If the United States is no longer dependent on Middle East oil, what will be the justification for protecting the Strait of Hormuz from Iranian or terrorist attack? Will isolationism spread among the American electorate, and demands grow to bring home the Fifth Fleet, now based in Bahrain to protect the Persian Gulf?
Maybe. But the United States would not be immune from oil shocks that could still jolt the globalized economy and send pump prices in the United States soaring, and few analysts predict the United States will turn away from the Middle East.
''Are we better off if we're less dependent on imports? Absolutely,'' said Bill White, a deputy secretary of energy in the Clinton administration and former mayor of Houston. ''But if the Straits of Hormuz are closed and 60 percent of the world is still import-dependent, then we face an economic crisis because the people we sell products to won't be able to buy our products and the price of the goods that we import would climb.''
Some things may look very different to Rip in a decade, but others could well look the same.

HEADLINE: Power Grids Iffy, Populous Areas Go for Generators

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
AFTER Tropical Storm Irene pummeled the Northeast in 2011, Keith and Barbara Wolff realized it was time to act. Though they were spared during Irene, several other storms had cut the power to their home in Brookfield, Conn., forcing them to throw out food, wear sweaters to keep warm and find coffee shops to recharge their cellphones and laptops.
So the Wolffs did what many of their neighbors had done: They bought a portable, gasoline-powered generator that produced enough electricity to run many of their essential appliances, including their refrigerator, water well, hot water tank, heater and home offices.
The Wolffs paid about $1,000 for a 7,500-watt generator made by Generac. A week after paying an electrician $900 to hook up the unit to their electrical system, they put their new purchase to work when a snowstorm knocked out their power for nine days. 
''It was a pretty hefty investment, but it was well worth it because when it's cold out, you want to at least be able to take a shower,'' Mr. Wolff said. ''There are two things you can do: Be completely aggravated and non-functional or do a workaround so your quality of life is better.''
Generators have been a backup for homeowners in rural America and twister- and hurricane-prone corners of the country for decades.
But in recent years, they have also become popular with families in metropolitan areas across the northern half of the country that have been hard hit by recent so-called superstorms.
With utility companies straining to keep up with the power failures after storms, homeowners are increasingly taking matters into their own hands.
For as little as $150, consumers can buy a 1,000-watt gasoline-powered portable generator at a big-box store like Home Depot that will keep a few home appliances running for several hours.
Larger homes with more appliances require more powerful generators that can cost well over $2,000 yet keep refrigerators, heaters, water pumps and other essential equipment running. Hookups to a home's electrical system are extra and can require a licensed electrician.
Now those with portable generators are being outclassed by homeowners with more money and larger homes springing for far more expensive standby units that can cost $10,000 or more installed. Typically powered by natural gas or propane, they flick on automatically and almost instantly in a shutdown.
''It's not cheap, but people look at it as a home improvement product, particularly as they age,'' said Aaron Jagdfeld, the chief executive of Generac Power Systems, which recently produced its one-millionth standby unit. ''People are coming to the conclusion that power outages are becoming more frequent.''
Generator makers do not release sales figures, but a report by the Consumer Product Safety Commission in 2006 estimated that more than one million generators a year are sold, with portable units making up roughly 90 percent of the sales.
Leading manufacturers like Generac and Honda, however, said sales had been unusually strong in the last several years and that the percentage of standby units had risen steadily as Tropical Storm Irene, Hurricane Sandy and other major storms had led to widespread failures along the Eastern Seaboard.
''The market has certainly increased, not just because of Sandy, but a plethora of weather events,'' said Tom Pernice, marketing manager in the generator division at the American Honda Motor Company. ''When you get a Sandy, a Rita, a Katrina, there are issues.''
One unintended consequence is the growing number of people -- dozens a year -- who die from carbon monoxide poisoning because they ran their portable generators in enclosed spaces without enough ventilation for the exhaust.
''For every dead person, there are 10 people who got sick from carbon monoxide and didn't realize it came from carbon monoxide,'' said Albert Donnay, a toxicologist who has urged generator manufacturers to include carbon monoxide sensors.
The generator boom raises even larger questions about the reliability of the nation's electrical grid and the ability of network operators to handle the more severe weather in an age when families are living in larger homes filled with a greater array of electrical devices.
In their recent report card evaluating the country's infrastructure, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the nation's energy network a grade of D plus, which was unchanged from the prior report in 2009.
''Investment in transmission has increased since 2005, but ongoing permitting issues, weather events and limited maintenance have contributed to an increasing number of failures and power interruptions,'' the report said.
Demand for electricity has grown by 25 percent since 1990, and utilities may need to spend as much as $1.5 trillion by 2030 to expand and update the nation's electrical infrastructure, according to the society.
''We have all the technology available to strengthen the grid, but whether it's being done is another question,'' said Michael Stavy, an energy economist who specializes in climate change mitigation. ''Generators are a short-term solution for something that the consumer is powerless to solve, so it's rational to get one.''
In the days after Hurricane Sandy pummeled the Northeast, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said that more money was needed to shore up transmission and distribution networks to prepare for extreme weather events, though he sidestepped the question of what was causing them.
''I don't call it 'global warming' because you trigger a whole political debate,'' he said last October. ''But the frequency of extreme weather is going way up.''
The governor's comment aside, it is unclear whether the storms that have hit the Northeast recently are evidence of a growing pattern or a blip on the historical weather map.
''Obviously, there have been two significant events in the Northeast over the past two years (Irene and Sandy) that some people might be reacting to,'' James L. Franklin, a spokesman for the National Hurricane Center in Miami, said in an e-mail. ''Whether this is a statistical anomaly or the beginning of a trend is unknown.''
He noted that the mid-1950s was a period of ''a lot of tropical activity in the Northeast,'' but it ebbed.
Homeowners are not waiting for the debate to be settled because they have more pressing concerns, like keeping their families warm (or cool) and healthy during emergencies, no matter how frequently they occur.
That's what prompted Charles LaDuca to buy a standby generator made by Generac that runs on natural gas for his 6,400-square-foot home in Bethesda, Md.
After several storms and power failures forced Mr. LaDuca, his wife and two children to abandon their home, he had the 14-kilowatt generator installed two years ago.
Mr. LaDuca spent about $12,000 on the generator and installation, which took about six weeks. The generator arrived promptly, but natural gas pipes had to be routed around the house and permits from the county were needed.
But the generator, which automatically turns on during a power failure, provides power to about 80 percent of Mr. LaDuca's home, including to the stove, heater, garage door, lights and television.
Mr. LaDuca said he was the fourth of the 20 or so homeowners on his street to buy a generator. ''It's sort of a luxury,'' he said, ''but we can run the house and keep the kids occupied and keep our food from getting spoiled. It's expensive but it's worth it.''
Demand for generators has meant extra work for utilities like Con Edison, which has had a 50 percent jump since 2010 in the number of requests to inspect the natural gas lines that are being connected to newly installed standby units.
Typically, licensed plumbers install any extensions to the natural gas pipes, and utilities sign off on the connection of the generators to their gas lines, a service they provide at no charge.
While such standby generators are more expensive than portable units, consumers are learning that they are more reliable because natural gas or propane is rarely interrupted by weather. By contrast, portable generators often require gasoline that may be harder to find after storms as stations run short of fuel.
The number of requests to install standby units ''will stay steady because of more acute events and folks are being more self-sufficient,'' said Robert Schimmenti, the vice president for engineering and planning for electric operations at Con Edison.
''The fact that we've had a few of these storms recently makes it top of mind for folks,'' said Timothy Cawley, the senior vice president for central operations at Con Edison, which plans to spend about $1 billion during the next four years fortifying its operations. ''We recognize it's a hardship to go without electricity, but it's the new reality.''

HEADLINE: The Next Nuclear Reactor May Arrive Hauled by a Truck

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
THE first commercial nuclear plant in the United States, commissioned in 1957, was just a scaled-up version of the reactors that powered submarines, and for decades afterward engineers made them bigger and bigger to maximize economies of scale.
But the hot idea now is to think small -- small enough to fit a reactor on a railroad car or even a heavy-haul truck.
Such a reactor could be built in a factory, sidestepping the problems of assuring high-quality fabrication in the field and allowing fast installation. And such reactors would have a built-in safety feature: in an emergency, natural convection could help a small core cool faster than a big one, just the way a cup of coffee cools faster than a pot of coffee. Proponents say that makes meltdowns far less likely.
''They offer the potential for a new paradigm in how we think about construction of nuclear power plants,'' Peter B. Lyons, the Energy Department's assistant secretary for nuclear energy, said of the so-called small modular reactors, also known as S.M.R.'s. He is supervising a program under which the government will pay up to half of the development cost of two different models. One manufacturer already has a contract to develop a plan for two small reactors in Tennessee. 
Because the plants could be safer as well as faster and easier to install, they do not have to surpass big reactors in cost per kilowatt-hour, Mr. Lyons said in an interview. ''If it is even equal, it is a winner,'' he said. ''If it's better, it's more than a winner.''
Rebecca Smith-Kevern, the Energy Department's director for light water reactor deployment, estimated their cost at $800 million to $2 billion a unit, compared with $10 billion to $12 billion for a large reactor. ''Basically they're not a bet-the-farm proposition for a utility,'' she said.
Small modular reactors could serve as ''starter reactors'' for countries that have no nuclear power now, no budget for a standard behemoth-size model and grids too weak to tolerate one anyway, proponents say. (Put a standard, 1,200-megawatt reactor on a small grid, and it could trigger a nationwide blackout every time it shut down unexpectedly.)
In addition to being small enough to ship, the reactors are small enough to be installed underground, offering the advantage of earthquake protection; buried structures are less vulnerable than those above the surface. They may also be easier to defend from attack.
And the ability to air-cool the reactors further distinguishes them from big nuclear plants, which, like coal and most natural gas plants that make steam to drive a turbine, require copious amounts of water to condense the steam back to water. S.M.R.'s make steam, like other reactors, but can condense it back to water using something a bit like a car radiator.
The Obama administration, with nuclear power aims that have received less attention than its alternative energy initiatives, began a five-year program to develop reactors in 2012, planning to spend $452 million.
The budget outlook for the final three years is uncertain, but the incoming energy secretary, Ernest J. Moniz, speaking at his confirmation hearing on April 9, said of small modular reactors: ''I think that it's a very promising direction that we need to pursue. It's where the most innovation is going on in nuclear energy.''
But new approaches to nuclear power have been forecast far more often than they have been realized, and some worry that small modular reactors could fall into that category. Joyce L. Connery, an Energy Department nuclear expert assigned to the National Security Council, remarked at a nuclear power conference in March, ''I hope that soon we populate the world with S.M.R.'s as much as we populate the world with conferences about S.M.R.'s.''
The economics may still be challenging even if the price tag is smaller, she said. ''Clearly there is a need for nuclear energy for the environment, but the environment for nuclear energy is not so great right now,'' she told a gathering of several hundred experts organized by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Cheap natural gas in North America and global political fallout from the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan are not helping, experts say.
And the regulatory structure is not so great for small reactors. Regulatory commission rules for control-room staff levels, emergency planning zones and security are all predicated on large, aboveground reactors. A small one built mostly underground might logically have smaller requirements, but a potential buyer would be reluctant to build one under the current regulatory regime, experts say.
Also, small reactors still face serious scrutiny for safety. David Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that the nice thing about reactors that existed only on paper was that the worst damage risk is paper cuts; their weaknesses do not become evident until the design or construction is further along.
But many potential manufacturers are advancing their designs. Leading at the moment is the power plant company Babcock & Wilcox, which has a promise of aid from the Energy Department. The Tennessee Valley Authority wants two of the company's mPower reactors for a site near the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and has agreed to pay for more detailed design work.
Babcock's reactor, 13 feet in diameter and 83 feet high, can produce 180 megawatts of power, about 15 percent of the power of a large new reactor, but can run far longer before refueling is required: four years, the manufacturer says, versus one to two years for a standard reactor. When a utility company needs more power, it can order another. Babcock refers to the basic design as a ''two-pack,'' as if the reactors were twin boxes of laundry soap.
The reactor's emergency cooling system consists of the natural circulation of air. Conventional reactors require operators to start up pumps and align valves, something that was impossible in the Fukushima accident, when a tsunami wiped out electric power.
Company executives hope to sell the mPower reactor to American military bases that would like to become more self-sufficient. At 180 megawatts, it could also be installed at the sites of 1950s-era coal plants that are being retired. Some of the infrastructure in those places, like the transmission lines and transformers, are about the right size for that kind of plant, officials say.
But another major market would be exports. According to the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry's trade association, 5,000 to 10,000 jobs are created for every $1 billion spent in this country for nuclear technology that is exported.
Another major player is likely to be NuScale Power, which plans a module with an output of just 45 megawatts.
Most reactors use pumps in their ordinary operation, to move the water they've heated into heat exchangers, which make clean steam for a turbine. NuScale makes water run to its steam generator with natural circulation, eliminating the pump that is used in conventional plants for that function. Such pumps are expensive and failure-prone.
The reactor is small enough to provide the steam needed to run an oil refinery, or even heat for keeping buildings warm. It would sit inside something like a Thermos bottle, submerged in a pool of cold water that could accommodate up to 12 reactors. In case of accident, that cooling water would last for months, the company says.
''It needs no A.C. power, no D.C. power, no additional water, indefinitely,'' said Michael McGough, a spokesman.

When the trustees of Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art voted this week to start charging for an undergraduate degree, it ended the institution's lengthy reign as the most famous tuition-free private college in America.
But it was never the only such place. While most colleges grapple with the growing burden of student debt, a few outliers across the country and even New York State offer a college education for the one price that looks good in any economy: nothing. 
To qualify for Cooper Union's largess, applicants had to prove themselves on the highest tier of the highest tier of academic or artistic achievement. That might strike some New Yorkers as easy compared with the requirements at some of the other free colleges. One requires students to work on a ranch, milking cows and harvesting alfalfa. Another requires them to build a container ship. And the national service academies, of course, require years of service in support of a robust national defense.
Applicants whose interests lead toward engineering -- specifically, naval architecture and marine engineering -- have a free alternative to Cooper Union's engineering school that is just a few stops away on the Long Island Rail Road. The Webb Institute, in Glen Cove, accepts just 26 students a year. Admissions ratios are not even relevant, as only about 100 people a year have high enough scores and grades to qualify for the privilege of applying. Students work two months a year in related industries, design a container ship and complete a thesis. Hard work, but the results are hard to beat: Robert C. Olsen Jr., the school's outgoing president, says the institute can boast 100 percent job placement. Room and board and other fees come to a little over $12,000 a year.
Berea College, in Berea, Ky., has the opposite of need-blind admissions. In addition to applicants with strong academic qualifications, it looks for those with little or no ability to pay for college, and then each year gives 400 of them a free education for four years. They are required to work 10 hours a week, but they do get paid, a fact that significantly offsets the $7,000 in annual nonacademic fees; as a result students graduate with an average of just $6,500 in debt.
The college was founded 158 years ago by an abolitionist with the goal of providing coeducational, interracial education, ambitious, given the era and the region. Today Berea has an endowment of over $1 billion. That works out to $625,000 per student, or more than 10 times the equivalent figure at New York University.
College of the Ozarks, in Point Lookout, Mo., and the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia also offer all students full tuition scholarships; Alice Lloyd College, in Pippa Passes, Ky., does so for those students from Central Appalachia.
But for New Yorkers, the closest free-tuition college is also the newest: Macaulay, the honors college of the City University of New York. With a home base in Manhattan but with students spread across eight other CUNY colleges, Macaulay uses the city itself as both campus and curriculum. And on top of waiving tuition for its elite New York students, it throws in a laptop, up to $7,500 for research, travel or internships, a ''cultural passport'' to many New York institutions, and in many cases housing subsidies, too.
Deep Springs College, on a ranch in an eastern California desert, selects just 13 men a year for its two-year program. The only required courses are composition and public speaking, along with a seminar that Brother Kenneth Cardwell, the school's dean, refers to as ''an introduction to how to talk reasonably to people your own age about matters of common concern.''
The college planned to begin admitting women, but because of a lawsuit filed by a couple of trustees who opposed the move, it remains for now all-male. Students also work 20 to 30 hours a week at a variety of jobs, from butcher to librarian to ranch hand. Most students transfer to four-year colleges, including a disproportionate number who depart for Brown, Yale, the University of Chicago and Columbia, said Brother Cardwell. Despite the bearded locavore vibe, the college gets very few applicants from New York.

HEADLINE: Syria Campaigns to Persuade U.S. to Change Sides

BYLINE: By ANNE BARNARD; Hwaida Saad contributed reporting.

 BODY:
DAMASCUS, Syria -- As Islamists increasingly fill the ranks of Syrian rebels, President Bashar al-Assad is waging an energized campaign to persuade the United States that it is on the wrong side of the civil war. Some government supporters and officials believe they are already coaxing -- or at least frightening -- the West into holding back stronger support for the opposition.
Confident they can sell their message, government officials have eased their reluctance to allow foreign reporters into Syria, paraded prisoners they described as extremist fighters and relied unofficially on a Syrian-American businessman to help tap into American fears of groups like Al Qaeda.
''We are partners in fighting terrorism,'' Syria's prime minister, Wael Nader al-Halqi, said. 
Omran al-Zoubi, the information minister, said: ''It's a war for civilization, identity and culture. Syria, if you want, is the last real secular state in the Arab world.''
Despite hopes in Damascus, President Obama has not backed off his demand that Mr. Assad step down. The administration has also kept up economic pressure on his government and has increased nonlethal aid to the opposition while calling for a negotiated settlement to the fighting.
But the United States has signaled growing discomfort with the rising influence of radical Islamists on the battlefield, and it remains unwilling to arm the rebels or to consider stepping in more forcefully without conclusive evidence that the Syrian government used chemical weapons, as some Israeli officials assert.
There is frustration with the West's inability to help nurture a secular military or political opposition to replace Mr. Assad.
It is difficult to see behind the propaganda of either side because government officials or the rebels -- depending on the territory -- control access. Information is a strategic weapon in the stalemated conflict, as both sides seek support from suffering Syrians and foreign countries.
The government's new strategy was on display during a two-week visit to Damascus by journalists for The New York Times.
Exhibit A was a group of blindfolded prisoners who shuffled into a dimly lighted courtyard one recent evening, each clutching the shirt of the man in front of him. Security officials billed them as vicious Islamic extremists who came from all over the world to wage jihad in Syria.
The men turned out to be five Syrians, a Palestinian and an Iraqi, and they described a range of goals, from Islamic rule to representative democracy.
In Damascus, officials and supporters sounded several themes: They believe they can win the war, and see no need to moderate the military crackdown. They expect Mr. Assad to run for re-election next year, and some say he can win, brushing off doubts about how voting will work in a country where nearly half the people have been forced from their homes.
Some officials and members of the Syrian elite even say -- however far-fetched -- they can persuade the West to embrace their president as a champion of common values and interests, even as he presses a military strategy widely criticized as striking civilian targets indiscriminately.
Most of all, the war seems to have inspired some of Mr. Assad's supporters. Some prominent Syrians, long frustrated by corruption and favoritism, say they have a newly compelling reason to stick by the government.
Now, they say, they are fighting for an idea: preserving Syria's mosaic of religions and cultures.
And they see themselves, with their well-traveled, secular lifestyles, as ideally equipped to connect to the West.
That is the mission of Khaled Mahjoub, a Syrian-American businessman.
At the nearly deserted Four Seasons Hotel, Mr. Mahjoub ordered Lebanese rosé. Syrians, he said, embrace joy at the hardest times. He smoked a thick cigar as Bach's ''Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring'' played softly in the background, mixing with the clap of mortar rounds headed for the Damascus suburbs.
''Syrian tobacco,'' he said. ''One hundred percent organic.''
For Mr. Mahjoub, who builds environmentally sustainable housing, blames ''Bedouin petrodollars'' for rising extremism and quotes from ''The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People,'' Mr. Assad is fighting an enemy driven by the ideology of Al Qaeda, ''the same enemy that did 9/11.''
Mr. Mahjoub, who has known Mr. Assad since attending the Syrian capital's Lycée Français with Mr. Assad's brother, Basil, said the president and the system he inherited from his father, Hafez, bear some responsibility for the tumult. Economic stagnation sent too many Syrians to work in Saudi Arabia, where they absorbed extremist views, he said, and security forces have made mistakes, too.
''But that,'' he said, ''doesn't justify burning the farm.''
Government officials said America and its allies orchestrated the uprising to punish Syria for opposing Israel. They also spoke of common interests. Syria, the prime minister said, is defending moderate Islam against ''the dark Islam.''
Opponents say the government itself has fueled sectarianism, first by favoring Mr. Assad's Alawite sect, now by using code words like ''Wahhabis'' and ''Al Qaeda'' to blame the Sunni Muslim majority for the violence.
Officials said that if Mr. Assad fell, Europe would face an arc of Islamist-led states from Turkey to Libya. They urged Washington to investigate whether Turkey was funneling jihadists to Syria in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373, which mandates international cooperation against terrorism.
Their biggest priority, though, was the visit with the prisoners.
The prisoners were driven from several jails to a security building. They had been held and interrogated for months without charges.
One prisoner called for global Islamic rule; others spoke of being brainwashed to kill for money. Another wanted democratic representation in the government.
At first, a wiry senior security official had promised his American guests something less ambiguous. ''They will tell you they're against you, '' he said. He declined to identify himself, or to specify what percentage of prisoners were foreigners. He said that as of August, the government had identified 600 slain foreign fighters. The conflict has killed more than 70,000 people.
Few dispute that foreign fighters who want Islamic rule -- and many more Syrians joining them for ideological or pragmatic reasons -- are influential in Syria's armed opposition. The United States has blacklisted as a terrorist organization one rebel group, the Nusra Front, which merged with Al Qaeda in Iraq.
Still, foreign fighters form a fraction of the tens of thousands of rebels. Powerful rebel commanders in Aleppo and Idlib say they took up arms to defend their homes and villages after security forces fired on peaceful protesters. From the start, many fighters reflected the traditional piety of their communities. Ideological jihadists became prominent later, after the opposition had trouble gaining arms -- while the jihadists have had willing donors.
The prisoners were interviewed in front of their jailers. One limped. They denied being coerced -- or mistreated, except, one said, when he ''made mistakes.'' But there was no way to know whether their stories were true, evasive or scripted.
The first prisoner presented was Bahaa Mahmoud al-Baash, a Palestinian resident of Syria. He called for a Muslim caliphate ''not only in Syria, but in the whole world.'' He said he had trained suicide attackers in Iraq and added, smiling and glancing at security officials, ''I will fight the Americans to my last.''
He has made similar remarks on Britain's Sky News and Syrian state television.
Three Syrians described a transition they could not fully explain: They had no opinions on the uprising, but were later brainwashed by preachers who paid them to demonstrate, then to kidnap, rape and kill. Two said they followed orders to rape and kill female relatives of government employees, fearing that otherwise their leaders would kill their families.
They expressed love for Mr. Assad, and urged associates to surrender.
A fourth Syrian, Abdulmoneim Mohammed Tayura, used to sell walnuts in a heavily bombarded Damascus suburb, Barzeh. He said he demonstrated, and later fought ''to topple the regime.''
What did he want next? ''To be represented in the upcoming government.''
Ali Hussein al-Shumarri, from Iraq, said he fought the United States there, then came to Syria for ''jihad for the sake of God'' and to ''topple the regime.''
To Syrian officials, the conclusion is obvious. Mr. Zoubi, the information minister, asked if Washington ''really believes'' the rebels are ''revolutionaries,'' not ''terrorists.''
''If they really believe, that is a disaster,'' he said. ''If they know they are not revolutionaries and consciously support Al Qaeda, that is a bigger disaster.''

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Orders Dropped 5.7% in March

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders for long-lasting factory goods fell in March by the most in seven months. The drop reflected a steep decline in commercial aircraft demand and little growth in orders that signal future business investment. 
The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that orders for durable goods declined 5.7 percent in March. That followed a 4.3 percent gain in February, which was revised lower.
Weaker economies overseas and the impact of across-the-board government spending cuts have made businesses more cautious, reducing demand for manufactured goods. Spending on military equipment also fell sharply last month.
Durable goods are items expected to last at least three years. Orders for durable goods tend to fluctuate sharply from month to month, and economists cautioned against reading too much into one monthly decline.
A measure of business investment plans, which include industrial machinery and computers, ticked up 0.2 percent last month. Economists pay close attention to so-called core capital goods orders because they strip out more volatile defense and aircraft orders.
Increases last month in both orders and shipments of core capital goods suggest businesses increased spending on equipment and software in the January-March quarter. That probably contributed to economic growth in the first quarter.
Still, most of the quarterly gain reflected a huge increase in January. Orders fell sharply in February and rose only slightly last month. That indicates businesses may spend less on equipment in the April-June quarter, economists said.
''This doesn't look like we're entering some kind of downward spiral,'' said Jonathan Basile, an economist at Credit Suisse. ''This seems like a downshift from stronger growth.''
The overall decline in durable goods was exacerbated by a 48.2 percent fall in commercial aircraft orders. Boeing reported that it received orders for only 39 aircraft, compared with 179 in the previous month.
Orders for military aircraft and other military goods also dropped. That most likely reflects the impact of automatic government spending cuts that began on March 1. Joseph LaVorgna, an economist at Deutsche Bank, noted that orders for defense equipment had fallen to their lowest level in over seven years.
Excluding aircraft and transportation demand, orders for durable goods dropped 1.4 percent, the second straight decline.
Demand fell in most types of goods. Orders dropped for metals like steel and aluminum, metal parts, electrical equipment and appliances and defense aircraft. Orders increased for computers and communications equipment.
Many economies overseas were also sluggish, reducing exports. China's manufacturers grew at a slower pace in March, according to a survey released on Monday, as export orders and employment declined. Europe's economy has been in recession.
Economists on average are projecting that the American economy grew at a healthy annual rate of about 3 percent in the first quarter, up from only a 0.4 percent rate in the fourth quarter of last year. The Commerce Department will release its first estimate for January-March growth on Friday.
But many economists say they expect growth has begun to slow to a rate of 2 percent or less in the current April-June quarter.

HEADLINE: Barclays and Credit Suisse Post Healthy Earnings in Investment Banking

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT and JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- As European policy makers push financial institutions to cut back on their risky trading activity, some of the region's largest banks are becoming more reliant on their investment banking operations to bolster performance.
On Wednesday, the British bank Barclays and a Swiss rival, Credit Suisse, both reported strong first-quarter earnings for their investment banks that helped to offset some sluggish growth in other divisions like retail banking and wealth management.
The healthy performance comes despite a push by European politicians to limit firms' exposure to financial risks and to promote lending to local economies. 
New tougher capital requirements have forced European banks to shed billions of dollars of assets since the financial crisis began. A proposed cap on banker bonuses that will become effective at European institutions next year has led to fears of a mass exodus of firms' top earners to international competitors.
The two banks' first-quarter earnings reflected the strength of investment banking.
Barclays' quarterly pretax profit for its investment bank rose 11 percent, to £1.3 billion, or $2 billion, or roughly 74 percent of the company's combined pretax profit over the period.
Over all, Barclays' quarterly profit, when adjusted for one-time charges, was £1.8 billion, down 25 percent from the same period last year, which missed analysts' estimates. The fall was linked to £514 million ($784 million) of costs related to a restructuring that includes 3,800 layoffs and a £235 million ($359 million) charge connected to the value of the bank's debt.
Barclays' investment bank benefited from renewed deal activity and a bullish stock market performance in the United States, where it now generates around 50 percent of its revenue. For example, the bank is advising Dish Network on its proposed $25.5 billion takeover of Sprint Nextel. ''The reality is that investment banking is becoming more dominant for Barclays,'' said Ian Gordon, a banking analyst at Investec in London. ''The first quarter was a blowout performance.''
At Credit Suisse, pretax profit in its investment banking division rose 43 percent, to 1.3 billion Swiss francs, or $1.4 billion, partly driven by a strong performance in the bank's fixed-income sales and trading business. In contrast, earnings from the company's private banking and wealth management business fell 7 percent, to 881 million francs, over the same period.
Credit Suisse reported a net profit of 1.3 billion francs ($1.4 billion) in the first quarter, compared with a profit of 44 million francs ($47 million) in the same period last year, when the bank booked a loss of 1.6 billion francs ($1.7 billion) on the value of its own outstanding debt.
Analysts said the bank's strong earnings were a result of a cost-cutting program started by the chief executive, Brady W. Dougan. The company's investment banking division also benefited from a pickup in global stock markets in the first three months of the year.
''The investment bank was the main driver with impressive cost management,'' Kian Abouhossein, a banking analyst at JPMorgan Chase in London, said in a research note to investors.
Shares in Barclays fell 1.3 percent in London on Wednesday, while Credit Suisse's stock price rose 1.5 percent in Zurich.
Attention will now turn to other large European banks that will report their first-quarter earnings over the next few weeks.
Deutsche Bank, the largest bank in Germany and one with a major investment banking division, will announce its results on Tuesday, as will the Swiss banking giant UBS. Analysts are expecting a fall in UBS's first-quarter net profit as the company continues to carry out sharp reduction in its investment bank, which includes around 10,000 job cuts, to focus on its wealth management business.
The continued reliance on investment banking at some of Europe's largest institutions follows efforts by politicians and top banking executives to reshape the Continent's financial sector.
Some banks, like UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland, are reducing their exposure to risky trading assets, while others, like HSBC and Standard Chartered, are increasing their operations in fast-growing emerging markets.
Antony P. Jenkins, Barclays' chief executive, also is trying to rehabilitate the company's image after a series of recent scandals. Last year, the bank agreed to a $450 million settlement with the United States and British authorities after some of its traders were found to have manipulated crucial global benchmark rates for financial gains.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: If Not Yellen at the Fed, Perhaps One of These

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
Handicapping the candidates to succeed Ben S. Bernankeas Federal Reserve chairman has much in common with predicting the outcome of a golf tournament: There's a good chance that the winner will not be one of the early favorites. 
Few people predicted Mr. Bernanke's selection by President George W. Bushin 2005. Here are a few people being discussed this time alongside Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's vice chairwoman.
ROGER W. FERGUSON JR. served as the Fed's vice chairman during the last seven years of Alan Greenspan's tenure as chairman, from 1999 until 2006. Widely discussed as a potential successor to Mr. Greenspan, he resigned shortly after Mr. Bernanke took office and has worked since 2008 as chief executive of TIAA-CREF.
Mr. Ferguson, 61, holds doctorates in law and economics from Harvard. He worked at the consulting firm McKinsey, becoming a partner and director of research and information systems, before joining the Fed in 1997.
Mr. Ferguson is regarded as a skilled manager deeply versed in the mechanics of the financial system. He is also well liked by former colleagues. But he is not an academic economist. And as the Fed's vice chairman, Mr. Ferguson oversaw the central bank's regulatory operations in the period leading up to the financial crisis, when it failed to check the excesses of the financial industry.
TIMOTHY F. GEITHNER, the Treasury secretary during President Obama's first term, was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from November 2003 until January 2009. That position is widely regarded as the second seat at the central bank because the New York Fed oversees the core of the nation's financial system and conducts the bulk of the Fed's own trading. The New York Fed's president also serves as vice chairman of the Fed's policy-making committee.
Mr. Geithner, 51, who holds a master's degree in international economics from Johns Hopkins University, lacks the academic credentials of recent chairmen. He has also disavowed interest in the job.
And like Mr. Ferguson, he was among the officials responsible for the Fed's regulatory failures. But Mr. Geithner's candidacy is difficult to dismiss because of his close relationship with Mr. Obama, who will pick the nominee, and because he is known and respected by investors.
He worked closely with Mr. Bernanke both at the New York Fed and as Treasury secretary, so he would provide a degree of continuity. And some argue that his skills in managing financial markets could prove particularly relevant as the Fed begins to retreat from its huge stimulus campaign.
LAWRENCE H. SUMMERS, Mr. Obama's chief economic adviser in 2009 and 2010, shares with Ms. Yellen the unusual combination of a sterling academic reputation and long experience as an economic policy maker. An economist by training, he was Treasury secretary during the final years of the Clinton administration and is now a professor at Harvard.
Mr. Summers, 58, has never worked for a central bank, although he has written extensively about macroeconomic policy. He has also been passed over once, having sought to replace Mr. Bernanke in 2010. And he has a mixed record in leadership roles, including his stormy five years as Harvard's president, which ended in his resignation.

HEADLINE: North American Sales Lift Ford's Results

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- The Ford Motor Company said on Wednesday that its net income improved 15 percent in the first quarter to $1.6 billion, as record results in North America compensated for losses in Europe and South America.
Two other big automakers, Daimler and PSA Peugeot Citroën, said that they expected weak sales in Europe to drag down their profits throughout this year.
Ford, the nation's second-largest automaker after General Motors, said its overall revenue grew 10 percent in the quarter to $35.8 billion, and its market share continued to increase in the United States. 
And despite unsettled economic conditions in international markets, the company reiterated forecasts that its full-year profit would at least match its performance in 2012.
''Our strong first-quarter results provide further proof that our One Ford plan continues to deliver,'' said Alan R. Mulally, Ford's chief executive.
Ford said that strong sales in its core North American market propelled the company to its 15th consecutive profitable quarter.
The company's sales in the United States rose 11 percent in the first three months of this year, compared with a 6 percent increase for the overall industry.
In North America, Ford posted a pretax profit of $2.4 billion, a 14-percent improvement over the same period a year ago. The company said it was the best quarterly performance since it began reporting the region as a separate business unit in 2000.
The company has steadily rebuilt its product lineup in recent years, bringing out new versions of mainstay vehicles like the Explorer sport utility vehicle and expanding production of smaller, more fuel-efficient cars like the Focus.
But Ford, like most other major automakers, continued to struggle overseas in the first quarter.
The company reported a pretax loss of $462 million in Europe -- about triple the $149 million it lost in the region in the first quarter of 2012.
Ford has said it expects to lose up to $2 billion this year in Europe, where weak economic conditions have driven new-vehicle sales to their lowest level in decades. The company is closing a major assembly plant in Belgium and accelerating other cost cutting in the region.
Other automakers indicated that troubles in the European economy might depress sales there for some time.
Daimler, the German maker of Mercedes-Benz luxury cars, said Wednesday that it was backing off its profit forecast for this year because of conditions in Europe.
The French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroën reported that its first-quarter sales dropped 10 percent because of weak demand in Europe. The company said it hoped to start talks with labor unions on wages and working hours in an effort to cut costs and improve competitiveness.
Ford's chief financial officer, Robert Shanks, said in an interview Wednesday that despite the sustained slide in European sales, there were some ''bright spots'' in the Continent's economy.
''We are starting to see some signs that the overall economy may be starting to stabilize,'' Mr. Shanks said.
Auto sales in the most troubled markets in Europe -- in particular Greece, Italy, Portugal, Ireland and Spain -- appear to have hit bottom. ''Some of these markets have flat-lined, which is a good thing,'' he said. ''Before, they were just dropping.''
While Europe continues to drag down Ford's results, the company is pressing ahead with plans to introduce several new vehicles in the region.
Ford is also coping with a setback in South America, where it reported a pretax loss of $218 million, after earning a profit of $54 million in the first quarter of last year. The company said currency issues in Venezuela and Argentina depressed its results, but that it still expected to break even in the region for the entire year.
Results in Asia, where Ford is investing heavily in new factories and products, improved slightly. The company said it earned a pretax profit of $6 million in the region compared with a $95 million loss a year ago.
One analyst said that Ford's overall performance showed that its turnaround was sustainable despite steep losses in Europe.
''As a global company, Ford is buffeted by winds affecting each of the world's major markets,'' said Jack Nerad, an analyst with the auto research site Kelley Blue Book. ''Most recently the North American market has been on the mend and Ford has been buoyed by this trend.''
Unlike its domestic rivals General Motors and Chrysler, Ford was able to survive the recession without a government bailout and a bankruptcy filing.
In recent years the company has increased the number of models built on global vehicle platforms, which saves money on development costs. Ford is also streamlining production plans to reduce inventories.
Mr. Shanks said that Ford expected the United States car market to continue its recovery this year, with industrywide sales of 15 million to 16 million vehicles. He added that sales of full-size pickups appeared to be gaining momentum because of improved housing starts and other construction activity.

HEADLINE: A Trans-Atlantic Trade Pact for the World

BYLINE: By CARLA A. HILLS

 BODY:
The opening of global markets -- starting in 1947 with the first round of trade negotiations among 23 nations and the creation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), through the creation of the World Trade Organization in 1995 -- caused international trade to explode and standards of living for nations rich and poor to soar.
Economic studies show that the opening of global markets since the end of World War II has added about $9,000 of additional wealth for the average American household. Developing nations have also gained from global trade. On average, poor countries that opened their markets to trade and investment have grown more than three times faster than those that kept their markets closed. No country has prospered by sealing itself off from global economy. 
The Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations was launched in 2001, two months after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States. It sought to boost economic growth through trade liberalization for all nations, but particularly for developing nations.
The security dimension was real, because in addition to the projected economic benefits, past experience showed that as governments liberalized their trade regimes, they generally liberalized their political regimes. Adherence to an agreed set of trade rules and support for the W.T.O. dispute settlement mechanism encourages nondiscrimination, transparency and rule of law, which contribute to increased stability.
The Doha negotiations broke down in 2005 and have made little progress since. Trade commentators are declaring Doha dead and multilateral negotiations obsolete as governments increasingly have turned to negotiating bilateral and regional trade agreements that create conflicting rules and distort trade by creating trade preferences for the signatories at the expense of those that do not participate. There is legitimate concern that the proliferation of bilateral and regional trade agreements could render the W.T.O. irrelevant and destroy the enormous benefits we derive from our multilateral trading system.
What could bring the 159 W.T.O. members back to the table? Ironically, history demonstrates that the successful negotiation of a major regional trade agreement of high quality can provide the necessary catalyst.
In 1990, the Uruguay Round collapsed in Brussels. In June 1991 the United States, Mexico and Canada launched the negotiations of a North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Fourteen months later negotiations were concluded. President George H.W. Bush signed the agreement in December 1992; President Clinton secured congressional approval of the agreement the following year.
By joining the economies of Canada, Mexico and the U.S., Nafta created a regional market of over 400 million people. It was the first comprehensive free trade agreement to join developed and developing nations, and it achieved broader and deeper trade liberalization than any prior trade agreement.
The world's reaction was broad, deep and fast. In just a few months following the passage of the Nafta, trade negotiators returned to the bargaining table, completed the Uruguay Round, and created the W.T.O. to the enormous benefit of the global economy.
If we are to repeat the success of two decades ago, we will require an even greater catalyst: a regional trade agreement of such quality and scope that the rest of the world is galvanized.
The Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership recently announced by the European Union and the United States could be that catalyst. That negotiation would involve roughly half the global economy. The negotiation need not be protracted. The E.U. and the U.S. each recently concludedfree trade agreements with South Korea that could serve as a template upon which to build.
The proposed Trans-Atlantic Partnership could have even more heft if Canada and Mexico were added -- which makes sense, since Mexico already has a free trade agreement with the E.U., and Canada is in the final stages of negotiating one. Including them would avoid having different rules covering trade involving our two largest trading partners.
The global reaction to Nafta 20 years ago shows that ''competitive liberalization'' can be a powerful catalyst. When governments see others taking economic action that generates growth and stability, they do not want to be left out.
A broad, gold-standard trade agreement across the Atlantic could be such a catalyst for reigniting support for multilateral trade liberalization, bringing W.T.O. members back to the table to finish the Doha Round, which would give a real boost to the global economy.
It was done before with the Nafta, and it could be done again with the successful conclusion of the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.
Carla A. Hills is Chief Executive Officer of Hills & Company International Consultants. She was the U.S. Trade Representative from 1989 to 1993 and the primary U.S. negotiator of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

HEADLINE: Down Payment Rules Are at Heart of Mortgage Debate

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
It seemed an easy fix to prevent the excesses of the housing market: make home buyers put more money down.
But as the housing market starts to return and the subprime mess fades from memory, the issue is up for debate.
Lenders and consumer advocates -- rarely on the same side of the issue -- are now cautioning against down payment requirements. They argue that such restrictions could limit lending, and prevent lower-income borrowers from buying homes. They also contend that the new mortgage rules put in place this year will do enough to limit foreclosures, making down payment requirements somewhat superfluous. 
The arguments seem to run contrary to long-standing beliefs about homeownership. For decades, experts have emphasized the need for a sizable down payment -- a rule of thumb being 20 percent -- on the premise that borrowers with a sizable chunk of equity in a home are less likely to walk away when things get bad.
''If our goal is to prevent foreclosures, I can't think of anything more effective than requiring a down payment,'' said Paul S. Willen, a senior economist and policy adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
The issue may not be so black and white. Regulators want to protect borrowers and promote homeownership. But they also want to encourage lending and insulate the financial system from future shocks.
And the subprime debacle has only distorted the debate, say some analysts. ''The problem with this conversation is that it's like discussing the future of shipbuilding from the deck of the Titanic,'' said Roberto G. Quercia, director of the Center for Community Capital at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ''There's a lack of perspective.''
To underscore his point, Mr. Quercia studied mortgages in a special program for low-income borrowers, typically those with minimal down payments. From 1998 through the end of last year, 5.5 percent of the mortgages ended up in foreclosure, he found. Subprime mortgages made during the last housing boom, regardless of down payment size, had far higher foreclosure rates, roughly 25 percent.
It's a critical issue for Washington. Currently, taxpayers, through the Federal Housing Administration, backstop most of the low-down-payment mortgages. But the aim is to curb the government's involvement in mortgages.
As that happens, policy makers are hoping a major part of the mortgage market will come back. Specifically, they need the return of private bond investors, who once bought trillions of dollars' worth of mortgage-backed bonds with no government backing.
Other than some small bond deals, that market remains dormant. A major reason is that the banks that sell the mortgage-backed bonds are waiting for regulators to complete rules aimed at strengthening this market.
This is where down payments could play a crucial role. The proposed rules require banks to hold a slice of the mortgage-backed bonds they sell to investors. Banks do not like those types of restrictions.
But lenders would not have to keep a piece of the bonds if the underlying loans included features that made them less likely to default. These exempt loans would be called qualified residential mortgages. Regulators effectively proposed that these loans should have a 20 percent down payment.
The proposal prompted widespread objections from consumer advocates, bankers and home builders, who said the plan could shut many borrowers out of the housing market. Banks, they argued, are likely to focus heavily on making qualified residential mortgages. And if those mortgages require high down payments, lenders will be hesitant to make loans with little money down.
Consumer advocates make a nuanced case. They do not deny that down payments reduce the risk of default. But they say defaults can be reduced almost as much by applying other rules that curb lending to certain types of borrowers.
Consider another set of mortgage rules, already put in place this year. These rules emphasize the affordability of the loan. Under them, a borrower's overall monthly debt payments cannot exceed 43 percent of personal income.
In his study, Professor Quercia of the University of North Carolina found that loans that complied with those rules defaulted at a relatively low rate during the housing bust. About 5.8 percent of them went bad, irrespective of how much the borrower put down.
He then calculated the losses on loans to borrowers in the same group who had down payments of at least 20 percent. The default rate on that smaller group was lower, at 3.9 percent.
But that lower rate came at a cost. More than half of the borrowers in his study group had to be excluded from the second calculation, because they didn't have down payments of 20 percent or more. This shows how restrictive a down payment rule could be, said Professor Quercia.
Some real estate analysts are skeptical of this approach. They assert that the new mortgage rules, which do not insist on down payments, may be relatively ineffective at preventing high levels of defaults.
The debt-payments-to-income ratio is not a strong predictor of whether a loan will default, said Thomas A. Lawler, a former chief economist of Fannie Mae who founded Lawler Economic and Housing Consulting, a research firm. ''It's not even in the top three,'' he said.
Also, Mr. Lawler and others who favor higher down payments argue that Professor Quercia's analysis underestimates the psychological and practical importance of the down payment. Borrowers who saved up for down payments may have budgeting skills that later help them make their payments, they argue, and borrowers with equity in their homes are less likely to walk away altogether, rather than try to find a solution.
Supporters of a down payment requirement also make a broader argument. They point out that the financial sector overhaul was not just meant to protect borrowers. It was also intended to make banks and financial markets more resilient to shocks like housing busts. In other words, the legislation always envisioned a trade-off between homeownership and the stability of the financial system.
''The key is what is the right balance between some risk and access,'' Professor Quercia said. ''Just looking at the risks is one-sided.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Obama's Delicate Task At Bush Library Event

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
DALLAS -- President Obama has left little mystery about how he views his predecessor. ''The failed policies of George W. Bush'' wiped away a budget surplus and ''squandered the legacy'' of bipartisan foreign policy. Mr. Bush put two wars ''on a credit card,'' led the country away ''from our values'' and ''crashed the economy.''
But Mr. Obama will surely say none of that when he helps dedicate the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum on Thursday. Addressing a crowd of Bush supporters and administration veterans, the 44th president will no doubt extol the virtues of the 43rd and praise his years of service to the country.
It has become an awkward ritual of the modern presidency that the current occupant of the Oval Office is called upon to deliver a generous historical judgment of the previous one. With the opening of each new presidential library, the members of the world's most exclusive fraternity put aside partisan differences to honor the shared experience of running the nation in difficult times. 
The task in such moments is especially acute when, as with Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush, the current and previous presidents come from opposing parties and such different sensibilities. The incumbent must hit grace notes without appearing inconsistent with past criticism or, worse, hypocritical. Sometimes a president goes through the motions, dutifully reading what aides put before him. Other times, library dedications have become bonding moments when presidents genuinely grow closer.
''When a president dedicates the library of someone he opposed politically, it's interesting and a bit of a challenge,'' said Michael Waldman, who was the chief speechwriter for President Bill Clinton when he helped President George Bush open his library in 1997. ''The best thing to do is focus on something that you can really embrace and mean it.''
Kenneth Khachigian, a chief speechwriter for President Ronald Reagan, said there was a formula: ''If you're a speechwriter, you can write a really nice speech about how Americans can fight and disagree and debate, but at the end of the day we're all Americans and we have the same goals, and I've learned that anybody who sits in this office really at the end of the day has the best interest of everyone at heart.''
That is a fair summation of what Reagan said in dedicating President Jimmy Carter's library in October 1986. In that case, the dedication came in the midst of a midterm election campaign, so the moment of conciliation was followed just weeks later by fairly tough language on the campaign trail in which Reagan criticized Mr. Carter's policies.
With no election at hand, Mr. Obama has more latitude, not having to worry about alienating his base, which still loathes Mr. Bush. A gracious speech could also fit into his outreach to Congressional Republicans.
The timing of the legislative calendar does give him some fodder for common ground with Mr. Bush. As he fights to liberalize the immigration system, Mr. Obama could use the speech to point out that he and Mr. Bush agree on the issue, implicitly pressuring other Republicans to join them.
That is not to say that Mr. Obama is putting away his partisan hat altogether. He flew to Dallas on Wednesday, a day early, to appear at a Democratic fund-raiser. At the ceremony on Thursday at the new Bush center, on the campus of Southern Methodist University, he will be joined by the elder Mr. Bush, Mr. Carter and Mr. Clinton.
At the event on Wednesday, Mr. Obama told donors: ''I'm really looking forward to attending the Bush library opening tomorrow. One of the things I will insist upon is whatever our political differences, President Bush loves this country and loves its people and shares that same concern, and was concerned about all people in America, not just those who voted Republican.''
But Mr. Bush's circle is anticipating the encounter with a certain suspicion. While the former president retreated to Texas after leaving office and has refrained from criticizing his successor, Mr. Obama made Mr. Bush a foil on the campaign trail, attributing the country's problems to the situation he inherited.
''A huge part of his messaging platform for his presidency has been the contrast, laying it off on his predecessor,'' said Dan Bartlett, who was the White House counselor under Mr. Bush. ''He's going to have to thread the needle.''
Mr. Bush's advisers bristled at Mr. Obama's Inaugural Address in 2009, when the new president criticized ''our collective failure to make hard choices'' and assured the world ''that we are ready to lead once more.'' They also thought that Mr. Obama was grudging when he unveiled Mr. Bush's portrait at the White House in 2012. Although Mr. Obama praised his predecessor's ''extraordinary strength and resolve'' after the Sept. 11 attacks, he noted ''just how breathtaking the financial crisis'' he had left behind turned out to be.
Marc Thiessen, a chief speechwriter in the Bush White House, said the test on Thursday would be whether Mr. Obama could be ''substantively generous,'' not just ''personally generous.'' In other words, would Mr. Obama acknowledge that despite their differences over Iraq, health care and other issues, Mr. Bush accomplished worthy things in office, like his fight against AIDS in Africa?
''He's never going to say this,'' Mr. Thiessen said, ''but if he's being totally honest, he would say that except for interrogations, he adopted almost the entire Bush counterterrorism policy, some of it voluntarily, some of it involuntarily, but most of it voluntarily.''
Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush have more in common than either might admit. They both value discipline and an orderly operation. They are both politicians intent on transformational presidencies. They both proved polarizing even though they arrived in Washington promising bipartisanship.
But they have never connected in a meaningful way, leaving many in both camps to watch closely how they interact on Thursday. Past library openings have proved to be bonding moments: Mr. Clinton praised the elder Mr. Bush at his library opening in 1997, and both Bushes returned the favor at his dedication seven years later. Mr. Clinton was touched and has since become a virtual adopted member of the Bush family.
''It was 2004 at the dedication of the Clinton library where the friendship was really renewed,'' said James L. Rutherford III, known as Skip, a longtime friend of Mr. Clinton's and the dean of the Clinton School of Public Service at the University of Arkansas. ''That's where they really bonded again and have remained good friends ever since.
''That's one of the beauties of the presidential library system,'' he added. ''That makes that possible.''

HEADLINE: Capital One Settles Charges It Understated Loan Losses

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Federal regulators on Wednesday accused Capital One and two of its executives of understating millions of dollars in auto loan losses suffered during the financial crisis.
The case, which the Securities and Exchange Commission agreed to settle with Capital One and the executives, illustrated a common financial misdeed during the crisis. As losses mounted in 2007 and 2008, some Wall Street firms covered up the woes from the public, prompting a wave of federal actions against Countrywide Financial and other lending giants.
In the case of Capital One's auto-lending business, according to the S.E.C., the bank ''materially understated'' its loan loss expenses and ''failed to maintain effective internal controls.'' The S.E.C. contended that Peter A. Schnall, who was Capital One's chief risk officer at the time, and David A. LaGassa, a lower-level executive, failed to prevent the improper statements. 
''Accurate financial reporting is a fundamental obligation for any public company, particularly a bank's accounting for its provision for loan losses during a time of severe financial distress,'' George Canellos, the co-chief of the S.E.C.'s enforcement unit, said in a statement. ''Capital One failed in this responsibility.''
But the S.E.C. could face questions over whether its penalties fit the crime. Capital One, one of the nation's biggest banks, paid $3.5 million to settle the case, a minuscule amount for a company of its size. And like most banks accused of wrongdoing during the 2008 crisis, Capital One was not required to admit or deny wrongdoing.
''The settlement does not require a restatement of Capital One's financial results,'' said a bank spokeswoman, Tatiana Stead. She added that the deal ''will not affect any current or future business activities by Capital One.''
The two executives also emerged relatively unscathed. Mr. Schnall agreed to pay an $85,000 penalty, and Mr. LaGassa settled for $50,000. Neither is barred from the securities industry. They are still employed by Capital One, though in different roles.
''The company continues to have confidence in Mr. Schnall and Mr. LaGassa and we believe that they can perform in their current roles with the company,'' Ms. Stead said.
Lawyers for both men did not respond to requests for comment.
The S.E.C.'s case stems from early 2007, when the subprime lending market was beginning to collapse. At Capital One's subprime auto-lending arm, the losses outpaced the bank's initial forecast.
The bank scrambled to react. Mr. LaGassa organized a ''swat team'' to diagnose the losses and provided almost daily e-mail updates to Capital One's senior executives. In an e-mail cited by the S.E.C., Mr. LaGassa warned he was ''not optimistic that we are going to suddenly see a slowing in losses.''
Ultimately, an internal ''loss forecasting tool'' traced the mounting problems to ''exogenous'' factors -- external problems like the souring economy.
But the bank, according to the S.E.C., looked the other way. For example, according to the S.E.C., Capital One failed to include any ''exogenous-driven losses'' in its assessment of the second quarter in 2007.
Capital One, the S.E.C. said in the order, ''gave insufficient weight to the evidence available at the time.''
The bank's actions, the S.E.C. said, caused the company to ''materially'' understate its loan loss expense in public filings. In the second quarter alone, Capital One understated the expense by up to $72 million, or about 18 percent.
''Financial institutions, especially those engaged in subprime lending practices, must have rigorous controls surrounding their process for estimating loan losses to prevent material misstatements of those expenses,'' Gerald W. Hodgkins, a senior S.E.C. enforcement official, said. ''The S.E.C. will not tolerate deficient controls surrounding an issuer's financial reporting obligations, including quarterly reporting obligations.''

DENVER -- If marijuana is legalized and properly regulated, its proponents have long said, it could generate millions of dollars in state tax revenue. But how the drug should be taxed has proved to be a thorny question.
In Colorado, where voters approved a measure in November legalizing small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, officials have been grappling with this issue for months as the state works to forge a cohesive regulatory code.
This week, legislators here will consider excise and sales taxes on marijuana of up to 30 percent combined. The proposal emerged from a task force of health officials, representatives of the state's rapidly developing marijuana industry and others that was commissioned last year to help develop rules for marijuana. 
The goal, task force members and lawmakers say, is to set taxes high enough to finance the administration of new laws, but not so high that customers are driven back to the black market.
''We should see a financial benefit as a state that can help pay for enforcement and other fundamental issues,'' said Christian Sederberg, a Denver lawyer on the panel whose firm helped draft Amendment 64, the measure legalizing recreational marijuana. ''The other side is that if you tax something too high, then you simply crowd out the regulated market. We're confident we'll find the right balance.''
Under the proposal, the first $40 million collected from a 15 percent excise tax would be used to build public schools. Revenue from a 15 percent sales tax imposed, in addition to the state's 2.9 percent sales tax and any local sales tax, would be apportioned to local governments and for enforcement.
A legislative hearing on the proposal, which would give lawmakers the flexibility to lower the tax rate, is scheduled for Thursday. The tax measure is one of several proposals related to marijuana regulation being debated this week.
State Representative Jonathan Singer, a Democrat from Longmont and the bill's sponsor, said finding the right tax rate was also a matter of public safety.
''The big thing is that we want to make sure we're able to put the appropriate safeguards in place so that marijuana doesn't end up in the hands of kids, criminals or cartels,'' he said.
Not everyone is certain that a tax is a good idea. Michael Elliott, executive director of the Medical Marijuana Industry Group here, said he feared that too heavy a tax could make it hard for any marijuana business to survive, because Colorado's black market is so entrenched.
Virtually all of the state's businesses that sell medical marijuana, which would be exempt from the taxes, will eventually shift over to selling the drug for recreational use as well. If taxes are too high, Mr. Elliott warned, those businesses could struggle and eventually close.
''Higher taxes on the legal, commercial model will prevent the transition to a legitimate market from happening and keep more people buying it illegally,'' he said.
Furthermore, if lawmakers pass the tax proposal, it will still require voter approval. Under a state constitutional amendment, tax increases are subject to a popular vote.
Meanwhile, projections over how much revenue the taxes might raise vary widely.
In Washington State, where voters in November passed a similar measure legalizing small amounts of marijuana for personal use, taxes will be levied in three tiers of 25 percent each on producers, processors and retailers. Those taxes were laid out in the initiative that voters approved, and will result in an effective rate for consumers of 44 percent, according to the state's Liquor Control Board, which will administer marijuana regulations.
A state study found that revenue from marijuana taxes could range from zero dollars, if Washington's marijuana laws are ultimately superseded by federal criminal law, to $2 billion over five years if a fully formed market develops. ''Nobody knows for sure how it will work out, but there are people who say they could grow and process marijuana at a lower price point than what is currently available illegally,'' said Brian Smith, a spokesman for the board.
Jeffrey Miron, an economics professor at Harvard University and a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian group, cautioned that while both states' approaches seemed reasonable, he doubted the taxes would create a substantial windfall.
Dr. Miron, who supports legalization, said that as long as federal marijuana laws continued to be unsettled, collecting taxes would be challenging. Moreover, he said, there is no way to predict how many customers would continue to buy on the black market.
After Prohibition ended in 1933, states levied taxes on alcohol, in part because they were desperate for revenue after the Great Depression. But that shift, Dr. Miron noted, was undertaken with the full support of the federal government.
''It's easy to get a little overexcited that legalizing marijuana is going to solve the world's budgetary problems,'' Dr. Miron said. ''But the question for the tax revenue part of this will be how much the federal government allows these markets to come completely above ground.''

HEADLINE: On Beyond Fear

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
The homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, testified on Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the Senate's bipartisan immigration bill. For hours, in a calm and methodical manner, she flipped each confrontational line of questioning on its head. No, the bill would not loosen security at borders and ports. It would tighten it. The bill would not weaken immigration enforcement, but strengthen it -- adding resources and improving the government's ability to keep unwanted people out and to catch fugitives, identify thieves and terrorists. 
Ms. Napolitano's testimony filled the last of three days of hearings on the immigration bill, a marathon featuring more than two dozen witnesses from all corners of the country -- sort of an immigration Woodstock. Within those three days and the bill's 844 pages lay a dizzying blizzard of details, but after Ms. Napolitano wrapped things up, a clearer picture started to emerge.
A veteran of the immigration battles could have watched her speak and still have been amazed at the vast sums of money and resources that have been sent to militarize America's southern border, as if the people flowing across it were an existential threat rather than a problem and opportunity to be controlled and redirected. Ms. Napolitano's testimony evoked a world of drones, radar and motion sensors, Border Patrol agents and National Guard troops, fencing and razor wire stretching for miles and miles. The bill calls for up to $6.5 billion in new spending, with expanded workplace-verification and entry-exit visa systems, and still more boots and fencing.
What was especially striking was how much of this enforcement has already been accomplished, even as the country keeps waiting for the broader, once-in-a-generation immigration overhaul that this bill -- and a companion bill being written in the House -- is trying to achieve.
The bill was only just filed and may not pass. The opponents of reform are intense in their desire to break it apart or stall it until it dies. Their arguments against the bill itself are unpersuasive -- who could oppose making the system fairer and more efficient, clearing backlogs in legal immigration, or creating a more rational and streamlined visa process to supply the economy with the labor it needs, from Silicon Valley to dairy farms to citrus groves?
What they do have is fear and anxiety, intensified by the Boston bombings. One witness on Monday, Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state and an outsize figure in the nation's anti-immigration battles, argued at length about how the bill might allow a hypothetical terrorist calling himself ''Rumpelstiltskin'' to get his papers and travel as freely as the Boston suspects did.
As Senator Charles Schumer of New York correctly noted, the bill's opposition grows from one root: restrictionist organizations that see no good in immigration short of mass deportation. They have profited immensely from fear, as the bristling southern border attests. But the flip side of fear is hope, exemplified by the host of witnesses on the other side -- the growers, business owners, ministers, state officials, human-rights advocates and undocumented people themselves who have the better argument.

HEADLINE: Moving Past the Last Balkan War

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
At a time of disillusionment about the state of the European Union, a diplomatic deal between Serbia and Kosovo highlights some of the more positive features of the institution that won last year's Nobel Peace Prize but fumbled the euro crisis. The tentative agreement signed last Friday not only shows that the European Union can perform well but also that it remains an attractive destination for countries that aspire to membership. 
The conflict, which pitted Serbia against its former province of Kosovo, and Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority against its ethnic Serbian minority, burst into war between NATO and Serbia in 1999 and remains a potential flash point. The compromise solution skillfully and patiently negotiated by the European Union's top diplomat, Catherine Ashton, makes it possible for both countries to move forward economically and, not incidentally, pursue their bids for European Union membership. One feature gives Kosovo's Serbs limited autonomy over health care and education and representation in top police posts and courts in areas where they predominate while preserving the Kosovo government's overall legal authority. Another is an understanding that neither government will stand in the way of the other's admission to the European Union.
Serbia has not yet agreed to officially recognize Kosovo, but it has now taken important first steps. The United States played no direct role in these negotiations, but it should be very pleased with the outcome. No country has done more over the years -- first to organize NATO's protection of Kosovars from Serbian atrocities, and then to sponsor Kosovo's emergence as an independent state, now recognized by more than 90 countries. Last week's agreement, if fully carried out, promises a more constructive future for both the winners and losers of the 1999 war.

HEADLINE: Parish Split on How to Manage $2 Billion Legacy of a Queen

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN

 BODY:
There has never been any doubt that Trinity Church is wealthy. But the extent of its wealth has long been a mystery; guessed at by many, known by few.
Now, however, after a lawsuit filed by a disenchanted parishioner, the church has offered an estimate of the value of its assets: more than $2 billion.
The Episcopal parish, known as Trinity Wall Street, traces its holdings to a gift of 215 acres of prime Manhattan farmland donated in 1705 by Queen Anne of England. Since then, the church has parlayed that gift into a rich portfolio of office buildings, stock investments and, soon, mixed-use residential development.
The parish's good fortune has become an issue in the historic congregation, which has been racked by infighting in recent years over whether the church should be spending more money to help the poor and spread the faith, in New York and around the world. Differences over the parish's mission and direction last year led nearly half the 22-member vestry -- an august collection of corporate executives and philanthropists -- to resign or be pushed out, after at least seven of them asked, unsuccessfully, that the rector himself step down. 
Over the years, the church has sold or given away much of the original 215 acres from Queen Anne, but it has 14 acres, including 5.5 million square feet of commercial real estate.
It reported $158 million in real estate revenue for 2011, the majority of which went toward maintaining and supporting its real estate operations, the financial statement indicates. Of the $38 million left for the church's operating budget, some $4 million was spent on communications, $3 million on philanthropic grant spending and $2.5 million on the church's music program, church officials said. Nearly $6 million went to maintain Trinity's historic properties, including the main church building, which was built in 1846; St. Paul's Chapel; and several cemeteries, where luminaries including Alexander Hamilton and Edward I. Koch are buried. The remainder went into the church's equity investment portfolio.
Critics argue that the church could have a higher profile as a beacon of charity and Episcopal belief. ''I felt that the church was being too corporate and wasn't acting on its values,'' said Jeremy C. Bates, the congregant who filed the lawsuit and a former leader of the church's Congregational Council.
But not all parishioners agree.
''Given the resources, I think they do exactly what they should be doing,'' said Susan V. Berresford, a current member of the vestry and the former head of the Ford Foundation. ''This, I think, is a first-class philanthropic operation and one that is using its resources very wisely.''
The vast majority of the parish's property is in Hudson Square, a commercial neighborhood next to the Manhattan entrance to the Holland Tunnel. These days, the area's hulking prewar industrial buildings, designed for use by printing companies, are increasingly occupied by creative and technology companies, with restaurants and galleries on the street level.
''The Trinity Church properties are now among the most valuable in all of New York City, because they are sitting on the edge of the hottest neighborhoods in the city -- SoHo, TriBeCa and Greenwich Village,'' said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University. ''Trinity has been either very wise or very prudent, but they have let the market mature around them, and now they are ready to take advantage of it.''
The church, which calls itself ''one of the largest landowners in Manhattan,'' has also been building an equity investment portfolio that was worth about $160 million in 2011. And the value of Trinity's real estate holdings is expected to grow because rezoning of much of the church's land will allow up to 3,200 new residential units, with the first large project planned for Duarte Square on Canal Street.
''The legacy of Queen Anne is that Trinity Church is going to prosper in the 21st century,'' Mr. Moss said. ''Who says that the empire doesn't live on?''
Mr. Bates, who says he wants the church to be more accountable to its members, argues in his lawsuit that the parish vestry, which acts largely as Trinity's board of directors, is being elected contrary to the terms of the church's original 1697 charter.
Mr. Bates claims that each vestry candidate must receive a majority of parishioners' votes to be elected. The church says that even one ''yes'' vote is enough if the candidate is uncontested; all the seats are uncontested. The parish has asked for the suit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, to be dismissed. The dispute over spending and governance is, in part, a dispute over the leadership of the Rev. James H. Cooper, who has been the church's rector since 2004.
''You have diminished Trinity Church, and you have created a glaring atmosphere of deceit,'' wrote one longtime vestry member, Lorraine LaHuta, in her 2012 resignation letter.
The vestry resignations last year caused a minor media splash, as did Trinity's tumultuous relationship with the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011. Trinity gave refuge and bathroom space to protesters at a community center, Charlotte's Place, but then stood by as protesters were arrested for trespassing on the part of Duarte Square owned by the church. The protesters were furious, and camped out outside Trinity for months.
Mr. Cooper, 68, weathered the storms, and this year helped select a new vestry more supportive of his leadership. But he also announced in February that he was planning to resign in 2015 -- a decision he called unrelated to the recent turmoil. He said he believed the rezoning, which could turn Trinity's holdings into a more vibrant neighborhood, would be remembered as one of the major accomplishments of Trinity during his time as rector.
The church agreed with one complaint in the lawsuit: Mr. Bates's assertion that he should be entitled to see the church's financial statement. The 2011 statement was released to the public in March; the 2012 statement is due out in May.
Trinity has released other estimates of its wealth over its 315-year history, but none recently. From 1909 to 1939, parishioners could find bare-bones annual statements at their pews; before that, the last disclosures beyond the vestry were in 1814.
''Trinity is moving more and more toward a transparent, modern system of governance, though not without bumps and bruises and pain,'' said Mr. Cooper, adding that he supported the disclosure.
Some details are not included on the form, church officials said, like Mr. Cooper's $475,000 annual salary -- which rises to a total compensation of $1.3 million when his pension and the estimated cost of his residence in a $5.5 million, church-owned SoHo town house are added. For at least some of the defecting vestrymen -- who complained Mr. Cooper was circumventing them in decision-making, subverting a review of his leadership and de-emphasizing religious education and philanthropy while obsessing about reconstructing the church's administrative headquarters at 74 Trinity Place -- those numbers rankle.
Mr. Cooper said he believed the church had the right balance between ministry, charity and its real estate business.
''Of course I do, and so does the current vestry,'' he said, adding that the goal of nurturing Trinity's property holdings is to increase the future operating budget for philanthropy and church operations.
The church's annual grants, some of which go to support parishes in Africa, remained stable during the recent recession, he added, and were now at $3.2 million, their highest level since 1991. In addition, he said nearly all of Trinity's spending -- from its free concerts to its open doors to hosting millions of tourists a year -- was a ''gift to the city.''
Mr. Cooper seemed tired as he sat surrounded by portraits of former rectors in a church office. ''I'm a strong believer that leadership has seasons, and my season is in the eighth or ninth inning of the game,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Fed's Forceful Voice on Inflation A Possible Bernanke Successor

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In July 1996, the Federal Reserve broke the metronomic routine of its closed-door policy-making meetings to hold an unusual debate. The Fed's powerful chairman, Alan Greenspan, saw a chance for the first time in decades to drive annual inflation all the way down to zero, achieving the price stability he had long regarded as the central bank's primary mission.
But Janet L. Yellen, then a relatively new and little-known Fed governor, talked Mr. Greenspan to a standstill that day, arguing that a little inflation was a good thing. She marshaled academic research that showed it would reduce the depth and frequency of recessions, articulating a view that has prevailed at the Fed. And as the Fed's vice chairwoman since 2010, Ms. Yellen has played a leading role in cementing the central bank's commitment to keep prices rising about 2 percent each year.
Ms. Yellen is now widely viewed as a logical candidate to succeed the current Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, when his term ends in January 2014. She has worked closely with him in shaping and building support for the Fed's campaign to stimulate the economy and bring down unemployment. 
But some of Ms. Yellen's critics remain wary. They worry that she would not be sufficiently concerned about the possibility that inflation will accelerate as the economic recovery gains strength. If nominated, she could face opposition from Senate Republicans who have repeatedly expressed concern that the Fed's campaign would destabilize financial markets and make controlling the pace of inflation more difficult.
''I think people read Janet Yellen's speeches as saying that she puts a higher weight on joblessness compared to inflation'' than the typical member of the Fed's policy-making committee, said Vincent Reinhart, formerly the head of the Fed's monetary policy staff and now the chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. ''And that includes Ben Bernanke.''
He added, however, that her nomination would be unlikely to shake financial markets because she already exercises considerable influence, so any shift in policy would most likely be modest.
Moreover, Ms. Yellen's personal qualities, highlighted by the 1996 episode, have helped her win supporters even among her ideological opponents.
''She makes an argument on the merits and she sticks with it,'' said Alan Blinder, an economics professor at Princeton nominated to the Fed alongside Ms. Yellen in 1994. ''And she's good at articulating an argument in a way that doesn't leave people on the other side hopping mad at her.''
Despite their disagreement at the time, Mr. Greenspan said that he continued to hold Ms. Yellen in high regard. ''I did listen to her more carefully because she articulates her position in a way that you can follow it analytically,'' he said in an interview. ''Intuitions are useless. Janet's conversation and her presentations were factually based, and that always got my attention.''
If confirmed, Ms. Yellen would become the first woman to lead a major central bank. She is 66, seven years older than Mr. Bernanke. She would be 71 by the end of a four-year term as chairwoman. But she remains in good health, and friends say that, like other prominent women of her generation, she regards herself as being in the prime of a late-blooming career. Nor would she be the oldest person to lead the Fed. Mr. Greenspan began his fifth and final term in 2004 at 78.
Ms. Yellen, slight, white-haired and described by one colleague as a ''small lady with a large I.Q.,'' does not loom like Paul Volcker nor cut like Mr. Greenspan. Her personal style more closely resembles Mr. Bernanke's soft-spoken manner. The force of her arguments can catch people by surprise.
Kevin Hassett, a staff economist at the Fed when Ms. Yellen arrived in 1994, recalled that she started to eat lunch regularly in the staff cafeteria to subvert the hierarchical system that limited communication between Fed governors and the vast army of research economists. Other governors had tried to change the rules but Ms. Yellen, he said, found a way around them.
''It showed a kind of grace and wisdom that is very unusual in Washington,'' said Mr. Hassett, now a fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute.
Mr. Hassett is among those who worry that Ms. Yellen does not place a sufficient emphasis on controlling inflation. ''But I hold her in the highest possible regard,'' he said. If the Obama administration is ''going to pick a Fed chair that thinks the way they do, then Janet Yellen would be the best possible choice.''
There has been no official word from the White House or Mr. Bernanke that the Fed will have a new chairman next year. The decision is up to Mr. Obama, and aides say he has not yet focused on who he wants in the job.
But Mr. Bernanke may have signaled his departure last week when the Fed announced that he planned to skip an annual summer conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. The Fed's chairman has attended the event in each of the previous 25 years.
People who have spoken with Mr. Bernanke say he is tired after leading the Fed through eight years that were mostly consumed by crisis. Mr. Bernanke has also sought to make monetary policy more transparent and predictable, dispelling the image of the Fed chairman as a kind of artist. ''I don't think that I'm the only person in the world who can manage the exit'' from the Fed's current policies, he said last month. The only way to prove that point would be to let someone else do it.
President Obama, for his part, has the opportunity to nominate the first Democrat to lead the Federal Reserve since President Carter chose Mr. Volcker in 1979 -- and the person he selects will serve a term that extends two years beyond his own.
Ms. Yellen has avoided questions about her future, but she, too, appeared to address the subject indirectly this month. Asked about the dearth of female economic policy makers, she responded that it was ''something we're going to see increase over time, and it's time for that to happen.''
She declined a request to be interviewed for this article.
There are other potential candidates for the job, including Roger W. Ferguson Jr. and Professor Blinder, both former Fed officials, and economic advisers to Mr. Obama including Timothy F. Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers. But Ms. Yellen appears to be the front-runner in a race that has not actually started quite yet.
None of the other obvious candidates possess the same combination of academic credentials and policy-making experience. No Fed chairman has been as deeply steeped in both the theory and practice of central banking.
''In the realm of plausible candidates, she is by far the best,'' said Christina Romer, a former chairwoman of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers who is an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. She has known Ms. Yellen for years and counts her as a friend.
Asked who else she would recommend that the president consider for the job, Ms. Romer responded, ''I would stop after No. 1.''
Ms. Yellen, born in Brooklyn in 1946, has said that she became interested in economics as a way of thinking logically about how to help people. She studied at Yale under the Nobel laureate James Tobin, a leading proponent of the view that governments could mitigate recessions. Professor Tobin, now dead, told Business Week magazine in 1997 that Ms. Yellen had ''a genius for expressing complicated arguments simply and clearly.''
She built an academic career at Berkeley together with her husband, the economist George A. Akerlof, whom she met in a Fed cafeteria. Much of their work together highlighted flaws in the economic theory that markets operate efficiently, a theory that basically treats government policy as inherently costly. Their work showed that government, including central banks, could indeed adopt economic policies that improved people's lives.
Colleagues and people familiar with their work said that Professor Akerlof, who shared the Nobel in economics in 2001 with Joseph E. Stiglitz and A. Michael Spence, was the more creative thinker, while Professor Yellen was more rigorous
''George can sometimes go off in a direction that is untethered from the real world, and Janet was better at bringing it back,'' said Professor Romer, who joined the Berkeley economics faculty with her husband and collaborator, David Romer, about a decade after Ms. Yellen and Mr. Akerlof.
In 1994, the Clinton administration nominated Ms. Yellen to the Fed on the recommendation of Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a colleague at Berkeley then serving as the head of the Council of Economic Advisers.
Ms. Yellen and Professor Blinder were chosen to check the Fed's tendency to curtail growth for fear of inflation. But in an unlikely twist, Mr. Greenspan became the strongest advocate for letting the economy grow more quickly, and Ms. Yellen helped provide intellectual justification for keeping interest rates low.
''She was much more aware of the current state of academic literature on fairly technical issues,'' Mr. Greenspan recalled. ''I found her very useful in that regard.''
At the time of the 1996 debate, inflation had fallen to a relatively stable pace of about 3 percent a year, eliminating much of the unpredictability that had plagued the economy. Mr. Greenspan saw clear benefits in pushing all the way to zero. But some economists worried that lower inflation might result in permanently higher unemployment, by making it difficult to adjust wages. And it would bring the economy dangerously close to deflation, the destabilizing condition in which falling prices freeze economic activity as people anticipate lower prices.
''I believe that heading toward 2 percent inflation would be a good idea, and that we should do so in a slow fashion, looking at what happens along the way,'' Ms. Yellen said at the 1996 meeting. The debate continued for years; the Fed finally adopted a 2 percent inflation target last year.
But Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor, recalled the 1996 meeting as a turning point. ''She was the one who really brought the story that inflation could be too low,'' said Mr. Meyer, a senior adviser at MacroEconomic Advisers. ''And she was very effective. Once she said it, it seemed so obvious and sensible.''
Ms. Yellen began a second stint at the Fed in 2004 when she was named president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. She has played a leading role in the Fed's movement to provide ''forward guidance'' about the path of policy over the next several years, persuading investors that it is safe to accept lower interest rates.
But it is easy to overstate her differences with those more focused on inflation. ''I think I am as committed to price stability and the attainment of price stability as any member of the F.O.M.C.,'' a reference to the Federal Open Market Committee, Ms. Yellen said at a 2010 luncheon in Los Angeles. ''When the time has come, am I going to support raising interest rates? You bet.''

HEADLINE: Learning From China, But What?

BYLINE: By YU HUA. 
Yu Hua, the author of ''China in Ten Words,'' is a guest columnist. This column was translated by Allan H. Barr from the Chinese.

 BODY:
BEIJING
The announcement that Stephen A. Schwarzman, the American private equity executive, will create a $300 million scholarship program for foreign students to attend Tsinghua University (with a third of the money coming out of his own pocket) made headlines in the West this week. The program will pay for 200 students to come to China each year, the bulk of them from the United States.
Although it's reportedly one of the largest donations ever for global education, the gift has not attracted special attention in China, where it has been reported mainly by financial newspapers and Web sites, and not in depth. Microbloggers, an important barometer of public opinion, haven't shown much interest, either. A few praised Schwarzman, chief executive of the Blackstone Group, for his largess. Others, pointing to Blackstone's purchase late last year of a high-end office complex in downtown Shanghai, are convinced that his generosity is really intended to enable his company to make more money in China. They note that Tsinghua -- founded in 1911 with American support -- has graduated legions of top government officials, including the new president, Xi Jinping, his predecessor, Hu Jintao, and the former premier Zhu Rongji. 
Yet a third group of commentators have been smug: ''Now we teach them,'' one wrote. This writer probably meant two things.
One is role reversal: like their counterparts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, who went abroad to help modernize their country, young Chinese have thronged North American and Western European universities since China's economy opened in the early 1980s. Now that China has become a huge market, young Westerners want to study our language, culture and economy.
The writer's other message: if Western businesspeople want to make money in China, they need to learn how to defer to our government and ingratiate themselves with our officials.
In the 1980s, when purchasing groups representing the Chinese government began traveling to the West, their hosts would often celebrate deals by opening bottles of Champagne. The Chinese were miffed: We spent so much money buying your stuff, and you won't even treat us to a proper banquet! It didn't take long before Western businesspeople realized that if they wanted to peddle their wares in China, they needed to see to it that the officials enjoyed junkets and ate well.
Not long ago the government, for reasons it wouldn't explain, began a campaign against Apple. It started on March 15 with a broadcast of China Central Television's annual consumer protection show. Samsung, the Korean technology manufacturer, gets a lot of consumer complaints in China, but it spent a great deal on TV advertising during the show, and other companies with quality problems that had been spotlighted by CCTV did the same -- so they all avoided being raked over the coals. Apple, according to news accounts, did not do so. In the two weeks following the broadcast, the state-controlled media published over a hundred articles criticizing Apple's customer service.
Most microblog posts on the subject, however, came out in Apple's defense: ordinary Chinese were disgusted that their government, which had done so little to investigate the quality and safety of domestically manufactured consumer products, was now making such a big deal about an Apple warranty policy affecting the back cover of the iPhone.
This incident was reminiscent of an episode three years ago, when Eric E. Schmidt, then Google's chief executive and now its executive chairman, took a stand against online censorship in China and redirected users to Google's Hong Kong site. In contrast, Apple's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, adopted a conciliatory posture and made an unusual, formal apology.
A Qing dynasty humor collection offers the following joke: a simpleton approaches a city gate, carrying a long bamboo pole. He tries holding the pole level in front of him, but it's too wide to fit. He tries holding it vertically, but it won't fit that way, either. An old man suggests a solution of sorts: he can get through if he breaks the pole in half.
In retelling this story, what I mean is this: if Western businessmen want to make money in China, they need to follow the government's instructions, even if those instructions defy common sense. Three years ago, Mr. Schmidt refused to break the pole, wanting to carry it by his side as he walked -- only to find the gate slammed in his face.
Someone asked me this week, ''Would Apple have caved in to the Chinese government if tough old Steve Jobs were still around?'' I replied that a more interesting question should be posed to Mr. Schmidt: ''Are you sorry you didn't break the pole in two?''

HEADLINE: The Joy (and Despair) of Cooking

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Pollan Cooks!'' (column, April 18), Mark Bittman urges us all to cook from scratch and leave prepared foods on the store shelf. Late in my life, I've learned to do that, with tremendous personal satisfaction.
As a retiree, I have time. I had to get over fear of cooking (burning, overseasoning, menu timing). But what about the many who feel too tired or too pressed? 
You should start small. Master an easy recipe that you like, and cook it once a week till habits form and confidence builds. Add another recipe involving different techniques; master that. Begin to substitute ingredients in the recipes you've practiced.
As you take small risks and observe altered outcomes, you'll be enjoying the rewards of kitchen creativity. You'll decide to cook more regularly. (You'll buy a decent knife and a cast-iron skillet!) You could end up with a joyous hobby. And live longer.
BLANCHARD HIATT Hallandale, Fla., April 18, 2013
To the Editor:
Michael Pollan is right. Mark Bittman is right. I know that they're right, and yet I will not cook.
Even though I know I should, I will not cook, beyond the intermittent grilled cheese or the odd lasagna (both bitterly resented for the brief time I spend preparing them).
Why won't I cook? Because I hate cooking. I have always felt that people who like to cook genuinely cannot understand people who hate to cook, who would rather be doing anything else; they always qualify our professed dislike, as Mr. Bittman does when he writes that people ''say'' that ''they just don't like it.''
I don't care how easy it is. I'm not claiming merely to not like cooking; I honestly can't stand it. For me and for many people like me, it's not a matter of economics or time management or gender or education.
It's a choice, and like so many other choices that people make, it may be wrong, it may be harmful, I may be doing myself and my children a disservice. But I still won't cook, and I'm really tired of the moralizing legions of cooking enthusiasts telling me that I must.
WENDY SCHOR-HAIM Jersey City, April 18, 2013
To the Editor:
Mark Bittman quotes the author Michael Pollan as saying we need to ''rebuild a culture of cooking,'' and ''we need to bring back home ec, but a gender-neutral home ec.''
Children are not learning how to cook at home or at school. The schools have forgotten to teach the basics. With the teaching of home ec must come an understanding of basic nutrition and why it is important to learn to eat and cook healthful foods, and maybe to learn what a portion size really is.
Perhaps now could be the time to encourage families and schools to teach children the most basic of skills: to be able to provide their own healthful, home-cooked meals for a lifetime.
AVIS R. WALS Rye Brook, N.Y., April 18, 2013
The writer is a registered dietitian.
To the Editor:
Mark Bittman writes that big food companies have alienated us from the beauty, fun and health benefits of home cooking. But as a home cook (I love to cook and make virtually everything my family eats from scratch), I don't recognize myself in Mr. Bittman's definition of some iconic home cook.
I bake my own bread, but it's often white, not whole grain. I rarely buy organic (too expensive). And while Mr. Bittman says home cooks aren't going to choose to make their own French fries (too much trouble), that's my family's favorite dish.
Please, give us home cooks a break. Home cooking has many benefits -- it's lower cost, generally more healthful and tastes better -- but a mystical, organic, locally sourced experience isn't one of them. Not in my house anyway.
YVETTE ALT MILLER Northbrook, Ill., April 18, 2013
The writer is the author of ''Angels at the Table: A Practical Guide to Celebrating Shabbat.''
To the Editor:
If we Americans have strayed so far from fundamentals as to need a reminder about the benefits of home cooking, I'd add that kitchen work, even at the simplest level, is full of life lessons that transcend the food.
Cooking rewards planning, punctuality, stick-to-itiveness and, when one is caught short, ingenuity; it promotes satisfaction in a job well done and instills forbearance when things don't go as planned. Those are among the building blocks of good character.
As a former copy chief at Saveur and Bon Appétit magazines, I've been fortunate to work with food editors and test-kitchen staffers. I've found that crowd ranks high in equanimity, perhaps because their food-related tasks are a link with the essential practicalities of life.
Put in full context, the savings and good nutrition that come with home cooking almost amount to gravy.

HEADLINE: Boom Times in Paraguay Leave Many Behind

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
ASUNCIÓN, Paraguay -- Walk into the headquarters of the central bank of Paraguay, a sprawling seven-story structure surrounded by flowering silk floss trees, and the message is clear: officials proudly display charts showing a dizzying economic boom, with growth reaching 13 percent this year, making Paraguay the fastest-growing country in the Americas.
But just a few minutes away by car one recent morning, grandmothers waded through raw sewage in the labyrinthine slum of La Chacarita, scavenging copper wire and aluminum cans to sell at scrap yards.
''Tell me about this growth,'' said Cecilia Aguirre, 60, grasping a plastic bag holding her day's takings, worth about $4. Squinting under the hot sun, she said she worked every day to feed the four grandchildren who live in her home. Asked about Paraguay's robust economy, she added, ''I've heard of no such thing in my lifetime.'' 
Indeed, Paraguay's economic boom, fueled by bountiful harvests of export commodities like soybeans and corn, exists only in pockets. In parts of Asunción, showrooms are selling out of Porsches and Audis, and cranes are putting the finishing touches on luxury towers like the Ícono, a 37-story skyscraper of SoHo-inspired lofts.
Yet much of the country, which has long figured among South America's poorest and most unequal nations, remains left behind. More than 30 percent of the population lives in poverty, according to the central bank, and Paraguay ranks near the bottom among South American countries in reducing poverty over the last decade, according to the United Nations.
Social spending for antipoverty projects is minimal, largely because taxation is lacking. Paraguay did not even have an income tax until this year, but even though the new across-the-board rate is low, at 10 percent, few people are expected to pay it, as exemptions and loopholes abound. The result: the economic boom may be accentuating the festering inequality in one of Latin America's most politically unstable nations.
''Nearly all of the growth is driven by highly mechanized agriculture, which generates few jobs for the population,'' said Andrew Nickson, an expert on Paraguay's development policies at the University of Birmingham in Britain. ''With a government that finances itself largely through value-added taxes and taxes on imports, you have a situation rather like a low-income African country.''
Paraguay is a landlocked nation about the size of California, sandwiched between southern Brazil and northern Argentina, with a population of 6.5 million. About 77 percent of its arable land is controlled by 1 percent of the nation's landowners, according to the last agricultural census, and land disputes simmer in various parts of the country.
Activists claim that for decades large tracts of land were illegally distributed by corrupt officials, leaving many land titles in question. In one particularly bloody clash last June, 11 peasants and six police officers were killed at a soy estate in Curuguaty, in eastern Paraguay.
Legislators seized on that episode as a way to oust Fernando Lugo, the former Roman Catholic bishop who was elected president in 2008, ending six decades of one-party rule. Mr. Lugo had initially been expected to focus on reducing inequality, but faced obstacles in doing so.
Paraguay's new president is one of the nation's wealthiest men, the tobacco magnate Horacio Cartes, who was elected Sunday after promoting conservative, business-friendly policies during his campaign. He recognized poverty as an issue but has been vague about any plans for reducing it beyond trying to create more jobs through private investment.
The government's economists remain bullish about growth, arguing that Paraguay, devastated by a 19th-century war that wiped out most of its male population and ruled throughout much of the 20th century by Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, one of the world's longest-ruling dictators, is emerging from decades of ostracism in the global economy.
Paraguay sold $500 million of bonds in January in international markets, a rare source of financing for a nation overlooked by many foreign bankers for decades. Inflation and unemployment remain low, at less than 2 percent and less than 6 percent, respectively, and the overall poverty rate has fallen to about 32 percent in 2011 from 44 percent in 2003, said Roland Horst, a board member at the central bank.
''We do have a peasant issue now and then,'' Mr. Horst said in an interview. ''But there is less tension than 10 years ago.'' He said the government had been trying to reduce poverty, noting that a program of giving small cash stipends to people in extreme poverty, begun in 2005, now included more than 75,000 families. Other economists, however, dispute such sunny assessments, arguing that the economy remains subject to wide swings, surging this year thanks in part to favorable weather conditions for certain crops, after contracting slightly in 2012 when farmers struggled with a drought.
They also contend that Paraguay's social welfare programs remain meager compared with antipoverty projects in neighboring countries, which have lifted tens of millions of people out of abject living conditions. They blame Paraguay's relatively weak state, with tax collection corresponding to only about 18 percent of gross domestic product, a figure lower than that of African nations like Congo and Chad.
''The statistics showing historically low unemployment are a farce,'' said Luis Rojas Villagra, an economist at the National University, who estimates that as much as half of Paraguay's work force is unemployed or underemployed in jobs with degrading wages and working conditions.
''How is it possible to reconcile the fact that hundreds of people survive each day by sifting through garbage in the municipal dump of Asunción while Paraguayans are also the biggest per-capita spenders in Punta del Este?'' said Mr. Rojas Villagra, referring to the Uruguayan resort city where rich Paraguayans vacation alongside moneyed Argentines and Brazilians.
Such contrasts persist across Paraguay's economy. Pockets of luxury, for instance, are expanding near Ciudad del Este, the city on the Brazilian border renowned as a smuggler's haven.
One development, the Paraná Country Club, includes mansions selling for more than $3 million, largely to soybean growers or business executives from Brazil who have opened factories in Paraguay, a migration of manufacturing that is starting to resemble that of companies from the United States opening factories in low-wage Mexican border cities.
''2013 is starting to look like an amazing year,'' said Thelma Amaral, an architect who designs homes near Ciudad del Este.
But elsewhere, including the soybean regions at the root of the growth, examples abound of disparities and disputes, largely over land. A small leftist rebel group, the Paraguayan People's Army, has been picking off security forces in remote areas. Last weekend, the group killed at least one police officer and wounded several others.
In December, gunmen shot dead Vidal Vega, a leader of the peasant movement involved in the deadly clash at Curuguaty. He had been expected to be a witness at the criminal trial intended to shed light on the massacre. The inquiry into his killing, as in similar cases of peasant leaders killed in Paraguay in recent years, has turned up few leads.

HEADLINE: A Wholesaler Finds Himself in Competition With Retail Clients

BYLINE: By JOHN GROSSMANN

 BODY:
Based in Miami, Source Outdoor is a five-year-old importer and wholesaler of patio and deck furniture owned by Gerald Shvartsman. From humble beginnings, in which he tried to sell his first containers of goods himself, Mr. Shvartsman, 35, has expanded his one-man start-up to encompass more than 50 employees and sales in 2012 of $7 million.
Although Mr. Shvartsman ships to hotels and resorts beyond his home state, he does the bulk of his business in South Florida, where he strives to deliver exceptional customer service, more in keeping with a small retail shop than a wholesaler.
THE CHALLENGE Having established five channels of distribution, Mr. Shvartsman found himself worrying that he might have to forgo his most profitable channel -- a direct-to-consumers approach that was starting to offend his wholesale clients. 
THE BACKGROUND A Toronto native, Mr. Shvartsman learned his first sales lessons at the age of 7, helping his parents sell jewelry at a Sunday flea market. He was smart, but he struggled in school because of an undiagnosed attention deficit disorder.
Passing on college, he went into business with his older brother in a 36,000-square-foot nightclub with 150 employees. Next, the brothers sold mall advertising on food court tabletops and ran a company that erected walls bearing ''Coming Soon'' announcements for obscure mall shops under renovation.
On the lookout for opportunities, Mr. Shvartsman had an aha! moment when he went to buy deck furniture for the patio of his family's Miami condo.
''A sectional to seat four or five? Fifteen thousand dollars,'' he recalled. ''Chaise longues? One thousand dollars apiece. I was flabbergasted. I looked in store after store, but I couldn't afford to buy what I like.''
Knowing nothing about the furniture industry, Mr. Shvartsman assumed he could jump in at a lower price and win buyers.
''My mother raised me to think there was no such thing as barriers to entry for me,'' he said.
He disregarded the rumblings of the looming recession, as well as the industry's old-school way of selling to retail stores through representatives. When his first four containers of outdoor furniture arrived from China, Mr. Shvartsman became a one-man sales force. He personally called and visited every furniture retailer in a 60-mile radius.
''I started attacking them,'' he said. ''In a short time, all had some of my furniture in their store or were selling off my catalog, which at the time was terrible.''
Then he opened several other South Florida distribution channels. He struck deals with local decorators and designers, and also with condos that needed half a dozen sectionals and dozens of chairs for each ground-level pool. Starting with one enterprising online furniture seller, Mr. Shvartsman also began fulfilling orders taken over the Internet by other businesses. Retail stores and online sellers paid him 60 percent off full price. Decorators, designers and condos got his goods for 50 percent off.
But Mr. Shvartsman also sold his furniture another way. As many as six or seven times a year he would fill a truck and unload it at a big Florida home show, selling directly to the public.
Most of these sales were at full price, with markups greater than 300 percent over his own costs -- the equivalent of grand slams versus the singles of selling to furniture retailers and the doubles of selling to decorators and condo associations.
Even the home-show items he discounted were generally slow-selling pieces that had been clogging his warehouse and that he was only too happy to move, especially at markups around 100 percent.
But one day in 2010, his third year in business, Mr. Shvartsman answered the phone and found his second-best retail customer on the line with a beef.
''Gerald,'' said the Fort Lauderdale furniture store owner. ''I understand you're doing home shows. I know that's important to you, but we're your customer. It's not fair to us. You might be taking our sales.''
Mr. Shvartsman feared such a call might come, and he had already been weighing the pros and cons.
THE OPTIONS On the plus side, the direct-to-homeowner sales were by far his most profitable. In 2009, they accounted for $400,000 of his total sales of $1.9 million. The home-show sales also allowed him to unload his mistakes -- slow-selling designs and styles -- at a profit. As for being in direct competition with his retail clients, he had yet to encounter any of them at the home shows.
On the minus side, he realized he was trying to wear two hats: wholesaler and retailer. He knew there was a risk that retailers would start to criticize him in this everybody-knows-everybody industry.
''It's not enough that he sells to us,'' he imagined their saying, ''this Shvartsman also wants to sell in competition with us.''
What should he do, he asked himself. Continue with his most profitable distribution channel? Or swear off the home shows?
WHAT OTHERS SAY Sean Rosser, a partner at Bridge Management Consulting, a small-business consulting firm: ''Mr. Shvartsman is faced with the classic channel-conflict issue. Many companies have faced this issue with regard to Internet sales, and most have found no simple answer. In theory, since none of Mr. Shvartsman's current customers exhibit at the home shows, there is no current channel conflict. However, looking forward, Mr. Shvartsman is wise to address this issue before it hurts his core specialty retail channel.
''My advice would be to create a second corporate entity that specifically targets home shows. This 'NewCo' should have a different name and would purchase product from Mr. Shvartsman's current business on an as-is, no-return basis. Mr. Shvartsman should then take this program to his other retailers, letting them have the opportunity to buy these obsolete products, and expend the resources necessary to exhibit at these home shows. He could even give his existing retail customers a right of first refusal on local home shows. If the local retailer was not interested in a program, Mr. Shvartsman could exhibit at the home show without creating a conflict.''
Caroline Hipple, chief executive of HB2 Resources, a home-furnishings consulting firm: ''Multiple-channel management can be a brand-building strength. By having a presence in heavily trafficked home shows, on the Internet, on high-profile commercial installations, and in better retail stores, demand for his brand can actually be a marketing asset. This will in turn drive traffic to his retailers.
''Finding ways to show his retail clients that this presence actually benefits them will be a key to maintaining good will and space on their floor.
''What are some ways to do this? Developing exclusive product by channel is one way. Another is including the local retailer in the sales made at the home shows, providing them with valuable sales leads and names for other products needed. Rewarding them for providing service or further support for an ongoing relationship with customers. Using their sales staff at the home shows and rewarding them. Passing out coupons for discounts on purchases made in partner retail stores (determined by ZIP code), thereby driving traffic.
''The key is to find ways to benefit his retail customers who help him build his brand by using the nonretail channels to drive future business to their stores.

HEADLINE: Howard J. Phillips, Conservative Leader, Dies at 72

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
Howard J. Phillips, a pillar of conservative activism who ran for president three times on the ticket of a political party he helped found, died on Saturday at his home in Vienna, Va. He was 72.
The cause was temporal frontal lobe dementia, his sister, Susan Phillips Bari, said.
Along with Richard Viguerie, Paul Weyrich, Terry Dolan and others, Mr. Phillips was a leader of the New Right, a movement that gave more clout to the right wing of the Republican Party in the 1970s and '80s, much as the Tea Party has in recent years. 
Even among stalwart conservatives, Mr. Phillips was known for being especially devoted to the ideological principles of the right, including limited government, traditional family values, strong national defense and opposition to abortion.
''He was our true north,'' Mr. Viguerie, famed for pioneering the political use of direct mail, said in an interview on Monday. ''You could compromise on strategy, but on principle Howie was unswerving.''
Mr. Phillips's integrity as a conservative was on display in President Richard M. Nixon's administration. In early 1973, the president signaled his intention to withhold financing from the Office of Economic Opportunity, an antipoverty agency with roots in President Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty. The president named Mr. Phillips acting director and charged him with dismantling it.
''I believe Richard Nixon epitomizes the American dream and represents all that is great in America,'' Mr. Phillips said at the time.
Nixon was unable to carry out his plans, however, after Democrats successfully sued to prevent him from starving an agency that Congress had authorized. And when Nixon yielded and continued to finance Johnson's Great Society programs, Mr. Phillips considered the president to have broken his word and resigned.
''The thing that changed him was that while he was working for O.E.O., before he became acting director, he went around the country looking at all the grantees,'' Ms. Bari, his sister, said, and concluded that much of the money was supporting liberal advocacy groups.
''Not to what the taxpayers thought they were supporting,'' Ms. Bari said. ''That's what radicalized him.''
In 1974, Mr. Phillips founded the Conservative Caucus, an advocacy group, based in Warrenton, Va. He stepped down as its chairman in 2011.
Mr. Phillips could be a thorn in the side of presidents, even fellow Republicans. He lobbied against President Ronald Reagan's nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to the Supreme Court and against the first President George Bush's nomination of David Souter to the court, arguing that they would favor abortion rights.
''Whether he won or lost, he always said that what is right is what he was going to do,'' Charles Orndorff, the administrative vice president of the Conservative Caucus, said in an interview on Monday. ''His honor, as a conservative leader, meant the most to him.''
In 1990, believing that neither major party would enact the policies he favored, Mr. Phillips led the formation of the U.S. Taxpayers Party (later renamed the Constitution Party), which declares that its policies are based on the founding documents of the nation and the original intent of the founding fathers. He was its candidate for president in 1992, 1996 and 2000. His best showing was in 1996, when he received one-fifth of 1 percent of the vote.
Howard Jay Phillips was born in Boston on Feb. 3, 1941, and grew up in the Brighton neighborhood. His father, Frederick, ran an insurance agency; his mother, the former Gertrude Goldberg, was a homemaker. Though he was raised Jewish, he became a Christian in the 1970s. He was present at the 1960 conference at the home of William F. Buckley Jr. in Sharon, Conn., that created the conservative organization Young Americans for Freedom. Mr. Phillips graduated from Harvard in 1962.
In the mid-1960s he was chairman of the Boston Republican Committee, and in 1968 he managed the Senate campaign of Richard S. Schweiker, a Pennsylvania Republican congressman who unseated Senator Joseph S. Clark, a Democrat. Mr. Phillips worked in several positions in the Nixon administration before landing at the Office of Economic Opportunity.
Somewhat quixotically, he sought the Democratic nomination for senator from Massachusetts in 1978 in order to oppose the Republican incumbent, Edward W. Brooke III, a defender of Great Society programs. Mr. Phillips lost in a primary to Paul Tsongas, who went on to defeat Senator Brooke.
In addition to his sister, Mr. Phillips is survived by his wife, the former Margaret Blanchard, whom he married in 1964; three sons, Douglas, Bradford and Samuel; three daughters, Elizabeth Lants (known by her middle name, Amanda), Alexandra and Jennifer; and 18 grandchildren.
On Monday, Mr. Viguerie recalled the occasional derision that he and Mr. Phillips endured for their political ardor.
''He and I did an interview with Dan Rather at the G.O.P. convention in 1984, and Rather asked us about George H. W. Bush, and we were very critical of his conservative credentials,'' Mr. Viguerie said. ''And the next night, Rather had Bush on, and he said, 'Richard Viguerie and Howard Phillips say you're not a conservative. Well, Mr. Vice President, what about it? Are you a conservative?'
''And he said, 'Yes, Dan, I'm a conservative, but I'm not a nut about it.' ''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Shadow Lobbyist

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: Corporate America is relying on new tactics to shape the legislative outcomes it wants. 

 BODY:
There has been a quiet upheaval in the lobbying industry.
On the surface, the firms that represent thousands of businesses, trade associations and special interests are taking a beating.
In practice, however, the lobbying industry is moving below the radar. More than $3 billion is still spent annually, more of which is not being publicly disclosed. Corporate America is relying on new tactics to shape the legislative outcomes it wants.
The adoption of innovative practices by the influence industry, combined with legal reporting requirements that are full of loopholes, have created misleading indicators which suggest that there has been a decline in the clout of the lobbying sector.
In fact, lobbying techniques have evolved so as to elude the regulations that implement the 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act. These regulations are revised every 6 months in "written guidance on LDA registration and reporting requirements" issued by the Clerk of the House and The Secretary of the Senate. 
Lobbyists and their lawyers are capitalizing on arcane gaps in regulatory guidelines. For example, constricted definitions of lobbying contained in Congressional regulations have been construed to exempt from disclosure money spent on grass roots mobilization; on television, digital and social media campaigns; and on public relations efforts to build support among voters and key elites.
With these exemptions not counted, an analysis of annual lobbying revenues shows that after increasing by 153.3 percent between 1998 and 2010 (from $1.4 billion to $3.55 billion), disclosed fees have dropped by $250 million, to $3.3 billion in 2012.
At some of the top firms, reported drops have been dramatic.
Barbour, Griffith & Rogers, which was founded by Haley Barbour, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and a former governor of Mississippi, has experienced a fall in lobbying revenues, as recorded by the Center for Responsive Politics (see Figure 1). They went from $22.3 million in 2007 to $13.8 million in 2012, a 38.1 percent decline.
Fig. 1
Half a mile away from BGR, another firm that saw tremendous growth from its founding in 2000 to 2007, QGA, now reports lobbying revenues in a nosedive. QGA was created by Ed Gillespie, who also once ran the Republican National Committee and who has been a key adviser to Republican presidential campaigns, and Jack Quinn, a top adviser to former Vice President Al Gore.
According to the Center for Responsive Politics (see Figure 2), QGA's revenues went from $16.3 million in 2008 to $6.8 million in 2012, a 58.3 percent decline.
Fig. 2
Increasingly sophisticated forms of political engagement on both the left and the right have outrun old forms of regulation. Most recently, the success of the Obama campaign in advancing computer-driven techniques to reach key segments of the electorate has produced a blossoming industry of digital and specialized communications firms using data analysis, microtechnology and computerized list-building to create public support for or opposition to legislative and policy initiatives - virtually all of which goes effectively undisclosed.
There are other factors pushing lobbying activity into the shadows. Obama administration regulations bar any lobbyist hired by the executive branch from participation "in any particular matter involving specific parties that is directly and substantially related" to a "former employer or former clients, including regulations and contracts"; they prohibit the appointment of lobbyists to federal boards and commissions; and they restrict former federal appointees from lobbying for two years after leaving federal employment.
Taken together, these regulations have encouraged those interested in public service to find jobs that do not require them to register as lobbyists. Or, put another way, those who are eager for government work are not going to formally register themselves as lobbyists and thus make themselves ineligible.
At the same time, in part because the administration has painted such a dark picture of lobbying, corporations are seeking alternative mechanisms to achieve their legislative and regulatory goals without public disclosure of their expenditures.
The enhanced ability of web sites like the Center for Responsive Politics and the Sunlight Foundation - both of which many reporters and columnists, including me, have relied on to provide data on lobbying expenditures - has, in turn, increased the likelihood that undisguised corporate spending will receive unwanted publicity.
To address diminishing revenues, lobbying firms have created their own public relations operations, subsidiaries with the same goals as the lobbying arm, that charge similarly high fees, but which do not have to be publicly reported to either the House or the Senate.
The BRG Group, for example, created BGR Public Relations. The firm's web site provides the following background:
When our firm started more than two decades ago, clients didn't want help with the media as part of our service. Now, almost every client wants - and needs - public relations advice. BGR Public Relations fulfills that need in a big and unique way. Led by veteran TV and print journalist Jeff Birnbaum [a former Washington Post and Wall Street Journal reporter and the co-author of Showdown at Gucci Gulch], BGR PR specializes in offering counsel in a way that sets it apart. Jeff and his team can explain how reporters think - and how they decide what news is from their perspective - in ways that conventional PR people simply cannot.
QGA has hired John Feehery, who spent 15 years working for the Republican House Leadership, as president of Quinn Gillespie Communications, and Jim Manley who spent 21 years working for Democratic Senators, most recently as communications adviser to Senate Majority leader Harry Reid.
On its web site, QGA declares:
Our founding principle - that every public policy issue is at its core a communications challenge - is even truer today. This is why at QGA you'll find people who are among Washington's most credible and connected, bipartisan government relations and strategic communications professionals.
"You can't just roll into a member of Congress, buy a couple of steaks, to get a tax provision," Feehery told me in a phone interview. He described the basic public relations approach as "setting up an echo chamber to help frame messages," by, among other things, creating web sites for the client, seeking coverage of the client's goals by the press, working with pollsters to develop a message and creating videos demonstrating the products or services the client can offer.
As an example of this work, Feehery cited Quinn Gillespie's efforts in support of the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, which was competing with a U.S. company, Beechcraft, for a $950 million Pentagon contract to build 29 light attack aircraft for the Afghanistan National Army Air Corps.
In this case, Feehery said, with a foreign company competing with a domestic manufacturer on a military contract, it was important to cultivate a level of respect for the competence of Embraer in the broad military community, including not only officers, but contractors, think tank analysts and the extensive media that cover defense issues.
The campaign on behalf of Embraer was "aimed at the military, but it was also aimed at the people who talk about these things, who read the Pentagon newspapers, aviation magazines," Feehery said.
The Internet has radically altered the lobbying arsenal.
The scope of the ongoing upheaval in lobbying was brought home with a vengeance in 2011 and 2012 by the failure of traditional lobbying strategies to win approval of the Stop Online Piracy Act. In early 2011, by all normal standards, the odds were with passage of SOPA.
The legislation had the backing of some of the most powerful companies and associations in Washington, including the American Bankers Association, the AFL-CIO, Americans for Tax Reform, Disney, the Teamsters, MasterCard, Visa, ESPN, the Motion Picture Association, the major TV networks and the US Chamber of Commerce.
In addition, the measure had strong bipartisan support in the House, including from Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Judiciary Committee and many committee members. The parallel bill in the Senate, the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act of 2011, had 42 Republican and Democratic Senate sponsors, including Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
On Nov. 30, 2011, Will Oremus wrote in Slate:
In a time of legislative gridlock, the Stop Online Piracy Act looked like a rare bipartisan breakthrough. The bill, known as SOPA, promised a brave new Internet - one cleansed of "rogue websites" that hawk pirated songs and movies as well as counterfeit goods. For Congress, the legislation's goals amounted to a can't-lose trifecta: uphold justice, protect legitimate businesses (and jobs!), and make the Web safer for law-abiding consumers. Who could be against that?
In a month, support for SOPA imploded and with it the world of the expense account lobbyist.
An anti-SOPA coalition abruptly burst on the scene towards the end of 2011 catching the SOPA backers by surprise. It included some high-dollar, high-tech corporations - Google, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo - with the means to invest heavily in lobbying, traditional or otherwise.
Opposition to the bill quickly caught fire among the broader public. It was expressed in emails, text messages, voicemails, Twitter comments, Internet petitions and outspoken attacks at town hall meetings - none of which have to be reported as lobbying-related.
Backers began to jump ship. In January of 2012, seven House members withdrew sponsorship, and 10 Senators followed suit. Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio, one of the bill's sponsors, announced on Facebook:
Earlier this year, this bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously and without controversy. Since then, we've heard legitimate concerns about the impact the bill could have on access to the Internet and about a potentially unreasonable expansion of the federal government's power to impact the Internet. Congress should listen and avoid rushing through a bill that could have many unintended consequences.
Congressman Dennis Ross, Republican of Florida and a cosponsor of the bill, tweeted matter of factly, "#SOPA is dead."
The emergence of a powerful public force outside traditional avenues of influence put fear of elective defeat into the hearts of members of Congress and forced the lobbying community to beef up its own non-traditional tactics.
Now, in the lexicon of Washington insiders, the acronym SOPA has become a verb, as in the warning to overconfident legislators: "Don't get SOPAed."
Anita Dunn, former director of communications in the Obama White House and now a managing director of the Democratic strategic consulting firm, SKDKnickerbocker, said in a phone interview that "the public dialogue has become more important in influencing the climate in which decisions are made."
Dunn pointed out that the universe of gatekeepers deciding what the public will know about the legislative process is no longer limited to "a very narrow group of people, editors and the members [of Congress]."
Instead, she said, the new media - including social media - means almost anyone "can shine a light on" Congressional negotiations, so that company or association pushing an issue can no longer depend on the effectiveness of an old-guard lobbyist with good connections on Capitol Hill. "If someone decided to lift an issue into the public dialogue, you have to be prepared to have that dialogue," Dunn said, which in turn suggests that the hiring of a strategic communications firm like SKDKnickerbocker to prepare "an active communication and PR strategy" is a good idea.
Dunn argues that the work she and others do at SKDKnickerbocker is not in fact lobbying. "We do not lobby," she told me. "We work closely on teams with government relations people" from other firms.
This avoidance of activities falling under the legal definition of lobbying allows SKDKnickerbocker and its clients to minimize publicity concerning work both would perhaps like to keep out of public view.
The liberal-leaning website, Republic Report, has pointed to a number of SKDKnickerbocker's controversial activities, many in direct opposition to the Obama agenda, including:

        
Pressing the Department of Education to weaken proposed tough regulations of the for-profit colleges run by Kaplan Education that were profiting from government loans to students who were not equipped to complete programs and get degrees.
        
Coordinating the campaign for Win American, a coalition of corporations seeking to avoid up to $1 trillion in taxes when they repatriate overseas income.
        
Coordinating the campaign by Sensible Food Policy Coalition, an alliance of food producers and advertisers determined to block the Obama administration's proposed voluntary food standards designed to reduce obesity.
While SKDKnickerbocker has done well in the new legislative environment, according to Dunn, she noted that the most explosive growth in the field of lobbying is taking place in the use of digital technology to mobilize and direct public and elite opinion.
Two of the most prominent are Democratic firms that grew out of past presidential campaigns: Blue State Digital, which was founded by a handful of the online specialists in Howard Dean's 2004 campaign, and Bully Pulpit Interactive, which was started by veterans of Obama's 2008 campaign.
On the Bully Pulpit web site, Jen Nedeau, a director of the company, argues there is a strong overlap between political and commercial digital advertising:
By using data-driven ads to craft a narrative, we believe that social media does not only have the ability to sell soap, but as we've already proven, it can help to get out the vote - and at least in 2012, that is one action that has certainly made a difference.
Modesty is no virtue in the world of client acquisition, and Blue State Digital exhibits none. On its web site, the firm boasts:
Blue State Digital helps clients create change - in their own organizations, in the marketplace, and in society. We do work that matters - building authentic relationships and activating audiences, raising awareness and raising money.
The company does not stop there. "Every agency promises results," it says. "We create behavior."
Blue State's clients run the gamut from corporations like HBO, Ford, AT&T and Google to unions and trade associations like the Communications Workers of American, UNITE, to non profits like the Jewish Federation.
The market value of Blue State and Bully Pulpit has been demonstrated by the decision of major public relations conglomerates to gobble up Blue State and hire away Andrew Bleeker, founder of Bully Pulpit.
On Dec. 30, 2010, Blue State announced that it had been acquired by "the world's largest communications services group," WPP. Less than a month later, on Jan. 14, 2011, Hill+Knowlton Strategies, a WPP subsidiary and a long-term member of Washington's PR establishment, announced the hiring of Bully Pulpit's Bleeker. "My goal is to extend the next generation of digital public relations to H+K Strategies' clients," Bleeker declared.
There is another way to interpret these developments. The seemingly venturesome high tech and strategic consulting firms in the field of influencing public opinion are headed toward a more traditional business-as-usual role as they and their top personnel are acquired by massive multinational corporations.
The growing network of "strategic communications," digital practitioners and the newly created PR subsidiaries of old-line lobbying firms is, in effect, supplanting special pleaders' traditional tactics while simultaneously enhancing their ability to operate out of the limelight. Many of the activities most people would call lobbying now fall outside of its legal definition. They have become a large but almost invisible part of special interest influence on public policy.

HEADLINE: Santander Earnings Slump on Weak Economy

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Banco Santander of Spain said first-quarter net profit fell 26 percent, hurt by continuing troubles in Spain and a slowdown in developing economies. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Banco Santander said on Thursday that first-quarter net profit fell 26 percent, hurt by continuing troubles in Spain and a slowdown in developing economies.
Santander, the largest Spanish bank, said net income fell to 1.2 billion euros ($1.6 billion) from 1.6 billion euros in the period a year earlier, missing analysts' estimates. 
As the Spanish economy continues to struggle with double-digit unemployment and major declines in its real estate market, Santander has not been immune from the domestic troubles. The bank said earnings were weighed down by anemic growth and a drop in revenue in its major markets, as well as by low interest rates worldwide that hurt profitability.
The bank's leaders expressed optimism about the rest of the year, however, saying results would outpace those of last year, when Santander made provisions of 18.8 billion euros to cover delinquent mortgages in Spain and an increase in other troubled loans across its businesses.
"Profit in 2013 will be significantly higher than the 2.29 billion euros registered in 2012," the bank's chairman, Emilio Botín, said in a statement.
Santander said it had made additional provisions of almost 3 billion euros in the first quarter, a 6 percent decline from those made in the first quarter of 2012.
The bank's shares fell 3 percent in early morning trading in Madrid on Thursday.
Santander experienced declines across its global operations. In Latin America, which now accounts for more than half of its quarterly earnings, net profit fell 18 percent, to 988 million euros, despite a slight increase in lending and customer deposits.
In Continental Europe, net income plunged 27 percent, to 307 million euros, as Santander tried to pare its exposure by reducing lending to local consumers.
Over the last several years, the bank has attempted to reduce its real estate business in Spain as mortgage delinquency rates have skyrocketed. In the first quarter, Santander said its exposure to troubled domestic real estate totaled 11.9 billion euros when adjusted for provisions.
The bank's ratio of delinquent loans in Spain increased slightly, to 4.1 percent, though the figure for real estate exposure remains far higher: 56.3 percent. For the entire bank's global operations, the ratio rose marginally, to 4.8 percent, compared with the end of 2012.
First-quarter net income in Santander's British division fell 23 percent, to 224 million euros, while profit from its unit in the United States declined slightly, to 233 million euros.
Like its competitors across Europe, Santander is increasing its reserves to meet regulators' more stringent capital requirements intended to provide a buffer against future crises.
Santander said it had now returned 31 billion euros of short-term funding offered by the European Central Bank, adding that its core Tier 1 equity ratio, a measure of a bank's ability to weather financial shocks, had risen steadily to 10.7 percent.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today&#8217;s Times and around the Web, plus a look at what&#8217;s happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times: 
Having offered up plenty of unflattering critiques of his predecessor, President Obama has tofind something nice to say about George W. Bush at the opening of the latter's presidential library in Dallas on Thursday morning, Peter Baker writes. In the afternoon before heading back to Washington, the Obamas will travel to Waco, Tex., for a memorial service at Baylor University to pay tribute to the workers who died in an explosion at a fertilizer plant in nearby West, Tex. 
Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia's efforts to soften the Republican party's image is not going terribly smoothly in the House, where Jonathan Weisman observes that legislation the Republican majority leader hoped would achieve his goal has been ignored, greeted with yawns or fought over in his caucus.
The automatic budget cuts imposed by Congress are forcing the Federal Aviation Administration to operate like a starving airline, the agency administrator told skeptical Republicans at a hearing on Wednesday, Matthew L. Wald reports.
With support from backers and critics alike, Janet L. Yellen, the vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, seems to be the most plausible successor to Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the central bank, whose term ends in January 2014, Binyamin Appelbaum writes. Other potential candidates for the job, which has been held only by men, include Timothy F. Geithner, Mr. Obama's first Treasury secretary, and Lawrence H. Summers, the president's former economic adviser.
Authorities searching for the person who sent ricin-laced letters to President Obama; Senator Roger Wicker, Republican of Mississippi; and a local judge have shifted their focus to a martial arts instructor, Campbell Robertson and Cynthia Howe report.
 Around the Web: 
Now that he is not running for re-election, Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, must decide what to do with the $4.8 million left in his campaign coffers, according to the Associated Press.
 Happening in Washington: 
Economic reports expected Thursday include weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., followed at 10 a.m. by weekly mortgage rates.
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s agenda includes a meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan at the Naval Observatory at 8:30 a.m., then a meeting with gun safety advocates at the White House at 2 p.m.
Separate House Appropriations subcommittees will hear budget testimony from Jack Lew, the Treasury secretary; Kathleen Sebelius, the Health and Human Services secretary; and Joseph Szabo, the administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration. All hearings begin at 10 a.m.
 Also at 10, a subpanel of the House Committee on Homeland Security will examine counterterrorism efforts aimed at preventing chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear attacks on American soil.
A House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, at a 10 a.m. hearing, will take up the topic of securing the nation's prescription drug supply chain. 
At 2:30 p.m., a subpanel of the House Committee on Ways and Means will hold a hearing focused on the Internal Revenue Service and the 2013 tax return filing season.

HEADLINE: With Fellow Cigar Enthusiasts, Lhota Raises Money in Smoky Haze

BYLINE: MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Joseph J. Lhota, a Republican running for mayor of New York City, held a fund-raiser at the Habana Hut Smoke Lounge, a tobacco shop just off Bell Boulevard in Bayside, Queens. 

 BODY:
The Race for City Hall
Some politicians avoid a smoke-filled room. This week, Joseph J. Lhota held a fund-raiser in one.
"You ever smoke a cigar before?" asked Mr. Lhota, a Republican running for mayor of New York City, his teeth clenched around a Montecristo White. He pulled out a miniature torch, flipped on the blue flame and gestured toward a guest. "Give him a cutter!"
Moments before, Mr. Lhota was addressing a crowd of two dozen cigar enthusiasts gathered on Monday evening in the leather-upholstered confines of the Habana Hut Smoke Lounge, a tobacco shop just off Bell Boulevard in Bayside, Queens. There was a well-worn stump speech, a bit of family history (father, a police officer; grandfather, a cabby), and a round of thank-yous for the night's donations. 
Then it was off to the walk-in humidor.
"I haven't smoked a cigar in I can't tell you how long," Mr. Lhota said, exhaling a blue plume. Later, he revised that assessment, admitting he had indulged in a celebratory smoke on New Year's Eve. He keeps hundreds of cigars in his Brooklyn Heights home, but lately, he said, "I've cut down a lot."
Elio Forcina, a lawyer who organized the event, introduced Mr. Lhota to an owner of the Habana Hut, adding that the proprietor, as a high school student, had once stuffed Andrew M. Cuomo, a classmate and the future governor, into a hallway locker.
The owner vigorously shook his head. "It was my brother! Not me!"
"Your brother put Andrew Cuomo in a locker? Wow, wow. That's great," Mr. Lhota said, reaching for a cigar cutter.
Many of the attendees - almost all male - knew Mr. Lhota from his days as a deputy mayor in the Giuliani administration, when he was known to indulge in cigars and Scotch. It was a habit he picked up in college, at Georgetown, where his roommates preferred the Caribbean blend of Macanudo Hampton Courts.
George Frangoulis, who served with Mr. Lhota at City Hall in the 1990s, recalled many smoky Christmas dinners with Chianti, cigars and a seafood feast, with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Mr. Lhota holding court. (Mr. Giuliani, he said, kept his cigars in a Tupperware container.)
Mr. Frangoulis said Mr. Lhota often used cigars to put subordinates at ease, right before grilling them on a recent foul-up. "It was a communications device; he'd get everything out of you."
Like Mr. Lhota, Mr. Frangoulis said he had had to cut back. "I'm 52," he explained. "I love my teeth."
New York City prohibits smoking in bars and restaurants. But aficionados can still light up in certain tobacco shops and smoke lounges, provided the establishment and its ventilation system are approved by the city.
Watching the festivities was Eric Ulrich, the youngest member of the City Council and one of its few Republicans. "We're behind Joe 1,000 percent," Mr. Ulrich, in a red tie with silver beads, told the crowd. He then predicted, in colorful language, that Mr. Lhota would easily best a rival, John A. Catsimatidis, in the primary.
As guests puffed away watching the Yankees game, Mr. Ulrich, a cigar enthusiast since high school, was asked his opinion of Mr. Lhota's Montecristo. "It's not bad," Mr. Ulrich said, as he lighted up one of his own. "It's a mild cigar. It's not a dark leaf. It's a social cigar."
He gestured around the room. "These are very hard-working, middle-class people," he said. "These are the voters who will put Joe over the top."
At that, the beer arrived. "We're getting Heinies right now!" Mr. Lhota exclaimed, as an organizer carried in a pack of Heineken cans and a bag of red Solo cups.
"If you're together with a bunch of friends and you're smoking cigars and you're having a drink, the most important component is the discussion and the talk and the revelry," Mr. Lhota said later, squeezed into a corner by the cash register. Amid the din, he looked pleased. "I think I've got to open up one of these places in Brooklyn Heights. I really do."
Soon, Mr. Lhota ducked out to the sidewalk for some fresh air. As the evening drew late, he was surrounded by well-wishers as he puffed on the Montecristo before heading home to Brooklyn.

HEADLINE: Presidents Are Viewed More Fondly in the Rear-View Mirror

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: As George W. Bush&#8217;s presidential library opens in Texas, a rise is seen in his popularity &#8212; exactly what one would expect, based on the history of other former presidents&#8217; approval ratings. 

 BODY:
The rise in approval ratings of former President George W. Bush has received some attention this week, in advance of the opening of his presidential library in Dallas. But that rise is exactly what one would expect, based on the history of other ex-presidents' approval ratings.
Presidents who are unpopular in their final months in office - like Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter and the first George Bush, all of whom lost presidential elections - typically become more popular out of office. All three of those former presidents had approval ratings exceeding 60 percent at various points over the past 20 years, according to separate polls by Pew and Gallup. 
The approval rating of the elder Mr. Bush peaked at 74 percent in early 2000, according to Gallup. Mr. Carter hit 69 percent in 1999, before drifting down to 52 percent in 2010. Mr. Ford reached 71 percent in 1999 (when the economy was booming and Americans were evidently feeling charitable toward their ex-presidents), and he was at 61 percent in 2010. The trend starts before presidents leave office, with their approval often rising in between election day and inauguration day.
"Presidents' retrospective approval ratings are almost always more positive than their job approval ratings while in office," writes Jeffrey M. Jones of Gallup. "Former presidents likely transcend politics when they leave office, moving into a more nonpolitical role compared with the highly political environment in which presidents operate." 
Even Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, popular throughout much of their presidencies and re-elected by comfortable margins, have had higher approval ratings since leaving office than they did in office, on average.
The pattern here doesn't apply only to former presidents, either. When prominent people leave the battles of daily politics, their approval ratings tend to rise. Hillary Rodham Clinton's favorability rating stood at 65 percent at the end of her tenure as secretary of state, a job mostly above the partisan fray. As recently as 2008, in the midst of her primary campaign against then-Senator Barack Obama, her approval rating was only 48 percent, according to Pew. If she runs for president again in 2016, her rating will almost surely decline from 65 percent.
George W. Bush's trajectory is most similar to that of President Lyndon B. Johnson. Mr. Bush left office with among the lowest approval ratings of any president, hobbled by an unpopular war. Mr. Johnson, worried he would lose his own Democratic Party's nomination because of the Vietnam War, chose not to run in 1968. Mr. Johnson's approval rating hovered around 40 percent in his last year in office, while Mr. Bush's hovered around 30 percent.
By 2010, 49 percent of Americans approved of Mr. Johnson's performance as president, with 36 disapproving, according to Gallup. In a recent Washington Post-ABC poll, 47 percent approved of Mr. Bush's perspective, and 50 percent disapproved.
The one exception to the pattern is Richard M. Nixon, the only president to resign from the office. His approval rating was only 29 percent in 2010 and has not exceeded 40 percent in any poll Gallup has published.
These historical patterns, obviously, are not destiny. It is possible that George W. Bush will become more or less popular over time, depending on events like the Arab Spring and on the details that eventually emerge about his tenure. But it isn't surprising that Mr. Bush has become more popular as a former president than he was as president. It would be news if he were not.

HEADLINE: The Gorilla and the Maginot Line

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Janet Yellen of the Federal Reserve, like many central bankers, knows her way around a metaphor to make a monetary point. 

 BODY:
Janet Yellen likes metaphors. This is a common trait among central bankers, at least the ones who see value in trying to explain their work.
In 2007, she compared problems in the housing market to a 600-pound gorilla lurking in the corner of the Federal Reserve's meeting room.
In 2010, she described the state of financial regulation before the crisis as "a financial Maginot Line that we believed couldn't be breached." 
We all know what happened next: The gorilla broke through the Maginot Line.
She is not the most colorful of the current crop of Fed officials. That honor surely belongs to Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, whose most recent speech was titled "Oil and Gas, Blondes and Over-Accessorized Brunettes, and Ruthless, Hard-Drinking Cowboys." 
Nor has she ever produced anything quite as enduringly memorable as former Fed chairman William McChesney Martin's famous description of central banking. The job, he said, is "to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going."
But Ms. Yellen, whom I profiled Thursday as a logical successor to Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, can paint a picture. Consider her description at the September 2007 meeting of the Fed's policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, of "the earthquake that began roiling financial markets in mid-July. Our contacts located at the epicenter - those, for example, in the private equity and mortgage markets - report utter devastation. Anecdotal reports from those nearby - for example, our contacts in banking, housing construction, and housing-related businesses - suggest significant damage from the temblor." 
In 1995, concerned that the Fed was keeping interest rates too high, she compared the effects to "a termites in the basement problem," suggesting that the high rates would gradually weaken and undermine the vitality of the economy.
"A 'termites in the basement' problem is a nagging, chronic little problem that can eventually cause a lot of grief if it is not attended to," Ms. Yellen said at the Fed's September meeting, according to the Fed's transcript. "Termites nibble away slowly so the problem just creeps up and there is no great sense of urgency that one absolutely has to deal with it on one day as opposed to the next."
Other members of the committee then picked up on the metaphor, invoking termites to make their own case for lower interest rates.
And then there is my personal favorite. Earlier in 1995, the Fed was debating whether to endorse Congressional legislation directing the Fed to make price stability its sole objective, replacing the "dual mandate" that instructs the central bank to minimize both unemployment and inflation.
Ms. Yellen was one of the strongest voices in opposition, arguing repeatedly that the people wanted the central bank to mitigate economic downturns in addition to minimizing inflation, and that the central bank had the ability and therefore the responsibility to do so.
Even the German central bank, famous for its commitment to suppress inflation, sought to mitigate economic downturns, she said.
"Who would be prepared to believe that the F.O.M.C. is single-mindedly going to pursue an inflation target regardless of real economic performance, if not even the Bundesbank is prepared to go that far?" she said. "So, that means that the targets are going to be perceived as a hoax."
And then, to drive the point home, she added, "They are not going to be any more believable than I would be if I told my child that I was going to cut off his hand if he put it in the candy drawer."

HEADLINE: Granta Editor Stepping Down

BYLINE: LARRY ROHTER


HIGHLIGHT: John Freeman, the American-born editor of the British literary quarterly, is leaving after five years. 

 BODY:
John Freeman, the American-born editor of the London-based literary quarterly Granta, has announced that he is departing the magazine, effective July 15. Mr. Freeman, 38, became Granta's American editor in 2008 and assumed the top post in 2009. He most recently oversaw the publication of the decennial "Best of Young British Novelists" issue, with 20 writers 40 years of age or younger, which has become the magazine's global calling card. 
"I loved this job, but I always felt five years would be a kind of marker, and it was," Mr. Freeman wrote in an e-mail sent on Thursday while he was flying from Seattle to New York. "There's a next stage now, though," he added. "And as the books I've been meaning to write are beginning to crowd to the front of my mind, it felt time to leave."
Mr. Freeman has a book coming out in the fall called "How to Read a Novelist" and said he is also finishing a book of essays, tentatively titled "The Alphabet of American Poetry." Beyond that, there is "hopefully a collection of poems," he wrote. "I'll also go back to reviewing a bit more, which I have missed," and will teach a writing course at Columbia University this fall.
Under Mr. Freeman, a former president of the National Book Critics Circle, Granta has significantly raised its international profile. Founded in 1889 as a literary magazine at Cambridge University, it now publishes editions in several languages, including Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Norwegian; new editions in Turkish and Swedish are about to begin publication.
In addition, the magazine, whose publisher is the Swedish heiress and philanthropist Sigrid Rausing, has greatly expanded its online presence during his tenure, and reshaped its look, while continuing to seek out and promote new writers. In a harsh economic climate, Mr. Freeman noted, he has also succeeded in "reducing the magazine's losses drastically, in half basically."
"The great thing about Granta is it's always felt to me like a kind of Trojan Horse for new writers," he added. "I feel like the horse is in the keep now, and so it's time to sit back and watch."

HEADLINE: Bigger Banks vs. Smaller, in Customer Satisfaction

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: A J.D. Power and Associates study finds that the largest banks have gotten better at making their customers happy. 

 BODY:
Many consumers love to hate big banks. But the largest banks have become better at making their customers happy, according to the latest study from J.D. Power and Associates. 
Customer satisfaction with banks over all has risen from last year, mostly due to improvements at the biggest institutions, the company's latest Retail Banking Satisfaction Study finds.
Over all, banking customer satisfaction rose to 763 points (on a 1,000-point scale), an increase of 10 index points over last year. The largest increase came from the "big banks" segment, which rose by 16 points. (The segment includes the six largest banks by deposits: Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citibank, U.S. Bank and PNC Bank.) The study solicited customers' opinions about their primary bank in January. The report includes more than 120 banks.
The study assesses customer satisfaction in areas like account information, fees and problem resolution, and ranks banks in 11 regional markets: California, Florida, mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New England, North Central, Northwest, South Central, Southeast, Southwest and Texas.
The biggest banks are often outranked in various markets by smaller institutions. In New England, for instance, the top-ranked bank was Bangor Savings Bank, while national banks like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase ranked below the region's average. And in Texas, Frost National Bank led the rankings.
But smaller banks didn't always win out. In the Midwest region, JPMorgan Chase topped the rankings, outscoring 22 other banks.
Big banks are still outranked by midsize banks overall (as a group, the midsize segment ranked 785 on the scale), but are closing the gap after a period in which new fees and the elimination of free checking accounts turned off customers. Now, fees have begun to "stabilize" and big banks are doing a better job of explaining their fee structures to customers, the report says. About a third of customers now say they "completely" understand their banks fees, up from about a quarter last year, the study reports.
Jim Miller, senior director of banking at J.D. Power, said in an interview that the big banks were doing a better job of reducing the number of problems that customers encountered and "executing on basic customer service." The largest banks, like Chase, are also expanding their use of mobile banking technology. That makes it more convenient for customers to bank, which adds to their satisfaction.
Do you use a big bank? Are you satisfied with your treatment?
