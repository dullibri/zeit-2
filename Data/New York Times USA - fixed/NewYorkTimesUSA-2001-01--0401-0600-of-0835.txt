 BODY:
White House to Press Airlines on Consolidation
The Clinton administration plans to issue a last-minute call to police the airline industry more closely in the wake of deals that would consolidate the airline industry in the hands of a few giant carriers.
 The departing transportation secretary, Rodney E. Slater, intends to release three studies criticizing the state of competition in air travel and lay out a blueprint for how the government can improve the situation. But after receiving strong criticism from the airlines, some academics and the White House itself, Mr. Slater will stop short of issuing a controversial set of guidelines first proposed three years ago that would have put airlines on notice about how aggressively they could respond to low-fare competitors. Page A1. 

Motorola to Lay Off 2,500 Workers
Motorola, following through with promises to cut costs as it struggles through a difficult first half of 2001, announced 2,500 layoffs that will shut down manufacturing at the company's last domestic cellular phone plant. C10.

Milken Return to Wall St. Unlikely
A pardon from President Clinton this week might improve Michael R. Milken's public image but it would not pave the way for the fallen financier to return to Wall Street, securities lawyers and people who know Mr. Milken said. President Clinton has been considering granting an 11th-hour pardon to Mr. Milken, who served almost two years in prison after pleading guilty to six felony counts of securities fraud in 1990. C10.

Utilities Seek Leeway on Bills
Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison, the two largest utilities in California, said they had millions of dollars owed to power generators due today but warned they might not have enough cash to pay them. Both utilities are hoping that negotiations last weekend will give them some leeway. C2.

Entertainment Writers Weigh Strike
The entertainment industry is facing a series of potential strikes by writers as well as actors that could cripple film and television production, starting in late spring. The writers have a series of financial demands, but what also seems to be driving the Writers Guild of America, representing 11,000 writers, are issues that have less to do with money than with giving the writers a new sense of respect. A1.

Curbs Sought on Money Laundering
The Clinton administration plans to announce voluntary measures meant to deter foreign leaders and their associates from hiding money in the United States, a leading destination for illicit wealth. A11.

From Alcoa Boardroom to Treasury
Paul H. O'Neill, the treasury secretary-designate, became chief executive of Alcoa in 1987 and quickly turned a Rust Belt laggard into the world's biggest and richest aluminum producer with a healthy bottom line. Just how Mr. O'Neill, a bureaucrat turned businessman, revived Alcoa's fortunes provides a glimpse into the man who has been designated to carry out -- and influence -- the Bush economic plan at a time of increasing financial uncertainty and general business unease. A1.

Nikkei Rallies on Mori's Remarks
The Japanese stock market rose after Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori said the government planned to take steps to stem falling stock prices. Mr. Mori said the government was considering a liberalization of regulations on corporate share buybacks that would allow companies to hold on to shares they purchase in the open market. The Nikkei index rose 158.49 points, or 1.19 percent, to 13,506.23. C11.

Maker of Mentos to Buy Van Melle
The Italian confectioner Perfetti said it would buy the two-thirds of Van Melle that it does not already own, bringing together Brooklyn chewing gum and Mentos mints, in a deal that values the company at $1 billion. C4.

Verizon Wireless Assigns Account
Verizon Wireless, a joint venture of Verizon Communications and Vodafone, named the New York office of the Bozell Group as agency of record on its account, including its national brand advertising. Billings were estimated at $300 million. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. C10.

U.S. Markets to Reopen Today
All major financial markets in the United States, which had been closed yesterday in observance of Martin Luther King's Birthday, will reopen today.

HEADLINE: WINE TALK; 
A Cellar Master of a Certain Vintage

BYLINE:  By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
IT'S easy to get tired of New York in midwinter: the crowds, the angry drivers, the dirty snow. Some people head for Miami. Me, I take the A Train to Brooklyn. With the sun on the water, the Brooklyn Bridge soaring overhead and Lower Manhattan a thousand yards away, there is no place like it to see New York. It's a John Sloan painting and an Edna St. Vincent Millay poem and an afternoon spent taking it in will get you through to April better than a weekend in Paris.
 In fact, I had a second agenda when I walked down Old Fulton Street last week from the subway stop to the River Cafe, the restaurant nearly under the bridge. Someone had told me that the average time a California winemaker stays at any one job is four years. With new restaurants opening almost hourly, sommeliers in California and everywhere else seem to move every six weeks. I've heard that "Excellent choice, sir" line from wine stewards I'd swear were not old enough to drink two years ago. Joe Delissio has been the wine director at the River Cafe for 23 years. That has to be some sort of record, and I was curious to see how he was holding up. 
 Mr. Delissio started out as one of those "excellent choice" kids: He was 23 when Buzzy O'Keeffe, who owns the River Cafe, hired him as wine director. He has literally grown up with the wine boom.
"My father owned a saloon in Brooklyn," said Mr. Delissio, who is 46, "but I knew nothing about wine, nothing. It was what the guys drank in my father's place when they were off the hard stuff."
Mr. O'Keeffe didn't know much about wine either, and the Frenchman who had been buying wine for him had his own way of adding up bills. "I was working as a psychiatric therapist during the day and an aspiring rock musician at night," Mr. Delissio recalled. "Buzzy hired me because my mother, who did his books, vouched for me. Actually, it wasn't that hard. I bought the wine and I sold it. It's like Pete Rose used to say when someone would ask him how he did what he did -- 'I see the ball,' he'd say, 'and I hit the ball.' "
It was more complicated than he admits, starting as he did from zero. "At first I listened to the salesmen," he said, "even if I didn't like the wine. I figured I didn't know anything. Eventually, I decided that it was time to buy what I liked. I traveled to California and to Europe. And it was a lot easier after that."
Mr. Delissio no longer hovers over nervous guests, recommending Volnay with the veal. He chooses the wines, buys them, coddles them. He consults with the chef, Brad Steelman, to match wines with special dishes, like a Cune Reserve 1991 with the buffalo steak.
Mr. Delissio has worked with many River Cafe chefs, including Larry Forgione and Charlie Palmer. These days he trains others to push the Volnay. Right now it is Scott Calvert, who has been with the cafe for seven years but sommelier for only a few weeks.
Have tastes changed? "When I started, about a third of our liquor business was wine," Mr. Delissio said. "The rest was spirits. Now, 75 percent of our alcohol business is wine. In the 60's our wine sales were almost all French. So was our wine list. Then I got fascinated by American wines, long before they were really popular. And now we seem to be going back to French wines."
The Delissio theory: It's all economics. When French wine prices go through the roof, American wines become the favorites. When their prices balloon, the French come back. Wines are not inexpensive at the River Cafe but they can be less costly than at other places around town, particularly at the top end of the price list.
Like Harry's at Hanover Square, Veritas on East 20th Street and other restaurants that offer hard-to-find wines at decent prices, the River Cafe has a policy of buying and holding rare bottles. Thus, Mr. Delissio can offer seven vintages of Chateau Petrus, six of Chateau Rayas, a rare Chateauneuf-du-Pape and nine vintages of Le Montrachet from Domaine Ramonet. The average price for a bottle of wine is around $55.
The roughly 500-bottle list is not the longest in the city, but it is one of the broadest. Not many restaurants in New York offer California cabernets going back to 1969; few if any offer white Burgundy verticals from Ramonet and Leflaive, along with red Burgundy verticals from Leroy and Romanee-Conti. A Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 1982 goes for $1,000, but some restaurants charge three times that.
The large-bottle collection is exceptional as well. How about, for example, an imperial -- six liters -- of Beaulieu Vineyards 1991 Georges de Latour Private Reserve? Or a double magnum of the 1974 Robert Mondavi Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon? The cost is $600 and $1,200, respectively, but these bottles are not for ordinary mortals.
The cafe has an unexpectedly good selection of Spanish wines and an unexpectedly short selection of Italian offerings. Port, Madeira and Cognac are well represented. The sherries include a fino flown in fresh from Spain. 
"In the old days, people asked for recommendations," he said. "Now all they want to know is if it's from a hot new winery and does it have a high score from the critics.
"Suggest a wine with some age? Forget it. Everyone wants the most recent release from some fancy little winery that has no wine for sale, anyway. It's a dangerous trend."
Recently, Mr. Delissio began to oversee the wine operations at Mr. O'Keeffe's other restaurants, the Water Club and Pershing Square. And he has formed a consulting business to aid places whose sommeliers don't have 23 years' experience. There was a book last year, "The River Cafe Wine Primer" (Little, Brown), and he writes about wine for Bartender magazine.
With all this, I hope he doesn't leave the River Cafe. It's comforting, dealing with a pro.

UNITED NATIONS: ZIONIST GROUP CLEARS HURDLE
A committee of the U.N. Economic and Social Council recommended that Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, be granted consultative status at the United Nations. Hadassah had applied in 1998 to join 2,000 other nongovernmental organizations, advocacy groups and charities allowed to participate in U.N. conferences and advise departments and agencies. Hadassah's application was delayed by objections from Arab countries. Christopher S. Wren

CHILE: PINOCHET DIAGNOSIS
Newspapers reported that tests showed that Gen. Augusto Pinochet suffers from a mild form of dementia -- a diagnosis that prosecutors say means he is fit to stand trial. Judge Juan Guzman, who wants to try General Pinochet on homicide charges, had ordered him to submit to a series of health tests. Newspapers said the general suffered from "a mild vascular dementia" caused by minor strokes in recent years. There was no official confirmation. (AP)

PERU: FINDING IN BERENSON CASE
A Peruvian judge found that a U.S. citizen, Lori Berenson, whose life sentence on terrorism charges was overturned last year, was a collaborator rather than a senior figure in the leftist Tupac Amaru guerrilla group. In a ruling closing his review of the case, Judge Julian Jeri said in Lima that Ms. Berenson had been a collaborator of the guerrillas when they mounted a failed attack on Congress in November 1995. But it was not proven that she had been a leader in the movement or had taken part in any major action on their behalf, he said. The National Chamber for Terrorism Cases now has 30 days in which to set a date for Ms. Berenson to give oral testimony in a civilian court. (Agence France-Presse)

EUROPE

YUGOSLAVIA: WAR CRIMES REBUFF
President Vojislav Kostunica of Yugoslavia, left, said during a visit to Athens that he would have no time to meet Carla del Ponte, the U. N. war crimes tribunal's chief prosecutor, who is to visit Belgrade next week to press for the extradition of Slobodan Milosevic, Mr. Kostunica's predecessor. Mr. Kostunica's remarks quickly drew criticism from his political alliance and are also likely to annoy Western governments. (Reuters)

TURKEY: QUAKE HITS ISTANBUL
A moderate earthquake shook Istanbul residents shortly before dawn, sending hundreds into the streets. There were no reports of serious injuries or damage in the quake, whose magnitude was measured at 4.2. Istanbul, with a population of more than 10 million, sits close to the North Anatolian fault line, which in 1999 unleashed two earthquakes that killed 18,000 people. Douglas Frantz (NYT)

RUSSIA: MEDIA BARON'S AIDE ARRESTED
Russian prosecutors struck another blow at Vladimir Gusinsky's independent Media-Most press empire, arresting the company's top financial officer on unspecified fraud charges. The official, Anton Titov, is one of several Media-Most executives interrogated or jailed in the inquiry, now nearly a year old. Mr. Gusinsky, who calls the inquiry politically motivated, is under house arrest in Spain while Russian prosecutors seek to have him returned. Michael Wines (NYT)

NORWAY: WHALE EXPORT BAN LIFTED
Norway, the only country that conducts commercial whale hunts, said it was lifting its ban on the export of whale meat and products. Whale hunts were resumed in 1993, but exports were barred for fear of international backlash. Norwegians eat whale meat but not the blubber, which is considered a delicacy in Japan and can now be exported there. Environmentalists argued that increasing profits from exports could lead to higher whale quotas and encourage other countries to resume hunts. (AP)

ASIA

SRI LANKA: ASSAULT ON REBELS
Government troops began a huge offensive to recapture a Tamil rebel stronghold in northern Sri Lanka, sending planes and tanks into the attack. At least 22 rebels, 18 soldiers and one civilian were killed, and 89 soldiers were wounded in the first 11 hours of fighting, said a military spokesman, Sanath Karunaratne. "We have recovered 22 bodies of terrorists, and there will be more," Mr. Karunaratne said. (AP)

VIETNAM: VISIT BY U.S. COMMANDER PUT OFF
In a setback for U.S.-Vietnamese ties, Hanoi has called off a visit by a top U.S. military commander, saying its military leadership is too busy to see him. A Ministry of Defense official said the planned visit on Monday by Adm. Dennis Blair, commander of the Pacific Fleet, would be postponed indefinitely. The sudden cancellation cast a shadow over hopes for improved relations between the countries that followed a visit by President Clinton in November. (AP)

AFRICA

MALAWI: EX-MINISTER ACQUITTED
Saying the state had not established its case, a magistrate court acquitted a former cabinet minister, Brown Mpinganjira, on charges of corruption relating to a $2 million contract scheme. Mr. Mpinganjira was accused of authorizing payments to "ghost" contractors to build schools two years ago. The projects were never completed, and the money was said to have been diverted toward campaigning for elections last year. (Agence France-Presse)

MIDDLE EAST

KUWAIT: WOMEN'S RIGHTS CASE REJECTED
The country's highest court rejected a case seeking to win women the right to vote and run for office. Judge Abdullah al-Issa, president of the Constitutional Court, said the man who filed the suit on behalf of his wife and four other women did not have power of attorney to do so. It was only the latest attempt to end male dominance of political institutions. The Legislature voted down an Emiri decree and a bill for suffrage in 1999. In July, the high court refused to hear four cases, also on a technicality. (AP)

CORRECTION-DATE: January 20, 2001

 CORRECTION:
A report by Agence France-Presse in the World Briefing column in some copies on Wednesday about an investigation in Peru involving Lori Berenson, an American imprisoned there, misidentified the official who acted in the case and misstated its legal disposition. The prosecutor, Maria Peralta, recommended that Ms. Berenson be charged as a collaborator with the Tupac Amaru rebel group rather than as a senior figure in it. The judge, Julian Jeri, did not issue a finding that she was a collaborator and did not close his review of the case. The report also misstated the deadline for setting a date for Ms. Berenson to give oral testimony in a civilian court or for the case to be dismissed. It is 3 days after a senior prosecutor receives the recommendation, not 30 days. The report also referred incorrectly to what the Peruvian government said in 1995 was a planned rebel attack on Congress. The authorities say they thwarted the attack before it occurred; the rebels did not mount an attack that failed.

Blue Chips Gain as Investors Avoid Technology Shares

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks rose yesterday as investors sought relief from worries about dwindling high-technology profits and scooped up Wall Street stalwarts like manufacturers, retailers and financial services companies.
 On Monday, financial markets were closed in observance of Martin Luther King's Birthday. 
 Technology stocks slipped as investors braced for earnings reports from Intel and a number of semiconductor equipment makers after the market closed. Traders will be scanning their statements carefully for clues to their profit performance in the months ahead. 
"The sense is all the negative news for this quarter isn't out yet," said Michelle Clayman, chief investment officer at New Amsterdam Partners. "Probably for a number of companies earnings may be disappointing for this quarter and maybe for another quarter."
The Dow Jones industrial average staged a late-day rally, climbing 127.28 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,652.66. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 8.33 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,326.65.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index, however, fell 7.95 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,618.55. The drop was led by the semiconductor sector as well as marquee names like Microsoft, down 94 cents, to $52.56, and Veritas Software, off $5.81, to $90.38.
Intel, the Nasdaq's most actively traded issue, slipped 75 cents, to $31.38. Intel had said on Monday that it would buy Xircom, a maker of mobile computing gear, for $748 million, to complement its line of desktop computer components. Xircom climbed $6.59, to $24.66.
After the market closed, Intel said that its fourth-quarter net income rose 4 percent but that its first-quarter sales would fall about 15 percent. In after-hours trading shares of Intel edged up to $31.63.
Wall Street also awaited results from leading chip equipment makers, including Novellus Systems, and Teradyne.
"I have never seen an earnings period that has been greeted with more trepidation by technology investors," said Arnold Berman, technology strategist with Wit SoundView. "The list of worries so far is a lot longer than the list of surprises."
Signs that the economic slowdown has begun to hurt corporate America's bottom line have become more prevalent, and some analysts expect the worst may be yet to come.
Yesterday's economic data brought more evidence that the once red-hot economy is cooling. Business inventories rose more than expected in November as sales softened for the second consecutive month.
Among blue chips, General Motors was one of the biggest gainers. It rose $2.88, to $55.75, after its subsidiary, Hughes Electronics, said growth in its DirecTV service helped increase its fourth-quarter cash flow.
Investors scooped up drug stocks -- battered in recent weeks -- like Merck, which rose $1.88, to $83.31.
Manufacturers like Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, up $3.81, to $113.50, also benefited from the Nasdaq's lackluster performance.
Financial services stocks advanced after several companies posted strong earnings, among them Citigroup, a Dow component, up $1.56, to $54.69. Citigroup said its profits rose 11 percent, helped by solid growth in its large consumer banking business.
Bank of America recovered from an early slump, after the parent of the nation's biggest bank posted a 27 percent drop in earnings because of loan and investment losses. Its stock dropped as low as $47.75 before recovering, closing up $1.88, to $50.94.
In the Treasury market, bonds rose modestly, but gains were limited as investors struggled to digest a hefty supply of new corporate debt sold last week.
Analysts said Treasuries had a lift after a sharp sell-off on Friday as the market awaited more clear signs on what to expect from the Federal Open Market Committee at its meeting on Jan. 30-31. 
The price of the benchmark 10-year note rose 4/32, to 103 29/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.23 percent from 5.24 percent on Friday. The 30-year bond rose 15/32, to 109 12/32. Its yield fell to 5.60 percent from 5.63 percent on Friday.
The Treasury market was closed on Monday for Martin Luther King's Birthday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Bars Airport Near the Everglades 

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
In a victory for environmental groups and a blow to Miami-Dade County officials, the Clinton administration rejected a plan today to convert the former Homestead Air Force Base into a commercial airport and instead approved the property for more limited development.
 The decision comes after a protracted battle over the fate of the site, which is near two national parks: the Everglades, about 10 miles to the west, and Biscayne National Park, two miles to the east. Miami-Dade County and developers, backed by the county's mayor, Alex Penelas, want to use the property for a new airport to ease congestion from Miami International Airport. Environmental groups have vigorously fought the plan, contending that it would pose a threat to the two parks with air and noise pollution. 
 In announcing the decision today to permit only limited commercial use of the land, the Air Force said it had sought to balance environmental protection and economic development.
"Although we clearly are not giving the county what it sought," said F. Whitten Peters, secretary of the Air Force, "we are, to the greatest extent possible under the circumstances, attempting to leave future development decisions at the former base in the hands of local citizens, through their elected representatives."
Environmental groups praised the decision, calling it an important protection for the grassland, marsh, reefs and barrier islands in the national parks.
"This decision is a victory for common sense and public input over special interests," said Bradford Sewell, lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, which was joined by the Sierra Club, the National Wildlife Federation and nearly 50 other environmental groups in opposing the airport plan. Many state and local elected officials also opposed it, as did Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Carol Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.
Homestead Air Base Developers, the group proposing to develop a commercial airport at the site, said it planned to fight the decision in federal court. 
Mayor Penelas, among the strongest local supporters of the airport, said he was disappointed by the decision not to allow it. 
"We're going to have an airfield capacity shortfall in about 12 to 15 years, and we need to prepare for that," he said.
The mayor added that the Homestead airport proposal was the most ideal solution and that he would not have supported the proposal had he believed it would pose an environmental threat.
Other proponents of the airport plan denounced the Clinton administration's decision.
"Basically we view this as a political decision not based in either science or law," said Ramon Rasco, general counsel for Homestead Air Base Developers.
"All of the studies over all of these years and all of the millions of dollars spent very clearly show that you can have an airport there that will be compatible with the Everglades and the environment," Mr. Rasco said.
The airport proposal began in 1992, after Hurricane Andrew devastated Homestead, a town about 25 miles south of Miami. Thousands of jobs were lost and the Air Force closed the base, dealing another blow to the local economy.
In 1994, the Air Force decided to turn the land over to the county for use as an airport. The plan was intended to relieve congestion at the Miami airport and to help spur development in Homestead. But the plan was fraught with controversy from the start.
In 1996, the Miami-Dade County Commission, with the support of Mayor Penelas, awarded a 70-year lease for the airport's development to Homestead Air Base Developers, a group of politically connected local developers. Environmental groups fought back, saying the airport would generate noise and air pollution that could harm the Everglades.
The following year, the Air Force and the Federal Aviation Administration decided to study the proposal and then reversed earlier approval of the airport.
The decision announced today, in which the Air Force will retain the runway and taxiways at Homestead but transfer the additional 700 acres to the county, seems to support a plan by a separate group of developers. They want to use the land for office and industrial parks, a golf course, water parks and an aquarium, hotels, shops and restaurants.
"Over time, it became clear that a commercial airport is not the only way of achieving desired economic development of southern Miami-Dade County," said Ruby B. DeMesme, assistant secretary of the Air Force, who signed the decision. "The choice is no longer simply between an airport and economic stagnation."

HEADLINE: President of CNNfn Quits As a Revamping Begins 

BYLINE:  By JIM RUTENBERG 

 BODY:
C. Shelby Coffey III, the president of CNN's financial news network, CNNfn, has resigned from his position to pursue the creation of a medical foundation, Mr. Coffey said yesterday.
 His resignation represents the second announced departure of an important CNN executive since CNN's parent company, Time Warner, officially merged with America Online last week. On Friday, CNN announced that Bob Furnad, the president of CNN's Headline News, would leave to pursue a career teaching journalism and consulting with local television stations' news divisions. 
 Both announcements come as AOL Time Warner begins a companywide reorganization that is to involve elimination of hundreds of positions. Employees whose job titles are facing elimination could learn their fate as early as today.
The resignations of Mr. Furnad and Mr. Coffey revived questions about the fate of the CNN spinoff channels that each man headed -- Headline News, which has slipped in the ratings in recent years, and CNNfn, which has forever struggled to gain footing on the country's various cable systems. 
CNN executives said they were emphatic about keeping those networks intact and independent, though, they said, each could see some scaling back of operations under their new corporate parent, which expects all of the company's ventures to work more cohesively and with more of an eye toward making the most of their online businesses.
Executives said they were considering merging the operations of CNNfn with those of its corresponding Web site, CNNfn.com. Like all of CNN, CNNfn is expected to have some staff cuts.
CNN executives are expected to name Teya Ryan, Mr. Coffey's former deputy at CNNfn, to oversee Headline News. A replacement for Mr. Coffey's position was not announced yesterday.
For Mr. Coffey, leaving CNNfn is the latest move in a career in wnich he has occupied some of the most visible positions in journalism. He helped pioneer The Washington Post's Style section. After briefly serving as editor of U.S. News & World Report, he went on to edit The Los Angeles Times from 1989 to 1997. He become the second in command at ABC News before being named to take over CNNfn, as well as to oversee CNN's business news coverage in general, in late 1999.
The obstacles to Mr. Coffey's success at CNNfn were plentiful upon his arrival. The network was still in disarray from the unexpected loss of Lou Dobbs, its former president and leading on-air personality, the previous June. Meanwhile, many of its own corporate siblings, Time Warner's cable systems, would not carry the network, and its rival, CNBC, with much better distribution, was running away with financial news viewers as the economy in general, and the stock market in particular, continued to thrive.
All of this would be daunting even for a seasoned television executive with heavy experience in business news, let alone for someone like Mr. Coffey, who spent most of his career in print journalism dealing with general news and features.
Though the network continues to struggle for distribution, Mr. Coffey did have some impact. He revised its on-air look, ordered increased coverage of technology and put a heavier emphasis on the West Coast economic engine and extended the hours of operation from 18 to 24. He was also able to increase distribution from 15 million to 17 million homes. He revamped CNN's marquee business show, "Moneyline," which executives credited with helping it beat back a strong ratings challenge from CNBC's "Business Center."
But Mr. Coffey was only able to do so much. Briefly into his tenure Time Warner announced its merger with AOL, which effectively hindered Mr. Coffey from undertaking any radical plans. Months later, CNN reorganized its top management, putting two new layers of bureaucracy between Mr. Coffey and the CNN chairman, Tom Johnson, to whom he originally reported directly.
Mr. Coffey said he had been considering leaving the network since that management structure was imposed. "I was discussing this at dinner with Bill Moyers a few days ago, and he said, 'Shelby, why do you always pitch your tent on a volcano?' " Mr. Coffey said in an interview last night.
He said, however, that he believed that CNNfn could have a bright future under its new bosses, who could give it more promotional resources.
"I'm certain that CNNfn will be able to continue to do strong work," Mr. Coffey said.
Mr. Coffey said he would devote much of his time to setting up a foundation with his wife, Dr. Mary Lee Coffey, an emergency-room physician, devoted to bringing new emergency medicine technologies to developing countries.

HEADLINE: $111 Million for Times Sq. Redevelopment Site 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The last vacant parcel in the Times Square redevelopment area sold at auction yesterday for $111.1 million in what was expected to be the first step toward dismantling the vast Milstein real estate empire.
 For nearly half a century, Paul and Seymour Milstein presided over a family empire in New York that swelled to $5 billion and included office towers, apartment buildings, hotels and a bank. 
 Yesterday, Paul Milstein's family agreed to buy the parking lot on the southeast corner of 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue, across the street from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Paul Milstein effectively agreed to buy out his brother and the Weiler family, who together had owned the property since 1984, when they bought it for $5 million. 
At a court-supervised auction, Paul's sons Howard and Edward Milstein made the winning bid for the 38,000-square-foot parking lot. Most real estate experts considered their $111.1 million bid to be a hefty price, given the uncertainty about the economy and the size of the tower that could be built. In recent weeks, nearly 12 qualified bidders dropped out. Only two bids were submitted.
One executive working with the winning bidder said Paul Milstein's family would have paid even more for what it considered to be a very valuable site. Paul's son Howard was ebullient. "I'm sorry we had to go through this process, but we're delighted to have been successful," he said yesterday. "We look forward to developing a wonderful new building for New York City."
Paul and Seymour Milstein had worked closely together for nearly five decades, but as the two brothers neared retirement, a bitter battle over succession began to take shape.
The bickering, especially the tension between Seymour Milstein and his nephew Howard, has been going on for years, but it became public more recently as family members filed a series of lawsuits and counterclaims against one another. The two sides are also warring over control of the Emigrant Savings Bank.
Last year, Seymour Milstein, who is 80 and owned a 20 percent stake in the parking lot, and Alan G. Weiler, whose family owned 50 percent, sought to dissolve the partnership and block Howard Milstein from unilaterally developing the site. A court eventually ordered the property to be sold at auction, with minimum bids set at $100 million.
But as the auction date neared, it was unclear whether anyone would bid. That would have sent the partners back to court. According to executives familiar with the bidding, Seymour Milstein and Mr. Weiler were so intent on ending the partnership that they teamed up with a developer, Douglas Durst, to make the only other bid, $100 million.
"We're very satisfied with the process," said Abby Hamlin, a developer who was advising Seymour Milstein and the Weiler family. "We're looking forward to the closing."
Since his family already owns 30 percent of the property, Howard Milstein and his family will have to pay $77.8 million.
According to one person involved in the dealings, they put down a $1 million deposit yesterday, and $2.5 million more is due within the week. The rest must be paid within 90 days.
"You have to assume that he has a tenant in hand who's willing to pay record rents in Times Square," said Joseph R. Harbert, chief operating officer for the New York region at Insignia/ESG, a real estate company, referring to Howard Milstein. "Otherwise there's no rationale for the price."
A state official said yesterday that it was unclear how big a building Howard Milstein could erect on the site. Two years ago, Mr. Milstein talked about building a 35-story tower of up to a million square feet, although state officials preferred something smaller. Last year, state officials transferred some of the development rights to a nearby parcel on Eighth Avenue, between 40th and 41st Streets, where The New York Times is negotiating to build a 1.37 million-square-foot tower.
Under rules for redeveloping Times Square, the Milsteins must include entertainment and retail uses, raising development costs.

HEADLINE: Governor Presents $83.6 Billion Budget 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki proposed a $83.6 billion budget today that would raise state spending by 5.3 percent but cut financing for mass transportation and nursing homes while salting away $1.4 billion to guard against a slowing economy.
 It was the second year in a row that the governor has proposed an increase in overall spending above the rate of inflation. As in last year's plan, Mr. Pataki has veered away from the painful cutbacks and big tax cuts than he championed in his first five years in office. He also called for changing the way the state allots school aid to give districts more control over the money. 
 Mr. Pataki portrayed his budget, the first to exceed $80 billion, as a conservative and prudent plan that would protect the state from an economic downturn, while continuing his philosophy of cutting taxes, reducing the size of government and being fiscally cautious.
"We cannot, and will not, return to the dark days when government spent more than it could afford, then used gimmicks and raised taxes to make up the difference," Mr. Pataki said in his address to the Legislature presenting his plan. "Now more than ever it is imperative to remember that surpluses are meant to be saved, not spent. Virtually every reputable economist has been forecasting a national economic slowdown in the months ahead."
If the past serves as a guide, the state Legislature is likely to fight to add money to the budget during the months of negotiations to come. The governor's chief Democratic adversary, Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the Assembly, predicted that the Democrats would fight for more money for education, transportation and Medicaid. He said the governor's proposed changes to state financing for schools, which will raise spending by $382 million, would in fact provide $1 billion less to local school districts than the current aid formulas would dictate.
Mr. Silver also said it was unconscionable to slash financing for nursing homes and transportation projects when the state has a large surplus. He said the surplus would be more than $2 billion by the end of the next fiscal year.
"I'm really disappointed that we are cutting education and, specifically, nursing homes," Mr. Silver said. "There is no reform in the education formula the governor has proposed. The reform word is used to mask cuts in the education budget."
Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the leader of the Republican majority in the Senate, praised Mr. Pataki for a budget that "sets the tone for all of us here in this state, in the right direction." But he predicted that the governor's education plan would undoubtedly be fought in the Legislature. "Education will undoubtedly be the most contentious issue," he said. "It gets down to shares, to where the school aid flows."
Mr. Pataki largely ignored a landmark court ruling last week that ordered the state government to spend significantly more on New York City schools after finding that the state had not met its obligation under the state Constitution to urban students.
Saying he would appeal the court decision, the governor said his proposal to streamline the current school aid formulas and direct more of it to school districts with impoverished or immigrant students would solve the problems the court addressed. 
Specifically, Mr. Pataki proposed raising school aid by $382 million, to $14.1 billion. The governor called for distributing the increase according to formulas based on the poverty of the districts and on the cost of living.
Aides to the governor maintained that under this arrangement New York City would get about $5.2 billion, or 37 percent, of the entire school aid pie, which is proportional to its share of students.
The governor's budget was also notable for what it omitted. It would do very little to offset the gaping hole in the five-year capital plans for the State Transportation Department and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority which were created when state voters rejected a $3.8 billion bond act in November. Mr. Pataki promised to draw about $250 million from a reserve fund to keep construction on two large upstate highway projects under way, but he left the M.T.A. to contend with filling a $1.6 billion shortfall in its already shaky capital plan. In the next fiscal year alone, the M.T.A. would have to come up with $320 million to keep its projects going.
"There's $250 million in the budget to deal with the road and bridge portion, and nothing for mass transit, zero, zip, nada, capital money for transit projects," said Gene Russianoff, a staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group for subway riders.
For his part, Mr. Pataki said the M.T.A. would have to find a way to finance the projects on its own. Among the major capital projects that could be endangered are the Second Avenue subway, the extension of the N train to La Guardia Airport and a plan to connect the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal.
Assemblywoman Catherine T. Nolan, a Democrat of Queens and one of the four members of the review board that must approve the M.T.A. capital plan, said: "It was a surprising omission, given the gravity of the need. It's very upsetting that he proposed some pay-as-you-go for upstate and not for the metro area."
The budget does include increases of about $150 million for bridge and highway construction and about $120 million in new operating aid for mass transit systems, including $81 million for the M.T.A. That increase will do nothing to help the M.T.A. capital plan, however. 
Mr. Pataki plans to cut $322 million in Medicaid reimbursements to nursing homes. He argues that private nursing homes are reaping enormous profits and banking them instead of plowing them back into capital improvements and increasing staff size.
Assembly Democrats, however, said staffing shortages at nursing homes would only be worsened by the cuts and vowed to fight them.
"This is really back to the bad old days of Medicaid cuts," said Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, a Manhattan Democrat and chairman of the health committee.

Chiquita Brands Faces Prospect of Bankruptcy
Chiquita Brands International, the largest producer of bananas in the world, says it cannot pay its debts and will probably have to go into bankruptcy court because, it contends, the Clinton administration has not been able to force the European Union to trade fairly.
 Chiquita says that European quotas against bananas grown in Latin America, as Chiquita's are, have cost the company $200 million a year since 1992 and have brought it to the brink of bankruptcy. Page A1. 

Affirmative-Action Rules Rejected
A federal appeals court struck down affirmative-action rules intended to increase job opportunities for minorities and women in the broadcasting industry after finding that they were unconstitutional. The decision was the second since 1998 in which the court vacated federal affirmative-action rules imposed on broadcasters, all but ending prospects that the industry will face obligations to recruit minorities and women in the near future.

HEADLINE: Mr. Pataki's Misstep on Schools 

 BODY:
Gov. George Pataki plunged into the problems of New York City's schools yesterday with an announcement that he would appeal a landmark judicial ruling that called for drastic increases in education aid to the city. That is a serious mistake that will only slow efforts to rectify the glaring deficiencies that led to Justice Leland DeGrasse's historic ruling that the state has failed to guarantee a sound, basic education to city schoolchildren as required by the State Constitution. At the same time, the governor proposed an $83.6 billion budget for the year beginning April 1 that will include a modest step toward ensuring that the city gets more education aid, though nowhere near the scale needed to remedy the defects cited by Justice DeGrasse.
 State officials contend that Mr. Pataki had to appeal because it would be irresponsible to commit the state to large expenditures on the basis of a single judge's opinion. We hope that Justice DeGrasse's decision is upheld by the appellate justices, putting it beyond further resistance by state officials. Meanwhile, the legal maneuvering does not excuse the Legislature from moving more forcefully to redress the deficiencies highlighted by Justice DeGrasse. 
 In his budget yesterday, Mr. Pataki increased school spending over all to more than $14 billion and proclaimed an important principle for Albany, that state school spending should be channeled to those districts that need it the most, and not to those with the most political clout. To reach that goal, the governor would consolidate about 70 percent of state aid now spread through nearly a dozen different programs into one program and give greater spending flexibility to each district -- a potentially useful approach provided it does not become an excuse for cutting vital spending in special education or other areas. He would ensure that every district gets at least a small increase in the consolidation and would spread the largest increases to New York City and needy upstate schools. 
But the overall increase in school spending would be only $382 million, not enough to make much of a difference for city schools. Democrats, led by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, were right to promise yesterday to increase it. The governor's proposed budget also cut back on increases in city school aid in separate programs for early childhood education that had been agreed upon last year. These cuts need to be restored.
The Republican-controlled State Senate has long championed aid formulas that favor the G.O.P. base in the suburbs and upstate. Mr. Pataki said yesterday that he did not want a judge determining school aid formulas. But the best way to avert that possibility would be to ensure that the formulas do not deprive some students of their rights. The most persuasive part of Justice DeGrasse's ruling was not his attack on the arcane aid formulas. It was his conclusion that because of collapsed school buildings, unqualified teachers, poor textbooks and materials and other factors, New York City pupils are not getting the sound, basic education required by the State Constitution. To address that finding, the Legislature and governor need to concentrate less on formulas than on the situation in the schools themselves, and to make sure that the money is provided to overcome the system's shortcomings. Some of this money may have to be provided by the city's budget as well as the state's. 
In other areas, Mr. Pataki proposed a prudent budget that includes only limited tax cuts and spending restraint in other areas. He argued that with the state about to face an economic slowdown, this is no time to embark on expensive new programs. Governor Pataki is to be commended for his caution, but the cuts that he proposed for nursing homes, transit projects and revenue sharing for New York City are punitive and need to be restored by the Legislature.

HEADLINE: A Hong Kong Stalwart Resigns 

 BODY:
The early resignation of Anson Chan as Hong Kong's second-ranking official is an unmistakable warning that the territory's democratic safeguards are being eroded under Beijing's rule. Mrs. Chan, appointed by the last British governor, Chris Patten, as the independent director of Hong Kong's non-political civil service, has made herself a symbol of the autonomy China pledged to respect in Hong Kong when it resumed sovereignty over the territory in 1997. Her decision last week to step down more than a year before the scheduled end of her term signaled that she no longer felt able to guarantee Hong Kong's autonomy in the face of increasing interference from mainland China. 
 Some of the worst fears about heavy-handed Chinese rule over Hong Kong have so far not come to pass. Just last weekend some 1,200 members of the Falun Gong sect, which has been heavily persecuted on the mainland, were allowed to hold a mass gathering in a concert hall owned by the Hong Kong government. Hong Kong's economy has also recovered surprisingly well from the 1997 Asian financial crisis, which closely coincided with the transition to Chinese sovereignty. 
 But the news has been less encouraging on issues of democratic accountability and institutional independence in the territory. The chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, is answerable only to Beijing, which appointed him. Under Mr. Tung's unpopular administration there have been serious encroachments by China on the authority of Hong Kong's courts, repeated government pressures on the news media and abuses of academic freedom. 
Mrs. Chan's efforts to keep the civil service clear of politics earned her a rebuke last fall from China's deputy prime minister, who called on her to be more supportive of Mr. Tung. Although Mrs. Chan now portrays her resignation as motivated simply by a desire to spend more time with her family, it seems fair to conclude that she could no longer in good conscience remain associated with this government. 
The West should not respond to her departure by resigning itself to further erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy. It should redouble its efforts to hold China to its commitment to respect Hong Kong's basic political and economic freedoms until at least 2047. Another credible and independent civil servant, Donald Tsang, stays on as Hong Kong's financial secretary and is a likely candidate to succeed Mrs. Chan.
The incoming Bush administration has indicated that it will apply more critical standards to China than the Clinton administration has, and it points out that in some areas Beijing's actions may conflict with American interests. Chinese pressure on Hong Kong's independent institutions is one obvious example.

HEADLINE: Pity the Vote Counter? What About the Caterer? 

BYLINE:  By MARIAN BURROS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
Democrats and Republicans were not the only ones on tenterhooks for the 37 days it took to decide who would be the next president. Washington's caterers, party planners, calligraphers, equipment rental companies, not to mention hostesses, were also chewing their fingernails. 
 "It was a very tense time," said Carolyn Peachy, one of the most formidable of Washington's event and party planners. "We were in list hell for four weeks because there are so many new people. Now we are in response hell." 
 Parties for hundreds have been organized in less than a week. Invitations are not engraved; in fact, sometimes they are faxed. There is no time for comparison shopping among caterers. Invitations sent to 100 people bring last-minute responses from 200 as people call and ask to be invited. 
In an ordinary inaugural year there would have been plenty of time to ask a new member of the administration to be the guest of honor, to find out who should be be on the guest list and where to send the invitations. And plenty of time for the responses. But most of the planning for this inaugural did not start until Jan. 2. 
"There is so much you cannot do until you know who you are doing it for and what you are doing it around," Ms. Peachy said. "It's a question of style. They have things in Texas they do not have in Tennessee, such as margaritas."
And that is why Buffy Cafritz, a Washington hostess, is having margaritas instead of martinis this year at the quadrennial bipartisan after-the-balls party on Saturday night. 
Telescoping the planning into a shorter period does have some advantages. Clients cannot spend as much time making decisions about the menu, about the color of the tablecloths, even about which caterer they should hire.
"Decisions have to be made faster, and in some ways that's better because no one has time to dally," said Bill Holman, a partner in the catering company Design Cuisine. "It's let's go. Boom. Boom."
But time crunches can also be more costly. "If fabric for a tablecloth has to be flown in from California or North Carolina, they're going to put a premium on it," Mr. Holman said. "We were calling Turkey today looking for something. Now it's beyond insanity. The fabric people are saying, 'What's going on there?' and I tell them, it's the inaugural, now shut up and buy it and fly it in.' " 
Time constraints also put an end to the usual competition among caterers. "Literally, there was no time to collect bids," said Eric Michael, who with is brother, owns the catering firm Occasions. "No tastings, no haggling. We had fewer meetings, offered fewer menus. But in reality caterers at a certain level are pretty close in price."
Despite general inflation, catering prices over the last eight years have been fairly stable.
"I'm probably charging the same price per head I did eight years ago," said Carol Bloom, an owner of the catering firm Windows. "Everybody is on a tight budget. Nobody's asked me for beluga caviar or foie gras. The last time was when Reagan was inaugurated. We were importing food from everywhere and no one cared about the cost. For the last eight years, we've been doing mashed potatoes and meat loaf. Dinners used to be $175 a person. Now it's $75 to $110. "
Even the dinners for the Republican donors who contributed from $15,000 to $20,000 are "not a pull-out-all-the-stops dinner," said the caterer Eric Michael. "If it were, it would be four or five courses instead of three and the main course choices wouldn't include chicken." 
Dinner on Friday night for the big givers -- $175,000 over four years -- will start with lobster and caviar, though it is not beluga.
Corporations and politicians are sensitive about all the money that is being spent on inaugural festivities and many want to keep a low profile. A note next to the names of House members and senators who have reservations at the Caucus Room restaurant during the inauguration festivities says do not give out.
The Marriott Corporation, which is holding a dinner on Saturday at the Corcoran Gallery of Art for 400 people did not want its menu released.
But not all the new people coming to town are worried if they look like big spenders. "I've noticed a completely different clientele," said Jean Jacques Retourne, the maitre d'hotel at Citronelle. "They are Beverly Hills kind of people: women with a lot more makeup and men with a lot of Cartier watches. And I'm seeing a lot more fur coats."

HEADLINE: Highlights of the Pataki Budget Plan 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed state budget for the fiscal year that begins April 1 is the seventh spending plan he has issued as governor. In his budget, he proposed overall spending of $83.6 billion, a figure that includes federal aid for programs like welfare and Medicaid. If enacted, the budget would represent a 5.3 percent increase in state spending.
 The portion to be raised by the state totals $57.4 billion, up 4.9 percent. Of that, the general fund, which includes most tax revenue, would rise 3.6 percent, to $41.3 billion, though the definition of the fund has changed over the years to artificially limit its growth. 
 The following are some proposals' highlights:

Education
Governor Pataki proposed consolidating 11 school aid categories and giving local districts far greater latitude in spending the money. Among the categories affected would be those for special education, and for students with limited knowledge of English -- moves that critics say could be the subject of court fights for years.
Over all, the governor proposed increasing school aid by $382 million, or 2.8 percent, to about $14.1 billion. When adjusted for inflation and the rising student population, that is a decline in spending per pupil.
The governor called for freezing spending for prekindergarten classes, reducing class sizes in elementary schools, and a package of related programs. Those efforts, the pet project of the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, were created under a 1997 agreement between the governor and the Legislature that called for them to grow to more than $600 million this school year, and $1.2 billion next year. Since the agreement, the governor has repeatedly tried, without success, to scale back the programs.
Mr. Pataki proposed strengthening the state law that prohibits school districts from using increases in state aid to make up for a decline in the districts' spending from their own tax revenues. And he proposed a system of incentives so that school systems that improve can receive more state money.

Health Care
Mr. Pataki proposed a 5 percent increase in Medicaid spending, the largest portion of the budget, to $32.4 billion. That reflects both the rising basic cost of Medicaid, the health insurance program primarily for the poor, and the expansion of programs enacted in recent years to help low-income working people obtain coverage. But he also said he would try to cut more than $300 million in Medicaid spending on nursing homes and at-home care.
About half the money for Medicaid programs is provided by the federal government, and the rest comes from the state and local governments.
Mr. Pataki is seeking a 20 percent increase in the Health Department budget, to almost $800 million. The rise would pay for a variety of programs already enacted, including increased subsidies for prescription drugs for the low-income elderly and efforts to combat the West Nile virus.

Tax Cuts
The governor's budget reflects $1.8 billion in tax cuts enacted in previous years that will take effect in the new fiscal year. He also proposed more than $500 million a year in new tax cuts, some of which would be phased in over several years.
Among those are several aimed at helping manufacturers and other businesses. The tax breaks would include expansion of the "empire zone" program, in which companies receive tax breaks for moving to blighted areas, and also help property owners cover the cost of cleaning up environmental contamination. And the governor is seeking to expand a program that reduces homeowners' property taxes.

Transportation
Mr. Pataki's budget proposal largely ignores the voter rejection in November of a $3.8 billion bond act for mass transit and highway improvements.
Of that figure, $1.6 billion was earmarked for New York City's subways and buses, and for the metropolitan region's commuter rail network. The money would have helped pay for such projects as the proposed Second Avenue subway line, and a connection between the Long Island Rail Road and Grand Central Terminal.
The governor proposed spending $250 million for highway projects to make up a small part of the loss of money from the bond act. 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 22, 2001

 CORRECTION:
Articles on Wednesday and Thursday about Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed budget referred imprecisely to his proposal for school aid. His office says that his proposal for a 2.8 percent increase, when adjusted for projected declines in inflation and student enrollment, would still result in a net increase. Only if inflation and enrollment followed current trends would it amount to a slight decline in real dollars.

HEADLINE: Inventories Rise; Sales Fall for 2nd Month 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
Inventories of unsold goods at American companies piled up in November as sales fell for the second consecutive month, adding to mounting evidence of a slumping economy. 
 Stockpiles of goods nationwide rose 0.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted $1.22 trillion in November, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Sales dropped 0.3 percent, to $896.3 billion. 
 "Weakening domestic demand kept inventory accumulation high," said Stan Shipley, a Merrill Lynch economist. 
The inventory-to-sales ratio, which measures how long it would take businesses to exhaust their inventories at the current sales pace, rose to 1.36 months in November, the highest since April 1999.

HEADLINE: PATAKI TO APPEAL DECISION BY JUDGE ON AID TO SCHOOLS 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA with ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki said today that New York State would appeal a landmark court ruling that ordered a major increase in spending on New York City schools, even as he proposed a budget that contained a small rise in school aid.
 The governor proposed combining 11 categories of state aid to local schools into a single lump sum, giving districts far greater latitude in spending the money. His plan, a bid to reform a notoriously cumbersome set of financing formulas, addresses one issue raised in the court case, but is likely to meet with resistance as the Legislature considers his budget in the coming months. Page B6. 
 At a news conference after his annual budget message, Mr. Pataki repeatedly refused to directly address last week's ruling by Justice Leland DeGrasse of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, except to say that he and the Legislature should determine state policy and decide how much to spend. 
"You can't have a judge running an entire educational system," he said. "We will challenge that decision because we want to make sure that that responsibility rests with the elected officials."
An appeal to the Appellate Division of Supreme Court, and after that possibly to the Court of Appeals, would almost certainly void the Sept. 15 deadline that Justice DeGrasse set for overhauling the way the state finances public education. It could delay a resolution until after the 2002 election, which would give the governor the chance to reverse some or all of a ruling that amounts to political dynamite as he faces re-election.
Complying with the judge's ruling could force the state to come up with more than $1 billion a year for the New York City schools, and any of the mechanisms for doing that would anger a significant part of the Legislature and the electorate.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Harold O. Levy, the city schools chancellor, expressed muted disappointment at news of the governor's plans, saying that they agreed with the judge's basic point that the city schools should receive more aid.
"I would have preferred that he didn't appeal," the mayor said at a news conference tonight at Gracie Mansion. "We believe that the judge's decision is right."
The governor deflected a barrage of questions about the court ruling by saying several times that he had all but eliminated the inequity that has historically sent less state aid per pupil to New York City schools than the statewide average.
But Justice DeGrasse's ruling dealt primarily with the adequacy of school financing, not just the equity. He found that the state had not met its obligation, under the State Constitution, to provide a "sound, basic education" to the city's children -- a goal that he said would simply require much more money.
He also concluded that the system violated federal civil rights laws, because black and Hispanic children are more likely than whites to receive a substandard education.
Mr. Pataki would not say, despite repeated prodding, whether he thought spending on New York City schools was adequate. But he made it plain that he believed that the judge had overstepped his authority and that parts of his ruling, at least, were simply wrong.
Several times, the governor noted that state aid to schools had risen sharply in the last four years, but he added, "Simply adding money isn't enough."
Mr. Pataki proposed today a $382 million increase in state aid to schools, to $14.1 billion in the next school year. Of that increase, $202 million would go to New York City.
In real terms -- adjusted for inflation and the rising student population -- what the governor has proposed is actually a slight decline in school aid, both statewide and for the city. This is, of course, merely the opening bid of an annual poker game, in which the governor starts with a low number that he knows the Legislature will drive up in budget negotiations.
Mr. Pataki made no mention of the court case or the judge's decision in his 30-minute budget address or in the budget documents. He took up the subject only under repeated questioning at the news conference.
The governor said he wanted to strengthen the state's "maintenance of effort" law, which seeks to prevent local governments from using state aid as cover for reducing their own spending on a function. He gave no details, but lawmakers in both parties said adjusting that law would go nowhere near addressing Justice DeGrasse's decision.
The judge's ruling, which capped an eight-year-old lawsuit filed by a group called the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, signaled a need to increase the budget for New York City's schools by $1 billion to $2 billion a year, in addition to the current $12 billion in city, state and federal aid.
Albany lawmakers say there are two obvious ways to do that. One would be to decrease spending on relatively wealthy suburban areas that are the governor's base of support. The other would be to simply come up with new money for schools, by taking it out of the state's coffers or forcing the city to produce the money. Either approach would carry a heavy political price for the governor, a Republican, and many legislators, Republican and Democratic.
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat who is planning to run against Mr. Pataki next year, sees education funding as a potent issue, and he has repeatedly called the current system inadequate. "All his appeal does is delay the solution," Mr. McCall said today.
Though nearly every state political figure, regardless of party, had expected the governor to appeal, he had refused to say before today that he meant to do so. His aides said Mr. Pataki simply needed time to have his lawyers review the 200-page ruling, but Democrats here complained that he was ducking the issue.
"There is no reform in the education formula the governor proposed," said Sheldon Silver, a Democrat and the Assembly speaker. "I think the 'reform' word was used to mask cuts."
The state funnels aid to local school districts through more than 50 categories, most earmarked for specific purposes, like prekindergarten classes or computers. Behind each number is a bewildering set of formulas -- renegotiated each year in a fundamentally political process by the governor and legislative leaders -- that determine how much each district will get from each category.
Justice DeGrasse's ruling said the system should be scrapped and replaced with a more transparent approach that bases aid to districts on their actual needs. 
Immediately after the judge's decision, legislators from both major parties pointed out that the city's own spending on its schools had risen more slowly than the state's, and said any additional money should come from the city's own budget. That prompted Mr. Giuliani to insist that the state was to blame for the schools' problems, and should pay to fix them.
Mr. Pataki today proposed folding 11 of the largest school aid categories into one, so that about 70 percent of the aid to districts would be relatively unencumbered, up from about half. He would eliminate aid earmarked for special education, for aiding students with limited knowledge of English and for programs for gifted children, among others, letting districts spend the money as they see fit.
While legislators and local school officials generally laud the goal of giving districts greater flexibility, each of those pots of money represents a hard-won gain for an alliance of parents, lawmakers and school administrators, who might be reluctant to give it up.
Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat who heads the Assembly Education Committee, dismissed the governor's proposal as "the makings of another lawsuit," saying he questioned both the legality and the propriety of the move.
Even the governor's chief legislative ally, Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the Senate, would not say in any detail what he thought of Mr. Pataki's proposal, calling it simply "a good beginning."
But aides to the governor said Justice DeGrasse's ruling could put pressure on the Legislature to accept Mr. Pataki's streamlining plan.
Michael A. Rebell, the executive director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, said he hoped that the Legislature would move ahead with the governor's plan to revamp the formulas, rather than wait for an appeals court to rule.

Since 1990, as all four major North American professional sports leagues expanded and teams agitated for new homes or moved to new cities, 21 new stadiums and 30 arenas have been built across the continent -- a remarkable construction boom.
 Eleven more arenas and stadiums are under construction from Pittsburgh to Seattle, and financing has been or is nearly secured for nine others. 
 Yet over that time, no major league stadium or arena has been built in the New York metropolitan area. The newest in the region is Continental Arena in the New Jersey Meadowlands, which opened 20 years ago. The oldest, Yankee Stadium, was completed in 1923 and rebuilt in the 1970's. 
There are many reasons big-league ballparks in the New York region are older than those in the rest of the country. Many independent consultants and local elected officials say part of the blame lies with George Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees, who has failed to resolve where he wants his team to play in the future.
While the Yankees have talked intermittently with city and state officials about a new stadium, plans for other teams, including the Mets, have been delayed, many people said.
Mr. Steinbrenner is still intrigued by the possibility of a new ballpark on the West Side of Manhattan, several officials familiar with his thinking said, even though nearly all of the city's senior elected officials and many community and civic groups are opposed.
Teams in the New York-New Jersey area also tend to be high-revenue operations, because of the region's huge fan base and television audience. That makes local and state governments less enthusiastic about spending huge amounts of taxpayers' money to build new stadiums and arenas.
The teams' financial well-being also makes it harder for them to make credible threats to leave the region, which is the leverage often used by professional teams across the country to get public financing for new buildings.
Several New Yorkers asserted that the inability to keep up with the national building boom was not a problem at all; the region's stadiums and arenas are still in relatively good condition, they said, and there is no need to rush to replace them.
But others said the region had fallen behind most of the country. This has occurred even though New York City has been governed since 1994 by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, an avid baseball fan and a relentless booster of new stadiums. So far, he has succeeded only in building two minor-league baseball stadiums.

A Lack of Consensus
As other cities converted wishes and blueprints into sports Xanadus, whatever lust for new stadiums existed regionally has been stalled by indecision and a lack of political consensus.
"In most other markets, you have one city, with one team in each category, but New York has multiple teams, making it more difficult," said Roger Goodell, the executive vice president of the National Football League. "Whatever you do for the Yankees, you have to do for the Mets, and whatever you do for the Mets, you have to do for the Jets."
Indicative of New York's plight is the Mets, whose co-owner, Fred Wilpon, proposed building a retro-style stadium with a retractable roof in 1998. The plan has barely moved forward.
"It's a shame," Mr. Wilpon said. "I think the resources are there, but it's a complex and difficult process."
While the Yankees' indecision has hurt the Mets, so has the Mets' inability to agree with city and state officials on how much of the team's proposed $500 million ballpark, designed to echo Ebbets Field, would be financed by the government and how much by the team. Similarly, the Nets and the Devils, now along with the Yankees jointly owned by the corporation called YankeeNets, have not yet worked out with New Jersey officials how much the state and local governments would pay to help the teams build a new $350 million arena in Newark for hockey and basketball.
Because the metropolitan region is large and affluent -- and it is not struggling to attract or retain big-league teams -- there is not the same impetus to build new stadiums that exists elsewhere, Marc S. Ganis, a sports finance consultant, said. 
"There has been inertia," he said, "but it goes to the point that the New York market is so rich without any new stadiums that there is none of the urgency we saw in Cleveland or Baltimore, where they needed new stadiums."
The Devils made the most serious threat to leave the area, when they were wooed in 1995 to be the primary tenant of a new arena in Nashville. The team eventually chose to renegotiate its lease at Continental Arena.
Most teams in the New York area, except the Giants and the Islanders, are operating under leases that date from the 1970's and 1980's and are to expire no later than 2008.
The urgency to build has been conspicuously absent in a region where the Yankees have drawn more than three million fans in each of the past two seasons and won four of the past five World Series in aging Yankee Stadium. The Mets attracted nearly three million people last season at Shea, when they won the National League pennant.
The Knicks and the Rangers consistently sell out Madison Square Garden, even when they play badly, while the Jets and the Giants have long waiting lists for season tickets at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., where both teams play.
"I would really pursue getting the Mets' deal done," said Peter F. Vallone, the Speaker of the New York City Council. "The Yankees are in good shape, doing fine in Yankee Stadium. We only have to reform Yankee Stadium and make it suitable for the 21st century."

'A Sign of Savvy'
Some people even said that the failure to build new ballparks in New York might not be a problem at all.
"Maybe it's not a sign of dysfunction, but a sign of savvy that nothing's gotten built here," said Mitchell Moss, the director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University. "Maybe New York is smarter than anywhere else and our economy is so good that we don't need new stadiums or arenas."
Nearly all of the region's stadiums and arenas are in relatively good repair and have good sight lines for fans. But the economics of major leagues sports have changed, and many executives say that teams must have stadiums and arenas with luxury boxes and other amenities to raise additional revenues to pay soaring player salaries.
In Miami, for example, the Heat of the National Basketball Association and the Panthers of the National Hockey League had shared an arena that opened in 1988. Each team moved into a new arena of its own, in large part because the old one had only 15 luxury boxes and did not produce enough revenue.
The New York and New Jersey teams are pressing local and state governments with demands to help finance a public works backlog of sports palaces. In addition to the new ballparks sought by the Yankees and Mets, the Jets want a new home of their own, after playing in the Giants' home for 16 years. The Devils and the Nets are pushing for their arena in Newark, and the Islanders eventually want a new hockey arena to replace Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y. The Islanders, though, are not pressing for one now, because of Nassau County's fiscal troubles.

Scouting New Garden Sites
Cablevision, which owns the Knicks and the Rangers, is scouting several sites for a new Madison Square Garden in Manhattan, including a state-owned site on the West Side that is coveted by the Jets and that has also been sought by a group making a bid to play host to the 2012 Summer Olympics.
"The best scenario is the Jets make a deal this year for a stadium to be ready in 2009," said Jay Kriegel, an organizer of the Olympic bid, "so that while the Olympic selection process goes on, we'll have a stadium in the works." A decision on a host for the 2012 Games is expected to be made in 2005.
The Giants even want renovations at Giants Stadium, which opened in 1976. The team is talking about a substantial rebuilding, or what could amount to a new stadium in the Meadowlands.
"Let's assume you spend $150 million or $175 million on renovations," said James DiEleuterio, the president of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority. "Then you're realistically planning a new stadium."
From east to west, then, as many as eight major projects are being pursued by major league teams. And that does not include the MetroStars of Major League Soccer, who are seeking a soccer-only stadium in New Jersey and intend to start an expansion team in either Queens or Long Island, where the team would also like to build a new stadium.
"It's a load from a public financing perspective," said Sam Katz, president of EnterSport Capital Advisors, a consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. "Because all of these projects were deferred, and are coming all at once, at the end of this construction cycle, a 45,000-seat baseball stadium that cost $120 million in Baltimore in 1992 will cost a half-billion or more in New York."
Even in regions that do not have nine professional teams all clamoring for new homes, negotiations tend to be time-consuming, complicated political-financial ordeals. Often, it is tougher to cobble together a deal for an existing team than it is to get approval for a new stadium to lure an expansion team or a team from another city -- a process that plays heavily on civic pride and aspirations of being "major league."
"More mature cities have a harder time building a constituency for a new stadium," said Jay Cross, who is in charge of planning a new stadium for the Jets.
Creating constituencies has been easier in some cities. In Atlanta, in Cleveland and in Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fla., a football stadium, a baseball park, and an arena for basketball and hockey have been built in each city over the past decade. Some negotiations take years, if not decades. In Chicago, there were as many as 15 plans for a future home for the Bears, dating from the reign of Mayor Richard J. Daley and concluding with talks between the team and his son, Richard M. Daley, the current mayor.
An agreement on a $587 million plan to rebuild Soldier Field was reached late last year. The Bears' deal was helped along by the availability of an N.F.L. loan program, the use of a city hotel tax and the departure from the negotiations of the team chairman, Michael McCaskey, who is part of the family that owns the Bears, in favor of Ted Phillips, the team president and chief executive.
"There was not a good relationship fostered in the past with Mayor Daley," Mr. Phillips said. "And you don't get anything done in Chicago without Mayor Daley."
In Boston, state financing for a new, $665 million Fenway Park was passed late last year, but the Red Sox's ownership soon announced that it would have to sell the team to someone capable of bankrolling the $400 million the team must put up for the new ballpark.

Quick Deal in Miami
One of the quickest negotiations in recent years occurred in Miami, where John Henry, a commodities broker, bought the Florida Marlins and less than a year later signed an agreement to help finance a $385 million ballpark with public aid from a Miami-Dade County hotel tax.
The Yankees, on the other hand, have been talking with the city and state since the mid-1980's about rebuilding Yankee Stadium or constructing a new one. But nothing has been resolved.
The mayor reiterated last month that there is money available for new homes for the Yankees, Mets and Jets. He has proposed that the cost of each new stadium be shared equally by the teams, the city and the state, although state officials say the mayor has never discussed his idea with them.
"I believe that public money to build ball fields at a certain level is appropriate," the mayor said.
Despite his grand ambitions, Mayor Giuliani so far has been able to get approval for only two new minor-league baseball stadiums. One, in Staten Island, will cost $71 million, the most ever spent on a minor-league stadium, and the other, in Coney Island, will cost $39 million.
Mr. Steinbrenner and his associates declined to be interviewed about their long-term plans. But people familiar with Steinbrenner's thinking say he is still tantalized by the possibility of a new ballpark on the site on the West Side of Manhattan that is also sought by the Jets and the Olympic organizers.
Mr. Wilpon has not explained publicly why his talks with the city have not yielded an agreement for a new stadium. He declined to say whether a Mets agreement could be reached before the Yankees' future is decided.
Even many of the elected officials vehemently opposed to spending public money for a new Yankee Stadium in Manhattan support the mayor's current plan for helping the baseball teams build new homes in the Bronx and Queens. Mr. Vallone, the City Council speaker, said he agreed that the city should pay as much as one-third of the cost of new ballparks, but he would not say if the city should limit how much it will pay for each project. 
And even if the city and the teams can agree on an overall formula, there could be disagreement over what the money should pay for.
"We shouldn't be paying for a stadium," said Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough president. "It should be for infrastructure that we own, or the state owns, or the feds can participate in. There are luxury boxes, naming rights and sponsorships that can pay for stadiums."

HEADLINE: Environmental Radicals Set Fire to Trucks; F.B.I. Raids House for Clues 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Jan. 16 

 BODY:
An elusive band of environmental radicals has struck again on Long Island, this time claiming responsibility for the torching of two trucks at a North Shore construction company on Sunday morning.
 A day after the arson, the Federal Bureau of Investigation seized computer files and other material from a suburban house a few miles from the crime scene in Suffolk County, as they searched for clues about a larger wave of fires and vandalism in recent months that the group, the Earth Liberation Front, says it has committed. 
 In a news release posted Monday on the Internet, the group claimed responsibility for dousing a 14-ton payloader and a 1986 General Motors pickup truck filled with tools with "eight gallons of petrol" and then setting the vehicles ablaze with "improvised torches."
It said the fire, at a fenced-in yard behind the offices of Melo's Construction on Route 25A in Miller Place, was its "11th major action" in Suffolk County and warned that its sabotage would continue. 
"All businesses, large or small, which participate in earth-raping industries will continue to be targeted as a part of the ELF's ongoing campaign to evoke economic damage to those responsible for urban sprawl," said the bulletin, released by Craig S. Rosebraugh of Portland, Ore., a spokesman for the group.
The bulletin said the fire was also set to show support for Andrew Stepanian, an animal rights activist from Lloyd Neck who was recently sentenced to 90 days in jail for throwing a brick through the display windows of a fur store in Huntington.
"This is a pristine example of how law enforcement agents are unable to catch the real perpetrators and instead target vocal above-ground activists," the ELF bulletin said of Mr. Stepanian's conviction. "The ELF supports the release of all political prisoners and an end to the unjustified police repression."
A squad of the New York Joint Terrorist Task Force, including agents of the F.B.I., the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Suffolk County police, is investigating the group's claims of destruction and arson going back to July, said James M. Margolin, a spokesman for the New York office of the F.B.I. 
No arrests have yet been made.
Mr. Margolin said the arson fire on Sunday in the North Shore hamlet of Miller Place was the latest in a series of attacks that included uprooting a Cold Spring Harbor cornfield, scrawling "Meat Is Murder" in red paint at a McDonald's corporate office in Hauppauge, and firebombing luxury homes under construction on former farmland in Mount Sinai.
On Monday, F.B.I. agents with a search warrant went through a wood-shingled ranch house on a quiet street in Coram, about six miles south of Miller Place.
A law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said that the search of the house, on Bristol Downs Street, was conducted in connection with the ELF investigation, and that computer files and other materials were seized. Agents were looking for evidence of the acts of vandalism and arson for which ELF has taken credit, the official said.
No one answered the door at the house today. Neighbors who saw the F.B.I. agents arrive said they did not know who lived in the house. 
The fire at Melo's erupted shortly after 5 a.m. Sunday and caused about $8,000 worth of damage, said Detective Lt. Charles Dohrenwend, commander of the arson squad of the Suffolk County police.
The pickup truck was destroyed and the payloader was burned less severely, said a spokeswoman for the construction firm.
"There could have been a horrible explosion and someone could have gotten hurt," the spokeswoman said.

HEADLINE: American Dreams, For Immigrants, Too 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Americans (a) Love (b) Hate Immigrants" (Week in Review, Jan. 14):
 America can't function without immigrants as a source of cheap labor, people who will do the jobs nobody wants at wages nobody else would accept. 
Yet we have the "American dream," in which no one stays at the bottom of the economic ladder. Within one or two generations, the descendants of immigrants are supposed to become business people, lawyers or doctors. 
 However, we can't have it both ways. A steady supply of cheap labor implies a permanent underclass. If today's immigrants move up the ladder, who will harvest the raisin crop, scrub the floors and watch the babies tomorrow? Do we want a stationary underclass that will never realize the American dream, or an upwardly mobile society in which an endless stream of immigrants moves in to fill the bottom rungs?

PERSON: Hammond E. Chaffetz 

HEADLINE: H. E. Chaffetz, 93, Lawyer On Antitrust and Price Fixing 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Hammond E. Chaffetz, a leading antitrust lawyer who won a big price-fixing case against the oil industry in the depths of the Depression and went on to build a little Chicago law office into one of the nation's largest law firms, Kirkland & Ellis, died on Friday, the firm said yesterday. He was 93 and lived in Chicago.
 Over the years, Mr. Chaffetz's cases ranged from mobsters to corporate America. Moses Annenberg, the publisher who with Lucky Luciano of the crime family known as Murder Inc. supplied bookies with instant horse race results by telegraph, was a client, as was General Motors, which made Kirkland & Ellis its lead outside counsel on the strength of Mr. Chaffetz's success with the price-fixing case. 
 Mr. Chaffetz was a free-market Republican, but just a few years after graduating near the top of his class from Harvard Law School in 1930, he was pursuing antitrust cases for the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
In his most significant case, in Madison, Wis., Mr. Chaffetz won convictions of 30 executives and 16 major oil companies for violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. Later, the Supreme Court upheld the 1938 convictions in a decision that contained what is now a famous footnote.
Robert H. Bork, the retired federal judge and antitrust expert whom Mr. Chaffetz brought into Kirkland & Ellis as a young man, said that at the time "nobody was quite sure about whether companies could agree on limiting competition and, if you did, what the limits were, and there was a substantial body of thought then that, if you could, then you ought to judge the reasonableness of the price fixed" to determine whether the price-fixing was intended to keep companies from failing in the weak economic conditions of the time or was meant to gouge customers.
The footnote, No. 59 in an opinion written by Justice William O. Douglas, firmly put an end to such thoughts, stating that any agreement to fix prices was per se illegal.
After winning the case, Mr. Chaffetz left the government and began defending corporations accused of price fixing, including major oil companies. 
Throughout his career, he clashed with judges. Lloyd N. Cutler, a prominent Washington lawyer who worked on a major antitrust case in the 1960's alongside Mr. Chaffetz, recalled him as a "litigator who took no prisoners, including judges; if he felt they were wrong, he said so."
Sometimes the judges scolded Mr. Chaffetz. But his success in complex cases won him cases and clients. 
In the 1960's, when automakers were facing huge claims that they had fixed the prices of an early antismog device known as a pollution control valve, General Motors was counseled by some of its lawyers to settle for the equivalent of $1 billion in today's money, but Mr. Chaffetz said there was no need to pay a dime.
Mr. Chaffetz took the cases to trial and won, said Donald G. Kempf Jr., the chief legal officer at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter who at the time was working under Mr. Chaffetz.
"Not only did G.M. never pay a nickel," Mr. Kempf said, "but when the plaintiffs sought $50,000 to cover their costs in return for promising to not appeal, he persuaded G.M. to reject the offer when he told them to send a message -- litigation is not risk free."
Mr. Chaffetz was a major supporter of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and often traveled with Sir Georg Solti when he was its conductor.
He is survived by his wife, Sara; two sons, Peter, of New York, and David, of Paris; and five grandsons.
In six decades with Kirkland & Ellis, he recruited young talent, drawing Judge Bork and others with promises that they would quickly get a chance to work directly with clients instead of toiling in the law library doing research for senior partners.
"One notable thing about Hammond was he gave young lawyers the chance to take on responsibility as fast as they could handle it," Judge Bork said. 
Mr. Chaffetz personally recruited job candidates, taking them to dinner and then long walks and selling them on why a small Chicago firm was a better opportunity than a big-league one in Manhattan, a technique that helped the firm grow to about 780 lawyers, making it one of the 30 largest in the country.
About 20 years ago, Mr. Chaffetz withdrew from active law practice, Mr. Kempf said, but he kept an office and often advised on strategy for complex antitrust cases. His last day at the office was Thursday, the day before he died.

HEADLINE: Publisher Set To Step Down At New Yorker 

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
In a move that is almost certain to rattle the Conde Nast magazine group and help establish another magazine company as a more significant player, David Carey, the president and publisher of The New Yorker, is expected to announce his resignation from Conde Nast today.
 Mr. Carey will become the president and chief executive of a newly formed business magazine group that Gruner & Jahr hopes will challenge the field of business magazines that includes Fortune, Forbes and Business Week, according to executives at Gruner & Jahr and Conde Nast. 
 Under its chief executive, Daniel B. Brewster, Gruner & Jahr recently bought the magazines Fast Company and Inc. and is aiming to buy other business magazines. To extend its brands, it intends to develop related businesses like conferences, spinoff magazines and perhaps a book publishing arm, Gruner & Jahr executives said. 
Mr. Carey oversaw a relatively healthy period in The New Yorker's history and assured advertisers of the magazine's stability during a transition between editors. Tina Brown, reported at the time to have been unhappy with Mr. Carey's ascension in 1998, resigned as editor shortly after he became publisher; she was replaced by the current editor, David Remnick.
Being the publisher of The New Yorker is a tricky business. The magazine is known for not being profitable and is said to have lost money since S. I. Newhouse Jr. -- chairman of Conde Nast and its parent, Advance Publications -- acquired the magazine in 1985 from the Fleischmann family for $142 million.
Mr. Carey has presided over the magazine mostly during a strong economy, and The New Yorker has overcome fears that it might sink without the buzz generated by Ms. Brown. Mr. Carey's promotional style has differed from that of previous publishers because rather than promote a colorful top editor, he advanced the magazine itself. Mr. Carey worked closely with Mr. Remnick on marketing campaigns, including the yearlong 75th-anniversary celebration last year, which included a film festival and a reading series.
Although Advance Publications is privately held, information released by Conde Nast the last three years and the little public data available suggest that The New Yorker, which is published weekly, has had a decent run under Mr. Carey. Last year, the magazine twice increased its rate base -- the circulation guaranteed to advertisers -- bringing it to 800,000 from 725,000. The magazine also said that its renewal rate for subscriptions is 77.3 percent, its highest recorded rate.
Ad pages and revenue are up. According to the Publishers Information Bureau, The New Yorker had 2,408 advertising pages in 2000, up 16 percent from 1999. The magazine said the number for 2000 was its highest in 10 years. It had $106.5 million in revenue, up 29.6 percent from the previous year, according to the bureau. 
While it is still not profitable, a Conde Nast executive said losses at The New Yorker fell from about $17 million in 1999 to less than $10 million last year.
David Verklin, chief executive of Carat North America, a media services company, said that under Mr. Carey The New Yorker was generally recognized as robust by the advertising industry.
"What you have in Remnick and Carey is one of the best partnerships in publishing," said Mr. Verklin, who was not aware yesterday of Mr. Carey's pending departure. As publisher, Mr. Carey has done away with advertising inserts, Mr. Verklin said, a way to pump up ad pages without significantly increasing revenue.
John R. MacArthur, publisher of Harper's Magazine, a 205,000-circulation monthly competitor in what the magazine industry calls the opinion-leader field, said that while he generally thought well of The New Yorker, he was very skeptical of the reported 77 percent renewal rate on subscriptions.
"I think that defies the laws of physics," he said. "It is virtually impossible to have renewal rates that high with such a large circulation."
E. Daniel Capell, the editor of Capell's Circulation Report, said he had studied The New Yorker's renewal rate and considered it to be accurate. He said the industry average was around 52 percent. 
Mr. Carey came to The New Yorker in June 1998, from another Conde Nast publication, House & Garden. Previously, he was the founding publisher of Smart Money magazine, a joint venture of The Wall Street Journal and Hearst Magazines. While at Smart Money, he twice tried to acquire Inc., which is now owned by Gruner & Jahr, but never closed the deal. 
Though it is unknown what Mr. Carey was paid at The New Yorker, his salary at Gruner & Jahr will be comparable and will include bonuses.
Gruner & Jahr, has long been considered a relatively sleepy backwater of the magazine industry, publishing women's service magazines like McCall's and Fitness. 
Bertelsmann, the German media company that owns 74.9 percent of Gruner & Jahr, sold its stake in AOL Europe in 1999 for about $8 billion. Mr. Brewster, who took over as Gruner's chief executive seven months ago, was given the task of using part of that windfall to strengthen the American magazine division. The rest of Gruner & Jahr is owned by the Jahr Group. 
Since Mr. Brewster's arrival, Gruner has been on a buying spree and redesigning binge. He has supervised the redesign of YM, the generally recognized laggard in the fast-growing publishing market for teenagers. He shut down the 125-year-old McCall's and has said he will reposition the magazine as Rosie: The Magazine, a celebrity vehicle for the entertainer Rosie O'Donnell. 
In an effort to push Gruner & Jahr out of the shrinking women's service market, Mr. Brewster bought two business magazines. In June, Gruner bought Inc. from the Goldhirsh Group for $200 million, and last month, it bought Fast Company from Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the New York real estate investor, for $340 million. According to Gruner executives, Mr. Zuckerman is to be paid an additional $20 million if the magazine meets certain revenue targets.

2 Banks Report Profits in Line With Estimates

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
Bank of America and Citigroup kept the rally in bank stocks alive yesterday as each reported profits that met expectations.
 Bank stocks have risen since the Federal Reserve's decision earlier this month to cut interest rates, but concerns have remained about the possibility of unexpected loan losses and weakening business as the economy slows. Investors were particularly nervous about Bank of America, which had sharply lowered earnings estimates last month, citing bigger loan losses. 
 With earnings reports yet to come from other banks struggling to turn around their businesses -- like the Bank One Corporation and the First Union Corporation -- Bank of America was considered a bellwether. 
The mediocre, if anticipated, results at Bank of America, which had a 23 percent decline in profits from a year earlier, and the stronger results from Citigroup, which had a 12 percent increase in earnings before nonrecurring charges, gave bank stocks a lift yesterday. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange/Keefe Bruyette & Woods Banks Index rose 2 percent, while the broad market gauge, the Standard & Poor's 500 index, inched up just 0.6 percent.
Bank of America's fourth-quarter net income of $1.39 billion, or 85 cents a share, was at the lower end of what the bank had projected and down 23 percent from a year earlier. Investors were so relieved that they pushed the bank's shares up $1.88, to $50.94.
The stock has rallied 40 percent since hitting a low of $36.31 a share on Dec. 6, when the bank lowered its fourth-quarter expectations by around 27 percent. The bank's stock, one of the poorest performers in the industry last year, has benefited from expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to lower rates to keep the economy from grinding to a halt. In this environment, investors have favored some of the weaker banks, figuring their shares have more room to rise. 
"If ever a bell tolls to buy banking stocks, it's when the Fed is in the early stages of easing interest rates," said Ronald Mandle, a bank stock analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
Lori Appelbaum, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs, said, "The market is being very accommodating, because investors wanted to like the numbers."
Bank of America's provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter was $1.21 billion, compared with $350 million a year earlier. In a meeting with analysts yesterday, James H. Hance Jr., chief financial officer of the bank, said the company's provision for credit losses this year could amount to $3 billion. The figure, he said, takes into account potential losses on loans to some California utilities, which have warned that they may have to file for bankruptcy. While he declined to disclose the bank's exposure, Ms. Appelbaum of Goldman, Sachs estimated it at $400 million.
At the opposite end of the earnings quality spectrum, Citigroup reported fourth-quarter earnings before nonrecurring charges of $3.3 billion, or 65 cents a share. The results met Wall Street expectations, despite a surprise write-down of 3 cents a share, mostly from losses on a trucking loan and leasing portfolio of Associates First Capital, the finance company Citigroup acquired last year.
"They are the rock of Gibraltar," said Richard Strauss, who follows the company for Goldman, Sachs, noting that Citigroup is now his top pick. Citigroup's earnings rose 12 percent in the fourth quarter, despite a difficult environment for capital markets and corporate lending.
"The performance this quarter once again corroborates the value of a diversified franchise," said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
Not surprisingly, profits at Salomon Smith Barney and for Citibank's corporate bankers were down 13 percent from the 1999 period. But the consumer business more than compensated. The Travelers Life and Annuity insurance business posted a 55 percent increase in profits.
Thanks to its earnings performance in recent quarters, Citigroup's stock has become the blue chip of the banking world. Though it has risen 27 percent in the last year, bank stock analysts suggest that the shares have more to go. Investors drove the price up $1.56 yesterday, to $54.69 a share. At that price, Citigroup trades at 18 times this year's estimated earnings, slightly higher than J. P. Morgan Chase at 17 times earnings.
Citigroup's business is so diversified that several analysts argue that it should not be valued like a bank but like other financial services companies. The American International Group, for example, trades at 35 times estimated 2001 earnings.
"If you compare Citigroup to other financial services bellwethers, there's no reason the stock should be trading at a discount," said Mr. Strauss, who predicts a 28 percent rise in Citigroup's stock to $70 a share over the coming year.
That argument suits Sanford I. Weill, Citigroup's chief executive. "Our multiple does not reflect the strength of our brand, diverse sources of income and ability to globalize our product lines," he said in an interview yesterday.
Nor would Mr. Weill rule out taking advantage of Citigroup's relatively strong performance to engage in one of his favorite activities: buying companies.
"We have the capital base so that we could look at opportunities others aren't able to right now," he said.

Secrets and Truths

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
What do you get when you cross a godfather with a Federal Reserve chairman? Someone who makes you an offer you can't understand.
 Sorry; an old joke, and one that's somewhat unfair to Alan Greenspan. Still, the Fed chairman does talk in a code that, while usually easy to decipher, bears only a distant resemblance to English. Moreover, he has a weakness for Delphic statements, seeming to imply that he knows more than he chooses to say clearly. 
 So Mr. Greenspan may bear some of the blame for the current rash of conspiracy theories surrounding the Fed's recent decision to cut interest rates. There isn't any real mystery about why the Fed acted; but those who insist that there must be more there than meets the eye have gained some undeserved credibility from the Fed's tradition of inscrutability.
When the Fed cut interest rates by half a percentage point on Jan. 3, jumping the gun on its scheduled meeting later this month, it surprised everyone. But we shouldn't have been that surprised; indeed, I was kicking myself for not having guessed that such a move was about to happen. All the ingredients were there: new signs of weakness in the economy, and evidence of an incipient panic in the financial markets. The Fed has always believed in the occasional usefulness of "slap in the face" interventions, dramatic moves that pull investors up short. So there was nothing particularly strange about that sudden rate cut. 
But there are many people who won't accept the obvious explanation, who insist that the Fed acted on secret information about a looming recession or financial crisis -- so many that last week Roger Ferguson, the Fed's vice chairman, went out of his way to deny those rumors. 
Why would commentators want to invent elaborate and unnecessary stories about hidden Fed knowledge? One reason is political: ardent tax-cutters, who hope to use recession fears to stampede Congress into giving them what they want, are eager to put as much negative spin on the economy as possible. 
Another reason is personal: those who were skeptical about the glories of the "new economy" have spent the last few years in the doghouse. Now that some economic clouds have finally appeared, they don't want the sun to shine on their parade.
Finally, there's the CNBC effect. Providing business news has itself become a big business. But all-news channels, which struggle to stay interesting while covering the same material hour after hour, often find themselves emphasizing entertainment values over the usually prosaic truth. Even the Weather Channel has fallen into the habit of hyping each storm as if it were soon to be a major motion picture. And now that CNBC can no longer run breathless tales about the economic boom, it has started to feature equally breathless (and potentially self-fulfilling) speculations about economic crisis.
The result has been to put Mr. Greenspan himself in a no-win situation. If he doesn't cut rates as fast as Wall Street wants, analysts fret that he has gotten behind the curve. But if he does cut rates aggressively, rumors fly about the dark secrets that prompted his action.
So it was certainly a good idea for someone from the Fed to ask, as Mr. Ferguson did, the rhetorical question "What does the Fed know that we don't know?" and answer, truthfully, "Very little, if anything." 
The real "secret of the temple" is that the Fed, Mr. Greenspan included, basically has no more knowledge about what is going on than any economic analyst equipped with a telephone and a modem. What the Fed has that the rest of us don't is not knowledge but power. 
Ironically, the belief that the Fed has special knowledge actually reduces the institution's power: rumors that Mr. Greenspan cut rates because he knows something we don't diminished what would otherwise have been a salutary effect on market psychology. Still, despite all that, the Fed's move has already made a noticeable difference, stemming the rout in the Nasdaq and producing a striking recovery in the corporate bond market. Another few shots in the arm like that and talk of recession might well evaporate.
The key thing to realize is that Alan Greenspan is just a man, no wiser or better informed than many others. But he controls the money supply -- and that's enough.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Tax-Cut Ads Take On Senators From Big Bush States 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
Two senior Senate Democrats from states where President-elect George W. Bush won decisively -- Montana and North Dakota -- come under fire in a new Republican television advertising campaign to support Mr. Bush's proposed tax cut package, now estimated at $1.6 trillion. 
 The two lawmakers, Max Baucus of Montana and Kent Conrad of North Dakota, are members of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over tax matters and will be at ground zero in the Senate debate over tax cuts. 
 Neither Mr. Baucus nor Mr. Conrad has ruled out cutting taxes, but both have suggested that Mr. Bush's cuts may be too large given other priorities, like paying down the federal debt and revamping Social Security. 
For two weeks beginning on Wednesday, the Republican Leadership Council, a group based in Washington with ties to moderate Republicans, will run 30-second advertisements in the two states, pressing Mr. Baucus and Mr. Conrad to support Mr. Bush's plan -- and reminding them of Mr. Bush's lopsided victories. 
In Montana, Mr. Bush defeated Vice President Al Gore 58 percent to 33 percent; in North Dakota, the result was 61 percent to 33 percent. 
The advertising campaign, which will initially cost $75,000, comes as other Republican groups have threatened to run advertisements against Democrats who oppose Mr. Bush's choice for attorney general, John Ashcroft, whose Senate confirmation hearings began today. 
"For most people in America, these Senate confirmation hearings are a sideshow," said Mark Miller, the Republican Leadership Council's executive director. "We want to talk about the agenda that George Bush has talked about, and that's tax cuts. Let's get on with it." 
Mr. Miller said the advertisements had not been coordinated with the Bush transition team. 
The advertising campaign comes just days after Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, who will resume being the Senate majority leader after the inauguration of Mr. Bush, and Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, have signaled that they want to press Mr. Bush's tax package early in the new Congress. 
In the presidential campaign, the centerpiece of Mr. Bush's tax package was a reduction in all income tax rates, a provision that accounted for more than half the value of the package. Mr. Bush's team has been weighing whether to accelerate the income tax cut. 
Clearly, the Republican advertising intends to capitalize on Mr. Bush's popularity in Montana and North Dakota to pressure the two Senate Democrats. Mr. Conrad was re-elected in November. But Mr. Baucus faces a tough race for re-election in 2002. A recent poll in Montana put him 12 points behind outgoing Gov. Marc Racicot, a Republican. 
The advertisement being broadcast in Montana will state: "Tax cuts will create new jobs and keep the economy moving. But some Washington politicians oppose the Bush tax cuts." 
In response, Michael Siegel, Mr. Baucus's spokesman, said: "In a state where the average worker brings home $23,000 a year, Senator Baucus wants an economic policy that will help all Montanans. He's never ruled out nor does he rule out the idea of a tax cut. But he wants one that's fair and equitable."

HEADLINE: North Korean Leader and Entourage Make Furtive Trip to Shanghai 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
The leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Il, arrived here today on a furtive impromptu tour of China's economic capital.
 Mr. Kim apparently traveled on Monday by special train to Beijing from the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, and then to Shanghai, his second known official trip abroad in 18 years. He first visited Beijing in May, for three days. 
 The current visit appeared to catch China's planning-obsessed bureaucracy by surprise. Mayor Xu Kuangdi of Shanghai excused himself from a meeting of city officials this morning, explaining he had to meet an important visitor, someone familiar with the meeting said.
Shanghai's government announced it was canceling a reception to celebrate the Lunar New Year.
The reception had been scheduled for Thursday evening, and its cancellation suggested that Mr. Kim would be in town at least until then.
By early afternoon, the hotel attached to a new riverside convention center had been taken over by Chinese and North Korean security officers. The North Koreans were clearly identifiable by their red lapel pins, which bore the likeness of Mr. Kim's father, the late Kim Il Sung.
By early evening, the hotel confirmed that Mr. Kim had checked in. Later this evening, a 50-car convoy cruised down the main shopping street, which was closed to traffic.
Despite the bustle here, the Chinese Foreign Ministry, the North Korean Embassy in Beijing and the Foreign Affairs Bureau of Shanghai all said today that they knew nothing of a visit by Mr. Kim. That is not surprising. Both China and North Korea kept silent about Mr. Kim's trip in May until after he had returned to Pyongyang.
But the formidable North Korea-watching machinery in South Korea and Japan had already begun speculating on reasons for the visit.
A newspaper in Seoul, JoongAng Ilbo, said 20 high-ranking officials, including Jo Myong Rok, head of the North Korean General Political Department, had accompanied Mr. Kim. Mr. Jo visited Washington in October.
The Kyodo news agency in Japan quoted a government source in Seoul as having said Mr. Kim was discussing with Chinese leaders relations with South Korea and the United States under the Bush administration.
China is North Korea's closest ally, and the two have joined in opposing the space-based missile defense system whose development Mr. Bush has said he supports.

HEADLINE: Citing European Banana Quotas, Chiquita Says Bankruptcy Looms 

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
Chiquita Brands International, the largest producer of bananas in the world and a household name in the United States, says it cannot pay its debts and will probably have to go into bankruptcy court because the Clinton administration has not been able to force the European Union to trade freely and fairly. 
 Chiquita contends that European quotas against bananas grown in Latin America, as Chiquita's are, have cost the company $200 million a year since 1992 and staggered the 131-year-old grower. 
 The financial hardships of one of the nation's biggest and oldest companies -- a company with a storied and at times unsavory past in Central America -- underscore the escalating importance to the United States economy of keeping markets open. And the problems that Chiquita and Washington have had with European nations that have their own priorities for trade are likely to increase tensions across the Atlantic and bring calls for the United States to be tougher with some of its trading partners. 
Under steady pressure from Chiquita, whose chairman and chief executive, Carl H. Lindner, is a big contributor to both political parties, the Clinton administration brought several complaints against the European Union in the late 1990's before the World Trade Organization and won them.
After the European nations refused to lift the quotas, Washington was allowed to retaliate by imposing punitive duties on a broad range of European goods in April 1999. Chiquita urged the government to punish the nations harshly for the damages they caused. When President Clinton decided to delay a new round of measures last fall after Britain showed some softening of its position, Chiquita officials were keenly disappointed.
"While there are those within the government who have acted in a tireless manner to bring this case to an appropriate conclusion," said Steven G. Warshaw, Chiquita's president and chief operating officer, the continuing trade dispute and Chiquita's inability to pay its debts prove "that the political side of the process has failed."
Bananas may be Americans' favorite fruit, but Europe has been a crucially important market for Chiquita for years. Before the import restrictions were put in place in 1992, the company said Europe accounted for half of its sales and the largest part of its profits. It estimates that it has lost more than $1.3 billion since the European Union instituted the banana quotas.
But Chiquita's problems go beyond European tariffs. It has been struggling with a weak euro and ambitious expansion plans that some analysts think went too far. Now, deep in debt and with its stock price already depressed, Chiquita has retained the Blackstone Group as a financial adviser to help negotiate a settlement of its debt problems. It plans to take the principal and interest on the $87 million in corporate debt that it cannot pay and swap it for an undetermined amount of company shares that the bondholders would take instead. Depending on the value that is assigned to the shares, some analysts think the corporate bondholders could end up with majority control of the company. 
Chiquita hopes to have the negotiations with debt holders successfully completed before filing for bankruptcy protection several months from now. This kind of prearranged or prepackaged bankruptcy is not uncommon. Unlike a normal Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, it provides a measure of certainty and limits disruption. 
"After many months of negotiation with the bondholders, that's when the 'B' word comes into play," Mr. Warshaw said. 
Chiquita officials said the company would continue to operate normally during the debt discussions. Consumers, suppliers and the company's 4,000 employees should not be affected, officials said. 
Chiquita shares lost almost half of their value yesterday and closed at $1.56 after the company's announcement that it would not be able to meet debt payments that are due on March 28. Shareholders also stand to see their holdings diluted when the debt is converted to company shares. 
The company's total outstanding public debt is $862 million.
"The stock may not be worth much, but it's better than nothing," said John M. McMillin, an analyst with Prudential Securities Research who covers Chiquita. "The bondholders are going to want to get a lot of equity in exchange for their bonds, and the company is going to argue that if it goes bankrupt before a settlement is reached, the shares will be worth nothing. It's a messy situation."
Through most of the 1990's, the company was immersed in an escalating trade war with Europe over import restrictions that favored Europe's banana-growing former colonies in Africa and the Caribbean and cut deeply into the market share controlled by Chiquita and other companies that grow bananas in Central and South America. 
"The direct blame for today's actions should be put on the bureaucrats in Brussels who have manifested this ongoing illegality," Mr. Warshaw said, referring to the European Union. "If not for the European Union, we wouldn't be going through this today."
When the Europeans imposed the barriers on bananas, Chiquita sought help in Washington, and people there listened. Over the last year, Mr. Lindner contributed $550,000 to the Republican Party and at least $270,000 to the Democrats, according to public financing records. 
Chiquita, based in Cincinnati, has a long history of seeking help from the government. When Guatemala acted to expropriate the holdings in that country of foreign banana growers, including the United Fruit Company, Chiquita's predecessor, the Central Intelligence Agency organized a coup that toppled President Jacobo Arbenz in 1954.
In December, European ministers offered to drop the colonial preferences and assign import quotas first come first served, a proposal Chiquita rejected. It favored a system based on the market shares that existed before it was punished by the European quotas.
Chiquita has also suffered from a weak euro that makes the bananas it does bring into Europe even more expensive. And it may have hurt itself by expanding too rapidly in the late 1980's, building additional boats to ship bananas and planting too many acres of trees.
"Some of Chiquita's problems have been self-inflicted, but not many," said Mr. McMillin of Prudential Securities. 
The trade barriers have most hurt Chiquita, Mr. McMillin said. "It's been a very painful experience," he said, "and now some can argue that the fat lady has already sung."

HEADLINE: How to Keep Vendors From Quietly Violating Your Privacy 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD MILLMAN 

 BODY:
When Robert Ellsworth sails to the mythical island of Velious to battle greedy dwarves and cast demonic spells, he just hates delays. Mr. Ellsworth, 30, of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., an avid player of the online game Everquest: The Scars of Velious, began to chafe over the time-consuming data exchanges between his PC and the game's home page.
 An inveterate and technically savvy game player, he suspected that personal data was being copied from his computer without his knowledge. Using a device called a sniffer, Mr. Ellsworth examined the data traveling over the Internet and discovered that the game's host, Verant Interactive, a division of Sony Online Entertainment, was collecting information about the other applications that were running on his computer. 
 "I was deeply disappointed by their actions," he said. "I was concerned they could use this information to build a marketing profile for generating unwelcome marketing material." Mr. Ellsworth said he was now more vigilant about preserving his privacy. "I have nothing to hide, but they should never do that without asking me for the information first," he said.
Mr. Ellsworth was one of a group of dissatisfied players who complained to Verant about its data collection techniques. Verant says the concept underlying the data collection was misunderstood, that its purpose was to improve the game and guard against hackers. But surprised by the intensity of its customers' collective criticism, and facing a decline in business, Verant changed the policy.
"It really woke us up," said Verant's chief operating officer, John Smedley. 
The data from Mr. Ellsworth's computer was being collected by a bit of software known variously as a phone home program, an update agent, or, more menacingly, spyware. The programs are small applications, or applets, and they are embedded in software like Intuit's QuickBooks, Microsoft's Windows Me, Symantec's SystemWorks and many others.
In their most innocuous configuration, the applets verify that the PC has the latest patches and fixes issued by the software vendor. By totally automating the updating process, update agents can save the PC owner time and effort.
Sometimes, however, vendors use update agents to extract information about users, their Internet browsing habits or their PC's configuration, and transmit the information to a Web site when the user is online. The user is often unaware of the practice, although it may be acknowledged somewhere deep within the fine print of the license that users are supposed to read and accept before installation.
"In most cases, users are unaware that these update applets exist and what they are doing," said Mark Fabro, a senior scientist at Guardent in Waltham, Mass., a security services consultancy. "When it comes to protecting their security and their privacy, what consumers don't know can hurt them."
Mr. Fabro advises his clients to read the license agreement to discover what data the vendor will collect and what it will do with the data -- use it for technical support services or internal marketing initiatives, or sell it to another company.
"In the hands of a skilled marketer, personal information gathered by a phone home applet is a virtual treasure trove," said Bob Geiger, a computer security expert with Info-Defense, in Ardsley, N.Y. "Stealth data collection is like having a telemarketer listen in on the speakerphone while you eat dinner with your family."
Consumers can protect themselves by installing a second applet, called a personal firewall. This software gatekeeper watches the data entering or leaving a computer, and traps packets containing selected information that the user tells it to watch for -- telephone numbers, credit card information, names, addresses, and the like. In addition, a personal firewall will intercept data headed for Web sites of dubious repute. 
Personal firewall products include Symantec's Personal Firewall, Zone Lab's ZoneAlarm, McAfee's Firewall and Biodata's Sphinx. They typically cost about $30 and come configured with a list of off-limits Web sites to which consumers can easily add others. 
These firewalls, while simple to install and usually trouble-free, require some time to learn and add a modest cost. A no-cost solution is to disable the update agents, provided you can find the "off" switch. Shutting the applet down may require contacting the vendor to ask for detailed instructions on how to do it. But be forewarned: to remove the applet may necessitate removing and reinstalling the primary program.
Taking the time to disable these applets or absorbing the cost of adding new software to counteract the unwelcome actions of your existing software is worth the effort, security experts say. 
"ID checks, auto updates and related technologies are basically a back door into a customer's computer, and too many people have keys to that door," said Richard Smith, chief technology officer of the Privacy Foundation, which is based in Denver.
The growing list of software vendors employing auto-update applets includes Real Networks, Intuit and Ontrack as well as the online game site Battle.net. The game site, operated by Blizzard, was accused of snooping into the PC's of players to retrieve configuration information including the player's name, browser and e-mail address as well files from competing gaming Web sites. Blizzard attributes it all to a misunderstanding, saying that its purpose was to improve customer service.
Some software companies, including RealNetworks and Netscape, an America Online subsidiary, face class-action suits potentially involving hundreds of thousands of consumers as a result of their actions. Plaintiffs charge that the companies violated provisions in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, which protects electronic communication against interception. Plaintiffs also charge violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which prohibits unauthorized retrieval of data from a computer.
RealNetworks and AOL have since changed their updating procedures and privacy policies.
Johnathan Shub, a lawyer in Philadelphia who specializes in class-action computer litigation, suggests that consumers "absolutely should not trust vendors with their confidential information."
"The economic value of the data and the ease of collecting makes it to hard to resist," he said.
Mr. Shub added that he believes protecting the consumer's privacy from software companies will require congressional legislation. Several privacy protection bills are pending in Congress, including the Spyware Control and Privacy Protection Act sponsored by Senator John Edwards, Democrat of North Carolina.
Some companies that formerly collected data in the background, such as Intuit, Verant and Netscape, now favor full disclosure. They now acknowledge that auto-update applets, even when running in the foreground, can benefit the vendor's interests as well as those of the consumer.
"The bottom line is that we cannot do anything without the public's full knowledge and compliance, even if it is well intended," said Mr. Smedley of Verant. "You walk a fine line with privacy."

Inside the Soap Opera of Television's Early Days

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL POLLAK 

 BODY:
WHO invented television? Besides Lucy?
 You're not going to find a one-or two-word answer here. Television has a complex parentage, and Web sites on its early days call to mind a comment by Sir Francis Darwin, the son of Charles Darwin: "In science, the credit goes to the man who convinces the world, not to the man to whom the idea first occurs." 
 Emotions are still raw 70-odd years after the first demonstrations of electronic moving pictures. Advocates of Philo T. Farnsworth as television's originator will like the Farnsworth Chronicles (www .farnovision.com/chronicles), a biography by Paul W. Schatzkin that draws in part on interviews with Farnsworth's widow and eldest son. 
"Farnsworth was a 14-year-old Mormon farm boy from Rigby, Idaho," the introduction says, "with virtually no knowledge of electronics when he first sketched his idea for electronic video on a blackboard for his high school science teacher in 1922. Fifteen years later, that teacher would recreate that sketch as part of his testimony in patent litigation between Farnsworth and the giant Radio Corporation of America." 
And yet, Farnsworth could appear on "I've Got a Secret" in 1957 and stump the panel. "Philo T. Farnsworth was presented his reward for inventing television: a carton of Winstons, $80 cash, and Garry Moore's eternal gratitude: 'We'd all be out of work if it weren't for you.' " 
The villain in this drama, to Farnsworth devotees, is David Sarnoff, the radio visionary and domineering president of RCA, who, relying on another inventor, Vladimir K. Zworykin, fought Farnsworth for more than a decade over television's patent rights. This contention is equally pointed in a recent article, "Who Really Invented Television?" by Evan I. Schwartz in Technology Review, in which Sarnoff versus Farnsworth is likened to Gates versus the world (www.techreview.com /articles/oct00/schwartz.htm).
Alex Magoun disagrees. "As with other histories of technologies of the 20th century, television suffers from the first run of corporate promotions and claims, and then the equally one-sided, anti-corporate revisions offered by supporters and descendants of those neglected in those histories," wrote Dr. Magoun, who is director of the David Sarnoff Library and curator for the Sarnoff Corporation in Princeton, N.J., the successor to RCA Laboratories. There is a history of the labs and Sarnoff at www.sarnoff .com. Dr. Magoun said in an e-mail message that he was expanding the collection's Web presence in a new site, www.davidsarnoff.org, that will be ready in a few months. 
In a reply to the Technology Review article, he wrote that Farnsworth was well paid for his patents and was well respected by his peers for his innovations. He also said that RCA under Sarnoff invested millions in television before showing a profit. "A more appropriate title might be, 'Who Innovated Television?' It was never one person," he wrote. 
Television has many other contributors. Dr. Russell Naughton's site, Adventures in Cybersound, has a section called Sparks of Genius (www.cinemedia.net/SFCV-RMIT -Annex/rnaughton/phd8100.html), with links to electronic media innovators like Paul G. Nipkow, whose crude disk in 1884 showed a way to send pictures by wire; Boris Rosing, who designed a television system using a cathode-ray tube receiver in 1907; and extensive material on Zworykin, the inventor of the iconoscope. A large collection of Zworykin's personal photographs and a biography are at members.tripod.com /%7EFrameMaster/index.html. 
In a fascinating British site, Phonovision (www.dfm.dircon.co.uk /tv1strx.htm), Donald F. McLean gives the history of John Logie Baird, who invented the first crude videodisk in the 1920's. The site includes still and moving images from 1927 and 1928 wax disks, the oldest television images ever preserved.
A site about the DuMont Tele vision Network by Clarke Ingram gives a history of the original "fourth network" founded by Allen B. DuMont, which operated from 1945 to 1956 (members.aol.com/cingram /television/dumont.htm).
And now for some early finished product. The Chicago School of Television (www.mcs.net/richsam /nbcmm/chschool.html) by Rich Samuels has nothing to do with economics and everything to do with Dave Garroway, Dr. Frances Horwich ("Ding Dong School"), "Super Circus" with the incomparable Mary Hartline and Burr Tillstrom's "Kukla, Fran and Ollie."

HEADLINE: Safe in Their S.U.V.'s 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 As a Jan. 17 letter writer says, in an accident between a sport utility vehicle and a regular car, the S.U.V.'s passengers have a lesser risk of injury. 
 But the price of an S.U.V. is high enough to create an economic barrier so that, following the writer's logic, if you aren't rich, you had better get off the road.
It is time for S.U.V. manufacturers to make their vehicles safer. All taxpayers pay for our roads; driving safety should not be based on economic status.

HEADLINE: New Talks on China's Entry To World Trade Group Fail 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
China's effort to join the World Trade Organization was held up today by a major disagreement over its subsidies to its 900 million farmers.
 "If you want to bind our hands and not allow support for our farmers, nobody could back that," said China's top negotiator, Long Yongtu, after a week of negotiations ended today without sealing China's entry as anticipated. 
 "Our agricultural subsidies are peanuts," compared with the subsidies offered in the European Union and in the United States, Mr. Long said at a news briefing.
When China joins the Geneva-based trade club, it wants the same flexibility developing countries have with agricultural subsidies. Its negotiators rejected three compromise attempts this week, engineered by European negotiators, to find common ground on the issue.
Although the talks appeared to be at an impasse, Mr. Long dismissed suggestions that this round's failure sinks China's chances to join the 140-country organization.
"This membership is in China's interest," Mr. Long said. "China has already enormously benefited from this process," he said, citing a 30 percent increase in foreign investment and record exports and imports last year.
China's attempt to join the organization entered its 15th year this week.
Trade diplomats said the talks proved more difficult than anticipated because United States trade negotiators were hamstrung by the imminent change in administrations. Envoys said American negotiators were not able to compromise, mindful that they could be overruled by the incoming Bush administration.
Some envoys thought China was digging in its heels on agriculture and services, a wide-ranging area that covers the ability of foreign insurance and financial institutions to operate within Chinese borders, to see what more it could gain.
Although no firm date was announced, talks could reconvene in late February or March.

Slag Heaps Into Gardens

BYLINE:  By ANNE RAVER 

DATELINE: VINTONDALE, Pa. 

 BODY:
JULIE BARGMANN almost missed the turn to this old mining town in southwest Pennsylvania, because she was deep into the story of these coal-rich Appalachian hills, where miners gave their lives to dig out the coal that made the coke that fired the steel plants in Pittsburgh and Detroit.
 Now Ms. Bargmann, a sculptor and landscape architect, turned down the steep hill leading through town, where most of the narrow wooden houses were built by the Vinton Colliery, when it opened the mine in 1906 across the Blacklick Creek. The town looked deserted, except for a few mutts barking at the end of short chains. There were boarded-up houses, empty stores, like ghosts of a population that dropped from 2,500 to 600 after the mine closed in 1963. 
 When the coal gave out, the company abandoned the site, leaving half a mile of coke ovens to decay on the flood plain, mounds of coal waste and a steady stream of acid drainage flowing into the creek. 
"The Blacklick pours into the Conemaugh River watershed, which flows straight to the Gulf of Mexico," Ms. Bargmann said, steering her rented Blazer over the icy bridge across the creek. "There are 3,400 miles of polluted waterways in Pennsylvania alone." 
Ms. Bargmann, 42, is one of a new generation of landscape architects teaming up with scientists and historians, artists and architects to reclaim wastelands without erasing history. They don't believe in walling them off or leveling the slag heaps that tell the story of America's industrial past.
A popular lecturer who sometimes makes her points in a hard hat and decontamination suit -- a kooky contrast to her ultra blond hair and jet black eyeleashes -- she throws her landscape architecture students from the University of Virginia at Superfund sites and landfills, encouraging them to map the flow of contaminants and to work with natural systems to regenerate earth and water. These wastelands -- 1,200 Superfund sites and 600,000 brownfields -- are the new frontier, a wilderness of steel mills and coal mines, oil refineries and plastics factories, waiting to be reclaimed.
"The scale of these landscapes is up there with Le Notre's Versailles and dead Fred's Central Park," Ms. Bargmann said, tweaking Frederick Law Olmsted for his artificial wilderness.
The new park makers aren't interested in fake pastoral scenes. They see the old blast furnaces and conveyor belts as the new bones of the garden of memory. They use plants to absorb and break down toxins, eventually creating clean soil and water. And they don't cover up the treatment ponds or hide the outflow pipes.
"Landscape architecture is the most significant form of public art today," said John Beardsley, an art historian at Harvard's Graduate School of Design. "It has both the artistic and the technical tools to deal with problems of enormous magnitude, like restoring the industrial landscape."
Mr. Beardsley considers Ms. Bargmann "among the most forceful advocates for this kind of work in the U.S." 
Now, she leaned into the wind tearing along the Blacklick and trudged down the Ghost Rail Trail, where the Pennsylvania Railroad once transported coke to Pittsburgh. She was meeting other members of the design team that has been working for five years, practically pro bono, to turn this polluted 35-acre flood plain into a natural treatment system that will be the centerpiece for a community park.
The project is the brainchild of Dr. T. Allan Comp, a historian working for the Office of Surface Mining in the Interior Department, who has a vision of building parks throughout Appalachia and has raised $400,000 to make it work. 
"This was the entrance to Mine No. 6," Ms. Bargmann said, halting by a slight depression in a hill that rises alongside the trail. "There were six hills with six mines, each given a number." Now it was just a ghost of a door, with a wash of yellow grit running toward the creek. 
"That's yellow boy," she said. "It's the goo that precipitates out of the acid mine drainage." It will be remembered in a path called the Yellow Boy Channel, flanked with a path of aspens, which turn gold in the fall, and a wide band of goldenrod.
The design team had gathered on a tall pile of bony -- the nickname for hard chunks of black coal waste -- to get a good look at the recent excavation work below. A bulldozer had dug through 12 feet of buried bony to sculpture a chain of six trapezoid-shape treatment ponds for breaking down the acid drainage that still flows out of these hills. Acid mine drainage is formed when rain and groundwater absorb the metals and compounds disturbed by mining.
It won't eat your finger off; it's about as acid as vinegar. "But it acts as an exfoliate, and it'll take the top layer of your skin off," said Robert Deason, the team's geologist. It will also dissolve other metals like magnesium, manganese and aluminum.
Mr. Deason has designed a series of ponds and limestone spillways to aerate the water and raise its pH from acid to alkaline until the dissolved metals drop out. Then the water will be channeled into a wetland, where bacteria proliferating among the roots of cattails and sedges will feast on its sulfur, and it will be sent back into the Blacklick Creek as cleansed water.
Such biological treatment systems are self-sustaining and cheaper than chemical treatment, and they provide a welcome habitat for wildlife. Though slow to catch on in this country, they are being considered at sites like the 3,000-acre Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island, the biggest garbage dump in the world, and at the 1,100-acre River Rouge complex, owned by the Ford Motor Company and Rouge Steel, where the architect William McDonough has been commissioned to build a new "green" assembly plant in a sustainable landscape.
As soon as he got the job, in November 1999, Mr. McDonough assembled a team of engineers, scientists and designers, including Ms. Bargmann, to develop a working landscape for the site. Rain and snow won't be shunted directly into sewer lines, but absorbed by a 12-acre roof covered with native plants. Wetlands and hedgerows planted with native trees, shrubs and grasses will filter the overflow.
"As architects, we feel the time has come to immediately engage with landscape architects the day we talk about design," Mr. McDonough said. "They should not just come in at the end and shrub it up." 
Such complex sites call for the collaboration of many minds.
Dr. Clayton Rugh, a scientist from Michigan State University, is testing the ability of native plants to break down contaminants in soil dug from the defunct coke ovens at the Rouge. Ms. Bargmann envisions those ovens as the walls of a post-industrial-age garden, where plants transform polluted earth into soil teeming with earthworms. 
Here in Vintondale, she and Stacy Levy, a sculptor trained in forestry, have been inspired by Mr. Deason's treatment ponds to design a litmus garden, which parallels the changing colors of the treatment ponds. Scarlet sugar maples and sweet gums will flank the orange waters of the most acidic pond, followed by yellow aspens and tulip poplars as the pH rises and finally by blue-green sycamores as the water clears.
In the marshes, once home to 152 coke ovens, a raised plinth will memorialize them, full of flaming red flora: red-twigged dogwood, chokecherry and blueberry. "People talk about how they smelled, how acrid smoke hung over the town," Ms. Levy said. "Now it's just a peaceful field. But it used to be this clanking, cranking landscape." 
The whistle blew at 7 a.m., and 600 men -- the first of three shifts a day -- went down to the Blacklick Creek and got on rail cars that took them five miles into the mountain. "The cars went at breakneck speed," said John Malloy, 77, who broke a collarbone and two ribs when a rail car lost its brakes. "You pushed your car into a seam that was only 42 inches high and started hand-loading. We got paid 87 cents a ton. They cheated the daylights out of you."
When the mines were flushed of water, the Blacklick flowed yellow, and the sulphur could turn a swimmer's hair orange. People threw their dogs into the creek to kill the fleas. 
When the mine closed in 1963, it left coke ovens, mounds of bony, the washery and network of rails. "It looked far worse in the 1970's," Mr. Deason said. "All black, with old fallen-down buildings. So the state came in and knocked them down, dug a big hole and buried it all." Mine tailings were spread over the site, and the area was planted with grass.
"It was better for the overall look of the place, but it was a bit of a tragedy because all the history of the site was buried," Mr. Deason said. "That's what we're about."
Dr. Comp of the Interior Department recalls the pride in coal country when miners produced the coal and coke that forged the steel of a new economy. Between the 1890's and the 1940's there was little thought of the environment. "Then there was this complete sense of abandonment, if not shame, in the coal economy after World War II," he said. "We're trying to shift from this legacy of pollution back to an older sense of family and neighborhood and place." 
The mine was the economic heart of Vintondale. "To give it presence gives history back," he said. "So these guys could walk through here and say, 'That's the washery where I worked as a kid,' or, 'That's the powerhouse where I lost a finger.' "
These days, 76,000 people a year ride or hike the 12-mile Ghost Town Trail on the banks of the Blacklick, and in the fall these hills are a blaze of color. But if you know mining, you know what lies beneath.
"Anthills," said Ms. Bargmann, who has pored over every seam and tunnel of the mining maps. "Miles of tunnels, some dead men and boys. And a lot of polluted water."
So this park is a requiem to the miners and to the defiled land. But it's also a celebration of the healing powers of nature.
Ms. Bargmann narrowed her eyes at the earthworks taking shape in the flood plain. "We want to keep those spillways low, so we have a long vista," she said. 
Make the process visible, and make it beautiful.

HEADLINE: The Other Energy Crisis 

BYLINE:  By Daniel Yergin and Tom Robinson; Daniel Yergin is chairman and Tom Robinson is managing director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
A new energy shock is rolling through millions of mailboxes -- this winter's natural gas bill. Surprised homeowners are finding bills as much as double last year's. The wholesale price (paid as gas enters pipelines for transit across the nation) has increased more than threefold.
 Natural gas does not have the drama of oil, but it provides 25 percent of the energy America uses. The price surge is becoming one of the drags on the economy. The importance of natural gas, an environmentally attractive fuel because it burns cleanly, will increase as the country becomes more dependent on it. While now 15 percent of our electricity is generated by burning natural gas, more than 90 percent of electricity from new plants now in development will come from it. 
 The last similar natural gas price shock was in the mid-1970's, and the cause was too much regulation. For decades, the federal government had set natural gas prices, and it had kept them too low, providing little incentive for drilling. The resulting shortage contributed to the economic disruptions of the 70's. It took a huge Congressional battle late in that decade to deregulate prices.
Many thought supplies were limited and deregulation would cause prices to skyrocket. But instead, increased competition drove prices down. As drillers responded to market forces and drilling technology advanced, supplies became ample. Residential prices, adjusted for inflation, fell 30 percent between 1985 and 1999.
So what happened this winter? We knew months ago that a big storm was brewing in the market. The oil and gas price collapse of 1998-99 forced energy companies to slash their budgets for developing new reserves of both oil and gas. That led to a decline in gas production capacity in the United States of about 6 percent since 1997.
Meanwhile, the strong economy and new gas-burning power plants coming on line led to increased consumption. Then came this very cold winter, with average temperatures across the country in November and December lower than in any other year in the 106 years weather data have been collected. Heating demand increased in December 2000 over December 1999 by an amount greater than the annual consumption of Finland, Norway and Sweden combined.
So is this yet another example of deregulated markets failing? Quite the contrary -- and these events are quite unlike those in California's power market. The high gas prices in December led to fuel switching and plant shutdowns, market-driven responses that helped prevent severe problems like those in the 1970's.
And energy companies are already stepping up their investments. Drilling for natural gas is beginning to rise, and development efforts are tapping into new gas fields in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico, off the shore of eastern Canada and in the Arctic.
There are, unfortunately, two constraints. One, a shortage of workers and equipment, is a legacy of the price collapse two years ago. The other is the time it takes to get new supplies into the system; much new gas will not be available until 2003 or beyond.
Those who forget the problems before deregulation may be tempted to turn back to price caps. That would be disastrous, stifling the very investments that will help lower prices in the future. One lasting lesson of a half century of energy policy is that markets will respond a lot faster than old-fashioned regulation.

HEADLINE: Many Sense the Good Times Slipping Away 

BYLINE:  By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: JANESVILLE, Wis., Jan. 15 

 BODY:
When he glimpsed the stone behemoth rising out of the prairie here in southern Wisconsin last fall, Paul Terpstra thought it was a new grammar school, or maybe an apartment complex.
 "And then I realized, 'Oh my goodness, it's a single-family house,' " recalled Mr. Terpstra, a 40-year-old engineer. "And I thought to myself, 'Can this extravagant spending go on forever?' " 
 But just as a glorious autumn slipped into slap-in-the-face winter, Mr. Terpstra has sensed the economy starting to grow cold. Stocks have tumbled, growth has slowed, and companies are cutting back. An old mill here is moving much of its production overseas, and just across the Illinois state line, 10 miles or so to the south, the Motorola plant announced today that it would lay off 2,500 workers.
Add to all that the uncertainty that accompanies a changing of the guard in the White House, and many Americans now seem to be growing skittish about an economy that once seemed unstoppable.
"It was just too good for too long," said Mr. Terpstra, who had stopped at the library on Main Street to check out a book. "Now you can feel there's an edginess." 
Janesville, a middle-class town of 60,000, is the home of a General Motors plant that makes the Suburban sport utility vehicle, a prime symbol of the fat, hard-charging economy. On a shipping lot near the plant, a sea of shiny new vehicles reflects the nation's voracious appetite, and its ability to foot the bills, at least for now.
After taking prosperity for granted for years, people in Janesville say they can hear the economy's brakes starting to screech. 
"We've been overdue for a pullback," said Raymond Dooley, a retired farmer and insurance salesman here. "We've forgotten that it's natural for the business cycle to swing both ways. Let's just hope it's not too rough."
In much of the country, people are just now seeing signs of economic slowing, and starting to voice fears about a recession. But for workers in the dot-com world, brutal reality hit months ago.
Richard Friedhoff, a 45-year-old technology consultant who works in Silicon Valley, said high-flying dreams had given way to a hard-nosed pragmatism there.
"You used to have everyone in their third year of college flying out here with a business plan with aspirations of becoming fabulously wealthy by age 30," Mr. Friedhoff said. "Those days are over. There is zero interest in people without credible track records, solid ideas and management skills. No one even wants to be caught talking to such a person in a Starbucks."
To be sure, there is scarcely a consensus that the economy is headed for the tank.
President Clinton, who views prosperity as a gemstone of his legacy, says the country's economic foundation remains rock solid. But President-elect George W. Bush has been talking about the slowdown for weeks, conveying a none-too-subtle message that he should not be blamed for any economic distress early in his administration. 
To some Americans, the reality falls somewhere between the roses and the rocks.
Jennifer Robischon, co-owner of an art gallery in Denver, said some economic vagaries were to be expected, given the changes brought by an election year.
"We're not running for the hills," Ms. Robischon said. "The stock market is reflecting a political year."
She added, "They seem to get scared quicker on either coast than in the middle of the country."
Frightened or not, plenty of people in Janesville say they are bracing for leaner times. Jason Dowd, 30, who stays at home to care for four young children while his wife manages a restaurant, said he and his family had started to cut back on discretionary spending. They bought much less during the recent Christmas season than a year ago, he said.
"There's just a lot of uncertainty now," said Mr. Dowd, expressing concerns that the new president would chart a different economic course. "People were used to Clinton. They felt comfortable. Now they're not so sure what Bush is going to change, or if it will work."
Of the Bush tax-cut proposal, which the president-elect has most recently promoted as insurance against a recession, Mr. Dowd was skeptical, saying that whatever version emerged from Congress would most likely favor the affluent. And a Republican president, he said, is likely to tolerate higher unemployment rates.
Not everyone, though, saw a slowing economy as all bad. Wendy Zanoni, a 33-year-old customer service representative for a utility company here, said her family was counting on even further drops in interest rates. "We're waiting to refinance the house," Ms. Zanoni said.
But for Mike Fertal, a student searching for part-time work in Chicago, the hunt has suddenly become tougher. "I can't find a job," said Mr. Fertal, who had stopped at Marshall Field in Chicago to file an application. "I've gone to Armani, Kenneth Cole and some of the other independent stores. All of them are cutting back on their part-time help."
Kelly Skinner, 29, of Dothan, Ala., said she and her husband, who has just completed his residency as a doctor, were trying to pay off credit-card debt and putting off "life-changing decisions," uncertain what the economy would look like six months from now.
Most people say they are not sure about the cause of any slowdown. But they tend to agree that Americans cannot forever buoy the economy by spending to the hilt. And they say people have become more than a bit spoiled.
"We've gotten to the point where people expect that the world owes you a great big house and a great big fancy new car," said Mr. Terpstra, the engineer. "For a while, almost every new house was being built with a three-car garage. That wasn't enough. Now they're building them with four-car garages."
He shook his head and managed a pained chuckle.
"Is that what we really need?" he said. "In this country, we pay so much attention to image that sometimes we lose sight of reality."

HEADLINE: December Figures Point to a Slowdown 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
A sharp drop in industrial output in December provided strong evidence of a slowing economy, while a moderating inflation index appeared to clear any obstacles that could block another interest rate cut.
 The nation's industrial engine sputtered to its biggest drop in two and a half years last month, while consumer prices rose only modestly at the end of a year in which a surge in energy costs pushed overall prices to their biggest gain in 10 years, the government said today. 
 Production by factories, mines and utilities fell 0.6 percent in December, the third consecutive decline and the biggest since June 1998, the Federal Reserve said. It was the first such string of declines since the recession of 1991. Output dropped 0.3 percent in November and in October. Analysts had expected a 0.5 percent fall in December. 
In a separate report today, the Federal Reserve cited manufacturing as one of the many areas of the economy that experienced a softening in December.
In its anecdotal beige book summary of economic conditions, the Fed also pointed to disappointing holiday sales, cooling home building and softening commercial real estate activity as signs the economy slowed last month.
The Labor Department reported today that the Consumer Price Index, the main inflation gauge, rose only 0.2 percent in December, identical to its November gain, and matching expectations, as higher prices for home fuel, utilities and food more than offset lower costs for gasoline and clothing.
The core index, which excludes energy and food, rose 0.1 percent in December after a 0.3 percent gain in the previous month. It was the smallest increase in a year.
In December, energy costs rose a slim 0.2 percent as lower prices of gasoline were more than offset by large increases in the cost of home fuel and utilities.
Food prices were up 0.5 percent in December after being unchanged in the previous month. Prices for clothing fell 0.4 percent.

HEADLINE: Internet Research Firm Announces Layoffs of 80 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
Jupiter Media Metrix, the Internet research firm in Silicon Alley, is laying off about 80 employees because of slackening revenue, particularly in the last quarter, company officials said yesterday.
 The job cuts will reduce the company's work force of 1,000 by 8 percent and are expected to save the company $7 million. 
 The layoffs make Jupiter Media Metrix one of the first older Silicon Alley companies to make drastic cutbacks in response to the economic slowdown. 
According to Jupiter Media Metrix's third-quarter financial statements, the company lost about $10.9 million on revenues of $65.2 million in the first nine months of 2000, up from a loss of $5.6 million on revenues of $39.9 million during the same period a year earlier.
The company expects revenue for the fourth quarter of 2000 to be $38.2 million to $38.5 million, instead of the $39.5 million to $42 million the company had earlier forecast.
"The rapidly softening economy directly impacted our revenues, and left us with expenses that were based on previously planned, higher growth rates," Tod Johnson, the chairman and chief executive of Jupiter Media Metrix, said yesterday.
Jupiter Media Metrix's stock price rose 5 percent, or about 43 cents, to close at $8.43 yesterday. The stock is down 82 percent from its 52-week high of $47.87 last March.
Jupiter Media Metrix was formed last year by the merger of Jupiter Communications, an Internet analysis firm, and Media Metrix, an online research company, which essentially became the Nielsen Media Research of the Internet industry by providing data on visits to Web sites.
Joshua Harris, an early Silicon Alley pioneer, founded Jupiter in 1986, and by the mid-1990's it had grown into one of the first Internet consulting and analysis firms.
Mr. Harris went on to found Pseudo Program, an online television company that went out of business last year.
Sandra Notardonato, an analyst at Adams Harkness & Hill of Boston, said: "The biggest flaw is that you can no longer be an Internet research analysis firm. You have to be broad-based, and it has to include existing technologies and emerging technologies. You can't just be an Internet company."
Ms. Notardonato said that many of Jupiter Media Metrix's competitors, like Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass., have made the necessary adjustments.
"About a year ago, Jupiter was in the right spot in the Internet economy, but it is very difficult to move as rapidly as the market changes," she said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Technology Shares Push Nasdaq Higher as the Dow Falls

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Technology stocks rose yesterday, but gave up hefty gains made earlier in the day. Blue-chip stocks fell even as the latest economic reports reinforced investors' thinking that more Federal Reserve interest rate cuts are in store.
 The Nasdaq composite index ended the day up 64.23 points, or 2.45 percent, at 2,682.78, the highest close in about a month. Earlier, the Nasdaq reached a session high of 2,756.63. More than 2.81 billion shares traded hands on the Nasdaq yesterday in one of its busiest days. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 68.32 points, or 0.64 percent, to 10,584.34. And the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 2.82 points, or 0.21 percent, to 1,329.47.
Investors took cues yesterday from the December Consumer Price Index, which rose 0.1 percent, falling short of the expected rise of 0.2 percent. The report encouraged the buying of technology stocks but also led to defensive selling, which in turn weighed on the Dow.
The rate excludes food and energy. The overall December index grew 0.2 percent, matching expectations.
Intel, the most active Nasdaq stock yesterday, fell 88 cents, to $30.50, after spending most of the day higher. The company warned late Tuesday that investors should expect a 15 percent decline in first-quarter revenue.
The Dow was also held down by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, which fell $3.50, to $110, after reporting quarterly earnings that were below expectations. 3M blamed slowing growth in the United States and the strong dollar for the shortfall.
Leading the gains was Juniper Networks, which provides Internet networking services. Its shares rose $8.19, to $136.19, after beating quarterly earnings estimates and raising its full-year forecast.
The chip equipment maker Novellus Systems climbed $5.63, to $44.38, and the communications chip maker Applied Micro Circuits jumped $10, to $80.38, after they both beat expectations.
I.B.M., which announced better-than-expected earnings after the markets closed yesterday, closed up $3.94, or 4.25 percent, to $96.69.
Investors are hoping more cuts in the Federal Reserve rate can cushion the slowing economy and keep the slowdown from cutting too deeply into corporate profits.
The Fed cut interest rates for the first time in one and a half years on Jan. 3, lowering its key rate target by half a percentage point. --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices rose for a second day as financial problems continued for two of California's biggest utilities and investors sought the relative safety of government debt.
"People are starting to realize that the problems in California are worse than they thought, and there's a flight to quality" into Treasuries, said Peter Cordrey, who was buying two-year notes for the $130 billion he helps invest at Prudential Securities in Newark.
The benchmark 10-year note rose 16/32, to 104 12/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 5.16 percent from 5.23 percent.
The most active 30-year bond rose 17/32, to 110 19/32, as its yield fell to 5.52 percent from 5.60. Thomas Connor, head of government bond trading at J. P. Morgan Chase, said the move came after the Treasury announced that it would buy back as much as $1.75 billion in 30-year bonds today.
Bonds and notes advanced after a California lawmaker said the state's two biggest utilities, the Pacific Gas and Electric unit of PG & E and the Southern California Edison unit of Edison International, were expected to declare bankruptcy, even if a bill intended to maintain the flow of power was passed, investors said.
Edison defaulted on some outstanding notes, and on payments to power generators and the California Power Exchange yesterday. Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service lowered credit ratings on both utilities to below investment grade, or junk status.

Some Slights Endure for Winfield

BYLINE:  By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
During the eighth inning of a Saturday night game at Yankee Stadium in mid-September 1985, George Steinbrenner plopped down in the first seat of the first row of the press box, a sheet of paper in his hands. The second-place Yankees were a few outs away from losing a second successive game to the first-place Toronto Blue Jays, and Steinbrenner was not happy.
 Displaying the statistics on the paper that showed Ken Griffey 0 for 8 for the three-game series, Don Baylor 0 for 7 and Dave Winfield 3 for 11, the Yankees' owner said to a young reporter: "Where is Reggie Jackson? We need a Mr. October or a Mr. September. Winfield is Mr. May." 
 Contrary to popular misconcepion, Steinbrenner did not label Winfield as Mr. May (in contrast to Jackson's Mr. October) for his 1-for-22 performance in the 1981 World Series. But the timing is important only for historical accuracy. Winfield would not have appreciated the derogatory remark whenever it was uttered. 
"It was irreverent, it was off-color, it was improper, it doesn't fit," Winfield said yesterday at a news conference for him and Kirby Puckett, the two newest members of the Hall of Fame. "I always rejected it. It doesn't apply. It was an inappropriate remark at the time. I didn't appreciate it then."
Steinbrenner, who did so much to make Winfield's life miserable in the eight-plus years he played for the Yankees, never appreciated the type of player he had. All he did was look at Winfield's hitting statistics. When they lacked lusty numbers, he criticized Winfield.
Unlike players and managers from other teams, Steinbrenner never understood the contributions Winfield made with his outfield defense and his base running. Memory might be playing tricks, but it's hard to recall when the man stopped at second on a single to the outfield. First to third was routine for Winfield.
Asked what he missed about no longer playing baseball, Winfield said: "I miss going first to third in somebody's face. I miss throwing someone out from the outfield."
Later he explained those facets of his game.
"Going from first to third, scoring from first on a double, for a big guy, those are things I really enjoyed," he said. "You can hit a ground ball right at an outfielder and if you're busting your backside from home plate, you have a chance for a double. Those are things I enjoyed. Playing defense is something you have to work on and something you have to love. When I first started, I wasn't a good defensive outfielder. I focused on it, enjoyed it, worked on things like charging the baseball. Little things that you do consistently become big things. Defense was a big part of my game."
Steinbrenner has belatedly recognized Winfield as an all-around player. He issued a statement yesterday expressing his delight at Winfield's election to the Hall and said he was "probably one of the greatest athletes I have ever known." 
Steinbrenner also acknowledged the problems the two men encountered, though he didn't say he instigated them, and said that "today we are good friends." Winfield didn't go that far, but said more than once that Steinbrenner had "apologized for what he's said and what he's done."
The Yankees will honor their latest Hall of Famer with a day this season and may retire the No. 31 he wore with them. Contrary to his success with other players, Steinbrenner is not expected to be able to buy Winfield's selection of the Yankees cap to appear on his Cooperstown plaque. Winfield may opt for the Yankees, but not because of any economic overtures from their owner.
Winfield tried hard yesterday to avoid the negative aspects of his time in New York, a city he said he loved and never wanted to leave as a player. "Everybody used to tell me, 'You should leave, you don't have to endure the circumstances,' " he said. "I said, 'I'm not going anywhere.' I had laid my roots here."
But he begrudgingly talked briefly about his 1984 competition with Don Mattingly for the American League batting championship. Not the race itself, but the undercurrent that engulfed the clubhouse. Most of their teammates were clearly pulling for Mattingly, raising questions about the possibility of race as a factor.
"There was nothing between Donnie and I," Winfield said. "We lived different lives. He was a young player who had a lot of support. I just know what I experienced the entire year. It was much different than my teammate did at the same time."
Mattingly won the title, .343 to .340, by collecting four hits to Winfield's one in the final game. After their last at-bats, the players clasped hands and walked off the field together. But Winfield was gone from the clubhouse when the door was opened to reporters.
"You wonder sometimes, where was the support during the course of the year?" Winfield said, reluctantly recalling his departure that day. "I made sure I packed my stuff because everybody might say, 'I was with him all year.' Aaahhh, that wasn't the case. I went through a lot. If I had won the batting race, I probably would have talked not just about the race; I probably would have talked about a lot of other things. But I didn't win and I'm not going to talk about it. Donnie won, put the spotlight on him. He deserved it. There wasn't a platform, so I wasn't going to make one."
Winfield has a big new platform now. He plans to use it only for positive matters, not unappetizing batting-race memories or labels.

HEADLINE: After a Last Push to Find Victims, Salvadorans Hope to Rebuild 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
With the death toll from Saturday's earthquake nearing 700 and no survivors found in recent days, Salvadoran authorities are preparing to shift their energies from search and rescue to rebuilding. Today they announced what is expected to be a final push by international teams to find those people who were buried with their homes when a wall of dirt smothered the neighborhood of Las Colinas in a suburb of the capital. 
 "That is one of the hardest decisions of the coming days," said Mario Acosta, the minister of the interior and president of the National Emergency Committee. "The families of many still hold on to the hope of finding loved ones alive. It is a possibility, and that is why we sent out today scout teams to give a response to the families. By Friday, we will end it and enter another stage." 
 After several days of local speculation that some cut-off communities were devastated by deaths, rescue crews found structural damage but few new fatalities. Government agencies have stopped issuing estimates of how many people are still missing, they said, because more and more people are turning up after having been unable to communicate with frantic relatives.
Crews working with everything from machetes and saws to dynamite and bulldozers have cleared many roads, and food, water and medicines are beginning to flow even into remote areas. Public health specialists, worried about epidemics from poor sanitation, have begun to analyze medical needs and assess how to rebuild damaged hospitals where some 800 beds are now unusable. 
The bigger challenge will be replacing more than 20,000 homes, especially in poor rural communities where houses were built with fragile wood and adobe. Some 47,000 other homes were damaged.
Nearly 46,000 people were ordered to evacuate their homes, including 800 families who had to leave a government shelter on Tuesday night after an unusually strong aftershock cracked its walls. 
"The most important part after the immediate emergency is the physical and psychological reconstruction," Mr. Acosta said. "There is not one family who has not been touched by this earthquake." 
International aid is still arriving, and the government has hired two accounting firms to ensure that all assistance ends up helping people and not sitting idle or diverted for profit. 
Relief workers long active in the region said the earthquake was but the latest blow to this country, which was not only battered by Hurricane Mitch in 1998 but was also recovering from a deadly dengue fever epidemic. "They couldn't have been more weak or vulnerable to begin with," said Paul Bell, regional director of the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance of the United States Agency for International Development. 
Still, President Francisco Flores urged citizens this week to face their challenge with the same courage and stoicism as past generations and said that such calamities had helped build "much of the Salvadoran character."
Yet while he and government ministers appealed for solidarity, opposition members of Congress seeking concessions were blocking the proposed budget, possibly slowing the redirecting of credits from the Inter-American Development Bank that were to be used for rebuilding.
"This is not the time for political illusions," Mr. Acosta said. "This is the time for all of us to dress in blue and white, our national colors, and help."

I.B.M. Swims Against Tide With Strong Profit Report

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
I.B.M. reported quarterly earnings yesterday that were slightly better than Wall Street's expectations, and perhaps more encouragingly, it told investors that it was "comfortable" with analysts' earnings projections for this year.
 Unlike a string of technology companies that have warned investors that a slowing economy has caused them to scale back expectations for 2001, including Intel as recently as Tuesday, I.B.M. said most of its business showed few signs of weakening. 
 I.B.M. executives said the company's strength overseas, its emphasis on selling a wide variety of services in addition to hardware, and its focus on large global customers that intend to keep investing to expand their electronic commerce capabilities helped shield the company from some of the pressures felt by other technology giants. 
In addition, the company said it was benefiting from the rollout of several important new products, including its latest mainframe computer, and payments from other companies eager to use I.B.M. electronics innovations in their own products. Royalty income alone topped $1.6 billion last year, John Joyce, I.B.M.'s chief financial officer, said. That figure went beyond the "more than $1 billion" estimate that I.B.M. used in previous reports. 
"We look forward to another good year at I.B.M.," said Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the company's chairman and chief executive, in a statement issued with the earnings.
Last year certainly ended on a high note for I.B.M., the world's largest computer company. It said it earned $2.67 billion, or $1.48 a diluted share, in the last three months of 2000, a 32 percent increase from the $1.12 a share reported a year earlier, when earnings were $2.09 billion. Revenue was nearly $25.62 billion, up 6 percent from $24.18 billion in the last three months of 1999. 
The earnings were 2 cents a share more than the consensus forecast of $1.46 reported by First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks analysts' projections. The revenue projection for the quarter had been $25.5 billion.
But the quarter was stronger than those figures suggest.
Revenue grew 12 percent if the effect of the strengthening dollar on sales in foreign currencies is removed. In each of the company's major businesses, profits and revenue grew faster in the fourth quarter than at any other time in 2000, sending the company into this year with strong momentum.
"They're cooking," said Ulric Weil, an analyst who follows the computer industry for Friedman, Billings, Ramsey in Arlington, Va. "They beat the revenue consensus, despite the really negative currency impact."
The news was even better than optimistic investors anticipated. I.B.M.'s share rose $3.94, to $96.69, during trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. The earnings were released after trading ended. After hours, the stock rose as high as $103.44.
In the company's conference call with analysts, Mr. Joyce acknowledged that I.B.M.'s personal computer business and hard disk drive business faced a tough climate. He noted, though, that I.B.M. had sharply reduced its involvement in the home computer market last year as part of its drive to return the unit to profitability after years of losses. Driven by sales of I.B.M.'s laptops and small servers for e-businesses, the company's personal computer business was profitable, with sales increasing 15 percent in the fourth quarter, despite declining desktop sales.
Mr. Joyce also cautioned that I.B.M. would have to reduce its expectations if the economy took a significant turn for the worse. "We don't have a better crystal ball than you do," he told analysts. 
But for the moment, the news is upbeat. Parts shortages that crimped sales in the third quarter have largely abated, although the company said it did not expect to catch up with demand for its popular new z900 mainframe before the end of the current quarter. 
I.B.M. also said it had largely cleaned up another sore spot in third-quarter earnings: poor execution of sales plans by its software sales force. While reported revenue for that segment were down slightly from a year ago at $3.6 billion, they represent a 6 percent gain when adjusted for the currency changes.
I.B.M. hardware sales grew 10 percent from a year ago, to $11.4 billion, with profit margins jumping 3.5 percentage points to top 30 percent.
I.B.M.'s services business, with $9.2 billion in revenue, a 5 percent increase from a year ago, ended 2000 with a backlog of $85 billion, up sharply from $60 billion a year ago. 
Europe and Asia were particularly strong performers for I.B.M. during the quarter. European revenue of $7.4 billion represented an 18 percent increase in the quarter from 1999, once currency adjustments were taken into account. Mr. Joyce characterized it as the region's strongest performance ever for the company.
But revenues in the Asia-Pacific region, which totaled $5 billion, grew at an even faster rate of 20 percent, adjusted to 1999 currency translation rates. 
Some analysts said the quarter was bolstered by the introduction of the z900, pent-up demand for RS6000 computers that were not sold in the third quarter because of parts shortages and the arrival in December of upgraded storage products. "They had three product cycles at their backs," said Thomas Kraemer, who follows the company for Merrill Lynch. "That's as good as it gets."
I.B.M. said strong efforts to use the Internet to become more productive also contributed to its success. Mr. Joyce said that I.B.M. had cut $1.5 billion from customer service expenses by handling more queries electronically and that it saved $350 million by using the Internet for internal training. The company also saved money by selling $9 billion in goods -- 65 percent more than a year ago -- via IBM.com.
"The good thing about this is that I don't have to change my model," said John B. Jones Jr., an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in San Francisco. "I've been bullish and I had gotten nervous."

BOEING BEATS 4TH-QUARTER ESTIMATES, BUT STOCK DROPS

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 Boeing said yesterday that its fourth-quarter profits rose 36 percent, beating Wall Street forecasts, as it squeezed more cash out of its aerospace business despite shrinking revenue. But the shares of Boeing, the world's largest maker of aircraft, fell $2.25, to $58.75, after three major airlines reported weaker quarterly earnings, hinting that future aircraft orders would suffer. Boeing, based in Seattle, said it earned $877 million, or $1.01 a diluted share, excluding one-time charges, up from $662 million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier. The results beat analysts' average expectations by 10 cents a share.

HEADLINE: Pataki's New School Plan Falls Short of Necessary Overhaul, Officials Say 

BYLINE:  By KATE ZERNIKE 

 BODY:
School officials across the state said yesterday that Gov. George E. Pataki's budget fell far short of the bold proposal they believe is necessary to change the way the state finances its schools, offering neither enough new money nor substantial changes.
 When a state judge last week threw out the formulas the state used to determine how much aid it offered schools, saying the formula shortchanged New York City, officials at many districts outside the city cheered the decision. They said the system was arbitrary and unfair to them as well. 
 But yesterday, the schools said that the revised formula proposed in the governor's budget on Tuesday merely tinkered with the financing and that his decision to appeal the judge's ruling suggested that he did not believe major change was necessary. The new formula would not solve the fundamental flaws for most districts in how aid is distributed, they said, adding that in some areas it might actually create more problems. For example, a district that had a high number of learning-disabled students might get far less aid for them than it did for its other students.
"The genie is out of the bottle," said Lawrence M. Cummings, lead coordinator of the Midstate School Finance Consortium, which represents more than 200 districts in the state. "With the judge's decision, enough people have said we have to have dramatic reform. I don't think what the governor has proposed is going to be sufficient to stem that tide."
Under the current formula, the state gives money based on the relative wealth of a community, a figure derived from calculating how much its property is worth and how much income its residents earn. The state earmarks the money for a few dozen categories, allowing districts to spend the money for only those specific purposes. 
The governor would essentially change the formula by collapsing 11 of the categories into one called flex aid, which would allow districts to spend the money however they choose. He would also increase state aid by $382 million, to $14.1 billion in the 2001-2002 school year. But adjusted for inflation and for increases in school enrollment, that would actually amount to a slight decrease.
The districts welcomed the flexibility. In some years, they have had to return money they desperately needed for reducing class size because they did not have enough classroom space to do so. Under the flex aid formula, those districts would be able to use the money toward other expenses. 
But in some ways, the new formula might also hurt them, superintendents and other school officials said. The formula still caps state aid to districts. Special education, for example, now a separate category, would be included in flex aid. Special education is a federal entitlement, so if many students in a district need these expensive programs, the state money it gets to pay for that may exceed the total flex aid cap, preventing the district from using the money for other items.
"One of the problems with the new formula is that it did not do away with these caps," said Nathaniel Clay, superintendent of the Hempstead School District. "There's nothing in what Pataki is proposing that begins to even put in place what the judge recommended."
Many superintendents, particularly those from suburban cities, say that even taking into account factors like income and tax base, the formula would not provide a fair share of their costs, compared with what it gives other districts. Across the state, there are wide disparities between how much the state gives toward districts' per pupil spending and how much the districts contribute. 
On average, school districts pay $1.36 for every $1 the state contributes, according to State Education Department figures for 1997-98. But while the towns in Hamilton County in northeastern New York, which spend the most local money per student, pay $6.50 for every $1 the state contributes, those in Allegany County, to the southwest, pay 36 cents for each dollar they get from the state.
There is also a disparity between state spending in districts in counties with the same relative wealth. Those in Columbia County, for example, paid an average of $6,042 per pupil in 1997-98 and received $3,664 per pupil from the state. New York City, which is slightly wealthier, paid less, $4,158, and received more, $3,680.
The problem with the proposed new formula, districts said, is that it does not fundamentally restructure how the wealth is calculated, or what percentage the state contributes.
Any new formula, many superintendents and board members said, should require a minimum threshold of local spending. Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky of Westchester proposed a bill yesterday to do so. 
Mr. Cummings, of the Midstate School Finance Consortium, said a revised formula should include a foundation budget, which would set a minimum amount each community must spend on its schools, and a minimum amount to be contributed by the state. Other states faced with similar lawsuits have done this.
"You cannot reform this incrementally," Mr. Cummings said. 
And that, most agreed, will take more money. "He still has not provided sufficient funds to place all children on track to meet the new achievement standards," said Pamela Betheil, president of the Eastern Suffolk County Board of Cooperative Educational Services. "They have to give more money."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 22, 2001

 CORRECTION:
Articles on Wednesday and Thursday about Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed budget referred imprecisely to his proposal for school aid. His office says that his proposal for a 2.8 percent increase, when adjusted for projected declines in inflation and student enrollment, would still result in a net increase. Only if inflation and enrollment followed current trends would it amount to a slight decline in real dollars.

CHIP MAKER MISSES FORECASTS

BYLINE:  Reuters 

 BODY:
 Advanced Micro Devices reported fourth-quarter net income yesterday that narrowly trailed forecasts and joined its larger rival Intel in predicting that slack sales of PC's would hurt first-quarter sales. Advanced Micro Devices said its net income for the quarter more than doubled to $177.9 million, or 53 cents a share, from $65.1 million, or 21 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 21 percent, to $1.18 billion. Analysts had expected the Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company to earn 55 cents a share. In light of weak demand for personal computers and slowing worldwide economies, the chip maker said it expected that normal seasonal weakness in first-quarter demand for PC processors coupled with the effects of excess PC inventories in distribution channels would hurt PC processor sales in the first quarter of 2001.

STRONG JOB PICTURE IN BRITAIN

BYLINE:  By Alan Cowell 

 BODY:
 British unemployment in December remained as low as it has been in 25 years, and the tight labor market drove wages up at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the previous three months, the government reported. 
Rising labor costs led analysts to back away from forecasts of an imminent cut in interest rates and suggested that the British economy was not slowing down the way the American economy appears to be. But with inflation well below the government's 2.5 percent target and the American slowdown considered likely to affect Britain eventually, investors still expect a rate cut later this year.

HEADLINE: California in State of Emergency Over Power 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
Gov. Gray Davis of California declared a state of emergency late this evening after the state was forced to cut power temporarily for hundreds of thousands of people on a swath from Oregon to Bakersfield. 
 While planned, controlled blackouts have occurred before in the state on a modest scale, this was the first time that they were carried out over such a large area. And despite frantic efforts by utilities and state officials to line up enough power for later in the week, the prospect of continuing blackouts put pressure on the governor to step in and take emergency actions. 
 Governor Davis provided few specifics in his announcement, other than saying that the state's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison, were on the verge of being forced into bankruptcy and that he was ordering a state agency, the Department of Water Resources, to become the principal purchaser of electricity from the big generating companies that supply the state. 
"The imminent threat of widespread and prolonged disruption of electrical power to California's emergency services, law enforcement, schools, hospitals, homes, businesses and agriculture constitutes a condition of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property within the state which, by reason of its magnitude, is likely to be beyond the control of the services, personnel, equipment, and facilities of any single county or city," Governor Davis said in his declaration.
The emergency declaration recognized that one of the factors that caused the blackouts and threatened more in the days ahead was the fact that the big generating companies were resisting selling their power to utilities that might never be able to pay for it. The governor said four of these generators, Duke, Southern, Reliant and Dynergy, were prepared to finally put the utilities into bankruptcy court, but had agreed to wait now that the state, which enjoys a solid credit rating, had stepped in and would be the primary buyer of their power. The governor said the arrangement was contingent on the Legislature's passing a bill on Thursday giving the state the ability to buy power on a large scale.
Today's blackouts began at 11:40 a.m. and ran for three hours in Central and Northern California. About 500,000 utility customers at a time in checkerboard patterns were denied power by Pacific Gas and Electric for about an hour, then had service restored as another block was blacked out.
For weeks a financial crisis at utilities, transmission bottlenecks and shortfalls in electricity generation have pushed the state's teetering power system to the brink. Today, as those financial problems worsened, a sudden drop in hydroelectric generation pushed the system over it. 
There were signs that financial concerns were a critical factor in the blackouts. Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison have said they are being driven toward bankruptcy because the soaring price of power on the wholesale market has risen far higher than what they are able to charge their customers by state regulations. 
Southern California Edison has already had to delay repayment of nearly $600 million in debt this week, and late today Pacific Gas and Electric said it would do the same. Given that reality, some generating companies have reportedly been unwilling to sell power to the utilities, which has aggravated the shortages. 
In San Francisco at midday, the rolling blackouts seemed to be dribbling. Certain streets of certain neighborhoods were left without power, but never whole neighborhoods. Downtown, A.T.M.'s stopped working, traffic lights went off on certain streets, and two students at the Hastings College School of Law were stuck in an elevator and had to be rescued.
People around the state also tried to improvise, with mixed success. For instance, in Davis, a university town about 15 miles west of Sacramento, Marylou Hedriana, the chef and owner at Chocolat, a bakery, said she had just put tart shells in the oven when the power went off there unexpectedly.
"They were lost," she said. "Now we have to start all over again at step one."
She added that she had been unable to contact anyone at Pacific Gas and Electric, frustrating her efforts to plan around the blackout. "We couldn't plan our day," she said. "We sent two employees home."
The blackouts hit portions of San Francisco, Sacramento, Modesto, Turlock and other cities. The utility spread them out carefully so that no single neighborhood or city bore the brunt of the electricity cutoffs.
At 1:40 p.m., the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the transmission system, said that it had purchased additional power, some of it from BC Hydro, a major generator in Canada, and that it was able to order all customer power restored.
But there was still great uncertainty, about both the evening peak demand hours and the coming days. Officials at the Independent System Operator said that as demand soared in late afternoon the usual peak period, new rotating blackouts could be ordered, this time in the southern part of the state, to the customers of Southern California Edison. 
The officials added that perhaps a million customers each hour could be affected. These officials said they were forced to order the planned blackouts to avoid uncontrolled shutdowns that could have moved unpredictably through the system.
On top of that, tens of thousands of businesses across the state that have signed up for what is called interruptible power were blacked out to a far greater degree.
Under their contracts, they had agreed to be shut down first in case of shortages, in return for rates that are about 25 percent lower than normal, and so they had already had their power cut off since early in the morning.
Most of these businesses agreed to lose power for only about five hours at a time, but many were forced to shut down for 10 hours or more, underscoring the mounting economic impact of the state's energy crisis and the lack of policy options being offered by state officials.
"We are trying to manage the picture here today, but we've come to the end of the road here as far as supply within California and out-of-state resources go," said Jim Detmers, the managing director for operations at the Independent System Operator.
One of the most maddening aspects of the crisis is that officials have no way of knowing from one day to the next what the situation will be, frustrating efforts by businesses and other power users to make plans and worsening the economic impact. Given the fact that a decline in water supplies had reduced power today, officials were reduced to praying for rain.
"I'm afraid we just have to take this day by day," said Terry Winter, the chief executive of the Independent System Operator. Some of the people who manage the transmission system expressed concern that they were being forced to improvise on a daily basis to keep the lights on in California and were not receiving more help from the governor and the Legislature. 
The lawmakers have passed some bills and have discussed taking other measures, but they have not yet implemented changes that could bring immediate relief to the overtaxed power system.
Public officials in Davis said they were prepared, however. The fire chief, Rose Conroy, said the planning began last summer, when the utility first warned of the possibility of the rotating blackouts. The city was notified as to which blocks would be affected and responded by sending fire fighters out today. They "knocked on doors and asked, 'Are you O.K.?' " at residences of invalids, Ms. Conroy said, providing a sense of security to residents.
Mr. Winter said the output from hydroelectric dams was cut by about 2,000 megawatts today, out of a peak demand of slightly more than 30,000 megawatts.
The State Assembly late Tuesday evening passed a bill that would have the state, which enjoys a strong financial standing, buying the power, then selling it to the utilities. But that bill must still be passed by the State Senate and would have no effect for several weeks at the earliest.
Those immediate financial problems led to some grim portents in the market where the power companies buy and sell electricity. The amount of contracts negotiated at what is called the California Power Exchange, the market set up by the state for the utilities to buy power from generating companies, plummeted today.
Jesus Arredondo, a spokesman for the Power Exchange, said 82,000 megawatts had been traded on the market today. That is power that will be supplied on Thursday. That level is down from 160,000 megawatts traded last Wednesday and 300,000 megawatts two weeks ago, more normal levels of business.
"That's dirt, it's like nothing," Mr. Arredondo said of the level of trading today. He added that it clearly indicated that the prospect of more blackouts on Thursday was high.
"You look at the precipitous drop in the contracts, and it's due to credit," Mr. Arredondo said.
A major transmission bottleneck in central California also contributed to today's problems. Near Bakersfield is a stretch of transmission lines known as Path 15. Power traveling from the south to the north of the state, the normal flow at this time of year, must traverse those lines, but their capacity is lower than the grid just above and below it, slowing the flow.
David Freeman, the chairman of Los Angeles's municipally owned Department of Water and Power, said the transmission grid at midday resembled "L.A. freeway-type logjams." Describing the shortages today, Mr. Freeman, who once ran the Tennessee Valley Authority and New York State's power authority, said: "It's not all that complicated -- we just have a shortage. All the conspiracy theories -- you don't need to go there."
The blackouts caused a variety of problems. At the University of California Hastings College of Law, in San Francisco, two students were trapped in elevators for 15 minutes before being rescued. At a Safeway in San Mateo, south of San Francisco, employees had to guide a handful of shoppers around the aisles using flashlights.
At the Peninsula Community Foundation, a nonprofit agency across the street from the darkened Safeway, Judi Powell, a program officer, said the lights blacked out suddenly just before noon without warning and that people tended to make do with natural light. The real problem, she said, was that without computers much of the work at the foundation came to a standstill, which means a report she had to complete went unfinished.
J. Steve Tedesco, president of the San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce, complained: "How did the utilities select these areas? Why did they select downtown, and why did they select noon?"
Some employers said they did receive warnings of impending blackouts.
Hewlett-Packard received word that its power could go out sometime in the afternoon at its Palo Alto headquarters. Earlier in the day, blackouts had hit three other Hewlett-Packard offices around Silicon Valley, affecting around 400 employees, said David L. Berman, a company spokesman.
In the Santa Rosa region, which is used to blackouts from powerful winter storms that have battered the region, it was strange to cope with a power outage on a brilliantly clear, blue, calm winter day.

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy Judge May Be Solution to California Energy Crisis 

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
Politicians and power company executives have bickered for months about how best to solve California's energy problems, but ultimately it may come down to this: a bankruptcy court judge may be the only person with the authority to ask for the rate increases and cost cuts that a growing chorus of analysts say are necessary, but that nobody in the state has been able to agree upon.
 Bankruptcy filings by the state's two largest utilities, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric, would only make it harder for them to borrow money. This would further shake the confidence of power-generating companies that are already threatening not to sell them electricity, fearing that they will not be paid. 
 But there is growing recognition that a trip to bankruptcy court could give many parties in the current debacle -- particularly the politicians -- a convenient way out. Everyone, that is, except consumers, who are almost certain to be forced to pay a large chunk of the $12 billion the two utilities owe power generators now. A prospective law being discussed in the state legislature does not address the payment of the current bills. 
"It may be the best thing that happens if this goes to bankruptcy court," said Donato J. Eassey, an analyst with Merrill Lynch in Houston. "I don't think there is room for gamesmanship. Somebody has to grab this snake by the head and strangle it."
The threat of bankruptcy for the utilities is more real than ever. Today, Pacific Gas and Electric and its parent, the PG& E Corporation, said they had defaulted on $76 million of commercial paper. And Southern California Edison said this week that it would not pay $596 million it owed bondholders and power generators.
On Tuesday, the State Assembly passed legislation that would allow the state to step in and buy power at cheaper rates on behalf of the beleaguered utilities, a bill put together, in theory, to appease all parties, including the utilities and the power generators. So far, it has proved to do anything but that. The measure, Wall Street analysts say, does nothing to solve the most immediate crisis: the utilities are quickly running out of cash. And while Gov. Gray Davis still insists that bankruptcy is not an option, neither he nor the legislature has proposed a solution to pay past bills, the crux of the utilities' problems today.
"They can put all this effort into getting a deal done, but it does not mean you avert bankruptcy," said Jon Raleigh, a power and utilities analyst with Goldman, Sachs in New York. "One reason is any legislative action will take time to implement."
Already, power-generating companies are threatening to force the utilities into bankruptcy, hoping that they will have more luck appealing to a bankruptcy judge than to politicians. "All of the power generators are coming under pressure to pay their own bills," said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade group in Sacramento. They are under pressure particularly from suppliers selling natural gas to the power plants to keep them running. But the generators have been reluctant to force bankruptcy so far, fearing that they would seem predatory after reporting millions in profits last year. 
Mr. Eassey of Merrill Lynch suggests that the power generators could force the utilities to file for bankruptcy as early as next week. But the utilities themselves are adamant that bankruptcy is not the answer. With their bonds downgraded to junk ratings on Tuesday, it will already be difficult for them to repair their damaged images with investors. Tom Higgins, a senior vice president of Edison International, the parent company of Southern California Edison, said a bankruptcy would be disruptive for customers and for the state's economy. Further, Edison defaulted this week to conserve cash and stave off bankruptcy. 
Still, some utilities, particularly PG& E, have already taken steps to protect their nonutility assets from being tapped by creditors in the event of insolvency.
Since California's most recent power problems started to become evident in late November, federal and state political leaders, company executives and consumer groups have blamed one another. 
Mr. Raleigh of Goldman, Sachs said that a bankruptcy could be a saving grace for Governor Davis and many of the state legislators who have been criticized for doing too little too late to solve the energy crisis. Earlier this month, the California Public Utilities Commission agreed to allow the utilities to temporarily raise rates for consumers and businesses by 7 to 15 percent. The governor has since said that he will accept increases in that range, but not higher.
But most analysts think that, barring another solution proposed by state leaders in coming days, a rate increase is necessary to solve the immediate crisis. "Governor Davis boxed himself into a corner when he said he won't raise rates," Mr. Raleigh said. Then it would be up to a bankruptcy judge, who would need the approval of the Public Utilities Commission, to propose higher rates. If rates went up that way, he said, the governor "can be the one to say he was not the one to raise rates."
Mr. Davis, though, balked at that notion, saying: "Nobody in their right minds wants a bankruptcy. We are working night and day on a bipartisan basis to keep the lights on."
Bankruptcy lawyers said that any rate increases would not occur within days of filing, but would be carefully reviewed and considered in light of all that has happened in California. And the California commission could reject the proposal.
Mr. Eassey said a judge would require the utilities to cut other costs first -- limousines and planes, for instance -- before tapping consumers.

HEADLINE: Bush Wanders Off Center 

BYLINE:  By Ted Halstead; Ted Halstead is president of the New America Foundation and co-author of the forthcoming "The Radical Center."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In nominating John Ashcroft for attorney general and Gale Norton as interior secretary, President-elect George Bush is ignoring what over the past decade has become the first law of American politics -- veer not from the center.
 Newt Gingrich and Congressional Republicans defied this principle and paid the price, Mr. Gingrich with his political life. If Mr. Bush persists in betraying the center that helped elect him, he, too, will pay -- with a diminished presidency. 
 America's new political center, reflected in the growing number of independent voters, is surprisingly broad and deep. Some 35 percent of Americans now describe themselves as independents, compared with 33 percent who say they are Democrats and 31 percent who identify as Republicans, according to a Gallup poll conducted earlier this month.
Together with large numbers of centrist Republicans and Democrats, these independent-minded voters are neither conservative nor liberal in the traditional sense. Rather, they represent a genuinely new center in American politics -- one whose agenda lies outside left and right as opposed to between them. These new centrists are socially tolerant yet supportive of law and order, fiscally conservative but accepting of government intervention for economic fairness or security, concerned about the economy yet worried about the environment.
The new center is wielding ever more power through instant polls, focus groups and an active presence in mainstream environmental, consumer and church-based groups. As we saw in the last presidential campaign, its influence is growing as that of religious conservatives and liberal special-interest groups is shrinking.
The nominations of Mr. Ashcroft and Ms. Norton are vulnerable, then, not because they are the target of liberals but because the nominees hold positions that are antithetical to the values of this rising center.
John Ashcroft's opposition to abortion -- even in cases of rape or incest -- conflicts with the pro-choice attitudes of these voters. And his faith-based approach to public policy raises worries about his commitment to the rule of law and to the separation of church and state -- both important principles of the new center. Not surprisingly, the latest polls show more Americans opposing Mr. Ashcroft's appointment than supporting it.
Similarly, Gale Norton's environmental record clashes with the conservationist ethic of most centrist Americans. They are flexible in their approach to protecting the environment, but Ms. Norton's criticism of regulations affecting public lands suggests she would allow logging, mining and grazing interests a much greater access than before, which would be anathema to most centrists. Even the Republicans for Environmental Protection opposes her nomination.
If the Democratic leadership allows these nominations to go forward without question, it, too, will be held accountable by this center, which looks to the opposition to be a check against the party in power. There is no hiding from responsibility in a media age that makes clear, through instant polling, where the public stands.
Mr. Bush ran as a compassionate conservative, not as a member of his party's right wing. At times during the campaign, he sounded like a convinced new centrist. He spoke eloquently of restoring purpose to American life and of tearing down the walls that keep America divided. In his effort to marry progressive ends with conservative means, there was more than a hint of potential greatness -- for both his presidency and the country. But by straying from the center, with his appointments of Mr. Ashcroft and Ms. Norton, Mr. Bush risks squandering the potential for an effective presidency.

HEADLINE: Softball for Powell, and With No Sweat 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
As a 63-year-old four star general acquainted with the old world of the Soviet Union and its weapons, Gen. Colin L. Powell set out today to convince his polite Senate inquisitors that he was suited to be secretary of state because he knew the new world of the Internet and the information revolution. 
 Only a few moments into his testimony, General Powell, dressed in a sharply tailored suit that could adorn any top corporate executive, was talking about e-mail, the speed of communication and his transforming experience as a director of America Online. 
 But just as the Internet was essential to the new world, so was national missile defense, said General Powell, who stressed repeatedly in his confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the Bush administration was determined to move forward with the plan, even in the face of allied opposition. 
"I have also been through several things like this over the years where people see something new come along and they are terrified," General Powell said comparing the fears in Europe about national missile defense with fears in the 1980's when there was public opposition in Britain and Germany to the installation of American Pershing nuclear missiles to deter the Soviets. But, the general declared, "If it's the right thing to do, you do it anyway." 
Under deferential questioning from the senators, General Powell gave a broad-brush tour of a Bush foreign policy, referring often to consulting with the president-elect though never playing down the State Department's role in deciding matters of policy from North Korea to the Middle East to Africa. 
Although he made tens of millions of dollars in the last seven years on the strength of his inspirational speaking skills, General Powell's delivery was almost rote as he rarely answered questions in depth. He had met with each of the senators on the committee in the privacy of their offices last week, so he seemed to be acting on the premise that today was as much about symbolism as substance, more about appearance than conviction. 
In a very gentle warning, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, predicted that a possible source of tension between General Powell and the committee was the very attribute that the general, as an experienced Washington in-fighter, flirted with today. Senator Biden described it as "your legendary capability of being closemouthed and avoiding saying exactly where the principal you represent stands." 
General Powell was scarcely asked about when and how he would apply his military doctrine -- known as the Powell doctrine -- that calls for a clear definition of goals and overwhelming force to accomplish them. Nor was he asked about his view of the role of American soldiers in peacekeeping tasks beyond the specific example of Kosovo and Bosnia.
In that instance, General Powell broke no new ground in his testimony or in answers to questions, saying that the Bush team would "carefully" review the commitments made by the Clinton administration to the NATO peacekeeping force in the Balkans. 
European leaders have expressed alarm that even the threat of withdrawing American troops from the Balkans missions would weaken NATO and destabilize Kosovo and Bosnia just at a critical moment of their repair. As if to respond to that concern but not willing to concede the apparent contradiction that withdrawing troops would affect NATO, General Powell said in his testimony that NATO was the "bedrock of our relationship with Europe." 
"It is sacrosanct," he said. "Weaken NATO, and you weaken Europe, which weakens America." 
The backbone of General Powell's presentation was the determination of the Bush administration to press ahead with national missile defense. The general brushed aside a suggestion from Senator Biden that if the United States could get an ironclad agreement ending North Korea's long-range ballistic missile development programs, as well as its sale of missile technologies to Iran, then a missile defense system could be built that would pose fewer concerns to America's allies. 
"There are still other nations that are moving in this direction, particularly Iran," he replied. "And until Iraq comes into compliance and we could be assured of what they're able to do, I would say that at this point, we should continue to move ahead as aggressively as possible." 
On Iraq, General Powell made the case that sanctions, as he has said before, needed to be reinvigorated and that this could be done by pointing out more vigorously to nations in the region that Saddam Hussein was threatening them with weapons of mass destruction.
General Powell seemed to express some skepticism on a policy of trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein, a policy favored more strongly by others in the Bush team. "It's easy to say let's just go in and take over the land," he said. "But we really have to make sure we have an understanding of how this is actually going to be operationalized, and that there really is some sound basis for believing that people could be successful once they go onto Iraqi territory." 
Elsewhere in the Middle East, the general distanced himself from the all-out Clinton effort to reach an accord between the Palestinians and Israelis, saying that Syria was needed for a comprehensive settlement. 
On the crisis in Congo, General Powell described the situation as "very confused" and warned that Congo was the most difficult peacekeeping task for the United Nations. "The Congo is not a nice little place like Sierra Leone, or even a little place like Bosnia and Kosovo," he said. "It's a huge place. And the number of people who get sucked up in such a mission is very, very large." 
Under questioning by the ranking Republican on the panel, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the general seemed to provide answers to Mr. Helms's liking. He said that the Bush team was in favor of expanding NATO beyond the three new members added during the Clinton years, but he was not specific. 
On the International Criminal Court, of which President Clinton said he favored ratification, General Powell told the panel not to be "standing on your tippy-toes waiting for the Bush administration to ask for any -- any -- movement toward ratification of the treaty." 
And on Cuba, the general fully satisfied Senator Helms by calling Fidel Castro an "aging starlet" who would be faced with a continued economic embargo from the Bush White House. In his prepared testimony, General Powell gave the impression that that the Bush administration would not seek passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty at all, though in his oral delivery he modified that to say they would not seek passage in the current Congressional session.

HEADLINE: Whitman Promises Latitude To States on Pollution Rules 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey said today that as the country's top environmental regulator she would give the states greater latitude in heeding federal pollution-control rules.
 In remarks to a Senate committee considering her for director of the Environmental Protection Agency, Governor Whitman also said all environmental regulations should be made subject to strict cost-benefit tests, and she vowed to "move beyond the command-and-control model" of protecting the environment. 
 As governor, Mrs. Whitman was criticized for cutting New Jersey's environmental enforcement budget and relying too heavily on voluntary compliance. While she promised today to oversee "a strong federal role" in environmental protection, her testimony signaled an inclination to allow greater flexibility to industries and the states than the Clinton administration allowed. 
Mrs. Whitman also said she would review a string of environmental regulations issued in recent months by the Clinton administration, including a clean-air rule for big trucks and buses that critics said would unwisely burden industry and the economy.
Several Democratic senators, including Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, urged Mrs. Whitman and the incoming administration of President-elect George W. Bush to uphold that rule. But otherwise, Mrs. Whitman faced not a single note of criticism during her one-day hearing and appeared to be headed for speedy confirmation.
Among the senators who questioned Mrs. Whitman was Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, in her debut as a member of a Senate committee. Mrs. Clinton said she intended to vote to support Mrs. Whitman.
Though her critics had vowed to make racial profiling in New Jersey an issue in her nomination, Senator Jon S. Corzine, the freshman New Jersey Democrat, was the only member of the panel to ask Mrs. Whitman about the issue. In her reply, she promised to be sensitive to racial concerns in dealing with the environmental problems of the cities.
Mrs. Whitman has admitted that New Jersey state troopers improperly singled out blacks and members of other minorities for traffic stops.
Democrats and Republicans alike greeted Mrs. Whitman warmly today on Capitol Hill, reflecting her stature as someone who was frequently mentioned as a possible vice-presidential candidate.
Senator Robert G. Torricelli, the New Jersey Democrat who introduced her to the Senate panel, called her nomination "a very wise selection" and noted that she was from a state with one of the country's best coastal management programs and the largest number of Superfund hazardous waste sites.
In signaling her plan to review Clinton administration directives, Mrs. Whitman made remarks consistent with earlier ones by Mr. Bush. She said the agency had "an obligation to review all the rules" issued recently by the White House, including those adopted last month to tighten emissions and clean-fuel requirements for buses and big rigs, the nation's heaviest polluters on the highways.
The oil industry has warned that the measures, which would not take effect before 2006, could cause fuel shortages and price increases affecting the transportation industry. One Republican senator, James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which heard from Mrs. Whitman today, has said he plans to try to get Congress to reverse the rules.
Mrs. Whitman did not spell out how the agency might be more flexible under her than in the past. But she called for a "new era of cooperation" among state and federal governments, businesses and environmentalists, and said, "Government cannot do it alone."
She said she would emphasize market-based incentives for protecting the environment, underscoring a Bush campaign theme. But she also said the agency would continue to enforce existing environmental rules.
"We will offer the carrot when appropriate and always preserve the stick of enforcement," Mrs. Whitman said.
She also emphasized that decisions in making environmental rules should always consider their effect on the economy.
"No longer do we debate about whether we need to protect our environment," Mrs. Whitman said. "Instead, we discuss how we can keep America green while keeping our economy growing."
Mrs. Whitman was asked how she would address a broad variety of environmental issues, including whether she would pursue a costly agency plan to remove PCB's from the Hudson River and how she might combat the flow of air pollution into the Northeast from Midwestern power plants.
She made no commitments on those issues except to say that she would review the agency's rules.

HEADLINE: OPEC Ratifies Oil Cutback; Iraq Remains a Puzzle 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: VIENNA, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
As ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ratified a decision today to reduce oil production by 5 percent, the biggest threat to the group's efforts to artfully balance supply and demand loomed from Iraq, one of its own.
 OPEC nations decided to lower the daily production target by 1.5 million barrels of crude oil a day beginning Feb. 1. The total output of the group, which produces about 40 percent of the world's oil, is expected to decline to 25.2 million barrels a day. 
 Those figures do not include Iraq's export quota -- which is set by the United Nations as part of the arrangement stemming from Persian Gulf war sanctions that followed the end of hostilities in 1991. Through much of the fall and winter, Iraq has withdrawn a significant share of its oil exports from world markets, in a campaign to undo or at least soften the sanctions. It is now pumping less than half its previous output of 2.3 million barrels a day. 
Analysts say that OPEC's move this week to reduce production has given Iraq great influence on world oil prices -- and consequently, on the broad economy. For Iraq, the bolstering of its influence comes at a propitious time, as George W. Bush, a son of the man who waged war against Baghdad, takes the helm of a shaky American economy and as more countries and international oil companies express the desire to see the sanctions lifted.
In Washington, a senior Pentagon official who will remain in office under the new administration said today that while President Saddam Hussein's actions had proved annoying, his previous efforts to disrupt the flow of oil had not significantly rattled the world oil markets.
Senior members of the incoming Bush team -- many of them veterans of gulf war policy decisions -- have criticized the Clinton administration for standing by while international pressure against Mr. Hussein has waned. But they have offered few specifics on how they intend to get tough on Iraq.
OPEC has wagered that it can shore up oil prices by reducing output, without further damaging the weakened economies of the United States and Asia. Many analysts agree that barring an unexpected shock, OPEC might just succeed in its effort to stabilize oil prices in the range of $22 to $28 a barrel. Yesterday, crude oil for February delivery fell more than 2 percent, to $29.60 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, as traders expressed relief that OPEC would not be making deeper cuts than the market had expected.
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who met with OPEC leaders in Europe and the Middle East over the weekend to urge restraint in reducing production, said in Washington today that he was disappointed with OPEC's action. "As both the United States and the European Union expressed, we remain concerned that any cut in production has the potential to lower stock levels and contribute to volatility in the market," Mr. Richardson said.
OPEC's new secretary general, Ali Rodriguez of Venezuela, said at a news conference here that the group's decision to reduce output was predicated on the assumption that Iraq would again increase its exports. Mr. Rodriguez said the Iraqi oil minister, Amir Muhammad Rashid, had assured him that Baghdad would be pumping 2 million to 2.3 million barrels a day by the end of the month.
But many analysts in Vienna were less optimistic. "OPEC believes that the Iraqis will reverse course and pump 2.3 million barrels a day," said Raad Alkadiri, country risk analyst with the Petroleum Finance Company, "and that is the most dangerous assumption OPEC is making. There is no guarantee, based on Iraq's political agenda to dismantle sanctions, that it will resume pumping two million barrels a day."
OPEC's announced plan to reduce output by 1.5 million barrels a day may actually result in a drop closer to a million barrels a day, because some members chronically exceed their official quotas. But if Iraq continues to withhold about a million barrels a day, the overall reduction in supply could send prices rocketing and weaken the American economy. 
"The thing to watch over the coming weeks is what Iraq will do -- how many tankers will leave the gulf with Iraqi oil," a member of a non-OPEC delegation in Vienna said.
If Iraq indeed keeps exports to a trickle, Saudi Arabia -- as the largest producer in OPEC and its de facto leader -- may feel compelled, as it has intermittently over the last year, to increase its own output to make up for the Iraqi supplies, industry analysts said. But the Saudis might be able to replace only part of the oil that Iraq took off the market. 
As OPEC tightens supplies and wild cards like Iraq come into play, analysts in Vienna predicted that world oil markets could be susceptible to the same volatility that prevailed last year, with relatively lofty prices occasionally spiking even higher, into a range around $35 a barrel. The risk of setting off such price increases is one that OPEC appears willing to take, regardless of potentially dire consequences for the world economy. 
"Last year is a good example of what we can have this year," Mr. Alkadiri said. "OPEC would rather deal with prices when they are $35 a barrel than $25 a barrel."

HEADLINE: Financial Problems in Government Are Rife, Nation's Top Auditor Says 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
The comptroller general of the United States, the nation's top auditor, said today that President-elect George W. Bush would inherit a government that is riddled with weak management, lacks many of the skills needed to run federal programs and cannot fully account for the use of taxpayers' money.
 The comptroller general, David M. Walker, found serious weaknesses in accounting and financial management throughout the government, from the Defense Department to the Internal Revenue Service, the Forest Service to the Federal Aviation Administration. 
 While politicians prepared for Inauguration Day festivities and for high-profile debates over tax cuts and education policy, federal investigators told Mr. Bush of problems festering below the surface of the government. 
The Pentagon's financial statements are in such poor condition that they cannot be audited, Mr. Walker said, and most other agencies do not comply with federal accounting standards. As a result, he said, he cannot certify the accuracy of consolidated financial statements for the government as a whole. Federal auditors have been complaining about this problem for several years.
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore often boast of "reinventing government," saying they have made it more efficient while reducing its size.
But the comptroller general, who is head of the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said federal agencies were poorly equipped to meet challenges of the 21st century because their employees lacked the necessary skills in information technology, science, economics and management.
Federal agencies "drastically reduced or froze their hiring efforts" in recent years, Mr. Walker said. "This helped reduce the number of employees, but it also reduced the influx of new people with new skills, new knowledge, new energy and new ideas -- the reservoir of future agency leaders and managers."
In a report to Mr. Bush and to Congress, the General Accounting Office described 22 "high-risk areas" in which it said the government was vulnerable to waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement. Eight of the 22 problems, including overpayments to military contractors and Medicare fraud, have been on the list since 1990, suggesting that they defy easy solution.
Today, for the first time, the accounting office said the government's failure to recruit and retain skilled employees was one of its biggest problems, severely impairing the ability of many agencies to perform their missions. Too often, the report concluded, the government has treated its employees as "costs to be cut rather than assets to be valued."
Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, the senior Republican on the Committee on Governmental Affairs, said, "The fact that the federal government does not adequately hire and retain the right people is a root cause" of the difficulties at many agencies.
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the ranking Democrat on the panel, said the problem could worsen because "more than one-third of government workers will be eligible for retirement in five years."
Mr. Walker said some reduction in the number of federal employees was justifiable, but he added: "The question is, How was it done? What type of strategic work-force planning took place in order to make sure that we achieved the short-term reductions in head count without mortgaging the future? For the most part, that was not done."
The armed services "face shortages among junior officers and problems in retaining intelligence analysts, computer programmers and pilots," the report said.
With many employees eligible for retirement, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has difficulty finding nuclear engineers to monitor the safety of atomic power plants. The Department of Veterans Affairs cannot find enough nurses or people to examine health claims. And the Immigration and Naturalization Service does not have enough intelligence experts to combat the problem of alien smuggling.
Likewise, the accounting office said, the loss of skilled employees at the nation's space agency may jeopardize safe operation of the space shuttle and could force cutbacks in the number of flights. And the federal Medicare agency does not have enough people with the skills needed to evaluate advances in medical technology.
The accounting office said five federal programs had been taken off the list of high-risk activities because they had made progress toward solving problems found by federal investigators.
The programs showing major improvements were the National Weather Service, which has bought $4.5 billion worth of equipment to improve its forecasts; the farm loan programs of the Agriculture Department, which has sharply reduced the number of delinquent borrowers, and the Superfund program, which cleans up abandoned hazardous waste sites. The year 2000 computer problem and the 2000 census were removed from the list because their deadlines had passed.
Federal auditors also found progress at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which received high marks for correcting problems in its community development programs.
But the new high-risk list still includes HUD programs to insure home mortgages and to subsidize rents for low-income families. In 1999, the accounting office said, the department paid $935 million in "excess subsidies" -- about 5 percent of all subsidy payments -- to tenants who underreported their income or did not report it at all.
In its report, the accounting office said these were some of the biggest problems facing Mr. Bush and the new Congress:
*The government erroneously pays billions of dollars a year to low-income families claiming earned-income tax credits. Some families falsify their income and Social Security numbers, overstate the number of children they have and use other schemes to obtain refunds to which they are not entitled.
*The Internal Revenue Service has failed to collect more than $100 billion in owed taxes. In the last three years, the government has radically reduced the number of cases in which it seized property to satisfy tax obligations. This may encourage taxpayers to understate their tax liabilities.
*The government's effort to update its air traffic control system has been plagued with cost overruns and delays. The Federal Aviation Administration has not followed standard practices in buying computer software for a vast network of radar and communications equipment.
*The Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare and Medicaid, has no reliable way to keep track of overpayments to doctors, hospitals and home health care agencies. So it cannot recover the money owed to the government.
Clinton administration officials say the Medicare agency is much improved. But the accounting office said, "The Health Care Financing Administration has a long way to go to achieve sound financial management."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Powell's Opening Statement to Foreign Relations Committee 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the opening remarks yesterday by Gen. Colin L. Powell, President-elect George W. Bush's choice for secretary of state, when he testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, as recorded by Federal News Service Inc.:
 These proceedings mark the 64th renewal of a long and honored tradition that began when the 26 members of the first United States Senate met to consider the nomination that was before them then, that of Thomas Jefferson of Virginia. When Jefferson took office in 1790, a cynical and tired Europe laughed in derision at the thought that "popular government," as it was called then, might work in even one country, much less the whole world. In fact, just a few decades ago, noted experts in academic journals wrote of the weakness and possible demise of democratic institutions in the face of rising dictatorial power of the kind we saw represented by the Soviet Union on the red side of the map. 
 Those articles were appearing at the very moment that Jefferson's ideas of liberty and self-government were about to prove another generation of cynics absolutely dead wrong, ideas that were going to, as Jefferson prayed, flow through time and spread their happy influence over the face of the earth as people behind the Iron Curtain and around the world threw off the yokes of totalitarianism. 
Jefferson's ideas and Jefferson's prayers were ahead of the time in which he lived, and ahead of the man himself. I have to pause in my admiration of Jefferson during this week of celebration of the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and reflect on how Dr. King helped to answer Jefferson's prayers for black Americans, whose forebears at that time were considered to be property, slaves, even in Jefferson's own custody. 
I am before you today as Jefferson's admiring successor, thankful for all the sacrifices that were made by Dr. King and so many others to make Jefferson's dream possible for people like me, a dream that I hope that will continue to inspire my fellow Americans and inspire people around the world, because there is still so much that needs to be done here at home and around the world to bring that universal Jeffersonian dream to the whole world. 
President-elect George W. Bush understands that dark shadows still linger over the edges of the American dream for so many. He intends to remove those shadows. He will be a president for all Americans, and he will be a leader who faithfully represents the ideas of freedom and justice to the entire world. . . .
And if confirmed, I promise that I will argue with you, I will debate with you, as I did in the past. But it will always be in the best spirit of cooperation, to make sure we get the right answer for the American people, and that we pursue the president's foreign policy as he has divined it from the will of the American people. 
We will need to work together well because we have a great challenge before us, but it is not a challenge of survival anymore; it is the challenge of leadership, for it is not a dark and dangerous ideological foe we confront, as we did for all those years, but now it is the overwhelming power of millions of people who have tasted freedom. It is our own incredible success, the success of the values that we hold dear, that has given us the challenges that we now face. . . .
The ideological "-isms" which challenged us for the last 50 years have all died away -- fascism, Naziism, Communism -- leaving only the dregs of abused and misused power in their wake. Yes, dictators remain, but they are relics of the past, and the "-isms" they practice can't destroy us, can't overthrow us, can't end our way of life the way the threat of the Soviet Union was able to do so. These regimes and these dictators can be dangerous, and they require our attention, but they can't hurdle the Atlantic in 30 minutes, the way I used to worry about Soviet forces doing just a few years ago. 
Democracy and free markets work, and the world knows it. And there is no finer example of this than America and her allies, who together comprise the strongest economies in the world, helping to reshape the entire world by -- willing to trade openly and encourage others to do likewise. 
And there should be no question in any world leader's mind that the first and most essential ingredient for success in this 21st century is a free people, and a government that derives its right to govern from the consent of such people. 
So a guiding principle of President-elect Bush's foreign policy will be that America stands ready to help any country that wishes to join the democratic world; any country that puts the law in place and begins to live by that rule, any country that seeks peace and prosperity and a place in the sun. In that light, there is no country on earth that is not touched by America, for we have become the motive force for freedom and democracy in the world. And there is no country in the world that does not touch us. We are a country of countries with a citizen in our ranks from every land. We are attached by a thousand cords to the world at large, to its teeming cities, to its remotest regions, to its oldest civilizations, to its newest cries for freedom. This means that we have an interest in every place on this earth; that we need to lead, to guide, to help in every country that has a desire to be free, open and prosperous.

HEADLINE: HUD Candidate Would Seek More Homes for Minorities 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
President-elect George W. Bush's choice for secretary of housing and urban development, Melquiades R. Martinez, told a Senate committee today that he would work to ensure that more minority families owned homes and would fight any effort to reduce the department's budget.
 "Despite record-high levels of homeownership, African-American and Hispanic-American homeownership rates remain below 50 percent," Mr. Martinez said. "That is not acceptable." 
 In a two-hour confirmation hearing, Mr. Martinez, the chairman of Orange County, Fla., persuaded Democrats and Republicans that his qualifications included not just public service in Florida, but also his personal history, beginning with his flight from Cuba as a teenager. He has become wealthy as a personal-injury lawyer.
"I came to America with a suitcase and the hope of a better life," Mr. Martinez said. "I know the value of homeownership because I have witnessed its great power throughout my entire life."
Nearly every senator cited this "compelling personal story" as one reason that Mr. Martinez will win easy confirmation. He would become the first Cuban-American to hold a cabinet post.
Mr. Martinez, 54, who also served as chairman of the Orlando Housing Authority and the Florida Growth Management Study Commission under Gov. Jeb Bush, assured the committee that he was not part of the wing of the Republican Party that had tried to abolish HUD.
"Far from being a caretaker, I intend to be a very active secretary," Mr. Martinez said, suggesting that the department's mandate should be expanded to include taking a leading role in managing the explosive urban growth brought on by the recent stretch of national prosperity. 
Pointing to a looming housing problem in rural areas as well as cities, Mr. Martinez said the number of poor people desperate for housing had grown while the number of affordable houses for sale had diminished. He also cited a growing need of housing for the elderly. 
"Unless we make sure that everyone is participating in this great economic expansion and until we ensure that barriers to home ownership are torn down for everyone," he said, "until then, our job is not done." 
Before his nomination, Mr. Martinez was best known for his public support of the Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez in their losing battle to keep Elian in Florida after his mother drowned while fleeing from Cuba across the Florida Straits. Later, Mr. Martinez was named one of eight co-chairmen of Mr. Bush's campaign in Florida.
Advocacy groups that had been wary of Mr. Martinez and his thin record on housing said today that they were not opposed to his confirmation and looked forward to working with him.
"We were encouraged that he understands the country is facing a serious problem that there is not enough affordable housing for low-income families," said Sheila Crowley, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. "He also understands the need for more affordable rental units."
Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, the Maryland Democrat who is the chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs until Saturday, when the Republicans take over, opened the hearing by announcing that the long-troubled housing agency had been removed from the government's "high-risk" category because of management changes under Andrew M. Cuomo, the departing secretary.
"You're inheriting a better HUD," Mr. Sarbanes said. "But it doesn't mean all the problems are solved."
In October, Congress approved a $32.4 billion budget for HUD, including a record $1 billion in new grants to help the estimated 200,000 homeless people nationwide. But Congress remains skeptical of the agency's ability to manage the complicated housing programs that were plagued with scandal in the 1980's.
Mr. Martinez said he would like to shift some of the more than 300 HUD programs to state and local governments, in part to cut out the red tape that bedeviled him as a local Florida official applying for HUD grants. 
Echoing Mr. Bush's campaign theme of compassionate conservatism, Mr. Martinez said he hoped to create partnerships with religious organizations and nonprofit groups to help solve housing problems. And once again, he pointed to his work in Florida as a model.
"When we needed after-school care for children," he said, "we didn't expand government programs but went into partnership with the Boys and Girls Clubs." 
He also pointed to Mr. Bush's plan to provide tax credits to financial institutions that help low-income families finance houses as a major initiative he will promote as secretary.

HEADLINE: TREASURY CHOICE VARIES FROM BUSH ON TAX OUTLOOK 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary-designate Paul H. O'Neill today struck a cautious note on tax cuts that departed from the position taken by President-elect George W. Bush, calling on Congress to reduce tax rates but expressing doubts that broad cuts would ignite the slowing economy.
 In his first public comments since Mr. Bush selected him to head the Treasury Department and serve as the leader of the new administration's economic team, Mr. O'Neill supported tax cuts with words that were noticeably less rousing than Mr. Bush's. He said he favored tax relief because he did not see the harm in lowering the tax burden while the government had big surpluses. 
 But in a three-hour confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Finance Committee, he did not spell out the benefits of tax cuts in any detail. The former Alcoa executive and Nixon and Ford administration budget expert also cast a shadow of doubt on Mr. Bush's contention that tax cuts are the right antidote to the looming economic downturn. 
He said the Federal Reserve, through its control of monetary policy, was the "first line of action" to fight a downturn and suggested that even cuts of the magnitude Mr. Bush has promised would likely have relatively little immediate impact on the nation's economy.
"I'm not going to make a huge case that this is the investment we need to make sure we don't go into a recession," Mr. O'Neill said. "But if we are going to do it anyway, then the sooner the better."
In a friendly but frank exchange on taxes with the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, who has urged immediate and sweeping tax reductions, Mr. O'Neill dismissed a cut in the capital gains tax, which Mr. Lott has favored, as likely to have minimal stimulatory effects on today's sluggish economy. 
Mr. O'Neill also praised the Clinton administration's record of fiscal discipline and economic stability as "wonderful." He said the Bush administration should aim to collect enough in taxes to pay for government operations each year without going into debt -- even when the economy barely expands.
"The tax system should be structured so that even with low or no growth, we are not borrowing from our children," Mr. O'Neill said.
That position differs in some respects from the view held by some supply-side economists, who steadfastly defend President Ronald Reagan's tax cuts of the early 1980's as having revolutionized the economy, even if they also contributed to giant budget deficits.
Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush's chief economic aide, is a leading proponent of Reagan-era tax cutting and the main architect of Mr. Bush's tax cut plan, which is estimated to cost $1.6 trillion over 10 years.
With Congress so closely divided between the two political parties, Mr. Bush may need every ounce of political support he can get on cutting taxes. Any sense that some senior officials within Mr. Bush's own camp view tax cuts as less urgent than Mr. Bush seems likely to play into the hands of Democrats, many of whom favor smaller reductions in tax rates.
Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, who headed the committee hearing today, and several other Democrats on the panel argued that while some tax cutting was called for, Mr. Bush's was so large that it threatened to turn projected surpluses into deficits when new spending was factored in. 
Several Democrats also argued that tax cuts would almost certainly kick in too late to make much difference in combating the current slowdown.
Mr. O'Neill said he was comfortable with estimates the Bush team had made that projected fiscal surpluses would cover the president-elect's spending plans, Social Security overhaul and tax cuts without creating new deficits. 
But if tax cuts sometimes seem like Mr. Bush's economic first love, Mr. O'Neill gave them more of an air kiss. The government has some extra money, he suggested several times, so why not return some to the people.
"It's desirable to have a situation in which we send it back when we don't need it," Mr. O'Neill said of government revenue, adding, "but we should be in balance even with a weak economy."
During the presidential campaign, Mr. Bush made the case that large-scale tax relief was vital despite the seemingly robust economy because it offered "insurance" against a future downturn.
More recently, amid signs that a slowdown has occurred, Mr. Bush has argued that tax cuts have become urgent because they are needed to rescue the economy from a potentially painful slump.
The statements by Mr. O'Neill do not necessarily signal a split within the Bush administration. Mr. O'Neill firmly echoed comments made by his boss when he made clear that Congress would receive tax-cutting legislation within weeks of Mr. Bush taking office. He also left open the possibility that the president-elect will decide to speed up some forms of tax relief to put money in people's pockets sooner.
But Mr. O'Neill does seem likely to let the Fed, run by his friend and former Ford administration colleague Alan Greenspan, take the lead in managing the ups and downs of the economy rather than seeking to have the administration try to influence economic fluctuations with the budget. He also seems more likely than some other members of Mr. Bush's team to argue the case for fiscal caution when the administration debates its economic plans.
His comments illustrate why some conservatives distrust Mr. O'Neill's economic instincts. As a budget official in the Nixon and Ford administrations, he developed a reputation as a pragmatic thinker on fiscal matters, inclined to run a lean and efficient government, but skeptical of ideological extremes.
As the chief executive of Alcoa, the leading aluminum manufacturer, he remained outspoken about public policy and did not always back consensus Republican positions. He fought strongly for deficit reduction during former President George Bush's term and offered crucial business support when Mr. Bush decided to raise taxes at that time, a deeply unpopular decision among conservatives.
Mr. O'Neill has also explored solutions to global warming. He once called for the government to slap a new tax on fuel to reduce energy use and raise new revenue. The latter position directly conflicts with that of the president-elect, and Mr. O'Neill has disavowed it.
His willingness to speak out on such topics has given him the label of maverick.
Mr. O'Neill also jested with senators about his tendencies toward outspokenness today.
During the discussion on taxes, which dominated the relatively breezy hearing, Mr. O'Neill provoked laughter when he said, "I'm thinking about whether I can still get away with being a maverick for a few more days." He quickly added, "I think I will be."
He then responded to a question about the impact of corporate tax cuts on investment, again displaying some skepticism.
"As a businessman I never made an investment decision based on the tax code," he said. "If you give money away I will take it, but good business people don't do things because of inducements."
No senator objected to Mr. O'Neill's qualifications to head the Treasury and his confirmation, expected as early as Saturday, seems assured.
Mr. O'Neill used the hearing to address some uncertainties about his leanings on other economic matters. Currency traders have speculated that his business background will make him more sympathetic to arguments that the dollar is overvalued against other currencies, possibly leading to a departure from the Clinton administration's steadfast strong dollar policy.
"I am in favor of a strong dollar," Mr. O'Neill said. "I can't imagine why anyone would think to the contrary."
Though Mr. O'Neill did not get into a protracted dispute with any of the senators, he seemed at times less willing to pander to their individual concerns than is typical during confirmation hearings.

HEADLINE: North Korea Leader Kicks the Tires in Shanghai 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
The North Korean leader, Kim Jong Il, today toured a Buick plant run in a venture with General Motors. 
 Apparently Mr. Kim, who also visited the city's stock exchange, is interested in seeing how economic reforms have reshaped this city since he last visited here in 1983. 
 China's prime minister, Zhu Rongji, flew in from Beijing to accompany the reclusive North Korean leader whose visit was kept so secret that few residents knew he was here.
At the General Motors plant, the Chinese president of the joint venture showed Mr. Kim around. 
Mr. Kim is a renowned lover of luxury automobiles, but few employees at the Buick plant were allowed to see him. . A group visiting from Thunderbird, the American Graduate School of International Management, in Arizona, was even trapped in a conference room at the Buick plant by the blanket of security that descended when Mr. Kim's entourage unexpectedly arrived. 
Mr. Kim also visited the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the most important of China's two stock exchanges in the city's gleaming financial district. But again, few other people at the exchange caught a glimpse of the North Korean leader or were even aware that he was there. China's 10-year-old stock markets, while still immature by Western standards, have played a key role in financing state-enterprise reform. 
In addition, Mr. Kim was reported to have visited China's most advanced semiconductor plant, a joint venture with NEC of Japan. 
Reporters scrambling around town for a sighting finally spotted Mr. Kim this evening leaving the Grand Theater after a private concert of Chinese folk songs and orchestra music. But the reporters were kept behind a fence about 25 yards away.
The consensus among analysts of North Korean politics and media pundits is that Mr. Kim, whose country's economy is in shambles after decades of Stalinist policies, is considering Chinese-style reform. Shanghai is the country's showcase of those reforms, which have been gradual and have been accompanied by tight political controls. 
Mr. Kim is expected to leave Thursday for Shenzhen, the special economic zone bordering Hong Kong where China's most aggressive economic reforms began.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
The nation should know where a Treasury nominee stands on world issues.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; This column appears here every Thursday. Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and a new collection of essays, "Unconventional Wisdom: Alternative Perspectives on the New Economy." Mr. Madrick, Virginia Postrel, Alan B. Krueger and Hal R. Varian rotate as contributors.

 BODY:
FEW of President-elect George W. Bush's cabinet choices have been as widely praised as Paul H. O'Neill, the candidate for Treasury secretary. Even organized labor has complimented Mr. O'Neill, formerly the respected chief executive of Alcoa.
 But the next Treasury secretary faces formidable problems, and the confirmation hearings yesterday only scratched the surface, with the senators largely concentrating on domestic issues. Mr. O'Neill, of course, says we can avert recession and manage a "soft landing" if we have a tax cut. But if the objective is to stimulate the economy, why propose a tax cut that would go largely to the wealthy, who would save, not spend, their newly found cash? 
 International issues, however, may well prove to be more urgent over the next four years, and so far the Bush team has shown a disturbing taste for insularity. In President Clinton's two terms, Robert E. Rubin and company had to deal with crises in Mexico and Asia, several in Russia, the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management and a world in which levels of poverty rose tragically and contributed to dangerous internal conflicts. During the Clinton administration, the trade deficit reached record levels yet again, and the dollar soared to unusually high levels -- both crises in waiting.
Here are some questions I wish that the senators had pursued more persistently and that Mr. O'Neill had answered more fully:
How long can the United States live with ever-higher trade deficits?
One damaging economic mantra of the last two decades has been that when America buys much more from abroad than it sells, it merely reflects the nation's economic strength. The problem is that the rising trade deficit also results in enormous borrowing, as foreigners must invest those dollars, usually by lending to America. Even the centrist Institute for International Economics now warns that this cannot go on forever. If investors lose confidence in American investments and sell the dollar aggressively, especially if the stock market continues to fall, America will find itself short of capital just as inflation is being fueled by rising import prices. It would make it hard to cut interest rates enough to stimulate a sagging economy.
Is the high dollar undermining our export industries?
The Wall Street point of view has so long dominated Washington policy-making that the nation has almost forgotten how damaging a high dollar can be to American industry. Wall Street liked the high dollar because it attracted investment from abroad. But it also raises the prices of the nation's exports, and discourages further investment in these industries. How do you reduce the trade deficit if you do not sufficiently invest in export industries? 
Wall Street is suspicious of Mr. O'Neill's basic-industry background, and he showed some sensitivity to market psychology when he announced at the outset of the hearings that he supported the Clinton administration's high-dollar policy. One can only hope he takes a more rounded view in practice.
If the American economy slows down, will economies in Asia and elsewhere be vulnerable again to financial crisis?
Everyone wants a soft landing here -- a slowdown in the rate of economic growth that stops short of recession. We are told that this would at last reduce the trade deficit, as Americans buy fewer imports. It would reduce inflationary pressures. It would enable the expansion to continue.
But analysts often talk as if America were in a vacuum. One serious consequence of an American slowdown would be a sharp drop in exports by the recovering Asian nations, whose finances are still generally shaky. Given America's high levels of debt, it is not so obvious that the nation will as easily withstand a repeat of 1997's crisis.
How would the Bush administration reform the world's financial architecture?
It is going on four years since the Asian financial crisis. Yet despite suggestions for reform from thinkers as diverse as Barry Eichengreen of the University of California at Berkeley; Joseph Stiglitz, formerly of the World Bank; and George Soros, the financier, almost no reforms have been started.
It is important to know more clearly what role Mr. O'Neill believes "hot money" had in the crisis. The flow of such short-term debt was encouraged by the aggressive loosening of controls demanded by the Clinton administration. Might Mr. O'Neill favor modest controls? Also, there are as yet no new provisions that require Western lenders to Asian investors to suffer the consequences of losses on those investments. This has led to a widely criticized "moral hazard," enabling rich institutional investors to make loans with little risk.
Will the Bush administration be concerned about growing competition from the euro?
The United States was able to attract capital from abroad to compensate for its low savings rate in part because investors worldwide believed the safest place for their money was the dollar. But if the euro, the single currency adopted by 12 European nations, gains credibility, it could well become a competing reserve currency. Contrary to some flippant American analyses, the euro has been a significant success abroad. All the more reason for America to put its finances in better balance.
Will the Bush administration attack worker abuses and environmental degradation abroad?
A case can be made that the World Trade Organization is not the place to demand ultimatums over worker rights and environmental standards, although some moderate conditions for trade make sense. But the carrot might work better than the stick, as the economist Jagdish Bhagwati of Columbia urges. We might, for example, be able to reward countries with financial benefits for improved working conditions. We might be able to use institutions like the International Labor Organization more effectively.
How seriously will the Bush Administration commit itself to reducing poverty around the world?
In my view, such a humanitarian objective is reward enough on its own and would only reinforce America's own values. But it is also good politics. Nothing is more important to peace in Kosovo, for example, than economic development. The same is generally true of South Asia and Africa. There is no better social policy than economic growth, but evidence is clear that social programs are also necessary to alleviate poverty. A sensitive hand at the Treasury concerning these matters would be helpful.
A confirmation hearing is not a traditional forum for complete frankness. But I would very much like to know that beyond paying simple lip service the Bush team is truly aware that domestic and international economic concerns are inseparable. In today's world, insularity would only backfire.

HEADLINE: Clinton Spends a Day Back in Arkansas, Where It All Started 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Jan. 17 

 BODY:
Returning to the city where his political career began a quarter-century ago, President Clinton told Arkansans today that he had never forgot his roots as a "little boy on South Hervey Street" even as he rose to the highest office in the land.
 It was the final out-of-town trip of the Clinton presidency, and Mr. Clinton said there was no more fitting place for such a symbolic journey than the state capital where he presided as governor for nearly five terms and where, one fall day in 1991, he announced his bid for the presidency on the white-columned portico of the Old Statehouse. 
 This afternoon, the president stepped onto the rostrum of the House chamber -- where he appeared regularly as a new governor with his eye on an even bigger prize -- and spoke for nearly an hour of the long journey he had traveled and the many challenges that would outlast his presidency. 
"I will leave office at noon on the 20th, amazingly grateful that somehow the mystery of this great democracy gave me the chance to go from a little boy on South Hervey Street in Hope, Ark., to the White House," he said.
While the trip was heavy with nostalgia, there was a bit of fence-mending on the agenda as well. The president, addressing a joint session of the Legislature, sought to quell hometown critics who have complained that he had turned his back on Arkansas when he headed east.
Mr. Clinton said he had appointed 460 Arkansans to positions in his administration over the last eight years, including aides and cabinet secretaries. He also recited the multiple helpings of pork he had delivered his home state this year alone, including $38 million for water projects, $592 million in highway money and more money to rebuild the bridges spanning the Great River and State Highway 82.
Although Mr. Clinton has new residences in New York and Washington, he made clear today that he would continue to return regularly to Arkansas, where his presidential library, complete with a presidential apartment, will be built.
"I call him our home boy," said State Senator William Walker Jr., who was a young representative in Mr. Clinton's days as governor. "We're happy to share him with D.C. and New York."
Mr. Clinton was in a reflective mood today as the days of his presidency dwindled to a precious few.
"For all the storms and all the sunshine, there has never been a day -- and tonight will be the same when I get home -- that I haven't landed on that helicopter on the back of the White House lawn and not felt a thrill, not felt like a 17-year-old boy visiting the White House for the first time," Mr. Clinton said. "And when I walk out of the White House for the last time and I sit at the inauguration of my successor, and I leave this office, I will leave more idealistic and more hopeful about my country than the day I took the oath of office, and that's how you ought to feel."
He invited some high school classmates aboard Air Force One on the flight from Washington and recounted how he had recently reread his first inaugural speech as governor, which he delivered in 1979.
Although on the ground for only about five hours, Mr. Clinton packed his schedule tight. He shook every hand extended to him in the Capitol and met privately with legislative leaders in his old offices, where he used to keep an Arkansas-made fiddle on the mantelpiece and portraits of Lincoln and Churchill on the walls.
Later, he visited a sick friend in the hospital and held a rally at the airport for several hundred backers. On the flight home, the last of almost 500 flights over the course of his presidency, Mr. Clinton invited a group of journalists who had covered his 1992 campaign to join him for dinner and reminisce about the last eight years.
In his remarks today, Mr. Clinton mentioned the recent election controversy between Vice President Gore and President-elect Bush but he did not repeat the assertion he made last week that Republicans had achieved victory only by unfairly stopping the count.
Today, he urged lawmakers in Arkansas and other states to work to ensure that their ballot-counting methods were sound and that no such disputes over punch-card systems occurred in the future.
"I personally think that the pencil system I use on my absentee ballot here from Pulaski County is a lot better, a lot less subject to messing up, and can also be counted by machine, so it can be counted more quickly," the president said.
Arkansas played a critical role in refining Mr. Clinton's political philosophy as well as his political combat skills.
He lost his first congressional bid in 1974. Two years later, he became attorney general and then, in 1978, the youngest governor in the country. Voters ousted him in 1980, sending the ambitious young man home to lick his wounds. But Mr. Clinton clawed his way back to the state house two years later. He was re-elected in 1984, and again, for four-year terms, in 1986 and 1990.
"Everything that I have been able to do as president is, in no small measure, a result of the life I lived and the jobs I had in Arkansas," he said today before leaving Little Rock. "My conviction that politics requires a vision and a strategy based on sound ideas and a belief that you can make a difference -- from education reform to economic policy to welfare reform and health care to building one America -- those things were formed here."

HEADLINE: Washington's Guessing Game 

 BODY:
Official Washington seems a little confused these days. President Clinton's long goodbye and President-elect George W. Bush's truncated transition seem to have dampened the anticipatory mood that usually grips the capital before an inauguration. Perhaps things will perk up a bit now that Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, are in town. A city that loves its history will also be glad to see former President George H. W. Bush. As the younger Mr. Bush remarked, this inauguration will be the first since 1961 in which a father has watched his son take the oath. It will also be, of course, just the second time in the nation's history that the son of a former president has achieved the same office.
 But history is not the only thing that matters to Washington. There is also the forward-looking local sport of sizing up the new leader. On that score, a subdued puzzlement reigns on Capitol Hill. Not since Ronald Reagan's advent in 1981 has there been deeper curiosity over how a new chief executive will govern and what he really wants. And it does not take a lot of snooping around to discover that Republicans and Democrats alike are beginning to suspect that President-elect Bush is far more conservative than either side suspected during the campaign. 
 Based on his cabinet appointments, his advocacy of a big, regressive tax cut and his initial statements on foreign relations, the president-elect now stands closer ideologically to Mr. Reagan than to his own father. For example, Congressional Democrats are being told that Mr. Bush does not like the idea of making his $1.6 trillion tax cut fairer by aiming it at payroll taxes that workers pay. Such targeting would give a much quicker boost to the flagging consumer economy than income tax reductions that will take two or more years to take effect. But Mr. Bush seems instinctively drawn to the classic conservative agenda of trimming high marginal rates, capital gains and estate taxes.
If Mr. Bush does turn out to be as aggressive as he now appears on, say, limiting federal support for abortion rights, building a missile defense system and giving the extractive industries wider access to federal lands, several questions will arise. Did the news media and his debate opponents interrogate him with sufficient energy on his core ideology? Did Mr. Bush knowingly disguise himself as a standard-issue suburban moderate, or did he simply luck into having John McCain line up on his left and Steve Forbes on his right during the Republican primaries? Democrats on Capitol Hill are beginning to consider another theory. In this view, Mr. Bush really did start out as a moderate, but has leapt to the right because his advisers have concluded that the closeness of the election was due to his failure to bond with the most zealous part of the G.O.P. base.
Perhaps this is a good time to remember that a new president sometimes takes a while to discover, or invent, his essential governing persona. Part of the excitement of the Clinton years lay in watching Mr. Clinton define exactly what third-way Democratic politics amounted to. In the campaign, Mr. Bush's speeches stirred the expectation that he wanted to invent a new, distinctive kind of Republicanism, consistent with the party's past but capable of really delivering on the kinder, gentler part of his father's vision.
Yesterday, in a farewell speech in Texas, Mr. Bush returned to the inclusive language of respect and cooperation. He is expected to repeat those themes in his inaugural address. But words alone cannot solve the policy puzzle being played out in the nation's capital, because so far, the message beamed from Austin to Washington has been stark and familiar.

HEADLINE: Norton Hearings to Pose Test for Bush's Plan to Change Policies on Use of Public Lands 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
The public hearings that begin on Thursday into Gale A. Norton's selection as interior secretary loom as an important test of the big shifts in public-lands policy that President-elect George W. Bush has signaled will be a priority once he takes office.
 Of all Mr. Bush's views, his support for oil drilling in an Alaska wildlife refuge, a position shared by Ms. Norton, and the likelihood that he will rein in President Clinton's land-protection actions have struck some of the hottest buttons on Capitol Hill, and hearings before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources may serve to show how deep the opposition might be. 
 Not a single senator, Democrat or Republican, has announced an intention to vote against Ms. Norton. Republican senators have expressed strong support, even those who, like Senator Robert C. Smith of New Hampshire, oppose the plan to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, among other differences.
But in a sign of possible opposition, a number of Democrats, including Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, have likened Ms. Norton to her onetime mentor, James Watt, a Reagan administration interior secretary. 
After a time in which major environmental groups have influenced administration policy making, Ms. Norton, a former attorney general of Colorado, would bring to the post instead a long affiliation with conservative groups that have been supported in large part by the industries most interested in opening more federal lands to development.
These groups include the Political Economy Research Center of Bozeman, Mont., where Ms. Norton was once a fellow; the Mountain States Legal Foundation of Denver, where she began her political career and with which she has worked closely even recently; and the Washington-based Defenders of Property Rights, where she served until early this month on the board of advisers.
Senators are likely to question Ms. Norton closely on her views, past and current, about some of those groups' legal challenges to laws that she would be required to enforce if she wins Senate confirmation.
As Colorado's attorney general, Ms. Norton refused to defend the state against a challenge to a minority set-aside rule that she opposed. That action has prompted questions about whether as interior secretary she would wholeheartedly enforce the Endangered Species Act and other laws she has opposed in the past.
In trying to block her confirmation, opponents including 18 environmental groups have waged an advertising and letter-writing campaign denouncing her as "an anti-environmental extremist." Ms. Norton's appearance at the hearings will be her first since she joined Mr. Bush on Dec. 29 when he announced her selection for a post that she described as carrying an "awesome responsibility." In that appearance, Ms. Norton, 46, described herself as an avid hiker and skier with a special fondness for the "beautiful and special places," and that is an image her supporters have sought to reinforce in response to the campaign against her.
A letter to "fellow Republicans" from Jim Nicholson, the party chief, described Ms. Norton as a "strong environmentalist" who had "worked for more than 20 years in a balanced way on environmental and land issues." And in a television appearance over the weekend, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said, "Most of us who represent states out in Middle America think that her views are very moderate and appropriate." Ms. Norton's critics have acknowledged that they have an uphill battle in their effort to block her confirmation.
But until Mr. Bush takes office on Saturday, the committee carrying out the hearings on Ms. Norton will be headed by a Democrat, Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, and he has promised that Ms. Norton would face "tough questions." Senator Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska, the Republican who will take charge of the panel after Saturday, has been a longtime champion of opening more land in his state and others to oil drilling, and he has been an enthusiastic supporter of Ms. Norton.
As the designee for interior secretary, Ms. Norton has already echoed Mr. Bush's vow to open parts of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil exploration, a position that would seek to overturn more than 15 years of policy and for which the president-elect said last weekend he expected her to "come under fire." She is also expected to use the hearings to back Mr. Bush's announced plans for a swift review and possible reversal of some of Mr. Clinton's most ambitious initiatives putting vast tracts of public lands off limits to development. "There's going to be some property in these giant chunks of land that we can use and not damage the environment," Mr. Bush said in a recent interview.
It would be unusual for senators to oppose Ms. Norton simply because of her support for Mr. Bush's policies. But she is likely to be held to a stricter standard for some of her other stances, particularly a long record of defense for property rights that she said in a 1991 speech might even extend to a "right to pollute."
The context of that statement made clear that Ms. Norton was not suggesting that polluters be given carte blanche, but making the case instead that the government should compensate property owners who were required to heed environmental laws.

HEADLINE: AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Safety; 
2 Views on the Rate Of Black Fatalities

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IN the endless campaign to increase seat belt use, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Ad Council are about to roll out a television commercial aimed at African-Americans.
 Public safety ads directed to a particular group are unusual. But government officials think the campaign makes sense because surveys show that African-Americans are less likely than other car occupants to buckle up, and they have a higher death rate than whites in vehicle crashes. 
 The advertisement, produced by the Leo Burnett agency, is mostly filled with familiar images from the civil rights struggle and photos depicting moments of black achievement, with the subject matter becoming apparent only at the very end. 
The new effort has not received a universal welcome. A safety analyst is offering a reinterpretation of the problem: African-Americans are more likely to die in crashes, he says, because they are more likely to be pedestrian victims, a problem that a seat belt campaign will do nothing to address.
The analyst, Charles Komanoff, agreed that blacks were less likely to wear seat belts. But he added: "Even though blacks are engaging in more risky behavior inside cars, they're not inside cars as much. Black people don't spend as many hours driving around as white people do; it's the economics, the demographics and where they live."
Mr. Komanoff, who is an advocate for pedestrians, bicyclists and public transportation, assumed that if everyone wore belts, the risk of death would fall by half. Using figures from the Centers for Disease Control for 1997, he counted the number of pedestrians and cyclists aged 14 and under struck and killed by vehicles, compared with those who died in cars while unbelted.
The number of pedestrians and bike riders was 2.5 times as high, he said, and for black children, it was 3 times as high. "This suggests that efforts to reduce childhood mortality from motor vehicles should focus on changing driver behavior on streets and in neighborhoods where children are present, rather than on stiffening or enforcing laws requiring seat belt use," he said.
According to his analysis of the Centers for Disease Control figures, among blacks there are 16.45 fatalities a year per 100,000 people, compared with 15.87 among whites. For those actually inside vehicles, the figures were 8.79 for blacks and 9.37 for whites; the overall figures are higher for blacks because their death rate as pedestrians was higher: 3.25 per 100,000 people, compared with 2.05 for whites.
The number of pedestrian deaths, like the number of highway deaths in general, has declined, to about 4,700 in 1999 from 5,300 in 1997. Pedestrian deaths are mostly a local concern; the Transportation Department puts more emphasis on drunken driving, seat belt use and vehicles' safety flaws.
As with advertising for any product or cause, the challenge in seat belt ads is to keep the appeal fresh. The Ad Council, a public service organization established by the advertising industry, has tried to do this by varying the message over the years. In 1985, the Ad Council introduced Vince and Larry, also created by Leo Burnett, who clowned their way through countless crashes. They were so popular that they spawned a line of children's crash-dummy toys.
But in January 1999, the Transportation Department decided that the humor was not effective and pulled the campaign in favor of a harder line. The Ad Council introduced two "shock" ads, which started out soft but ended in heart-stopping crashes.
In one, a husband makes a midnight run to buy ice cream for his pregnant wife, but is hit by a car as he leaves their driveway. In another, two carloads of teenagers giggle and wave until the boys' sedan is struck by a speeding van. (The old ads and the new one, plus a Volvo video called "Clive Alive," can be viewed at www.nytimes.com/autos.)
The new 30-second ad will start turning up next month as a public service announcement. Using black-and-white photos, it is meant to evoke African-American progress: the first shot is of a man drinking from a water fountain marked "Colored," followed by pictures of the police turning dogs on demonstrators, Rosa Parks sitting defiantly at the front of a bus, Martin Luther King, Jackie Robinson and Colin Powell.
But then there is a screech of brakes, a crash, and a screen that says, "Car crashes are the second-leading cause of death among young African-Americans." The final screen is the familiar "Buckle up."
Peggy Conlon, president of the Ad Council, said her organization had produced some Spanish radio ads to promote seat belt use, but that most such campaigns were not aimed at a particular ethnic group.
The Transportation Department said it was making progress in increasing seat-belt use in general, with about 71 percent buckled in 1999. Blacks are catching up; their rate of use lagged whites' by 10 percentage points in 1996, but is now only 4 points behind, the department said last month when it released a report by independent experts.
But statistics point to a different dimension of the picture. Among whites under 21 who died in crashes, 86.5 percent were in vehicles and 10 percent were pedestrians. (The rest were cyclists or their status was unknown.) Among blacks, only 77 percent were in cars; 18.7 percent were pedestrians.
A spokesman for the traffic safety administration, Tim Hurd, said this was no reason to slack off on persuading more African-Americans to buckle up.
But Mr. Komanoff argued that the focus was wrong, and disputed the premise of the Transportation Department's recent report, that lower use of seat belts constituted a public health crisis. "If it is," he said, "then there's a public health crisis that's twice as big and twice as important -- that blacks are being killed walking or cycling."
Pedestrian deaths could be reduced by redesigning streets to favor pedestrians, he said, and by changing drivers' habits. Persuading people to drive better would benefit both pedestrians and the people inside cars.

HEADLINE: A Felon Seeks Vindication: Will Milken Be Pardoned? 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
MICHAEL R. MILKEN is proud and unrepentant.
 With the Clinton administration down to its final hours, an unanswered question is whether Mr. Milken, the one-time king of junk bonds, will get the pardon he has requested, and with it a claim to vindication. 
 Mr. Milken has cut a wide swath since he left prison in 1993. Until the Securities and Exchange Commission stopped him, he helped arrange some big corporate deals, using the network of friends he had built up when he was the most powerful investment banker in America. 
His Milken Institute organizes conferences in which he sits around talking with panels of Nobel laureates in economics, trading ideas about how to improve the world. He gives away lots of money and always has an entourage. His Web site features pictures of him with Jimmy Carter, Tipper Gore, Mark McGwire, Jesse Jackson, Colin Powell, Kofi Annan, Gray Davis, Arnold Palmer and Ted Turner.
It has been long enough since Mr. Milken's fall from power to evaluate his career. He was a brilliant financier who popularized high-yield financing and came to control the junk bond market in the mid- to late 1980's. Some companies that he financed made good use of the money; others did not. A case can be made that the fear of hostile takeovers he put into executive suites helped make American business more competitive. Some savings and loan institutions suffered from the bonds Mr. Milken sold, but he was not responsible for the crisis in that sector.
Like most people who know Mr. Milken, I like him. He is smart and engaging. At 54, he has more to contribute to society, and I wish him well. But so far as I know, he has never faced up to the reality of the way he abused his power.
Mr. Milken declined to be interviewed, but his spokesman referred me to his Web site, www.mikemilken.com. It is quite a site. On it you will learn of his "legal dispute with government regulators," in which "intense pressure on him and his family" led him to "admit conduct that resulted primarily in violations of securities regulations that had not been prosecuted as crimes before." His prosecution was a "vengeful response by America's business and regulatory establishment." Notwithstanding erroneous press reports, "he had no involvement in insider trading."
That is historical revisionism at its most impressive. The S.E.C. charged him with numerous violations of insider trading laws in concert with Ivan Boesky, the disgraced former takeover stock speculator. It accused him of conspiring with Mr. Boesky to defraud clients of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the brokerage firm Mr. Milken dominated.
Mr. Milken avoided pleading to those charges, but he did admit market manipulation of a type that was clearly illegal. "This is," said David S. Ruder, a professor of securities law at Northwestern who was S.E.C. chairman at the time the charges were filed, "an array of illegal conduct that is unparalleled in the history of the federal securities laws." He added that the S.E.C. had a lot of corroboration on the insider trading charges, including testimony from Mr. Milken's colleagues at Drexel.
"If Milken can do what he did to the securities markets, and then be pardoned for it, the integrity of the markets is clearly in jeopardy," Mr. Ruder said.
Innocence should not be a prerequisite for a pardon. But in cases of serious crimes where guilt was clear, contrition should be. If Mr. Milken gets his pardon, he will no doubt view it as an exoneration. For those who believe in respect for the securities laws, it will be a sad moment.

HEADLINE: Publisher Is Named at The New Yorker 

 BODY:
David L. Kahn, the associate publisher of The New Yorker, was named publisher of the magazine yesterday, said Steve T. Florio, the chief executive of Conde Nast, a subsidiary of Advance Publications. 
 Mr. 
Kahn, 39, succeeds David Carey, who resigned this week to become the chief executive of the newly formed Business Information Group at Gruner & Jahr, overseeing Fast Company and Inc. magazines. 
 Mr. Kahn has been associate publisher of The New Yorker since May 1999, when he came to the magazine from Saveur, where he had been the publisher. As associate publisher at The New Yorker, he oversaw advertising sales in the United States.
"The magazine has been high and it's been low, and we're entering a golden age for The New Yorker," Mr. Kahn said. "Our work, as David Remnick and I have recognized, is just beginning." Mr. Remnick is the magazine's editor.
Mr. Kahn said the recent downturns in the advertising market in the magazine industry were not a cause for alarm for The New Yorker. 
"We keep our finger on the pulse of the advertising economy as well as the general economy," he said. "What The New Yorker has is, if you will, an insurance policy in that we have a very broad-based business, categorically speaking. I think the trend for the magazine itself will outweigh any downswing in the economy."

I.B.M. Rally Drives Nasdaq To Best Close in 5 Weeks

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks soared higher yesterday as a rosy earnings forecast from I.B.M. propelled the Nasdaq market to a five-week high.
 The upbeat sentiment on Wall Street was also bolstered by fresh evidence that the economy was rapidly running out of steam, which heightened speculation the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates even further to bolster business activity. 
 The Nasdaq composite index blazed to its best finish since Dec. 13 as the I.B.M. cheer spread to other high-technology companies. The Nasdaq ended up 85.71 points, or 3.19 percent, to 2,768.49. 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 93.94 points, or 0.89 percent, to 10,678.28. The rally by I.B.M. -- up $11.63, to $108.31, to its highest close since mid-October -- made up about three-quarters of the Dow's gain. That offset a loss by Caterpillar, another Dow component, which fell after it forecast a 5 percent to 8 percent drop in profits for 2001.
The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 18.50 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,347.97.
For the second consecutive trading session, Intel was the Nasdaq's most heavily traded share, gaining $1.69, to $32.19, even though earlier in the week it offered a poor sales outlook and its quarterly earnings just squeaked past Wall Street's forecasts.
"The market seems to be saying it has already factored in the bad news," said Michael Farr, president of Farr, Miller & Washington, a Washington-based fund that manages $379 million. "This trend may have just turned in the past few days -- for the short term." 
Underpinning the market were growing hopes the Fed would come to the economy's rescue with more aggressive interest rate cuts after a key business conditions index dropped sharply, analysts said.
The manufacturing sector in the mid-Atlantic region contracted in January to its most dismal level in more than a decade, the regional Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said yesterday.
"People are willing to look over the lack-of-earnings valley because of the Fed," said Paul Cherney, an analyst at S.& P. MarketScope. "The Fed has bolstered confidence that we will pull through this."
The central bank's next policy-setting meeting is scheduled for Jan. 30-31, less than two weeks away. It is widely expected to lower its key fed funds rate by at least a quarter- point. Earlier this month, the Fed surprised financial markets with a hefty half-point cut.
Apple Computer, which reported its first loss in three years, but beat lowered expectations and said it would return to profitability soon, climbed $1.88, to $18.69.
Caterpillar, the giant maker of construction and mining equipment, fell $2.91, to $41.75. It posted strong profits for the latest quarter but forecast a drop in earnings for 2001, citing slowing sales in North America and price competition from rivals.
Boeing, the aerospace giant and Dow component, fell $1.38, to $57.38, after Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown cut its near-term rating on the stock because of an expected growth slowdown in the airline industry.
 --------------------

Treasury Prices Rise
 (By Reuters) -- Treasury bond prices surged again yesterday after a report showing a sharp decline in business conditions in the mid-Atlantic region helped build hopes the Fed would move aggressively to cut interest rates in coming months.
The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its January business conditions index slumped to minus36.8 in January from minus 4.2 in December. The index, which dropped to its lowest level since December 1990, was far lower than the minus 8.2 economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast.
The data overshadowed earlier jobs and housing starts data that had been slightly more robust than the market had expected, causing government bond prices to dip initially.
The benchmark 10-year note rose 15/32, to 104 27/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.10 percent from 5.16.
The most active 30-year bond rose 21/32, to 111 8/32, as its yield fell to 5.47 percent from 5.52.

HEADLINE: December Rise Ends Down Year for Home Building 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Residential construction edged up in December with a surge in new single-family home projects, the government said today, but for all of 2000, housing starts reached their lowest level since 1997.
 The unexpected 0.3 percent gain in new housing projects in December, to a seasonally adjusted 1.575 million units, was bolstered mostly by a 6 percent rise in groundbreaking for single-family homes, the Commerce Department said. Analysts had been expecting a 3.3 percent decline in housing starts. Building permits fell 6.6 percent in December, attributed in part to the cold weather that affected much of the nation. 
 "We are getting a huge lift in this industry from dropping interest rates," said James Glassman, an economist with Chase Securities.
Economists say the gain in starts, coupled with an upward revision to the November number, was a sign that the number of new housing projects had stabilized after a downward trend in the first half of 2000.
"This should provide more ammunition in the case that the economy is having a soft landing," said Paul Christopher, economist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
That relatively upbeat news was followed by a bleak report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showing that the manufacturing sector in the mid-Atlantic region contracted sharply in January, turning in its worst performance in more than a decade.
For the year, housing starts fell 4.4 percent, to 1.59 million units.
A separate government report today showed that the number of newly unemployed workers plunged an unexpectedly steep 37,000 last week, to its lowest level in more than three months.
But analysts have warned against reading too much into the weekly figures for unemployment claims, saying distortions from the harsh weather and the holiday season would mar the true picture of the labor market, which had been exceedingly tight throughout 1999 and for about the first 10 months of 2000.

HEADLINE: Officials Call Economy Down, But Not Out, in the Philippines 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: MANILA, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
As tens of thousands of anti-government protesters choked the streets of this city's business district for a third day, three top advisers to President Joseph Estrada acknowledged that the political turmoil was damaging the economy of the Philippines.
 But they said that the collapse of Mr. Estrada's impeachment trial on Tuesday would not propel the country into a recession, though it could mean several more months of political uncertainty and social unrest. 
 "We've gone over and over the numbers, and in the worst-case scenario, we'll still have 2 percent growth," said Jose T. Pardo, the finance secretary. 
That is half the rate of growth that the Philippines recorded last year, and it would put the country behind almost all its Asian neighbors. Still, it is a positive statistic, and Mr. Estrada's aides said it would be no small feat for a country consumed by the legal travails of its leader, who was being tried on corruption charges.
"The year 2000 was one of the worst in our history," said Edgardo Angara, executive secretary to Mr. Estrada. "The whole year was a series of disasters, natural and man-made. Coming out of that horror, it's quite respectable."
Business leaders are more pessimistic, noting that the crisis has scared away foreign investors, caused local companies to cancel expansion plans, and prompted wealthy Filipinos to move their money offshore. That in turn has drained the Philippine peso and the stock market. After plunging 6 percent on Wednesday, shares fell another 1.4 percent today, and the peso traded near its all-time low of 55 pesos to the United States dollar.
"The economy is falling faster and more unpredictably than anybody could have imagined," said Guillermo M. Luz, the executive director of the Makati Business Club, which represents some of the biggest Philippine companies. "I would not discount the possibility of a recession," he said. 
With Mr. Estrada's impeachment trial suspended indefinitely and with him showing every sign of digging in, business people worry that the Philippines will be rudderless for the next six months. 
The Makati Business Club has demanded that Mr. Estrada resign even before his fate is decided in the Senate. The president is accused of taking more than $10 million in kickbacks from illegal gambling and from tobacco taxes. He has denied the allegations and says he will leave only if convicted. That prospect became much less likely on Tuesday, after the Senate voted to exclude potentially damaging evidence against Mr. Estrada. Prosecutors from the House resigned in protest, and the trial was halted.
Senator Franklin M. Drilon, who voted to allow the evidence, said he did not believe the trial would resume until July, after legislative elections. A new Senate, with fewer of Mr. Estrada's allies, might yet convict him, Senator Drilon said. But by then the damage to the economy would be done. 
Mr. Estrada's advisers said the impeachment trial could resume as early as next week if the House appointed new prosecutors. One of the prosecutors who resigned, Joker Arroyo, hinted today that the old team might return if Mr. Estrada agreed to testify, something he has resisted. 
The advisers said most foreign investors were steering clear of the Philippines until it resolved the president's case as well as a stock-manipulation case involving one of Mr. Estrada's friends.
"Clearly, we have to win back the confidence of portfolio investors," said Rafael Buenaventura, the governor of the Philippine Central Bank. "Maybe they'll start coming back now that the Nasdaq has cooled off in the United States."
Mr. Buenaventura said he was less concerned about the peso, which on Wednesday suffered its biggest one-day drop since July 1997. He said it was "emotionally driven," and not worth fighting with the usual remedy of higher interest rates.
Mr. Buenaventura said he was optimistic that the peso had stabilized at 55 pesos to the dollar. Once the crisis subsided, he said, it would bounce back to what he called its proper level: 47 pesos to the dollar.
Given the furies swirling around them, Mr. Estrada's advisers seem remarkably calm.

HEADLINE: Nortel Reports Solid Quarterly Earnings 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Nortel Networks, the largest maker of fiber optic equipment, reported strong growth in earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter yesterday, but warned that tight financing for communications companies might cause sales to reach only the low end of estimates in the months ahead.
 Nortel said net earnings, excluding costs from acquisitions, were $825 million in the quarter, or 26 cents a share, matching estimates of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. Including acquisition costs, Nortel had a net loss of $1.41 billion, or 46 cents a share. 
 The company's revenue of $8.82 billion in the fourth quarter, a 34 percent increase from the year-earlier period, narrowly beat a First Call estimate of $8.65 billion. Robust sales of fiber optic equipment fueled much of the growth of revenue and earnings at Nortel, which is based in Brampton, Ontario.
But concern over the effect of a slowing economy on the communications industry led Nortel to caution investors that revenue and earnings should grow 30 percent this year, compared with previous estimates of 30 to 35 percent. Expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates if the economy deteriorates encouraged it to maintain relatively aggressive estimates, the company said.
"The slowing economy presents its challenges, but Nortel is still in a solid position to sell to big clients that haven't been hit by the negative financing climate," said Eric Allard, director of research at Smith & Thomas Asset Management.
Signs of strain at some of the small, relatively young communications companies formed to compete with big local and long-distance phone companies have been a major source of concern. Still, Nortel appears to be weathering the changes in the communications industry better than Lucent Technologies, one if its main rivals, which has recently struggled with slower revenue and earnings growth.
"A lot of our customers are looking closer at who they think will be in a stronger position in a couple of years when doing big equipment purchases," John Roth, Nortel's chief executive, said in a telephone interview. Asked if he was making a statement about the fortunes of Lucent, Mr. Roth replied: "The long-term prospects of suppliers are becoming much more important." 
Nortel's stock climbed $1.94, to $36.69 yesterday, and rose as high as $38 in after-hours trading after its earnings were released, amid a wider rally in shares of communications equipment companies.
Even so, industry followers say nimble new competitors are waiting in the wings.
"The explosion of venture capital investment in new fiber optic companies is bringing some potential competitors to fruition," said John Simpson, a portfolio manager at Oeschle International Advisors in Boston.
Mr. Simpson cited ONI Systems, a maker of fiber optic equipment that went public last May, as one company that Nortel needs to watch out for. Shares in ONI, which is based in San Jose, Calif., rose $3.94, to $42.

HEADLINE: Troubled Nonprofit Group Gives Up Management Duties 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
The Banana Kelly Community Improvement Association, a once-vaunted but more recently troubled nonprofit organization in the Bronx, has announced that another non-profit, Promesa Enterprises, will take over day-to-day management of about 27 of its buildings, its social service operations and its finances.
 Separately, 14 of Banana Kelly's other buildings, which it owns in partnership with the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a national nonprofit organization, are being turned over to another outside manager. 
 Banana Kelly, established in 1978 when the Bronx was being decimated by arson and abandonment, was once praised as a national model for residents trying to restore housing and their neighborhoods. But in recent years, it has been criticized for financial mismanagement and the deteriorating conditions of its buildings. 
Promesa, an acronym for Puerto Rican Organization to Motivate, Enlighten and Serve Addicts, was founded as a drug rehabilitation program. Over the years, it, too, expanded into housing and other services, and it also has a troubled past.
In 1992, Promesa's chief financial officer was murdered after discovering discrepancies during an audit, and another employee was convicted of hiring two teenagers to kill her. The teenagers were also convicted. A subsequent city investigation of the organization's finances found that tens of thousands of dollars were missing.
But Promesa's chief executive officer since 1996, Ruben Medina, has been credited with restoring its reputation. Promesa reimbursed the city for the missing money and is now a $30 million corporation with about 400 employees. On Wednesday, Representative Jose E. Serrano announced a $2 million grant to Promesa for economic development.
Under the agreement with Promesa, Mr. Medina will become Banana Kelly's acting administrator. Yolanda Rivera, Banana Kelly's board chairwoman since 1985, will remain in that role and also assume the role of president, according to a news release. Since 1991, she has served at various points as president, chief executive officer and executive director, an arrangement that has been criticized because nonprofit groups traditionally have day-to-day management that is distinct from their boards.
Banana Kelly referred all questions about the management contract to Mr. Medina, who said he did not want to comment until he had had more time to examine Banana Kelly's situation.
Over the years, Banana Kelly's government financing has shrunk dramatically and its economic development plans have gone unrealized. Tenants say they have paid the price for those trends and for mismanagement at the organization.
Concern about tenants' living conditions and Banana Kelly's finances prompted the Local Initiatives Support Corporation to give an outside manager control of the 14 buildings that it has held in partnership with Banana Kelly.
Mark Yahr, a program vice president for the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, which provides financial and technical assistance to neighborhood-based housing groups, said the it would decide after a year or so whether to return the buildings to Banana Kelly or to give them to other community-based organizations.

Sun Says Second-Quarter Earnings Met Expectations

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Shaking the profit woes faced by many other high-technology companies these days, Sun Microsystems Inc. said today that its quarterly earnings met Wall Street's expectations. The company added that although sales soared 44 percent, it still missed targets because of a sudden downturn in December.
 Sun reported net income of $552 million, a 56 percent increase from the year before, when it earned $354 million. The company posted earnings, not including costs related to acquisitions, of 16 cents a share, compared with 10 cents a year before, for the second fiscal quarter, ended Dec. 31. 
 "I always prefer the tough times," Scott McNealy, the company's chief executive, told analysts in a conference call. "It's where we can separate the followers from the leaders, and we're leading here in the marketplace." 
Sun was one of few companies to avoid surprising Wall Street with earnings warnings during the quarter. Companies like Intel, Hewlett-Packard and even Microsoft warned early that the slowdown in personal computer sales would cause revenues to miss expectations.
Revenues increased from $3.554 billion to $5.115 billion, an increase of 44 percent. But after the company predicted that its growth percentage would be in the high 40's, analysts set their revenue expectation to $5.29 billion, according to consensus estimates by First Call/Thomson Financial.
"They had to control expenses pretty dramatically to deliver the numbers" that analysts expected for earnings, said Richard Chu, a managing director with SG Cowen.
Based on the lower-than-expected sales last quarter and a shaky economic climate, Michael Lehman, Sun's chief financial officer, revised his revenue estimates for the year slightly downward. Instead of percent growth "in the mid-30's" predicted last quarter, Mr. Lehman said, Sun's revenues will grow 30 percent to 35 percent.
"There are a couple of companies out there that said they have no idea how things are going to go in the next few months" Mr. Lehman said in an interview. "We're not saying that."
Sun executives remained bullish in their outlook, saying the company picked up market share during the quarter. Revenue grew 34 percent in the United States, 53 percent in Europe, 38 percent in Japan, and 70 percent in the rest of the world, they said.
Orders, which indicate future sales, were $4.953 billion, up 32 percent from the previous year but less than the company's expectations of a growth percentage in the high 30's.
In the quarter, Sun completed its purchase of Cobalt Networks for $2.061 billion in stock. The company said it took a charge of about $130 million, or 4 cents a share, in accounting charges because of the acquisition.
Today, Sun released its first product using Cobalt technology and, in doing so, set its sights on the lower end of the server market. Sun has historically specialized in high-end computer servers that cost as much as $1 million and can handle a wide range of tasks, like managing computer networks and e-mail. But the Cobalt product is a so-called server appliance, which is designed to perform one task well and can be linked to other server appliances to handle increased demand. And Sun's new line of Netra servers, also announced today, is its first offering priced less than $1,000.
The company said it was taking aim on personal computer makers like Dell and Compaq, which have pushed harder into the low-end server market in an effort to offset declining PC sales.
"When one looks at Sun objectively, you realize that here's a company that's been on a tremendous roll for the last two years, thus comparisons are difficult to do," said George D. Elling, an analyst with Lehman Brothers.
Sun also announced today that AOL Time Warner had agreed to spend $400 million on Sun computer servers and services in the next two years to support its America Online network. The deal increased AOL's commitment to Sun to $900 million. Before its merger with Time Warner, AOL agreed to buy $500 million in services and equipment from Sun as part of AOL's purchase of Netscape Communications in 1998.
On news of the AOL commitment, investors pushed Sun shares up $2.50, nearly 8 percent, to close at $34.88. Sun announced its earnings after markets closed. Sun shares fell 63 cents to $34.25 after results were released.

HEADLINE: Cell Phones for the World's Poor; 
Hook Up Rural Asia, Some Say, And Ease Poverty

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SUKABABO, Indonesia 

 BODY:
This village in northern Sumatra is home to 832 people who live on less than 50 cents a day farming the rich volcanic soil. No one can use the Internet. Cellular signals do not reach it. The nearest telephone is more than three miles away.
 "If I miss my parents, I just come back to my village," said Priska Ika, a gregarious 20-year-old visiting her home from college in the city of Medan, 50 miles to the northeast. 
 During the heady days of the dot-com boom, the hope was that a coming era of telecommunications would help communities in the developing world like Sukababo narrow the digital divide between rich and poor, becoming more closely linked to the wider world. In a country where fewer than 2 of every 100 people use the Internet, the reasoning went, wireless devices on a new global standard would bring e-mail to people too poor for personal computers. And digital radio waves would embrace communities telephone lines have yet to reach. 
The new era begins this year. From Japan, a so-called third generation of cellular telephone technology giving individuals much greater mobile access to the Internet is ready for Europe, then the United States and the rest of the world.
But it will not be coming here to Sukababo. With technology stocks slumping, the telecommunications industry reeling at the cost of its wireless future, and rising doubts that even rich-country users will quickly embrace the new technology, a more pessimistic forecast for the third generation, or 3G, is emerging. 
"It's an illusion to think that 3G will close the digital divide," said Bertrand Bidaud, a wireless industry analyst at the Gartner Group in Singapore.
The problem is that despite rapid urbanization, most people in the developing world still do not live in cities. They live in scattered villages like Sukababo, part of a rural sprawl too thinly spread and too poor to justify expensive new networks. Costly licenses and equipment militate against the spread of mobile phones to poor communities, especially rural ones, putting the burden on governments to lure operators into seemingly unprofitable areas. 
More than just debunking dot-com hyperbole, this starker assessment of the potential in the developing world for third-generation wireless contradicts the very basis of the International Telecommunications Union's plea 15 years ago for the new standard's development -- to accelerate the spread of communications.
Now, some doubt whether the time is right for the rural poor to be connected at all. Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, quarreled with some of the priorities of technology enthusiasts at a recent industry conference, saying that the Internet was useless to people who lacked basics of life. 
At the "creating digital dividends" conference in Seattle a couple of months ago, Mr. Gates was highly skeptical. The premise was that "market drivers" could be used "to bring the benefits of connectivity and participation in the e-economy to all of the world's six billion people." Mr. Gates would have little of this.
"Do people have a clear view of what it means to live on $1 a day?" he asked. "There's no electricity in that house -- none." 
When a moderator brought up solar power, Mr. Gates shot back: "No. You can't afford a solar power system for less than $1 a day." And, "You're just buying food, you're trying to stay alive." 
Still, many high-technology executives, politicians and development experts insist that without Internet access, thousands of poor communities are speedily falling into the global economy's wake.
"Those people won't take advantage of the benefits that can come out of e-commerce and access to information," said Bernard Drum, an official at the World Bank in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital. "And people who do take advantage of those opportunities will be ahead of the game."
Being connected means more than shopping on eBay. Internet evangelists believe that the Web can help bring better education and health care to rural areas, and make them wealthier, too. 
"Poor people are poor because they're stuck in an environment that is stifling," said Iqbal Z. Quadir, a former New York investment banker who returned to his native Bangladesh in 1996 to build a rural cellular network with Grameen Bank. "If they are connected, the environment changes and everyone's life gets better."
Mr. Quadir's GrameenPhone lends money to village women to buy cellular telephones. They in turn sell fellow villagers time on the phone to do things like call relatives abroad. Today, GrameenPhone's rural resellers connect 2,800 villages and pocket $2 a day -- equivalent to a large chunk of average income. 
E-mail would not do much good in rural Bangladesh, Mr. Quadir says; only 4 of every 10 people can read. But throughout Southeast Asia, roughly 9 of 10 people can read.
Cellular operators in Southeast Asia witnessed long ago how rural populations can benefit from being connected. In Thailand, one operator found shrimp farmers calling Bangkok to get prices -- and the upper hand on middlemen. Similarly, Smart Communications, a Philippine cellular operator, learned that vegetable farmers who had never had regular fixed-line phone service were using mobile phones to market their produce in Manila. 
Sukababo offers a good contrast. The village sits on a rolling volcanic plateau where people farm a variety of crops: everything from bananas to chili peppers. Rice paddies girdle the hills. Coconut palms shade ripening corn. 
Modern life has intruded: traditional thatched-roof houses on stilts have given way to corrugated iron topped by power lines and satellite TV dishes. Leonardo Ginting, 11, can watch movies on video compact discs, but has never heard of the Internet. In a few years, he will head to the nearest high school, 12 miles away, a move that will cost his family almost half the average income here. Advocates of rural connectivity say that the Internet can bring the classroom to Sukababo. 
The Internet could also help local farmers. Sukababo lost its corn crop a few years ago to blight, and farmers here have not been able to grow a decent one since, said Bagi Kita Ginting, the village headman, and no relation to Leonardo. He has never heard of the Internet, either. Farmers elsewhere are able to learn about crop diseases and resistant strains from the Web.
If only Sukababo could get a dial tone. In theory, the laws of supply and demand should drive the wireless industry to develop so that it can deliver some version of its product to anyone willing to pay for it. Sukababo, after all, has shampoo, store-bought clothes and television sets. Children even play with beeping toy mobile phones.
But communications technologies have yet to yield equivalent economies of scale. Though costs have come down significantly, many executives argue that incompatible mobile phone technologies operating at conflicting frequencies have interfered with cellular's propagation.
In the countryside, "it's simply not economically feasible to put up cellular networks," said Ramon R. Isberto, public affairs director of Smart Communications, the Philippine operator. "You'd have to put up a lot of base stations for very little traffic. It's not a workable business case."
The International Telecommunications Union first proposed the development of third-generation cellular technology as a global standard to solve this problem. But corporate bickering over rival technologies ultimately led it to endorse three different versions. "Unfortunately, because of some differences in technologies, we couldn't take one simple standard," said the group's secretary general, Yoshio Utsumi.
Whatever the choice, the cost of building a third-generation network could be more than double the expense for existing digital networks, said Tay Soo Meng, vice president for mobile networks at Singapore Telecommunications. Raising funds will not be easy, particularly in today's tougher financial environment, analysts say. 
Cellular operators in developing countries, therefore, are likely to hold off, relying in the meantime on technical upgrades of existing digital networks that offer Internet access at slower speeds. Even then, analysts say, they are likely to concentrate on cities, where incomes are higher and they can reach more customers in a smaller area.
Experts say the only way the new technology will ultimately reach villagers is if governments play a more active role in pushing networks outward. The Philippines, for instance, required cellular operators to extend their digital service to every major population center. Because the Philippines, unlike some other countries in the region, is at least 50 percent urban, many people are now within reach of a cellular network.
How governments award licenses will also be crucial, analysts say. Most recommend against auctions, pointing to Britain's and Germany's multibillion-dollar auctions last year to show how fierce bidding inflates prices. Instead, experts recommend picking operators with the best network plans. Others warn that such beauty contests favor incumbents, many of them controlled by the crony conglomerates that still dominate Asian economies.
Nonetheless, the Philippines may have no choice but to auction off licenses, said Edgardo Cabarrios, director of the common carriers authorization department of the National Telecommunications Commission. The law requires an auction process if, as is likely, bidders outnumber licenses. Indonesia is also leaning toward auctions, said Sasmito Dirdjo, director general of the transportation and communications ministry. 
Some think that governments should adopt a laissez-faire approach, intervening only to ensure fair competition. "In Indonesia, where the government has a history of confusion and chaos," Mr. Drum of the World Bank said, "they should create an enabling environment, creating incentives, and let the private sector do it."
Others maintain that the Internet, like power and water, is a public utility that will never be distributed equitably if left to business. The best comparison is with the development of Interstate highways in the United States, said Ken Gibson, the head of McKinsey & Company's Indonesian office. "If it had been left to the private sector," he said, "the Interstates would never have been built."
Other technologies could deliver Internet service to rural areas. Satellites, for instance, have been used to beam access to a few showcase villages in South Africa and Borneo. Microwaves are linking villages in Bhutan. 
But these technologies are expensive and, so far, they lack the mass-market appeal to pay for themselves.
Mr. Utsumi says he is optimistic that third-generation technology will gain popularity in industrial nations quickly enough to bring equipment costs down to levels affordable in poorer countries.
Development experts, in the meantime, hope that plain old telephone lines can be extended to create community telecenters, where rural residents can call or use the Internet. In Indonesia, for example, no-frills Internet cafes are already springing up in cities and in college towns. 
The key to moving the latest telecommunications to the world's hinterlands may lie not in new technology, development experts say, but in harnessing the collective buying power of the rural residents.
"The real secret is to create a digital identity for people who are using shared access points," said Paul Meyer, an American who started the first Internet service in Kosovo. 'We have to get over the mentality that consumers are people who have a PC or a phone."
The Internet would find a warm reception in Sukababo. "It would be great if we could have it," Mr. Ginting, the headman, said after Ms. Ika explained what the Internet is. "Now we have to go to Munte," three miles away, "just to make a phone call."

Homeowners' Equity Share Has Fallen to Record Low
For most American families, their home is their biggest investment, and after years of prosperity in which home prices rose substantially, family wealth has increased as well. But millions of households borrowed heavily against their homes, often to support ever greater spending.
 The borrowing has been so extensive that homeowners have let their ownership shares deteriorate over the last two decades to the lowest level on record, the Federal Reserve reports. Page A1.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Treasury Choice Varies From Bush on Tax Outlook" (front page, Jan. 18): 
 Treasury Secretary-designate Paul H. O'Neill appears to recognize that tax cuts for the wealthy are unlikely to have significant stimulatory effects on the economy. 
Yet while monetary policy may be the first line of action in fighting the downturn, tax cuts, which he favors, may indeed help. 
 Consider this proposal: Give each taxpayer an equal one-time, lump-sum tax rebate. This would increase consumption. Even more important, it might receive bipartisan support, as it would benefit every American equally in absolute terms while being progressive in relative terms. 
Moreover, this plan is prudent because it postpones more permanent cuts until there is more clarity about the extent of the downturn. The size of the tax cut could be negotiated separately. This could be the new administration's first success.

HEADLINE: California Endures A 2nd Straight Day Of Power Blackouts 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Northern and Central California endured a second, more extensive day of rotating blackouts today affecting several million people, but officials said that large purchases of power by the state under the governor's emergency decree helped avert additional cutoffs during the afternoon.
 The blackouts, in the region covered by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company, began about 9:50 a.m. and continued until a little after noon, with most customers losing power for about an hour at a time. 
 The controlled power shutdowns were spread thinly and widely through many neighborhoods and across hundreds of miles, in cities including San Francisco, Sacramento and Modesto. While most people said they coped with the disruptions, there were growing concerns about how prolonged blackouts could harm the state's economy, as well as nervousness in the Legislature, now the focus for solutions, about the impact on the state's budget.
Gov. Gray Davis announced late Wednesday evening that he was declaring a state of emergency. That would permit the state to buy electricity for utilities; officials said that the governor hoped to spend about $400 million on the purchases -- a figure the State Senate approved this evening -- but that given the demands, that sum might get the state only through next week. 
Officials at the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the electricity transmission system, said the Department of Water Resources, the agency designated to make the purchases, had been buying roughly 1,200 megawatts an hour of electricity that might not have been available otherwise because of concern over whether the private utilities would be able to pay for it.
Given the fact that power rates in the overheated wholesale market were running $200 to $800 per megawatt an hour, that means the emergency program was costing California about $600,000 an hour. It is reselling the power immediately to private utilities, but they have about 75 days to pay the state, said Jim Detmers, the managing director for operations at the system operator.
Since the utilities have already been missing debt payments, the state was bearing an enormous risk that it could be stuck with those costs.
And there are signs that the costs will rise considerably in coming days. Mr. Detmers said that, given the expected shortages and the reluctance of power-generating companies to sell to the utilities, the state's purchases could easily rise to 2,000 megawatts an hour and more.
The governor's declaration put great pressure on the Legislature to move faster to devise solutions to the crisis.
The Legislature has already passed bills that will restructure the agencies that oversee the state's power system and that prohibit the major utilities from selling off generating plants -- measures that are unlikely to bring any short-term relief to the badly overtaxed system.
But even some legislators sympathetic to the governor's proposals said that the uncertain cost of the state's financial intervention left them queasy, and did not make it any clearer what the real solution would be. Several lawmakers and other state officials said that the governor and the Legislature were going to have to decide whether taxpayers or ratepayers were going to bear the real cost of the crisis, many billions of dollars, and accept potentially painful political repercussions.
The governor is a Democrat, and Democrats control both houses of the Legislature.
"This crisis is so open-ended and so expensive potentially in a short period of time we could cross the billion-dollar mark very quickly," said Assemblyman Tony Cardenas, chairman of the Budget Committee in the Assembly. "Me and my colleagues in the Assembly are all saying we are not going to head down that road of an open checkbook. It's a slippery slope."
Philip Angelides, the state treasurer, said the emergency measures would not pose problems, as long as they were temporary.
"This is something we can handle right now," Mr. Angelides said. "The notion here is not to do this long-term."
While most cities, businesses and individuals around the state appeared to be coping well with the temporary power shutdowns, there were indications that the costs of the disruptions and the overall impact on the economy were growing more threatening.
So far, the economic impact appeared modest and uncertain. Moody's Investors Service said today that it was maintaining its strong rating of California's credit, but that it was watching developments closely.
"A protracted period of electricity market instability and unreliability could cause us to revisit our rating outlook, as it would produce a more substantial dampening effect on the economy in the long term," Moody's said.
Even though Southern California has not been hit with the planned rolling blackouts, many industrial customers, who agreed to have their power cut first when shortages were severe in return for lower rates, have been shut down for several days, with little prospect for getting back up soon.
Elaine Cullen, an official at the Los Angeles Economic Development Corporation, said that a number of large industrial concerns in the San Gabriel Valley northwest of downtown Los Angeles had lost their power and temporarily laid off hundreds of employees, moving some of their production to plants in other states.
"When they send production out of the state, and the uncertainty here remains so high, we're not sure how much of that will come back afterwards," Ms. Cullen said.
Cities are also spending money on police, and other staff overtime, as well as moving to a state of emergency preparedness, though they said the sums spent so far had not been significant.
The city of Fremont in the San Francisco area, with 210,000 residents and a high-tech industrial base, estimated its costs on Wednesday at $5,000. The figure included $1,000 spent on overtime hours for police, $200 for fire department, and $2,300 for costs of activating and running the city's Emergency Operations Center, which organizes the municipal response to an emergency.
The city has also taken itself off the power grid, and is no longer receiving its electricity from Pacific Gas and Electric. Fifteen city buildings, including 11 fire stations, a police building, a jail and two municipal office buildings, now rely on generators.
On the coast, in Pacifica, population 40,000, David N. Carmany, the city manager, said he was concerned that there might be blackouts during rush-hour or late at night on the beautiful but dangerous Pacific Coast Highway, Highway 1.
Mr. Carmany said the city was deciding whether to try to run four stoplights along the route with portable generators, or to use the police, but he was concerned about the safety of officers in the dark.
"The idea of all those commuters on Highway 1 after dark is not a pretty picture," he said. And he said that the surf advisory merely put added pressure on the strained city.
The problems were not restricted to the cities. 
Bob Vandergon, assistant agriculture commissioner for Fresno County, which has been hit with rolling blackouts, said that citrus farmers in the area were concerned that if they lost power during one of the overnight freezes that seem imminent they could lose their crops. The farmers use wind machines and pump well-water into irrigation canals to keep the oranges from freezing, and so if electricity were interrupted it could do serious damage.
In Sacramento, legislators wrestled with a problem that most conceded consisted of a series of politically unpalatable choices -- making taxpayers, ratepayers or the shareholders of the utilities pay most of the billions of dollars of losses being incurred -- with no clear indications of the best direction. 
The generating companies, which are owed billions of dollars by Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison, with muddy prospects of being paid, have expressed exasperation with what they consider the slow pace and unrealistic expectations of the Legislature. 
Steve Ledbetter, the chairman of Reliant Energy, a Houston-based power generating company, said there was improved cooperation among the key players, but no signs of a real solution in sight, particularly with the two major utilities now missing debt payments and their finances deteriorating by the day.
"Their banks refuse to extend additional credit, yet suppliers such as ourselves, not just in California but throughout the entire Western market, are being forced to assume their credit risk with no promise of payment," Mr. Ledbetter said. "This is unreasonable and unfair, and it cannot be allowed to continue."
In Washington, Paul H. O'Neill, President-elect George W. Bush's choice to become treasury secretary, at his confirmation hearing described California's electricity program as "lunacy," in large measure because of the effort to keep retail prices down and avoid rate increases.
"The State of California assumed that they could defeat economics," Mr. O'Neill said, adding that trying to hold retail electric prices down when supply is short "makes no sense."
The Legislature has been constrained by the fact that Governor Davis has flatly insisted that ratepayers should not be forced to pay for the problem by having their rates increased further.
"I believe we get this done without another rate increase," Governor Davis said.
Mr. Cardenas, the Budget Committee chairman, said that it would be hard to ask taxpayers to carry much of the burden, but that there was little appetite for raising utility rates sharply.
Mr. Angelides said that, in his view, the state's utility ratepayers would ultimately have to bear the burden, but more large businesses than residential customers.
"Ratepayers may be asked to become lenders," he said. "The tab that the utilities have had to take on doesn't go away. It's a matter of how you apportion it. The shareholders of the utilities will have to pay some of that and the business sector, which argued for deregulation, will have a share of it."

JOB GROWTH CONTINUES

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton 

 BODY:
 New York City's economy continued to surge in December, despite the national economic slowdown, according to figures released yesterday by the New York State Department of Labor. 
Employers created more than 20,000 new jobs in the city in December, bringing the total increase for the year to 90,000, 2.4 percent more than in 1999. That growth rate is far stronger than the national average of 1.5 percent or the statewide average of 1.8 percent. The unemployment rate in the city, when adjusted for seasonal factors, was unchanged in December at 5.6 percent. Statewide, the unemployment rate dipped slightly to 4.5 percent from 4.6 percent; the national average was unchanged at 4 percent. Leslie Eaton (NYT)

 Consolidated Edison said yesterday that its fourth-quarter profit fell 8.4 percent after a customer rate cut but that it would meet or exceed earnings forecasts for this year. 
Profit from operations fell to $111.4 million, or 52 cents a share, from net income of $121.6 million, or 57 cents, a year earlier, said Hyman Schoenblum, vice president of corporate planning. The company was expected to earn 51 cents, the average estimate of five analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial. Con Ed said New York City's strong economy increased sales and helped offset the rate decrease.

HEADLINE: Equity Shrivels as Homeowners Borrow and Buy 

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
When Erica Hutchinson and her fiance, Lynn Corbett, bought their brownstone in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn for $175,000 three years ago, they persuaded a bank to lend them $230,000. Their argument was that the value of their new home would jump once they used the extra mortgage money to gut the three-story building and fill it with new bathrooms, a new kitchen, new flooring, new windows -- new everything.
 They were right, of course. The Corbetts, now married, say that after several years of a flush New York economy their brownstone would easily sell today for at least $370,000. Their bankers seem to agree. The couple recently added a $30,000 home equity loan, using the new money to pay off credit card bills. "The construction costs were more than we had anticipated so we charged them," said Ms. Corbett, who is 30, like her husband, "and we paid for our wedding with credit cards, too." 
 For most American families, their home is their biggest investment, and after years of prosperity in which home prices rose substantially, family wealth has increased as well. But like the Corbetts, millions of households borrowed heavily against their homes, often to help support greater spending. 
The borrowing has been so extensive, in fact, that homeowners, after building up equity through much of the 1960's and 1970's, have let their ownership shares deteriorate over the last two decades to the lowest level on record, the Federal Reserve reports. The borrowing even accelerated in the 1990's, helping to explain how Americans managed to easily outspend their incomes through two long economic expansions.
Now a slowing economy catches the average household owning less of a stake in its home than in any economic slowdown since the advent of the modern mortgage in the 1930's. If a recession develops and people start worrying that they have too little equity left to continue borrowing safely against their homes, the blow to spending could turn a mild recession into a prolonged one. That would certainly happen, economists say, if a downturn causes home prices to fall, shrinking even more the equity stake that households still have in their homes.
"When you make borrowing dependent on your home, then you erode the fire wall that protects your standard of living and we are going into this slowdown with the fire wall clearly eroded," said Nicolas Retsinas, director of the Joint Center on Housing Studies at Harvard. "The home is not just a financial transaction, it defines who you are and what kind of community you live in. When all of a sudden you get into trouble, you can't just rip it up like a credit card."
The average homeowning household owed lenders 46 percent of the market value of its residence during last year's third quarter, up sharply from about 30 percent in 1982 and 40 percent in 1991, at the start of the current economic expansion, the Fed reports show. For a typical family with a home worth the median market value of $144,000 late last year, that meant their equity was $77,760 while their debt was $66,240.
That still sounds like a relatively safe cushion. But American society once exalted a different norm -- a 20 percent down payment and the balance paid off through a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. The Champagne toasts and mortgage burnings that celebrated the final payment are gone today. Instead, a growing number of Americans are approaching or entering retirement still making hefty home payments.
In many ways, the shift makes sense. Home equity loans and the refinancing of mortgages have become vehicles for converting standard consumer debt into loans that usually enjoy tax breaks, lower interest rates and smaller monthly payments. Millions of people have managed to borrow against their homes at rates under 10 percent, while channeling other funds into retirement plans and into a stock market that until recently achieved average returns of 15 percent or more a year.
Whatever the justifications, the family home is now more at risk as collateral for the spending that underpins economic growth.
The vulnerability cuts two ways. For people like the Corbetts, convinced that their brownstone on St. James Place can only rise in value as their neighborhood improves, there is still room to borrow more and spend it avidly, softening any downturn. "We are definitely ahead of the game," said Ms. Corbett, who works in the fashion industry. Her husband runs a Boy's Town center in Brooklyn and their income is $120,000 a year, not counting the $1,300 a month they receive as rent for an apartment in their brownstone.
But for homeowners like Thomas Murray, an executive for a Cincinnati company that cleans food processing plants, even a leveling off of home prices would be chilling. He is painfully aware that if he sold his four-bedroom brick suburban home for the $220,000 that he thinks he can get for it and then paid off his mortgage and his home equity loan, he would walk away with -- as he puts it -- "$8, maybe $9."
"If I had to take a pay cut or had to accept another job for a lower level of pay, then I would have the credit card problem again, and no equity left in my home to solve it," said Mr. Murray, 36, who landed his present job last spring at a sharp increase in salary, to above $100,000. Over the last five years, he had made less than $80,000 a year. As a result, the family accumulated $20,000 in credit card debt, which he and his wife recently converted to a $25,000 home equity loan.
"Car repair, dental bills, mandatory home repairs, clothing for the kids, birthday parties, you cannot afford all this and stay out of debt," Mr. Murray said. "Unless you have a big enough income, which I have -- now."
The big concern among economists is not a relatively short recession, but a longer one, lasting a year or so. "In a brief recession, the extra borrowing and spending would even soften the downturn," Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com in West Chester, Pa., said. Indeed, a new surge in mortgage refinancing as interest rates fall -- the fourth surge since 1993 -- is likely to give a lift to spending as some people go further into debt, pocketing the extra mortgage money without increasing their monthly payments.
"But in a longer recession," Mr. Zandi said, "housing prices would weaken and many homeowners could easily find themselves owing more on their homes than the homes were worth."
If that happened, the abrupt pullback in spending as these families tried to work down their debts and preserve their homes would exacerbate a recession. Many Japanese behaved in just this way after the collapse in real estate prices in that country a decade ago.
Or, with monthly mortgage and home equity payments in the United States at a record level as a percentage of disposable income, trouble on the job -- layoffs, for example, or cutbacks in overtime pay -- could quickly restrict spending, also deepening a recession.
Alexander Wright, a 40-year-old aircraft mechanic for Northrop Grumman in Jacksonville, Fla., is currently going through just this experience. He is among the millions of relatively new homeowners who could not meet the old requirements for a down payment to purchase a home, but achieved his goal as lenders relaxed their standards, offering mortgages that cover nearly the entire cost of a home.
Mortgage insurance has encouraged this expansion of homeownership. So has the increasingly popular practice of packaging mortgages into bonds that are then sold to many investors, thus spreading the risk of default. Government-sponsored programs aimed at allowing lower-income families to buy a home with little money down have helped as well. Together with the robust economy, these forces have propelled homeownership to a record 67.7 percent of all households, although many of the new homeowners own only a modest stake in their homes.
Mr. Wright and his wife, Carvetta, an assembly line worker in a microchip plant, are in this situation, having purchased their three-bedroom ranch house several years ago for $64,500, obtaining a mortgage for the entire amount.
"I've done a lot of renovation, doing the work myself, and I would price the house now at $82,000," Mr. Wright said. He has worked the mortgage down to under $55,000.
But the family also owes $30,000 on a home equity loan the Wrights took out to pay off credit card bills and to help buy a car. With two teenagers, they were paying off the debt without undue sacrifice, Mr. Wright said, until his overtime suddenly stopped last June. Repair work at Northrop Grumman had slowed. The Wrights' combined annual income is about $54,000, and the overtime once added $10,000 a year. Without it, the payments on the debt continue, but family spending is curtailed.
"I am going to try not to draw down the $4,000 that remains on my home equity credit line," Mr. Wright said. "We are trying to tough it out. We don't go out anymore, and we try not to buy the name-brand clothes that the kids want, none of that Tommy Hilfiger stuff. We had two dogs, and we got rid of one." 
If Mr. Wright is worried, David Murphy, who owns a home in Madeira, an upscale Cincinnati suburb, certainly is not. The Murphys -- he sells computer systems to hospitals, she is an electrical engineer -- completed a lavish $130,000 kitchen renovation last year, borrowing the full sum to expand the space to make room for a stone fireplace and archway. They installed new custom cabinets, granite counter tops and a Sub-Zero refrigerator.
That was only the latest renovation to a three-bedroom home that the Murphys bought nine years ago for $225,000, putting $50,000 down and borrowing $175,000. The upgrades include an entertainment room and an outdoor cooking center, and the debt against the home has risen to $400,000. But Mr. Murphy is confident that he could sell his home for $550,000 today. A bank appraiser told him that the $130,000 kitchen remodeling raised the selling price of the home by the full amount spent on the renovation.
Is that accurate? Or are people overly optimistic about the values of their homes?
"We are stunned by the optimism that shows up in our surveys," said David F. Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders in Washington. "The attitude used to be that remodeling is great, but don't expect to get it back in resale value."
Mr. Murphy could well be right about his home. But what if he is wrong? "There is not yet a problem with house prices," Mr. Seiders said, "but if this slowdown continues, you could see problems."

HEADLINE: Turkey Tries to Step Up Sell-Off of State Companies 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Turkey's privatization officials will hit the road next week in Europe to try to drum up interest among potential buyers for a stake in the state-owned telephone company, a deal many analysts see as a litmus test for the country's economy.
 Under pressure from the International Monetary Fund, the government agreed last month to sell 33.5 percent of Turk Telekom and provide management rights to the buyer after an offer last year to sell 20 percent failed to attract any bids. 
 Analysts said the transaction would help answer questions about whether Turkey had the political will to speed up its privatization program and meet a number of I.M.F. deadlines for overhauling the economy. 
"More important than the money generated from selling Turk Telekom, investor confidence will be positively affected," Oner Ayan, manager of the Turkey desk at Raymond James & Associates in New York, said in an interview via e-mail. "Failure of Turk Telekom privatization may be a disaster." 
As part of a three-year economic overhaul program started last January, the government promised to curb inflation, cut its budget deficit and sell many state-owned enterprises to private investors. Progress has been made on inflation and the deficit, but political leaders have been slow to push privatization, particularly for what are regarded as the state's crown jewels, Turk Telecom and Turkish Airlines.
The effort took on new urgency when a financial crisis swept Turkey's financial markets in late November and early December. The I.M.F. agreed to provide a $7.5 billion emergency loan to stop the crisis, but the government had to adopt deadlines for selling the larger stake in the telephone company and for selling 51 percent of Turkish Airlines. Missing the deadlines would jeopardize the I.M.F. money.
The sale of the airline is expected to be the easier of the two transactions, despite objections to the sale from the transportation minister. Turkish Airlines loses money, but it has profitable international routes, one of the world's newest fleets of aircraft and a new international airport. Analysts expect a foreign airline to team with a large domestic company to bid on Turkish Airlines, which company officials value at $2 billion to $2.5 billion. The deadline for the sale is March 31. Swissair and Lufthansa are known to have expressed interest in Turkish Airlines.
After the failure to sell part of Turk Telekom last year, the I.M.F. insisted that the stake be raised and that the offer include strong management rights for the buyer, including control of a management committee.
But there are questions about whether the management rights have the strength to attract enough bids to push the value of the stake into the $10 billion range expected by the government. Analysts also questioned the viability of the sale when Europe's telecommunications industry faces rising debt and falling valuations. 
They also said that including a cellular phone license as part of the Turk Telekom package might have come too late because of concerns that the market was saturated.
Turkey is supposed to invite formal bids by March 30 and select the winning bid by the end of May, according to its agreement with the I.M.F.
The two sales are only one financial hurdle on the horizon. By the end of the month, regulators must decide which ailing banks to sell, which banks to dissolve and which power companies to sell. Parliament must decide whether to pass laws to open the way for more privatization in tobacco, alcoholic beverages and power generation.
From Turkey's viewpoint, there has been progress toward the I.M.F. goals. Inflation last year was 38 percent, above the target of 25 percent but half the 1999 rate and the lowest level since the mid-1980s. The goal for 2001 is 12 percent, followed by single digits the following year. Government spending has also been curbed, reducing the budget deficit.
Partly because of fears ignited by the financial crisis, analysts expect economic growth to slow to about 1 percent in the first quarter of this year and remain sluggish in the second quarter. The slowdown should trim inflation further, but lagging investment and production will not make life easier for most Turks.
"Turkey has been locked down at $3,000 per capita income for 10 years, and we cannot break the chains and improve the standard of living," said T. Gungor Uras, an economist and former official with the state planning organization. "Under the targets in the I.M.F. agreement, it is impossible to increase investment and production."
Some businesses have felt the squeeze already, and there have been reports of big drops in retail sales. Civil servants, who are in contract negotiations this month, are balking at the 10 percent raise required under the I.M.F. program, although there is a provision for an adjustment if inflation rises.
But some experts say that after years of double-digit inflation eating away at real wages, Turks are willing to wait a bit longer because they see inflation falling.
"In inflationary times, people are much more nervous," said Haluk Tukel of the Turkish Industrialists' and Businessmen's Association, which is made up of the country's largest private companies. "People see prices going down now, and they can see possible growth."

HEADLINE: Microsoft Proves a Lure After Internet Stints 

BYLINE:  By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: REDMOND, Wash., Jan. 17 

 BODY:
At a recent orientation for about 200 new employees at the Microsoft Corporation, Joseph Vansyckle found he was hardly alone in raising his hand when the company's chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, posed a question. Just how many of these "new employees," Mr. Ballmer wondered, had actually worked at Microsoft before? 
 "There were about 10 to 15 hands in the air," said Mr. Vansyckle, a product manager who had left the software giant in 1999 for stints at Drugstore.com and Amazon.com, both based in Seattle, before returning to Microsoft's Redmond campus this month. Many had gone off to local Internet companies or other high-technology start-up ventures, and had exciting if nerve-wracking tales to tell of their experiences. 
 But, as Mr. Vansyckle, 29, explains it, they also seem to have returned with a new appreciation for what they had at Microsoft -- not just the financial resources to develop software, but also decent salaries and a variety of other personal benefits. 
"A really good health plan, a really good 401(k)," he said. "That played a really big part in my coming back. The stability of Microsoft was important. When you get toward 30, those things become much more important." 
The world's largest software maker is certainly not immune to the ferocious slump that has hit the high-technology industry. But as Internet companies lay off workers or even close their doors altogether, Microsoft has recently gone on something of a hiring and acquisition binge.
In doing so, the company is providing a safety net in the Seattle area for some of the industry's brightest young talent and demonstrating that in the suddenly turbulent world of the New Economy, being an industry titan holds out at least one decidedly Old Economy appeal: the prospect of relatively stable employment. 
Microsoft, which has never had to impose widespread layoffs in its 25-year history, hired 11,800 people in 2000, bringing its total work force to an all-time high of 41,600. It has more than 5,000 official job openings now, and company recruiters say that applications are up more than 10 percent from a year ago, even more so from college campuses. 
In the last six months, Microsoft has rehired 103 former employees, company officials say, including, in a fitting touch of symbolism, its first official hiring: Marc McDonald, issued badge number 00001 in 1976 when the company was known as Micro-Soft and based in Albuquerque, returned recently when Microsoft acquired the electronic publishing company he was working for. 
And Microsoft has taken on other workers who were initially lured to the siren call of the Internet world, perhaps even by the chance to take off with a small company much as early Microsoft employees once did. 
"I think working for a typical dot-com, it's almost like doing the extreme-sports thing," said Christopher Chapman, a software engineer who was laid off in November from the Seattle office of Stamps.com, an online postage service. 
"For someone who's 23, I think it's a cool rush to be in a situation like that," added Mr. Chapman, who got a job a few weeks later with Microsoft in a division that develops training materials for the company's software. "But coming to Microsoft, walking in and knowing they have a whole system from A to Z, everything's been worked out and they know what they're doing, well you appreciate that, too. I guess it depends on where you are in your life." 
Microsoft has plenty of problems. There is its antitrust battle with the federal government. There is also its reputation as the industry bully, an image expressed in "AntiTrust," a new movie in which Tim Robbins plays a Bill Gates-like software chieftain who orders thugs with bats to take out rival programmers. 
But with cash reserves of more than $20 billion, Microsoft is in a position to snap up smart workers at struggling small Internet companies in the Seattle area and beyond. 
Some Microsoft employees hired a year or two ago do share an unhappy distinction with workers at Internet companies: their stock options are underwater, in the industry lingo. But even Microsoft's stock woes seem to have an upside. Many new employees say they are convinced that the company's stock, mired in the $50 range, well off the peak just short of $120 that it hit in 1999, is bound to recover, making this an attractive time to go to work there. 
Perceptions among bright young programmers may be changing, too. For a good part of the last decade, computer whiz kids generally shunned the company's suburban, corporate campus for start-ups in Seattle's bohemian neighborhoods. Now many of them talk of the virtues of a Microsoft career.
"How many dot-coms or start-ups can you name that have really done something revolutionary?" asked Ori Amiga, 23, a program manager in Microsoft's "dot-net" division, part of the company's strategy to shift much of its software from packaged products to services available over the Internet. "Very few, compared to the tens of thousands out there." 
Mr. Chapman, who came to Microsoft after being laid off by Stamps.com, put it another way: "They win. I wanted a company that was a winner. I wanted to wind up at a company with a lot of resources, a place that knows what it takes." 
Many new workers here say they do not worry about Microsoft being split in two in the antitrust battle. They believe that the company will prevail on appeal or that the Bush administration will settle the case. At the very least, they see themselves working for one of two strong companies.
Even those who live in Seattle but do not work for Microsoft remain positive about the company. Many residents own shares in the company and thus wish it -- or at least its stock price -- well.
"The fear and loathing of Microsoft as too big and too dominant is found almost everywhere but Seattle," said Glenn Pascall, a senior fellow at the Institute of Public Policy at the University of Washington, who studies the company's impact on the local economy.
But, Mr. Pascall said, there is some irony that Microsoft is seen as "a place for those who had the great dot-com adventure and now need a safe harbor." Some economic downturns that have led Boeing, the region's largest employer with three times as many workers as Microsoft here, to layoffs have prompted workers from the aerospace company to start their own businesses.
"The notion of Microsoft as a mother ship that gathers up the wounded chicks after the shake-up is the reverse of the entrepreneurial impetus Boeing has inadvertently provided with its layoffs," Mr. Pascall said. "This is a bit like the Boeing story but with a new chapter added, which is the return of the departed employee."
For now, the returnees seem grateful. Mr. Vansyckle, who is now a product manager in the company's dot-net division, said he had no regrets about leaving Microsoft to work in e-commerce. 
"I would not have traded my experience there for anything," Mr. Vansyckle said. "But working at a company like Microsoft, you have unlimited resources. You've got the money to do it. From the company's point of view, the only problem is, you've just got to choose what it is you want to do."

HEADLINE: Ford 4th-Quarter Earnings Fell 40% as Sales Slowed 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company said today that its earnings dropped 40.4 percent in the fourth quarter as slower sales in a weakening American economy crippled profits in its North American operations.
 For the last five years, Ford executives have taken considerable pride in their robust earnings in the United States, the result of having bet heavily and early on the boom in sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. But the company's profits as a percent of sales plunged to 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter from 5.5 percent in the period a year earlier. 
 The deterioration in Ford's finances was all the more striking because North American profit margins at Ford's archrival, General Motors, actually improved slightly in the fourth quarter before one-time charges, to 3.6 percent from 3.5 percent. G.M. also took a one-time charge of $983 million to shut down Oldsmobile. 
Ford's net income dropped to $1.08 billion in the fourth quarter, or 57 cents a share, compared with $1.81 billion, or $1.47 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales fell to $42.6 billion from $43.9 billion.
Excluding the results of Visteon, the huge auto parts subsidiary that Ford spun off last June, and one-time items, Ford said it earned $1.2 billion, or 64 cents a share, in line with Wall Street expectations, which had been reduced after Ford issued two earnings warnings in December.
Henry D. G. Wallace, Ford's chief financial officer, said that Ford had suffered from slowing sales for all automobiles and because it halted production of one of its most profitable models, the Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle, in November to prepare factories for the introduction of a new Explorer in February.
Ford also had heavy marketing expenses for the expiring model of the Explorer, Mr. Wallace said. The company tried to reassure customers about the vehicle's safety after a recall on Aug. 9 of Firestone tires linked to more than 100 deaths, almost all of them in Explorers that rolled over after tread separated from a tire.
Struggling with the Explorer's troubles as well recalls of other models, Ford fell short as well in its pursuit of cost reductions last year. 
But some financial analysts were skeptical of Ford's explanations, saying that they suspected that the company faced a more serious problem: eroding profits per vehicle on sport utilities and pickup trucks as more foreign automakers enter the market.
"Profitability is deteriorating in North America; at any level of the market, these guys are not as profitable as they used to be," said Rod Lache, an auto analyst at Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown.
Mr. Wallace denied in an interview that light truck profit margins had suffered, saying that the decline in overall sales volume, combined with the Explorer design change, had been responsible for the declining profits of Ford's North American operations, which earned $607 million, compared with $1.47 billion a year earlier. While G.M. said on Wednesday that it lost money in every region overseas during the fourth quarter, including a staggering loss of $463 million in Europe alone, Ford managed to do much better abroad. In Europe, Ford eked out a $33 million profit after losing $30 million a year earlier. Ford's profits in Asia inched up to $20 million in the fourth quarter from $10 million a year earlier. Ford's losses in South America narrowed to $31 million from $100 million a year earlier.
Ford Credit, the automaker's unit for car loans and leases, posted a 33 percent increase in profits, to $410 million, capping a year of double-digit increases in profits. 
Bibiana Boerio, the chief financial officer of Ford Credit, said that his unit had not been hurt by the Ford Explorer's troubles because the number of Explorers being returned at the end of leases, instead of being bought by the lessor or the dealer, had been in line with expectations.
Ford Credit had also assumed for several years that the resale value of Explorers would erode somewhat this winter because of the pending introduction of the new model and because other sport utility models are coming on the market and has, thus, been able to resell Explorers for what it anticipated, she added.
For all of last year, Ford earned $3.47 billion, or $2.30 a share, down from $7.24 billion, or $5.86 a share. The spinoff of Visteon resulted in a one-time charge of $2.25 billion. Sales rose to $170.06 billion last year from $160.66 billion.

HEADLINE: Microsoft Sees Some Good And Some Bad 

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Capitalizing on strong sales growth for its Windows 2000 desktop operating system at the end of the year, Microsoft reported quarterly earnings today that met Wall Street's scaled-back expectations. 
 The company reported record revenue of $6.59 billion for the quarter ended Dec. 31, an 8 percent increase over the $6.11 billion for the 1999 quarter. Net income and diluted earnings per share were $2.62 billion and 47 cents a share, up marginally from the $2.44 billion, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. The earnings per share met a consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts reported by First Call/Thomson Financial. 
 On Dec. 14, Microsoft took the unaccustomed step of warning Wall Street that it would have lower revenue than previously expected as a result of a downturn in the PC market and in corporate purchases.
Today's earnings news was announced after the markets closed. Microsoft's shares ended the trading day at $55.63, up $2.69, and went as high as $58 after hours. The stock has tumbled from $115 last March amid concerns about the government's antitrust case and the computer industry's slowdown.
"There's a little relief that they didn't drop any more bad news on us," said Richard Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "That will give the stock a boost. Maybe it's O.K. to go back in the water."
Despite the strength of its operating systems sales, the company added a gloomy note by reporting that revenue for its Office software declined for the second quarter in a row. Revenue from those programs, known as desktop applications, was $2.49 billion in the latest quarter, down 2 percent from $2.53 billion a year ago. 
The declines are the first for the company's desktop programs, which dominate the PC software market. As a result, analysts are questioning whether the company will be able to continue to persuade consumers to shift from one generation of its software to the next.
"Office represents the single largest product for this company," said Sanjiv Hingorani, a Wall Street analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in New York. "What is going to cause Office revenues to grow in the future?"
Microsoft said its earnings had come in near the top of its reduced forecast, largely on the strength of last-moment corporate purchases for its Windows 2000 desktop operating system at the end of last month.
"The quarter ended a little better than anticipated," said John G. Connors, chief financial officer. 
Indeed, Mr. Connors said that part of the slightly better performance might have come because of the added incentive given to Microsoft's sales force by the gloomy warning two weeks before the end of the year.
At the same time, he said that with worldwide PC growth leveling off, the company's annual growth in the future would be more modest. 
"Our growth prospects are really healthy, but it won't be the 20 percent of the past," Mr. Connors said.
Further evidence of a global slowdown in PC sales came today in a preliminary survey released by Dataquest, the market research firm. That survey indicated that worldwide shipments of PC's totaled 134.7 million in 2000. Global sales increased 14.5 percent for the year, while sales in the United States were up 10.3 percent.
For the fourth quarter, worldwide PC shipments rose 10 percent, and United States shipments were up 6.4 percent, far below forecasts. 
Microsoft said its server business had continued to accelerate during the quarter, and cited several customers as evidence of its success.
Analysts said, though, that Microsoft's strength in software for servers, the workhorses of the Internet, had yet to be fully developed. That suggests that the company has not yet begun to make huge inroads into the business of its toughest software competitors, like Sun Microsystems and I.B.M.
"I didn't see the upside on the server side of the business," said David Readerman, a partner and director of Internet strategy for Thomas Weisel Partners in San Francisco. "It's still largely on the desktop side."
The company is clearly looking for new growth outside the personal computer market.
Yet those businesses, which generally have lower margins than its traditional core PC business, may not be the safe havens that Microsoft is searching for. In December, it cited revenue shortfalls in its consumer Internet business, MSN, as one reason it was forecasting a shortfall, and today Mr. Connors said that the company's $400 rebate promotion had in effect been too popular. The company saw 500,000 new customers in the quarter, but revenue was significantly lower than planned because so many of the new customers took advantage of the rebate.
Over all, however, Microsoft gave none of the signs of a beleaguered giant. While acknowledging that it would be affected by any economic downturn, Mr. Connors said, "Going into 2001, Microsoft is as well positioned as we've ever been."

 NEW YORK

MANHATTAN: A.C.L.U. ACCUSED OF BIAS -- A former employee of the American Civil Liberties Union said yesterday that she was suing the organization for age and race discrimination. The woman, Maria A. Torres-Sylvan, who is 50 and Hispanic, worked as a computer operator at the A.C.L.U.'s national headquarters in Manhattan for nearly 17 years. In 1998, when Adrienne Stein, a white woman in her 30's, became the direct supervisor, Mrs. Sylvan said, several older employees began to feel unwelcome. Last April, she said, she was replaced by a 23-year-old white man. An A.C.L.U. spokeswoman said the charges were groundless. Sherri Day (NYT)

MANHATTAN: MORE SUBWAY CARS -- Hoping to ease the rush-hour crush on the busiest subway lines, New York City Transit officials voted yesterday to increase their order for new subway cars by $185 million for 150 additional cars. The increase means that over the next two years, 1,550 new subway cars will appear on the IRT lines -- the Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 9 -- replacing all 1,400 of the oldest trains. Lawrence G. Reuter, transit president, noted that the train fleet included about 6,000 cars, so the expansion was relatively small. But he said he expected some improvement in the subway system, where ridership has risen steeply. Randy Kennedy (NYT)

UNIONDALE: POWER USE RISES 9 PERCENT -- The Long Island Power Authority said yesterday that while Long Island's population had barely grown last year, electricity use by the average household had shown a 9 percent increase. The utility's 2000 population survey said that Suffolk County's growth was 1.2 percent and Nassau's 0.2 percent. It said that the strong economy, lower electric rates, expanded construction and new technology were the reasons power use was growing faster than expected. Tina Kelley (NYT)

ROCHESTER: JUDGMENT IN STUDENT HOMICIDE -- A jury awarded $1 million yesterday to the mother of a 13-year-old girl who was killed by a classmate in the first student slaying at a public school in Rochester. A 12-year-old girl used a steak knife to stab the 13-year-old, Stephne Givens, in the neck outside Jefferson Middle School on Sept. 21, 1995. They had been quarreling over a boy, witnesses said. A State Supreme Court jury said the city school district had failed to adequately supervise the students, and ordered it to pay $430,000 in damages to Stephne's mother, Aledia Givens. The 12-year-old and her mother were ordered to pay $570,000. (AP)

OYSTER BAY: PETITIONERS SEEK RETAIL MALL -- The Nassau Suffolk Building Trades Council yesterday delivered 6,000 petitions to John Venditto, the supervisor of Oyster Bay, that support plans to build a mall on the grounds of the Cerro Wire and Cable Company plant near Syosset. "It means an awful lot of employment for our construction workers," said John M. Kennedy, the council's president. Some of the town's residents oppose the mall, although it is expected to generate more than 2,000 construction jobs. But Morton Weber, a lawyer for the developer, the Taubman Company of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., said, "The rest of the town realizes it is so essential for the economics of the town, and jobs." Tina Kelley (NYT)

ALBANY: COURT RULES ON ACCUSED PEDIATRICIAN -- The appellate division of the State Supreme Court has ruled that Stuart M. Copperman, a pediatrician from Merrick, on Long Island, who is accused of molesting some of his teenage patients, cannot practice, even with a chaperon, while he is appealing the revocation of his license. The ruling was made on Friday but made public on Wednesday. It is considered a victory for the State Health Department, which revoked the doctor's license in December. Tina Kelley (NYT)

NEW JERSEY

TRENTON: SCOOTER HELMET BILL -- Children 14 and younger would have to wear a helmet while riding a scooter under a bill approved by an Assembly committee yesterday. The measure is in response to the death of an Elizabeth boy, Andy Pinto, while riding a scooter in September. The measure, which passed the Assembly Law and Public Safety Committee and will go to the full Assembly for consideration, amends a law that requires children to wear helmets while riding bicycles or using skateboards or in-line skates. Parents of children who do not wear helmets would be fined $25 for the first offense and $100 for subsequent offenses. (AP)

SOUTH BOUND BROOK: POLICE CHIEF DISCIPLINED -- The chief of the South Bound Brook Police has been placed on administrative duty, the Somerset County prosecutor said yesterday. The action follows a restraining order granted to the chief's former wife last week and an assault complaint on Wednesday by his neighbor. The chief, Robert A. Verry, had his weapon seized and his duties suspended temporarily on Friday by the prosecutor, Wayne Forrest. Mr. Forrest said he would decide on permanent measures after consulting with the mayor and other authorities. Chief Verry did not return telephone calls. Steve Strunsky (NYT)

NEWARK: PORT AUTHORITY GRADUATION -- The police force of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which was recently criticized by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, will graduate 77 new recruits from its academy training program today. The increase in the force, to 1,300, will make it the nation's 26th-largest police agency. Mayor Giuliani had charged the agency with failing to stem an increase in crime at the city's airports. The force, disputing the criticism, said that one-third of its class was made up of former New York City police officers. Ronald Smothers (NYT)

NEWARK: 3 INDICTED IN GAS SCHEME -- Two company presidents and another official were indicted yesterday in an alleged conspiracy to falsify laboratory results and sell hundreds of millions of gallons of substandard gasoline. Charged in an 11-count federal indictment were Richard Kaminski, 53, of Houston, former president of Caleb Brett U.S.A., a petroleum testing laboratory; Waldo Schroeder, 53, president of Blending, Marketing and Service Inc.; and his brother, Mark Schroeder, 43, a Blending operations manager. (NYT)

CONNECTICUT

NORWICH: SHRINE SEIZED -- The city has taken title to a hillside religious display known as the Sanctuary of Love because the owner cannot pay overdue taxes and utility bills. Tenants of the apartment house on the property are moving out so the city can condemn the area and close the shrine. The owner, Salvatore Verdirome, 80, who worked for 30 years building the sanctuary by hand, may stay in his apartment with his caretaker until the city can assess whether the apartment meets housing regulations.

HARTFORD: APPELLATE JUDGE NAMED -- Judge Joseph Flynn, who has served as deputy chief court administrator since late 1999, was named yesterday to the state's Appellate Court. Judge Flynn, 60, a Democrat from Ansonia, has been a judge since 1985. His promotion to the state's second-highest court was announced by Gov. John G. Rowland. He will serve on the Appellate Court on an interim basis, pending confirmation by the Legislature. (AP)

HEADLINE: Caterpillar Expects Lower Profit 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc., the largest maker of construction and earth-moving equipment, said today that its profit would fall and that its sales would be little changed this year because of the slowing economy and higher spending.
Caterpillar shares fell $2.91, to $41.75, a drop of 6.5 percent. 
 Caterpillar said its profit would be 5 percent to 10 percent less than it earned in 2000. Analysts had expected earnings to rise this year. 
 The company had said that fourth-quarter net income rose a greater-than-expected 10 percent, to $264 million, or 76 cents a share, compared with $239 million, or 67 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 1.9 percent, to $5.11 billion from $5.02 billion. Analysts had expected the company to earn 64 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
Caterpillar's profit had dropped seven out of the last nine quarters as higher interest rates, low commodity prices and weak overseas economies crimped sales of backhoes and cranes. 
Caterpillar plans to spend $350 million to initiate a quality-control program and upgrade computer systems to improve productivity, Lynn McPheeters, the chief financial officer, said in an interview. Profit would increase without the higher spending, he said.
North American sales of machinery in 2001 will be hurt from excess industry capacity and pricing competition, while sales in the rest of the world will probably increase, Mr. McPheeters said. The company, based in Peoria, has sought to counter increased competition from rivals like Deere & Company and CNH Global N.V. by offering incentives to dealers, which include reduced interest rates and price cuts.

HEADLINE: Congress Asked to Help Police the Rogue Diamond Trade 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Seeking to distance the trade in spangled tiaras and humble engagement rings from the taint of so-called conflict diamonds, a leading industry group has urged the United States Congress to ban the import of tainted gems and to support a new system of certification across the $7 billion global market in uncut stones.
 The proposal by the World Diamond Council was intended to bring governments, including the United States, directly into the policing of the rogue diamond trade rather than leave it to the United Nations and the industry itself. 
 "This is a bold move by the industry to ask to be controlled," said Eli Izhakoff, a retired New York diamond executive who heads the council, a group established by industry leaders, including the giant De Beers company, in an effort to disassociate the legitimate diamond trade from the illicit trade. 
"It's a major undertaking," Mr. Izhakoff said in an interview today at the close of a two-day meeting of the organization. 
The De Beers chairman, Nicky Oppenheimer, said, "It is time for governments, particularly those whose countries are the major exporters and importers of rough diamonds, to effect appropriate legislation to ensure that the trade in rough diamonds without proper certification of origin is outlawed."
The meeting was the latest step by retailers, cutters and uncut diamond wholesalers to avert a boycott, similar to one against the fur trade, that seemed inevitable two years ago after reports that rebels in Angola and Sierra Leone were using diamond sales to finance their uprisings.
Since then, the issue has drawn in the United Nations and the governments of the United States and Britain and has raised questions about the involvement of several countries from Congo to Ukraine.
The latest call for legislation emerged a day after De Beers, which has controlled the world trade in uncut stones for most of its 112 years, announced a landmark agreement with the luxury goods retailer LVMH-Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton to break into the retail trade with branded cut diamonds. 
De Beers's own measures against conflict diamonds and its support for global measures to undermine the conflict diamond market are widely seen as part of an effort to shield its retail venture from association with so-called blood diamonds.
The diamond retail trade, far more lucrative than the rough diamond business, is worth an estimated $50 billion, half of it in the United States, where De Beers is barred from doing business directly because of long-running antitrust disputes.
But, council participants said, the United States is a minor importer of uncut stones, the bulk of which are controlled by De Beers in southern Africa and its contracts with suppliers in Canada and Russia. 
Mr. Izhakoff said the council's certification proposal, ensuring that diamonds reaching the markets were exported under strict controls, was intended "to create a conflict-free rough diamond zone" that would affect the entire business. 
"We want to make it impossible," he said, "to trade in conflict diamonds."
But some attending the conference questioned the effectiveness of the certification program in light of Russian opposition to the monitoring of diamond exports and to the creation of a global database of exports. 
"Without Russia, the whole system isn't going to work," an industry executive said. Russia is the second-largest exporter of rough diamonds after Botswana, whose industry is controlled by De Beers. 
Russia is "very leery of controls from outside," Mr. Izhakoff said.
Specifically, the council said it would like to see legislation in Washington that would create a closely monitored system of certificates of origin "in which packets of newly extracted rough diamonds would be sealed, documented and recorded in databases all under the supervision of government officials."
In addition, the council has proposed that efforts to circumvent the control be punishable by fines of up to $250,000 and two-year jail terms. The proposal would also provide for the president to negotiate a global agreement enforcing the use of certificates of origin. 
Delegates to the London conference said the proposals foresaw a certification process using formal documentation as well as encrypted, electronic systems to ensure that packages were not tampered with.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. The ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on
Page 12.

Now Playing

"ALL THE PRETTY HORSES," starring Matt Damon and Henry Thomas. Directed by Billy Bob Thornton; written by Ted Tally (PG-13, 112 minutes). Yes, very pretty. Also, slow, portentous and banal. Mr. Thornton and Mr. Tally have faithfully adapted Cormac McCarthy's beloved novel, but they have also inadvertently laid bare its essential emptiness. Mr. Damon and Mr. Thomas play a couple of young cowboys who venture into Mexico in the late 1940's. They find mystery, love, violence and betrayal, but their adventures are presented with such solemn, stylized detachment that it's hard to care much about them. Penelope Cruz struggles with an impossible role as Mr. Damon's love interest. The only spark of life or humor in the picture comes from young Lucas Black, in the role of a scrawny prepubescent runaway who fancies himself a dangerous outlaw and unwittingly becomes one (A. O. Scott).

"ANTITRUST," starring Tim Robbins, Ryan Phillippe, Rachael Leigh Cook and Claire Forlani. Directed by Peter Howitt (PG-13, 120 minutes). Overplotted and overdirected, this thriller about high-tech corporate skullduggery is clever and likable enough to make you feel a bit sorry about the lousy timing of its release. Mr. Phillippe plays an earnest young geek seduced away from his friends' Internet start-up by a Bill Gates-like cyberguru (Mr. Robbins). Like most Hollywood movies about corporate villainy, "Antitrust," waving the banner of the open-source movement, feels a bit phony. But Mr. Howitt and the production designer, Catherine Hardwicke, do a nice job of capturing the ambience and idioms of the New Economy workplace (Scott).

* "BEFORE NIGHT FALLS," starring Javier Bardem. Directed by Julian Schnabel (R, 125 minutes). Mr. Schnabel's romanticized portrait of the exiled gay Cuban poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas, who died of AIDS, imagines pre-Castro Cuba as a pagan paradise of endless erotic promise ruined by the puritanical Communists, whom Arenas initially embraced then turned against. Mr. Bardem's arresting performance paints Arenas as an emotionally volatile daredevil. But this biography, which incorporates swaths of Arenas's writing, is sketchy, and the star's thick Spanish accent is daunting. It's still quite indelible (Stephen Holden).

* "CAST AWAY," starring Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt. Directed by Robert Zemeckis (PG-13, 143 minutes). The core of this contemporary Robinson Crusoe story is an unforgettably gripping survival drama. Mr. Hanks is a Federal Express employee shipwrecked on a desert island after a plane crash. Physical survival depends on things like rubbing two sticks together to start a fire and cracking open coconuts. For companionship, he paints a face on a volleyball and names it Wilson. As in all his films, Mr. Hanks makes his character compelling by infusing him with a childlike openness. But the interrupted love story that frames the survival sequences is sappy and formulaic (Holden).

"CHOCOLAT," starring Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom (PG-13, 121 minutes). In the late 1950's during Lent, a free-spirited chocolatier (Ms. Binoche) takes on the hypocritical forces of morality in a small French town: in other words, "Like Water, for Footloose." Mr. Hallstrom puts an impressive group of actors through their crowd-pleasing paces, a cast that includes Lena Olin, Victoire Thivisol, Judi Dench, Leslie Caron, John Wood, Alfred Molina (who's asked to do the work of several actors) and Mr. Depp. Ms. Binoche is such an aggressively wholesome proponent of good times -- D. H. Lawrence's "Mary Poppins" -- that the sanctimony practiced by the mayor (Mr. Molina) seems a lot more inviting (Elvis Mitchell).

* "CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON," starring Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi. Directed by Ang Lee (PG-13, 120 minutes). Mr. Lee puts his particular stamp on the Hong Kong action film, and it results in "Sense and Sensibility" with a body count. Mr. Lee and the writer James Schamus are careful to invoke all the conventions of the genre, affectionately exposing them to parodic excess: there's so much high-flying swordplay that the movie seems to have repealed the laws of gravity. Mr. Lee also gives the proceedings a soulfulness not endemic to the genre. Mr. Chow comes across as the Cary Grant of the blade. But Zhang Ziyi is the real focal point of the film, and she claims it for herself (Mitchell).

"DOUBLE TAKE," starring Orlando Jones and Eddie Griffin. Directed by George Gallo (P-13, 88 minutes). A shell game of a movie that will do anything to hustle a chuckle out of an audience. Mr. Jones is a smooth-talking investment banker named Daryl who finds himself implicated in a multi-million-dollar swindle while mysterious killers dog his tracks. The motormouth Mr. Griffin is a small-time con man who agrees to take on Daryl's identity as a life-saving gesture. "Double Take" has a criminal lack of attention -- it ruthlessly sacrifices its own logic on a regular basis for a cheap laugh (Mitchell).

"THE FAMILY MAN," starring Nicolas Cage. Directed by Brett Ratner (PG-13, 120 minutes). A Christmas drag. The hardworking Mr. Cage, deft and minimal, stars as a single, wealthy buccaneer of a Manhattan capitalist who's magically tossed into a life he could have had but chose to walk away from. He's transformed into a suburbanite with a temperamental minivan, two kids and a wife (Tea Leoni in a welcome return to the screen). This is not his beautiful wife, this is not his beautiful car, this is not his father's Oldsmobile. He's trapped in New Jersey in a movie that's a little of "Groundhog Day," a little of "A Christmas Carol" and a little of "It's a Wonderful Life." Despite a few laughs and Mr. Ratner's requisite confidence in fish-out-of-water comedy, the movie is forlorn and flat. Mr. Cage seems as depressed with money as he is without it; in Hollywood propaganda terms, this means the wealthy have souls, too. But, apparently, no shame (Mitchell).

* "THE HOUSE OF MIRTH," starring Gillian Anderson. Directed by Terence Davies (PG, 140 minutes). One of Edith Wharton's greatest novels has been adapted by this English director into a powerful but extremely somber feminist allegory in which Ms. Anderson (somewhat miscast as Lily Bart but powerful nonetheless) is a precociously modern woman crushed by the cruel hypocrisies of New York society in 1905. More Dickensian than Whartonian in its telling, the story of Lily's downfall still has a crushing force. Laura Linney is exquisite as the treacherous, two-faced Berthe Dorset, who engineers her destruction (Holden).

"MISS CONGENIALITY," starring Sandra Bullock, Michael Caine and Benjamin Bratt. Directed by Donald Petrie (PG-13, 105 minutes). Ms. Bullock plays Grace Hart, a slovenly, barely socialized F.B.I. agent who goes undercover at a beauty pageant where she discovers, much against her will, her feminine side and wins the love of her studly co-worker. The picture is contentedly second-rate -- it seems made for airline viewing -- but a supporting cast that includes Candice Bergen as the pageant's brittle director, William Shatner as its dotty host and Mr. Caine as a pink-shirted Pygmalion provides a few nice comic moments (Scott).

"SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE," starring John Malkovich, Willem Dafoe and Eddie Izzard. Directed by E. Elias Merhige (R, 90 minutes). Mr. Merhige's ambitious and uneven film is based on an audacious premise: that Max Schreck, who gave a haunting performance in F. W. Murnau's silent classic "Nosferatu," was really a vampire. As played by Mr. Dafoe, Schreck is both sinister and oddly sympathetic, and his struggle with the megalomaniacal Murnau (Mr. Malkovich) gives the film a flavor of Gothic behind-the-scenes comedy. Mr. Dafoe's intriguing performance and Mr. Merhige's keen visual intelligence -- most evident in his uncanny re-creations of scenes from "Nosferatu" -- offset the picture's dubious central metaphor, which is that moviemaking is, at bottom, a form of vampirism (Scott).

"STATE AND MAIN," starring Alec Baldwin, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy, Sarah Jessica Parker and David Paymer. Written and directed by David Mamet (R, 102 minutes). Mr. Mamet's satire about a Hollywood film crew on location in a picturesque Vermont town offers an amusingly jaundiced inside view of narcissists and other movie types bumping heads and corrupting the townies. Mr. Baldwin and Ms. Parker are the spoiled stars, Mr. Paymer the shark producer, Mr. Macy the hysterical director and Mr. Hoffman the depressed screenwriter. Funny but unpolished, uncinematic and unevenly cast (Holden).

* "TRAFFIC," starring Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Dennis Quaid, Benicio Del Toro, Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 140 minutes). Not since "Nashville" or maybe even "The Godfather" has Hollywood turned out an epic as resonant as Mr. Soderbergh's densely layered study of the Mexican drug trade and its devastating impact on the United States. In weaving together multiple stories, this intricate thriller, adapted from a British mini-series, jumps from Tijuana to Washington to San Diego to suburban Ohio. Mr. Douglas is the new American drug czar, Ms. Zeta-Jones the ruthless wife of a busted drug lord and Mr. Del Toro a Mexican policeman. Mr. Cheadle and Mr. Guzman are a team of government agents whose bust of a cynical midlevel dealer (Miguel Ferrer) precipitates much of the drama. Shot with hand-held cameras, "Traffic" builds into a profound and gloomy meditation on greed, violence and contemporary ennui. Perhaps last year's most remarkable acting debut belongs to Erika Christensen as Mr. Douglas's angry, drug-addicted 16-year-old daughter (Holden).

"WHAT WOMEN WANT," starring Mel Gibson, Helen Hunt, Alan Alda and Marisa Tomei. Directed by Nancy Meyers (PG-13, 123 minutes). "Tootsie" for the slow-witted. Mr. Gibson plays a happy chauvinist ad executive who suddenly gets the power to read women's thoughts. Before "Women" settles into sentimentality, Mr. Gibson's ring-a-ding 60's-style swingle is a gas to watch. He's happy to be liberated from having to slam a clip into a Glock. But unlike the Rock Hudson-Doris Day comedies that inspired "Women," no one bothered to define the women, and they're so uncomplicated it's a form of neglect. Ms. Tomei makes a huge impression as a damaged-goods actress who falls into Mr. Gibson's clutches (Mitchell).

* "YOU CAN COUNT ON ME," starring Laura Linney, Mark Ruffalo, Matthew Broderick, Jon Tenney and Rory Culkin. Written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan (R, 111 minutes). This small, realistic gem, set in an upstate New York town, looks deeply and empathetically into the loving but strained relationship between Sammy (Ms. Linney), a single mother with an 8-year-old son, and Terry (Mr. Ruffalo), her wastrel brother who returns home after serving a jail sentence. The two share a special bond, having lost their parents in a car crash when they were children. Mr. Broderick is Sammy's stuffy new boss at the bank where she works as a loan officer. The tensions that erupt may not be the most melodramatic domestic problems ever filmed, but they're the stuff of life, and Ms. Linney's and Mr. Ruffalo's performances are achingly perfect (Holden).

Film Series

"THE DECALOGUE." When Stephen Holden, film critic of The New York Times, compiled his list of the 10 best films of 2000, he included a work created in 1988-89. And he called it a masterwork. He was discussing "The Decalogue," a cycle of 10 fables loosely based on the Ten Commandments and created for Polish television by Krzysztof Kieslowski (1941-1996). "The Decalogue," set in and around a Warsaw housing development, was released in theaters only last year. Beginning today, an opportunity to see this remarkable mini-series on the large screen arises again with the start of showings of 35-millimeter prints in the BAMcinematek repertory program at the BAM Rose Cinemas. The films, each about 55 minutes and subtitled in English, are to be shown in sequence at the rate of two weekly. The series begins with Decalogues I (Thou shalt have no other gods before me) and II (Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain). The first deals with the consequences of a father's allegiance to science and technology and the second with the workings of fate on an ailing husband and the unborn child his wife has conceived by another man. Screening times for the first week are 2 and 9:30 p.m. today through Sunday and 9:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday. "The Decalogue" continues through Feb. 22 at the BAM Rose Cinemas at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene. Tickets: $9; $5 for children under 12 and the elderly and for students at weekday screenings. Information and full schedule: (718) 636-4157 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

HEADLINE: TRANSITION IN WASHINGTON; 
Excerpts From Senate Hearing on Norton's Selection as Interior Secretary

 BODY:
Following are Gale A. Norton's opening statement yesterday at her confirmation hearing for secretary of the interior and excerpts from questions and answers between Ms. Norton and Senators Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico; Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska; and Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, as recorded by Federal News Service Inc.:

Ms. Norton
 I'm glad to have this chance to tell you something about the goals that President-elect Bush and I share and which we hope to achieve, if you see fit to confirm me as secretary of the interior. 
 As you all know, America is a land of singular beauty. Americans are proud of the many exquisite national treasures within our shores. President-elect Bush believes, as I do, that the top priority of the Department of the Interior must be to conserve those natural treasures. One of President-elect Bush's priorities is to protect our national park system. We plan to return scientists to our parks and to work with Congress to eliminate the major maintenance backlogs that have been obstacles to resource protection, and to do that within five years. This initiative would help restore our national parks and ensure a positive legacy of protecting our cultural, natural and recreational treasures for Americans today and in the future. 
The great wild places and unspoiled landscapes of this country are the common heritage of all Americans, and we must both conserve them and manage them for Americans living today, and for the Americans of the future, our children and our children's children. That is our goal. I don't think any of us here today would disagree on that goal. In that, I believe, lies the basis for common ground. We have the opportunity for bipartisan environmental cooperation and leadership. 
I've worked for more than 20 years on environmental issues. I'm proud of my accomplishments: preserving endangered species, cleaning up mountain valleys polluted by mining, working to convert the Rocky Mountain Arsenal from a place polluted by pesticides and nerve gas residues to a wildlife refuge.
Based on these experiences, I am firmly committed to a process of consultation and collaboration. We should listen to all voices and involve all citizens. That is fair. It is also wise. People are a magnificent resource for ideas, for knowledge, for insights.
I've lived and worked here in Washington. I have also lived and worked in the great American West. Those of us here in Washington need to be good partners with Americans living in other parts of this country and in our territories. America is a stronger nation because of the diversity of its people. These people hold many different views and perspectives. We need to work with them, to involve them, to benefit from their creativity and their capacity to innovate.
One top priority that I want to mention to you today concerns the special responsibilities of the secretary of the interior with regard to American Indians. I think we should all recognize that the situation in Indian country is not as it should be. There is much that I believe we can do, in partnership with our nation's proud Native American tribes, to improve conditions and provide a more hopeful future.
President-elect Bush has said many times that he will leave no child behind. To accomplish that requires that we improve the schools that serve more than 50,000 Native American children. A good education is the key to a better life for any child, whether that child lives in Washington, D.C., or Miami, Fla., or on a reservation in New Mexico.
Recognizing the historic relationship of the federal government and native American tribal governments, I will work very hard to achieve real results for every Indian child.
President-elect Bush has proposals to build conservation partnerships, to help states, local communities and private landowners to conserve wildlife habitat, watersheds and open space. I'm excited by the chance to work together on these proposals. Working together, there is much that we can do to promote conservation in the United States.
Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I will be candid in telling you that I am both a conservative and a conservationist. I see no conflict there. In fact, I am a compassionate conservative and a passionate conservationist. I believe that, too, is entirely consistent.
If confirmed as secretary of the interior, I intend to make the conservation of America's natural resources my top priority. Using consultation and collaboration, forging partnerships with interested citizens, we can succeed in our effort to conserve America's most precious places. What's more, we can achieve this while maintaining America's prosperity and economic dynamism, while respecting constitutional rights and nurturing diverse traditions and cultures.
It won't always be easy. It will require a lot of hard work and the willingness to be creative, to think outside the usual boxes.
That is the mission that President-elect Bush has asked me to undertake. With your help, your wisdom and your cooperation, I believe that we can succeed.
Thank you very much.

Questions and Answers

SENATOR BINGAMAN -- A few years ago, according to writing that you did, you described yourself as a free-market conservative, an advocate of judicial restraint, as well as a champion of states' rights. And over the years, you have taken some positions on the takings clause, for example, on the federal taxing power, on the 10th Amendment, on the now long-discredited theory about economic due process, which seem, at least as I read some of those earlier writings of yours, to be at odds with mainstream legal thought.
Can you give this committee assurance that if confirmed, you would feel comfortable enforcing the existing laws and regulations of the Department of Interior as they now stand?

MS. NORTON -- Mr. Chairman, I have served eight years in the capacity of the state attorney general, enforcing the laws of Colorado and of the United States. And I feel very comfortable in enforcing the laws as they are written. I will be fully committed to ensuring that our nation's environmental laws and laws for the protection of natural resources will be fully enforced.

Q. Many of the Republican members of Congress, some on this committee, have been sharply critical of the environmental initiatives and policies of Secretary Babbitt and of President Clinton and his administration. Which, if any, of those legal or policy positions that have been adopted by the Department of Interior during this last eight years would you depart from or attempt to change?

A. There are many things that have been adopted over the past few years. We will be looking at what needs to be changed, in our views, and the many things that will remain the same. We will examine issues across the board and apply the best legal standards, as well as the views that I believe many of us would share, to ensure that we are doing the best to preserve our natural resources. At this point, I'm not sure where we may depart from the past administration, but we will carefully examine those things and work with this Congress in order to examine issues.

Q. One issue that the president and the secretary of interior, the current secretary of interior, have been roundly criticized about by Republicans here in the Congress is this issue of designation of national monuments. I believe this president has designated 19 areas as national monuments under the authority that he has under the Antiquities Act. Do you believe that the president's use of that Antiquities Act, President Clinton's use of that Antiquities Act, was appropriate or not?

A. The goal of preserving lands is an admirable goal, and I share the goal of trying to be sure that we are identifying those areas that ought to be natural treasures and setting those aside. The process in which those decisions were made is one that causes me concern. Many of those decisions were made through a top-down process without consulting the people who are most affected by those decisions. President-elect Bush has established his view, and I certainly share that, that decisions about the land should be made in a process that includes the people who are affected by those decisions.
And I would certainly hope that in the future we would hear input from those of you on this committee, from governors, from local communities before we take actions that are going to deeply impact people's lives.

Q. Would you advocate repeal of the Antiquities Act or some changes in that basic statute?

A. The Antiquities Act is something that has been very useful in the past. It has shown its ability to preserve some of our most important national monuments. I would like to see a process of involvement of the people most affected by decisions. That certainly would be the practice that would be followed in a Bush administration if I am selected to be secretary of the interior. Whether that would require changes in that statute for the long term is a decision that I have not made in terms of what we would advocate and obviously would require Congressional action in order to make any of those changes. . . .

SENATOR MURKOWSKI -- Do you feel that you can bring together within this new administration the wherewithal and the policy makers to resolve and make some decisions about how we're going to relieve our dependence on imports of 56 percent going up to, we heard this morning, 62 by the year 2004? Our greatest source seems to be coming now from Saddam Hussein. We fought a war in '92; we lost 147 lives. We can't address what to do with our nuclear waste. Oil prices continue to go up. We're looking towards natural gas; now we're using it faster than we're finding it. You're going to have to come up with some of these answers with your collective colleagues. How do you propose to do it?

A. The issue of Americans being so dependent on foreign oil is, obviously, a great cause for concern. The idea that people in California, this very day, are facing serious shortages of energy is another great cause of concern. We will have to pull together all of our resources and work across departmental lines to find ways of addressing those issues.
Obviously, it's going to be difficult to find short-term answers. We'll have to do a lot of planning to be able to find long-term answers. We would hope to work with you to find the right kinds of solutions that would balance environmental protection, as well as finding ways of providing the kind of energy resources that need to be available.

Q. I think it's appropriate that I bring up the issue of ANWR Alaska National Wildlife Refuge , because some would be disappointed if I didn't. In any event, many members of our environmental community have opposed your nomination because of the president-elect's position on environmentally responsible oil and gas exploration in that small portion of the Arctic coastal plain in my state of Alaska. However, the reality is you nor the president currently has the authority to open up this area. Only Congress has that authority.
And in this regard, I have two questions for you. If Congress is to undertake the debate on this issue, will you commit to aid those debates with the very best science available from the Department of Interior?

A. Absolutely. I view the role of the Department of Interior as helping provide the information to this Congress so that you can make an informed decision. We hope to look at the issues of how we can provide the best scientific evaluation of the environmental consequences, how we can do any exploration and production, if it is done, in the absolute most environmentally conscious way that we can have that happen.

Q. My second question is, if Congress approves a measure to allow exploration and development of the coastal plain and it becomes law, will you uphold the law Congress passes and use all the powers afforded to you to mitigate any potential negative environmental consequences?

A. I will certainly follow any laws that are passed, to be sure that the protection of the important resources of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are preserved at the same time that any exploration or production would take place.

Q. Thank you. Now moving over to Prudhoe Bay, which was discovered 30-some odd years ago. In the search for oil in Prudhoe Bay, which has been providing this nation with about 20 percent of the total domestic crude oil produced for some 27 years, and it's falling off now as Prudhoe Bay declines, but not looking for it, but as a sidelight, we found some 36 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Nobody paid much attention to it because of the cost of getting that gas out when gas was $2.16 per thousand cubic feet, which is what it was a year ago. Now gas is $8.40. And as we look at our reserves and the fact that we're pulling down our reserves, there is more and more thought given to marketing that gas.
In order for this to become a reality it's going to take a transportation system and it's going to require an investment of about $10 billion, the largest single construction project that would be on the horizon, and larger than anything that we've undertaken in this country.
Should the owners of the gas decide to move forward with such a project, the Department of Interior, through the Joint Pipeline Office, will have an awful lot to say about the permitting and development. My question to you is, if confirmed, will you act in your role as secretary to provide all the resources needed to the Joint Pipeline Office in Alaska to help expedite a project of this magnitude if indeed it becomes a reality?

A. I'm aware of the important need for natural gas not just because our economy is expanding and there's more demand for energy, but also because natural gas is seen as one of the ways of having the cleanest supply of energy. So it's important for us to have some mechanisms to be able to draw upon gas resources.
I will look forward to working with you to learn more about that issue. It's not one that I have had the opportunity, obviously, to discuss the details on. I will look forward to working with you so that we can resolve that issue. . . . 

SENATOR DORGAN -- You have written that there is little consensus over whether global warming is occurring. Do you think there's any kind of a scientific consensus at all that there is some significant climate change occurring or global warming occurring?

A. Global warming is an issue that has seen scientific information developing over time. And the further we go through the process, the more information we have available.
The article that you referred to is something that was written several years ago. I will maintain an open mind and receive new scientific information as it is put forward.

Q. But my question is, do you think there's a consensus on any side of this issue? Some would say, you know, while there are doubters, certainly, and some respected doubters, there seems to be a fairly overwhelming consensus among most scientists that something is occurring in the area of global warming. Do you share that view?

A. It does seem, based on my evaluation, which is not a scientific one, that there is beginning to be more of a consensus that global warming is occurring. There is still disagreement as to the causes and the long-term future. And obviously, there is disagreement about what ought to be done in that regard. I will certainly rely on scientific information as it becomes available and evaluate the information as it is presented to me.

HEADLINE: TRANSITION IN WASHNGTON: THE PRESIDENT-ELECT; 
G.O.P. Begins a Party 8 Years in the Making

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Forty-eight hours before settling into the Oval Office, President-elect George W. Bush kicked off a Republican takeover of Washington today with a whirl of celebrations, private dinners with big contributors, and a concert and fireworks show attended by thousands of supporters.
 Holding hands with his wife, Laura, Mr. Bush descended the steps of the Lincoln Memorial this afternoon to the strains of Aaron Copland's "Appalachian Spring" in the first major event leading to his swearing in Saturday as the 43rd president of the United States. Then he took a seat on the reviewing stand for an eclectic performance by singers, actors and athletes -- everyone from Ricky Martin to Andrew Lloyd Webber, Muhammad Ali and Mr. Bush's own choice for secretary of state, Colin L. Powell, who introduced Dara Torres, the Olympic swimmer -- in the chilly, damp night air. 
 It was on the same steps, eight years ago, that Bill Clinton celebrated the imminent takeover of the White House from another Bush. So today's ceremonies had the air of a political restoration, punctuated by the presence of many of Mr. Bush's father's advisers, who have resurfaced in the new administration. 
On Capitol Hill, the arguments over two of Mr. Bush's selections, John Ashcroft for attorney general and Gale A. Norton for interior secretary, continued to boil. But Mr. Bush -- perhaps buoyed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's unanimous endorsement of General Powell today -- sounded only moderate, inclusive notes, the same notes expected in his Inaugural Address. 
"I want everybody to hear loud and clear that I'm going to be the president of everybody," Mr. Bush said this morning to a meeting of the Republican National Committee, acknowledging indirectly that he had lost the popular vote, even while winning 30 states and the electoral vote. "Whether they voted for me or not, I'm their president."
Corporate America certainly demonstrated that he was its president: General Motors held a glittering cocktail party this evening on the roof of the Kennedy Center for Mr. Bush's White House chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., who until last year was the company's chief lobbyist here. Carmakers, other major corporations and law firms have events planned through the weekend. 
Mr. Bush was so busy running among dinners here this evening -- the cost to attend was $2,500 a plate -- that his spokesman said he had had no time to watch Mr. Clinton's farewell address on television.
Mr. Clinton used the speech to warn against three dangers: failing to pay down the national debt, retreating from the policy of engagement and open trade with great powers and the developing world, and ignoring racial and ethnic divisions.
But within the Bush camp, some aides focused not on the message but the timing, complaining that once again Mr. Clinton would not give up the stage -- insisting that he be given network broadcast time at a moment that Mr. Bush's supporters believe should belong to the president-elect.
As the Bush team spread through Washington, greeted by Republicans the way the French greeted the Allies retaking Paris, the White House was a sea of melancholy.
Surrounded by boxes of papers being shipped off to the National Archives, Mr. Clinton's aides sent e-mail messages that had the sound of the last transmissions from a sinking vessel. Many were forwarding addresses and phone numbers, now that they would no longer be instantly accessible through the White House operators. A senior aide in the Treasury Department sent invitations to a "disinauguration party."
Other members of the Clinton inner circle said they were leaving town for the weekend, unable to bear the sight of Mr. Bush taking office while Al Gore, his rival in the election, retreats to suburban Virginia.
But Mr. Clinton's top economic advisers over the past eight years flew back into town Wednesday, gathering at the Hotel Washington for a subdued celebration of their contributions to an economy that kept booming until the last few months of the administration.
"I worked with many great people in this administration," former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, now the head of Citigroup's executive committee, told his former colleagues Wednesday night. "And I'm reminded of that every day because so many of them are in my waiting room, looking for jobs." 
In fact, many of them are moving only blocks from the White House. The current treasury secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, will be running into the head of the National Economic Council, Gene Sperling, at the Brookings Institution. 
William S. Cohen, the secretary of defense, is starting his own consulting group, but will spend time at the Center for Strategic and International Studies -- alongside enough former Clinton assistant secretaries and national security staff members to put together a daily meeting in a mock situation room.
Movers have been sweeping through the White House with such care that come noon on Saturday, there will be barely a shred of paper left on any desk in the West Wing, and no data on the computer hard drives. All of that will be shipped to the archives, leaving the Bush team to move into what is certainly the most prime real estate in Washington, and probably the barest.
"We'll leave it," one staff member said, "exactly as we found it on the afternoon of Jan. 20, 1993."
On the Mall, the combination of unpleasant weather, the early dismissal of Washington's bureaucracy to avoid traffic foulups, and heavy security kept the audience for the inaugural concert small and unusually subdued. It did not matter: many members of the largely youthful crowd said they came less to see Mr. Bush than to watch the show.
Anna Trai, a 19-year-old from Germantown, Md., said Ricky Martin was why she arrived at 9 this morning. After he was introduced by Vice President-elect Dick Cheney, Mr. Bush himself joked, "there's a lot of excitement in the air, and I'm not sure if it's because people came to see you, or Ricky Martin."
But Mr. Bush said he found it "humbling" to realize that he would soon be among those who followed Lincoln to the presidency and said, "I am honored to serve, and I am ready to start."
 Ms. Trai found herself pressed up near a chain-link fence far from the Washington Monument, the closest that security personnel would allow people without tickets to get to Mr. Bush. It was one of many precautions being taken for fear of a terrorist attack; the subway will not even stop at some stations on Saturday.
In Washington's packed hotels, the focus was on the future. This morning Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist, dissected the election results for the Republican National Committee, suggesting ways to build on Mr. Bush's narrow victory. 
He noted that Mr. Bush got 35 percent of the Hispanic vote, the highest percentage by a Republican since 1984. "This is a dynamic and growing part of the electorate that shares our values," he said, declaring it was "our mission and our goal" to get a higher percentage of the Hispanic vote. He said that would "require all of us in every way and every day working to get that done."
He said Mr. Bush and his agenda had drawn more moderate voters than Republicans had in the past, proving that there was a "gigantic coalition" available if Republicans framed their debate with Democrats correctly. Mr. Rove also noted that Mr. Bush had received fewer votes from blacks than Bob Dole, the Republican nominee in 1996. "As a country and as a party," he said, "that has to be unacceptable to us."

Schaap, Writer and Commentator, Has a New Subject: Himself

BYLINE:  By Richard Sandomir 

 BODY:
Had the long-distance runner Pheidippides not dropped dead in 490 B.C. after running 25 miles from Marathon to Athens to tell the Greeks they had beaten the Persians, he might have hired Dick Schaap to write his life story.
 You can picture writer and first marathoner sequestered for three weeks at an Aegean resort to chat about the marathoner's life and storied military career. And Schaap would write the book in two months. 
 Schaap, silver-haired and 66 years old, has seemingly been around forever. He is renowned as the co-author of 13 autobiographies, as a print journalist, as an ESPN and ABC News commentator and as the father of the ESPN reporter Jeremy Schaap. 
Now, after writing books about other people, he has written one about himself, "Flashing Before My Eyes" (William Morrow), a breezy and delightful work of staggering anecdotage featuring a cast of just about everybody he has ever met.
Schaap hoped to call the book "Name-Dropping." But the economist John Kenneth Galbraith and the comedian Alan King had already used it. Dropping names is Schaap's forte. By my count -- and I confess to counting the equines, cats and dogs that Schaap has commiserated with -- he drops 531 names in his book. 
Nearly two a page.
"For years," he said, "I used 'Name-Dropping' as the title of the speech I gave because name-dropping is my living, dropping names into sentences and microphones."
Schaap is connected to more people than Kevin Bacon, whose film career with ensemble casts created a parlor game that quickly links him to everyone in Hollywood history.
He played lacrosse against Jim Brown, surrendering four goals.
His housemate during a summer spent at a steel company was the "Gong Show" creator and host, Chuck Barris.
He introduced Cassius Clay to Harlem and Sugar Ray Robinson.
He took Bobby Fischer to a Knicks game and prowled drug dens (to research a story) with Peter Falk.
Along with his second wife, he slept at Wilt Chamberlain's mansion.
Years later, after Chamberlain wrote of his 20,000 female liaisons, Schaap's wife, Trish, touched the great center on his elbow and asked, "Does that count?"
He covered the 1960 World Series in Pittsburgh and, while there, befriended the comedian Lenny Bruce, who was performing in the city. They discovered they had both grown up in Freeport, N.Y.
He is the most-used talking head in ESPN Classic's "SportsCentury."
"Mark calls and I ask, 'Do you want a quote or an anecdote?' " Schaap said, referring to Mark Shapiro, ESPN Classic's top executive.
"He's got all this information locked up in his head," Shapiro said.
ESPN Classic is making a two-hour documentary based on Schaap's book, in which Schaap will shift to talking about himself.
One recent Sunday, after he taped his weekly ESPN panel show, "The Sports Reporters," Schaap walked into Barney Greengrass, the Manhattan loxsmith. He was greeted by Gary Greengrass, the owner, who is connected to Schaap by more than sliced nova: he was a high school intern at Channel 4 when Schaap delivered the nightly sportscast.
His people collection is so large that he omitted an index to prevent friends from putting the book back on a store shelf once they had seen what he had written about them.
Like any memoir, Schaap's is an exercise in ego. He has a thriving one, but he's happy to laugh at himself. In an early draft of the book, he said, he tried to top his tales about others, then omitted his toppers to be more self-deprecating.
"If you're going to write about yourself, I felt, you should make yourself the butt of the jokes," he said. "Or, you can do it the way Romain Gary did it in his autobiography. Lie. He wrote about falling in love as an 8-year-old with a 7-year-old girl. To impress her, he said he ate his galoshes."
Schaap's professional life has been charmed as he moved from Newsweek to The New York Herald Tribune to Sport magazine to Channel 4 to ABC to ESPN. 
He is inextricably connected to sports, but is as personally attached to the theater, which he reviews regularly for the ABC News overnight show "World News Now."
So with all this stuff crammed in his brain and in cartons, it was time to ask himself to write his autobiography. "It was a pleasure to write in my voice," he said. "I was accessible, so I knew how to reach me, which isn't always easy with an athlete."
What is not on view in Schaap's tome is a glimpse into his inner life. Obviously, Schaap refused to open up very much to himself.
"I'm not very reflective," he said reflectively. "Maybe if you don't reflect, you don't hurt as much."
Omitted from the book, but revealed over Schaap's cheese omelet, is the judgment of one of his six children, Joanna, a poet and editor, who was named for Schaap's pal Joe Namath, whose memoir he wrote and whose talk show he was co-host of.
"She once wrote me an angry note saying my progress from being friendly with Lenny Bruce to being friendly with Billy Crystal showed how far I'd fallen," Schaap said. "She's also written poems where I perceive myself to be the villain."
Such villainy may be an intrafamily notion, because to generations of sports fans he has presented a knowledgeable, avuncular image.
"I'm very lucky that people think I'm a nice guy," he said in his raspy voice, "whether I am or not."

AIRWAVES
PHIL SIMMS has signed a new contract worth at least $2 million annually to continue as CBS's lead National Football League analyst. . . . BRENT MUSBURGER has also agreed to a new multiyear deal at ABC Sports.

HEADLINE: TRANSITION IN WASHINGTON: THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT; 
Few Answers and Few Waves At Energy Designee's Hearing

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
President-elect George W. Bush's choice for energy secretary, Spencer Abraham, today disavowed the position he had taken as a senator to dismantle the Energy Department, answering the only question put to him about his energy record at a congenial confirmation hearing.
 Mr. Abraham was pressed a little harder on what the federal government should do about the California electricity crisis, but he refused to comment, saying he did not want to upset negotiations there among utilities, generators and state legislators. 
 Although Mr. Abraham has been selected to head a department facing many contentious issues, members of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources failed to extract specifics from him on most of the questions they asked. 
Most senators referred to the nominee, who is a former colleague, as Spence, but informality did not squeeze out the bizarre. Following Senate tradition, the nominee was introduced by the senators from his own state, Michigan, one of whom is Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat who defeated Mr. Abraham in November in his bid for a second term. The state's other senator, Carl Levin, also a Democrat, referred to the presentation as "American democracy at its ironic best." 
In about three hours, most of it taken up by panel members voicing their own opinions on subjects ranging from electricity shortages and gasoline mileage to nuclear waste, Mr. Abraham made these points: 
*The electric generation industry's shift to building plants that run almost exclusively on natural gas is creating an unbalanced system. 
*The National Nuclear Security Agency may be conducting too many lie-detector tests, subjecting even Mr. Abraham himself to the procedure.
*Nuclear waste cleanup may need to be altered so the nation can "begin to gain some ground on the cleanup of these sites."
"Overhead and security issues have consumed so much of the budget," Mr. Abraham complained. Environmental management will cost about $6.75 billion this year, he said, about a third of the department's spending. Hardly any land has been completely cleaned, but the work has cut the risk of spread of contamination in some cases, department officials say.
Mr. Abraham referred to the need for a "balanced" energy solution, including increased domestic production of oil and gas, conservation and more use of renewable energy sources, and decreased reliance on imported oil. But he offered no specifics about how to achieve these goals.
Environmental groups complained today that as a senator from Michigan, Mr. Abraham opposed increases in fuel economy standards; today he said he thought the market was moving faster than was possible for the government to turn out fuel-efficient hybrid vehicles.
After a break for lunch, the committee approved Mr. Abraham's selection by unanimous voice vote. But while members were supportive, several offered words of caution. Senator Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska, a Republican who will become chairman of the committee after the presidential inauguration, told Mr. Abraham, "This is not necessarily a glamorous position."
While committee members seemed eager to pass legislation intended to cut reliance on oil imports, one, Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, said Congress would have to do better than in 1979, after the last oil crisis.
The major bills then, he said, were the Synfuels Act, a billion-dollar effort to make liquid vehicle fuel from solid fuels; the Natural Gas Policy Act, which controlled the price of that fuel; the Fuel Use Act, which forbade the use of natural gas in power plants; the Windfall Profits Tax, which put price limits on oil, and the Energy Allocation Act, which gave government the power to distribute scarce supplies.
All were later repealed, he said.

HEADLINE: TRANSITION IN WASHINGTON: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
Selling Point Is a Sore One

BYLINE:  By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
One of George W. Bush's selling points during the primary campaign last year was inclusiveness. In two campaigns for governor, he and his backers argued, he had done better among blacks and other minorities than most other Republicans, and he would do so in the presidential race.
 Mr. Bush urged his party to remember that it carried "the mantle of Lincoln." As if in response, the Republicans gave unusually prominent roles to African-American speakers and performers at their convention in Philadelphia. 
 None of it made much difference. He won only 9 percent of the black vote, tying Ronald Reagan for the worst showing by a Republican presidential nominee in many years.
On Saturday, African-Americans will be prominent among those protesting at Mr. Bush's inauguration, even though he has chosen for his cabinet the first black secretary of state and a widely respected black educator.
Ask black politicians about the appointments, and they quickly change the subject to Florida, where, they assert, antiquated voting equipment and unfriendly electoral officials in minority precincts illegitimately tipped the outcome to Mr. Bush.
"A majority of African-Americans think that the election was stolen," said David Bositis, an analyst of minority voting at the Joint Center for Economic Studies, a think tank here.
The bitterness that many black voters and their white allies feel toward the president-elect was on vivid display as the Senate Judiciary Committee pressed Mr. Bush's choice of former Senator John Ashcroft as attorney general.
With attention centered on Judge Ronnie L. White of the Missouri Supreme Court, an African-American, and Mr. Ashcroft's success in blocking his nomination as a federal judge, the session was supercharged with racial tension.
Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat, said Mr. Ashcroft had applied a double standard, campaigning for Judge White's defeat last year on grounds that he was soft on crime while voting to approve other, more liberal white judges. Senator Alan J. Dixon of Illinois, regarded as a moderate Democrat in his home state, joined in the attack, suggesting that Judge White had been vilified for Mr. Ashcroft's selfish political ends.
Describing Mr. Ashcroft as "racially insensitive," Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware said at a committee hearing on Wednesday: "People are suspect not because they believe you are a racist. They are suspect because they believe your ideology blinds you not just to the law but to the facts."
As they always do, the senators cloaked the intensity of their feelings in polite legislative language. But Senator Dixon's suggestion that Mr. Ashcroft had derailed Judge White's nomination in an effort to save his own political skin in an ultimately unsuccessful re-election campaign went well beyond the politesse usually observed by sitting senators in dealing with a former colleague. So did Senator Edward M. Kennedy's red-faced suggestions that Mr. Ashcroft had spoken treasonously, or something close to it, in arguing that citizens needed firearms to defend themselves against a potentially tyrannical central government.
Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican, said that today's session was the roughest he had sat through in more than 21 years on the committee -- rougher even than the notably contentious Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Robert H. Bork and Clarence Thomas. Several other Republicans warned the Democrats to moderate their language and remain collegial.
In a sense, Mr. Ashcroft has reminded African-Americans of some of the president-elect's own missteps. Mr. Bush spoke at Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C., during the campaign, although it had a history of forbidding interracial dating; Mr. Ashcroft, it turned out, spoke there, too. Mr. Bush refused to call for the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the South Carolina Capitol; Mr. Ashcroft, it turned out, gave an interview to a magazine called Southern Partisan that avidly celebrates the Confederacy.
In a brief time, the Missourian has become the leading symbol of Mr. Bush's difficulties with black voters. He is highly likely to be confirmed, and as attorney general he will help Mr. Bush solidify his political base. But his presence at the Justice Department will make it very difficult for the department and the administration to establish effective communications with African-Americans other than the tiny group of black Republicans.
No matter how many black judges Mr. Ashcroft has voted to confirm, no matter how vocally he has decried segregation, the black community seems determined to view him as walking, talking evidence that Mr. Bush is deaf to its interests.
Speaking at Northwestern University early this week, before he was knocked off stride by the revelation that he had fathered a child out of wedlock, Jesse Jackson stated the indictment: "Ashcroft, if he gets through, will determine who is prosecuted, who is targeted, who will be judged, who will go to jail. He cannot be trusted."
Mr. Bush's popularity among black voters apparently sank with the attempt to use the Philadelphia convention as a symbol of a new, open attitude.
Black leaders denounced the convention as phony, and several described it as "a minstrel show."
Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco said that it reminded him of a National Basketball Association game: "All the people on the stage are black, and all the people in the audience are white."
Studies by the Joint Center found that Mr. Bush's favorable rating among black voters dropped from 43 percent in May 1999, when he was pondering a run for president, to 29 percent at the end of September 2000, when the campaign was nearing a climax. The more African-Americans saw of Mr. Bush, said Mr. Bositis, who designed the polls, "the less they liked him."
More fuel went onto the fire in the November imbroglio in Florida, with Kweisi Mfume, president of the N.A.A.C.P., charging that there had been disproportionate purging of voter rolls and other chicanery in mainly African-American precincts.
Now Mr. Bush, about to cross the threshold of the White House, faces continuing challenges from a new black militancy to his legitimacy and his ambition to be the president of all Americans, as he put it tonight. 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 20, 2001

 CORRECTION:
A front-page news analysis article yesterday about the nomination of John Ashcroft as attorney general misidentified the senator who suggested that Mr. Ashcroft had vilified Judge Ronnie White for selfish political ends. It was Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, not Alan J. Dixon, who left the Senate in 1993. The article also referred incorrectly to Mr. Ashcroft's views on a civil rights issue. He has deplored segregation, not desegregation.

HEADLINE: Jackson Says He Fathered Child in Affair With Aide 

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
The Rev. Jesse Jackson acknowledged early today that he had fathered a child out of wedlock with an employee in his civil rights organization, the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. 
 Mr. Jackson, in a statement issued because a supermarket tabloid, The National Enquirer, was preparing to disclose the information, said he would be curtailing his public activities while "taking some time off to revive my spirit and reconnect with my family." 
 One of the nation's most prominent political leaders and civil rights activists, Mr. Jackson is a Baptist minister and a former aide to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He sought the Democratic nomination for president twice, in 1984 and 1988.
Mr. Jackson, a friend of President Clinton's, was a special envoy to Africa and served as a spiritual adviser to the Clinton family during the impeachment proceedings over Mr. Clinton's extramarital affair in the White House.
Today Mr. Jackson, who has been married for 38 years, said in the statement: "This is no time for evasions, denials or alibis. I fully accept responsibility, and I am truly sorry for my actions." 
Advisers to Mr. Jackson said he had had an affair with Karin L. Stanford, whom he met when she was an assistant professor of political science and African-American studies at the University of Georgia and writing a book about Mr. Jackson's impact on foreign policy, "Beyond the Boundaries: Reverend Jesse Jackson and International Affairs," which was published in 1997.
Mr. Jackson hired Dr. Stanford to be director of the Washington bureau of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, a nonprofit organization that seeks economic and political power for minorities, and aides said they became involved after she joined the organization. In May 1999, Dr. Stanford gave birth to Mr. Jackson's child, a girl.
"As her mother does, I love this child very much," Mr. Jackson, 59, said in the statement, "and have assumed responsibility for her emotional and financial support since she was born."
A Jackson adviser said Mr. Jackson was paying Dr. Stanford, who is 39, about $3,000 a month to support their daughter. He also paid about $40,000 in expenses to help her move to Los Angeles from Washington, the adviser said, adding that the money came from Mr. Jackson's personal savings. 
Efforts to reach Dr. Stanford by telephone were unsuccessful. 
Jackson advisers said that after the baby was born Mr. Jackson told his wife, Jackie, and their five children, including Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr., Democrat of Illinois. The congressman issued a statement today, saying, "Over the course of nearly four decades of marriage, my father and our family have survived many dangers and endured many crises and, with God's help, we hope to endure this one as well."
In his statement, the senior Mr. Jackson, who declined to be interviewed, alluded to the fact that he was also a product of an out-of-wedlock union. 
"I was born of these circumstances, and I know the importance of growing up in a nurturing, supportive and protected environment," he said, "so I am determined to give my daughter and her mother the privacy they both deserve." 
A spokesman, John Scanlon, said Mr. Jackson would keep his short-term public commitments, although it was unclear whether he would still participate in protests in Washington at President-elect George W. Bush's inauguration. Mr. Jackson's other forthcoming events include a conference, scheduled for next week, of the Wall Street Project, an initiative that seeks to persuade corporations to provide more opportunities for women and minorities by increasing their hiring and capital investment in rural areas and inner cities. 
Mr. Scanlon said he did not know how long Mr. Jackson would be keeping a low profile. 
Supporters urged people not to condemn Mr. Jackson.
"I remind people that Reverend Jesse Jackson should not be judged by just this situation," the Rev. Al Sharpton said in a news conference in New York City. "We should remember that for 35 years, it was Jesse Jackson who walked a picket line, that marched, that went to jail, that went to foreign shores to bring home prisoners of war for this nation. It was Jesse Jackson that raised issues that others didn't raise. Jesse Jackson should not be seen just in one limited and one-dimensional act."
Jake Siewert, a White House spokesman, said President Clinton was aware of the situation, but he said did not think the president had talked yet with Mr. Jackson. 
"This is a family matter that Reverend Jackson has vowed to deal with on his own," Mr. Siewert said. "And our thoughts and prayers are with him."

HEADLINE: TRANSITION IN WASHINGTON: THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT; 
Interior Choice Faces Sharp Questioning

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Facing skeptical Senate Democrats, Gale A. Norton presented herself today as both a conservative and a conservationist and said her past legal views would not prevent her from enforcing environmental laws if she became secretary of interior.
 But on the first day of her Senate confirmation hearings, Democrats sharply questioned whether Ms. Norton's record on positions that she had taken as a lawyer, a government official and a politician would be compatible with her new post. 
 "I have no doubt that Ms. Norton is a very decent and capable person," said Senator Jeff Bingaman, the New Mexico Democrat acting as the committee's chairman. "But I have doubts about whether some of the policies she has promoted are consistent with the responsibilities of the secretary of the interior." 
"For over 20 years, she has consistently championed the interests of the individual over the public, the states over the federal government, and economic development over environmental protections," Senator Bingaman said.
Ms. Norton, 46, a former attorney general of Colorado who has been a longtime critic of federal regulation, spoke softly and carefully throughout her appearance. She gently suggested that her record had been distorted and at one point notably distanced herself from her onetime mentor, James Watt, the interior secretary who resigned under pressure in the Reagan administration.
"I mean no disrespect to him, but I am my own person," Ms. Norton said.
The challenges by the Democrats and Ms. Norton's efforts to address them formed the central dynamic in the two-hour hearing over a nomination that has been bitterly opposed by environmental groups and has become one of the most controversial of the choices to President-elect George W. Bush's cabinet.
Republicans who spoke on Ms. Norton's behalf were unanimous in predicting that she would win confirmation. Frank H. Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who will lead the committee after Inauguration Day, described the interior secretary-designate as one who "has been accused only of guilt by association, has been tarred with innuendoes and brushed with, I think, misinterpretation."
In her testimony and her response to questions, Ms. Norton said that on a number of occasions in the past, she had challenged laws that she might soon be obliged to enforce, most notably the Endangered Species Act. But like John Ashcroft, Mr. Bush's embattled attorney general choice, she said those past stances would not stand in the way of her carrying out her responsibilities.
"I feel very comfortable with enforcing the laws as they are now written," Ms. Norton said.
Ms. Norton's testimony, in a brief opening statement and in her answers to questions from nearly a dozen senators, outlined her views about public lands, which are markedly different from those embraced by the Clinton administration.
She said she had been concerned at the way President Clinton had moved over the last year to designate nearly two dozen new national monuments. She said those decisions and others by the outgoing administration would be reviewed.
When asked her views about permitting snowmobiles on public lands, she struck a tone clearly intended to appeal both to conservative off-road enthusiasts and conservationist nature lovers. "I value the preservation of our lands, and I value the ability of people to use those lands in an appropriate way," she said.
In advance of the hearings, a coalition of 18 environmental groups fighting the nomination took out a newspaper advertisement in The Washington Post and two Capitol Hill publications that displayed an image of just one-half of Ms. Norton's face and described her as "so far on the fringe" that "she's off the page."
The groups, led by the League of Conservation Voters, accused Ms. Norton of having failed to take action against corporate polluters while attorney general in Colorado. "America deserves an interior secretary who will protect our air, water and natural resources not the polluters who seek to exploit them," the advertisement said.
At today's hearing before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, several Republican senators criticized that attack in sharp terms as being out of bounds. But several Democrats said the critics had raised legitimate questions, and they said they remained to be persuaded that Ms. Norton's ideological views and her calls for changes that would give more decision making power to the states would not conflict with her federal responsibilities.
"You have to convince me in these hearings that as you provide flexibility to the states in these areas, your bottom line will be unwavering," said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. "All federal laws must be complied with, and you have to enforce them." 
In response to particular questions, Ms. Norton insisted that she had never advocated "a right to pollute," as a line in a 1991 speech had seemed to suggest. She also said that she had once declined to represent the state of Colorado in defending a minority set-aside policy not because she disagreed with the policy, but because the state's position was not legally defensible.
The state's position was ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court, in a decision that Ms. Norton described as a vindication of her views.
Throughout her appearance, Ms. Norton seemed to be trying hard to put a different gloss on an image that until now has been largely shaped by critics. Rather than emphasize her advocacy of drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, for example, she named as one of her proudest accomplishments as the Interior Department's solicitor general in the 1980's her work toward the protection of the California condor, an endangered species.
She also singled out as a top goal one mentioned by Mr. Bush in his presidential campaign: a major effort to increase financing for the national parks to overcome a backlog in maintenance and upkeep.
A onetime member of the Libertarian Party, Ms. Norton did not entirely try to disguise her conservative views, criticizing what she described as the "top-down" process by which the Clinton administration designated the national monuments without waiting for approval from Western states.
"I have lived and worked in Washington," she said. "I have lived and worked in the great American West. Those of us here in Washington need to be good partners with Americans living in other parts of this country and in our territories."
But in answer to those who have said her priority would be on oil drilling and logging on public lands, she also said that if confirmed by the Senate, "I intend to make the conservation of America's natural treasures my top priority."
"I will be candid in telling you that I am both a conservative and a conservationist," she said. 'I see no conflict there."
Ms. Norton was introduced to the committee by Colorado's two Republican senators, Ben Nighthorse Campbell and Wayne Allard, and by the state's Republican governor, Bill Owens. Governor Owens told the committee that he had once worked as an aide to Senator John Tower, and he expressed concern that Ms. Norton might suffer a fate similar to that of his former boss, whose nomination to become defense secretary under President George Bush was defeated after a round of stormy confirmation hearings.
"What I really hope is that we don't take this fine person, and tear her apart through this process," Governor Owens said.

HEADLINE: TRANSITION IN WASHINGTON: THE PRESIDENT; 
In Farewell Talk, Clinton Looks Back and Forward

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
President Clinton said goodbye to the nation tonight, using his final televised address to look back at his administration's accomplishments and warn the incoming president against retrenching from the world or squandering the country's economic prosperity.
 Mr. Clinton wished President-elect George W. Bush well. But he also bluntly repeated the policy differences he has with his successor, the ones that he hammered away at during the hard-fought presidential campaign. 
 Mr. Clinton spoke of the economic good times that marked his years in office and urged Mr. Bush not to veer away from fiscal responsibility. He never mentioned Mr. Bush's tax-cut plan directly but was clearly trying to nudge the new administration to scale it back in favor of continuing to pay down the debt.
"Staying on that course will bring lower interest rates, greater prosperity and the opportunity to meet our big challenges," he said. "If we choose wisely, we can pay down the debt, deal with the retirement of the baby boomers, invest more in our future and provide tax relief."
Mr. Clinton also spoke of the interconnectedness of today's world and the need for the United States to stay engaged. Again, he was directing his remarks at Mr. Bush, this time contesting the belief that America's military had overextended itself through far-flung peacekeeping missions.
"America cannot and must not disentangle itself from the world," he said. "If we want the world to embody our shared values, then we must assume a shared responsibility. If the wars of the 20th century, especially the recent ones in Kosovo and Bosnia, have taught us anything, it is that we achieve our aims by defending our values, and leading the forces of freedom and peace."
Speaking from the Oval Office -- the same site he had used previously to announce military strikes and plug major legislative initiatives -- Mr. Clinton once borrowed the word "compassionate" that has become a mantra of the incoming Bush administration.
He said that the next president would have to address the growing gap between those thriving under globalization and the many still struggling to survive. "This global gap requires more than compassion," he said. "It requires action. Global poverty is a powder keg that can be ignited by our indifference."
Mr. Clinton also spoke of the importance of tolerance in the United States, challenging Mr. Bush to follow through on his pledge to unite the country.
"We must remember that America cannot lead in the world unless here at home we weave the threads of our coat of many colors into the fabric of one America," he said.
It was a brief farewell by historical standards, and at just under 10 minutes was one of the shortest speeches by the loquacious Mr. Clinton. He had huddled with aides until the very last minute, reworking portions of it as he prepared for the 8 p.m. speech, which was broadcast by all major networks.
Aides said the president kept the speech short because he believed he had already made a detailed case of what he had accomplished in office. 
Still, Mr. Clinton did not miss the opportunity to rattle off the statistics of progress that are now a part of his memory -- the number of new jobs, students receiving financial aid, new homes built.
"In all the work I have done as president, every decision I have made, every executive action I have taken, every bill I have proposed and signed, I've tried to give all Americans the tools and conditions to build the future of our dreams, in a good society, with a strong economy, a cleaner environment, and a freer, safer, more prosperous world," he said.
Then, Mr. Clinton signaled that even once he departed Washington on Saturday, ceding the executive mansion to Mr. Bush, he would not really be going away.
"My days in this office are nearly through," he said, "but my days of service I hope are not. In the years ahead I will never hold a position higher or a covenant more sacred than that of president of the United States. But there is no title I will wear more proudly than that of citizen."
With that, Mr. Clinton pumped his fist in the air.

HEADLINE: Mr. Clinton's Farewell 

 BODY:
With a proud defense of his record and a stern warning against disengagement from the world's problems, President Clinton bade farewell to the nation from the Oval Office last night and graciously offered best wishes to President-elect George W. Bush. The crisp seven-minute televised speech predictably omitted any reference to the ethical lapses that will always shadow Mr. Clinton's reputation. Instead he made a final bid to be remembered as a man of accomplishment and offered polite but pointed advice to his successor. The speech also marked a final nostalgic turn in the president's long goodbye tour of the places that figured in his extraordinary journey to the White House in 1992. 
 The tradition of a presidential farewell speech began with George Washington in 1796. In a subtle nod to history, Mr. Clinton's alluded to Thomas Jefferson's warning against "entangling alliances" by asserting that the United States could not now "disentangle itself from the world." It was an apt formulation from a president who expanded free trade, intervened to prevent economic collapse in Mexico and Asia and strove to combat disease, ethnic cleansing and regional warfare in the Balkans, the Middle East and Africa. The comment also seemed aimed at concerns that President-elect Bush could reduce American involvement abroad. 
 It was said yesterday that Mr. Clinton was working with his aides in sometimes frantic fashion to put together his farewell address -- and that he loved every minute of it. With Mr. Bush clearly on his mind, he urged a continued emphasis on fiscal responsibility and paying down the federal debt. It was an obvious final warning against the large tax cuts that Mr. Bush has said he still wants. Mr. Clinton's comment that engagement in the world requires "more than compassion -- it requires action" seemed to be addressed to Mr. Bush's theme of compassionate conservatism. In all, his speech was a repetition of the idea that harnessing free enterprise and having an activist government can go hand in hand.
Mr. Clinton leaves office with extraordinarily high approval ratings, a sign perhaps that Americans are willing to hear the wisdom of departing leaders. The president used the occasion to try to inculcate the idea that he had presided over a prosperous era and left the country in excellent shape. As in so many earlier speeches, he spoke of "putting people first" while also preparing the economy and its workers for the 21st century. 
In less than two days, Mr. Clinton will become the first president in history to be succeeded in office by the son of the man he defeated in the first place. In spite of the disappointments and costly personal lapses of his presidency, Mr. Clinton said goodbye last night in the spirit in which many Americans can remember him, one of facing up to a world in turmoil and striving to ease hatreds abroad and at home.

HEADLINE: TRANSITION IN WASHINGTON; 
Speech: 'I'll Leave the Presidency More Idealistic'

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Clinton's farewell address last night, as recorded by The New York Times:
 My fellow citizens, tonight is my last opportunity to speak to you from the Oval Office as your president. 
 I am profoundly grateful to you for twice giving me the honor to serve, to work for you and with you to prepare our nation for the 21st century. And I'm grateful to Vice President Gore, to my cabinet secretaries and to all those who served with me for the last eight years. 
This has been a time of dramatic transformation. And you have risen to every new challenge. You have made our social fabric stronger, our families healthier and safer, our people more prosperous. You, the American people, have made our passage into the global information age an era of great American renewal. 
In all the work I have done as president, every decision I have made, every executive action I have taken, every bill I have proposed and signed, I've tried to give all Americans the tools and conditions to build a future of our dreams in a good society with a strong economy, a cleaner environment and a freer, safer, more prosperous world. 
I have steered my course by our enduring values: opportunity for all, responsibility from all, a community of all Americans. I have sought to give America a new kind of government, smaller, more modern, more effective, full of ideas and policies appropriate to this new time, always putting people first, always focusing on the future. 
Working together, America has done well. Our economy is breaking records with more than 22 million new jobs, the lowest unemployment in 30 years, the highest home ownership ever, the longest expansion in history. Our families and communities are stronger. Thirty-five million Americans have used the family leave law, eight million have moved off welfare, crime is at a 25-year low.
Over 10 million Americans received more college aid and more people than ever are going to college. Our schools are better: higher standards, greater accountability and larger investments have brought higher test scores and higher graduation rates.
More than three million children have health insurance now and more than seven million Americans have been lifted out of poverty. Incomes are rising across the board. 
Our air and water are cleaner, our food and drinking water are safer and more of our precious land has been preserved in the Continental United States than at any time in a hundred years. 
America has been a force for peace and prosperity in every corner of the globe. 
I'm very grateful to be able to turn over the reins of leadership to a new president with America in such a strong position to meet the challenges of the future. 
Tonight I want to leave you with three thoughts about our future. 
First, America must maintain our record of fiscal responsibility. Through our last four budgets, we've turned record deficits to record surpluses and we've been able to pay down $600 billion of our national debt, on track to be debt-free by the end of the decade for the first time since 1835. Staying on that course will bring lower interest rates, greater prosperity and the opportunity to meet our big challenges.
If we choose wisely, we can pay down the debt, deal with the retirement of the baby-boomers, invest more in our future and provide tax relief. 
Second, because the world is more connected every day in every way, America's security and prosperity require us to continue to lead in the world. At this remarkable moment in history, more people live in freedom than ever before. Our alliances are stronger than ever. People all around the world look to America to be a force for peace and prosperity, freedom and security.
The global economy is giving more of our own people and millions around the world the chance to work and live and raise their families with dignity. But the forces of integration that have created these good opportunities also make us more subject to global forces of destruction, to terrorism, organized crime and narcotrafficking, the spread of deadly weapons and disease, the degradation of the global environment. The expansion of trade hasn't fully closed the gap between those of us who live on the cutting edge of the global economy and the billions around the world who live on the knife's edge of survival. This global gap requires more than compassion. It requires action. Global poverty is a powder keg that could be ignited by our indifference. 
In his first inaugural address, Thomas Jefferson warned of entangling alliances. But in our times, America cannot and must not disentangle itself from the world. If we want the world to embody our shared values, then we must assume a shared responsibility. 
If the wars of the 20th century, especially the recent ones in Kosovo and Bosnia, have taught us anything, it is that we achieve our aims by defending our values and leading the forces of freedom and peace. We must embrace boldly and resolutely that duty to lead, to stand with our allies in word and deed and to put a human face on the global economy so that expanded trade benefits all peoples in all nations, lifting lives and hopes all across the world. 
Third, we must remember that America cannot lead in the world unless here at home we weave the threads of our coat of many colors into the fabric of one America. As we become ever more diverse, we must work harder to unite around our common values and our common humanity. We must work harder to overcome our differences in our hearts and in our laws. We must treat all our people with fairness and dignity, regardless of their race, religion, gender or sexual orientation and regardless of when they arrived in our country, always moving toward the more perfect union of our Founders' dreams. 
Hillary, Chelsea and I join all Americans in wishing our very best to the next president, George W. Bush, to his family and his administration, in meeting these challenges and in leading freedom's march in this new century. 
As for me, I'll leave the presidency more idealistic, more full of hope, than the day I arrived and more confident than ever that America's best days lie ahead. 
My days in this office are nearly through. But my days of service, I hope, are not. In the years ahead I will never hold a position higher or a covenant more sacred than that of president of the United States. But there is no title I will wear more proudly than that of citizen.
Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America.

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING; 
Colt's Shot at Big Time Has Hurley Satisfied

BYLINE:  By CHARLIE NOBLES 

DATELINE: HALLANDALE, Fla., Jan. 19 

 BODY:
Bobby Hurley's heart still belongs to basketball, even as he savors horse racing ownership as a stimulating diversion. That is why Hurley, a former National Basketball Association player and Duke all-American, describes himself as temporarily unemployed, even though he owns a Kentucky Derby hopeful.
 "This is satisfying for me right now, but I'm still antsy to do something," the 29-year-old Hurley said Thursday as he prepared to send Songandaprayer, a colt he paid $1 million for in February, to the post on Saturday in the Holy Bull Stakes for 3-year-olds at Gulfstream Park. 
 Hurley, a standout at St. Anthony High School in Jersey City and Duke University, whose pro basketball career was hampered by a life-threatening automobile accident, wants to coach basketball, probably in college or high school. He envisions it happening "pretty soon."
For now, owning racehorses is keeping him busy. He started in 1998 by paying $70,000 for two decent horses, since claimed, and then jumped into racing's big league. He sank some of his $16.8 million contract from the Sacramento Kings into acquiring Songandaprayer and another promising 2-year-old, Shooter, who cost $170,000.
Two other horses sold for more money than Songandaprayer at the Tipton Select Sale at Miami's Calder Race Course, but the trainer John Dowd, who has helped bring Hurley into racing, is convinced that they acquired the most talented one. Dowd calls Songandaprayer the most athletic horse at the sale and a "daisy-cutter," meaning he runs easily without having to lift his legs very high.
"He's looking like he could be a special kind of horse," Hurley said. "He's still got a lot to prove, but John loves him and thinks he's going to be better as he starts to go longer and continues to develop."
Songandaprayer made his debut at Monmouth Park in June, winning a maiden race as the front-runner. Bone chips in a rear ankle forced him into surgery, but he returned in November to win the Huntington Stakes at Aqueduct by coming from behind.
Saturday will be Songandaprayer's first test at a mile and a sixteenth as he tries to build for a spot in the Florida Derby on March 10 and then a prep in either the Bluegrass Stakes or the Wood Memorial before the Kentucky Derby.
The jockey Pat Day encouraged Dowd about Songandaprayer's ability to run a greater distance after a recent workout.
"He worked seven-eighths and Pat felt he had plenty left in the tank," Dowd said.
Hurley is soaking all of this in. He likened Songandaprayer's maiden victory as comparable to beating North Carolina when he was at Duke.
"It's definitely up there with the good memories I have with basketball," he said. "I'm not actually doing it, but I feel like I contributed, because I was there. I saw the horse as a baby and helped select him and I put up the money to buy him. So to see him do well definitely got my adrenaline going."

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Narrowed 1.7% in November 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit narrowed 1.7 percent, to $33 billion in November, as imports of oil, autos and computers fell, the Commerce Department reported today. It was the first back-to-back decline in more than three years. 
 Even with the two small declines, however, the trade deficit remained close to its record high of $33.7 billion set in September. With just one month to go, the deficit for all of 2000 was on track to hit $366 billion, more than $100 billion deeper the previous record of $265 billion set in 1999. 
 Many economists are predicting a slow improvement in the trade picture in 2001 as weaker United States economic growth translates into falling demand for imported goods. There is also hope that foreign economic growth will pick up, bolstering American exports, and that the price of oil, a big part of the import bill, will stabilize.
Many of those trends seemed to be emerging in the November report.
United States imports declined 1.1 percent, to $123.35 billion, a drop of $1.33 billion, with $981 million of that improvement coming from an 11.8 percent decline in crude oil imports. Both the volume and the price of oil fell.
Imports of autos and auto products fell by $179 million, to $16.6 billion, as the sharp slowdown that has hurt domestic automakers had an effect on foreign manufacturers as well.
United States exports of goods and services fell 0.8 percent, to $90.4 billion, as sales of computer products, autos and farm products declined.

HEADLINE: Leonard Davis Dies at 76; Philanthropist and Insurer 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
Leonard Davis, a leading philanthropist and the founder of the Colonial Penn Group, an insurance company that pioneered insurance programs for the elderly, died Monday while on a cruise to South America. He was 76 years old and lived in Palm Beach, Fla. 
 The cause of death was congestive heart failure, his son Alan said. 
 Along with his wife, Sophie, who died in September last year, Mr. Davis founded Colonial Penn in 1963. The company, based in Philadelphia, grew to be one of the largest insurance underwriters in the country before its sale in 1984 to an industrial consortium. The company was best known for products like health and automobile insurance for people over 65. 
After the sale of the company, Mr. Davis, who had lived in New York and worked in the insurance company's New York office, moved to Palm Beach and became a full-time philanthropist, making gifts to a range of health and cultural programs in New York, California, Palm Beach and Israel. Over the years, Mr. Davis gave more than $10 million to City College of New York, where he had met his wife while they were students.
Among the institutions at City College supported by the Davises was the Aaron Davis Hall, a performing arts center that was described by the architecture critic Paul Goldberger in The New York Times in 1979 as a piece of architecture "that puts Lincoln Center to shame." It was named for Mr. Davis's father. In addition, the Davises provided money to the Leonard Davis Center for the Arts and the Sophie Davis School of Biomedical Education, which has trained more than 1,000 doctors to practice in poor urban areas.
Mr. Davis also endowed the nation's first school of gerontology, at the University of Southern California, and founded the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics at the University of Pennsylvania.
"My father was always older than his time," Alan Davis said. "He was very concerned about the aging process. It was his passion, and he was able to use that in business and later, when he had the resources, to establish the school at U.S.C."
Mr. Davis, who grew up in the Bronx where his widowed mother ran a candy store, also had interests in politics and in the performing arts. A longtime donor to the Democratic Party, Mr. Davis began making contributions as far back as 1974, when he gave $100,000 to the gubernatorial campaign of Ogden R. Reid, a former New York Congressman. 
He was also chairman of National Telefilm Associates, a company whose main assets were a film library and a television station in New York. After protracted negotiations in 1961, the station, which then operated under the call letters WNTA-TV, was sold for $6.2 million and became Channel 13, the New York area's first educational television station. 
In 1964, Mr. Davis was indicted on charges of perjury in connection with a defunct dental insurance plan that he once headed. The United States attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, said Mr. Davis had lied before a grand jury, which was investigating whether the insurance plan executives made kickbacks to union officials to obtain business. Alan Davis said that the charges against his father were later dropped. 
After moving to Palm Beach in 1984, Mr. Davis led a drive to build the Kravis Center for the Performing Arts and for 20 years backed two regular classical music programs there. He also served on the boards of several Jewish organizations, was a founding member of the National Holocaust Museum in Washington and established the Institute for the Study of International Relations at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.
Mr. Davis is also survived by another son, Michael, and four grandchildren.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
A Czech Internet Venture Will Close

BYLINE:  By PETER S. GREEN 

DATELINE: PRAGUE, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
Globopolis.com, a company in the Czech Republic that produces online city guides, is going out of business as the shakeout in Internet start-ups reaches into Eastern Europe.
 Globopolis's principal backer, the Advent International Corporation, a $3.5 billion venture capital fund, confirmed today that it was shutting the taps after a group it led has poured nearly $3 million of a planned $6 million investment into the privately held online culture guide since last June. 
 Globopolis provides a multilingual culture and night life guide to 10 cities in Central and Eastern Europe and had plans to expand its reach through the Internet and mobile phones. But Advent said revenues at the year-old operation could not meet the rapidly growing costs of its four-city, 90-person operation. 
Joanna James, Advent's London-based managing director for Central and Eastern Europe, said Globopolis had simply failed to attract viewers and advertisers.
"Globopolis is a specific example of a general trend," Ms. James said. "They produced a wonderful set of sites with terrific content, but unfortunately not enough people want to use it and not enough advertisers want to advertise on it. We decided to call it a day; you can't buck the market."
Scott Rogers, the company's 34-year-old president and founder, said Advent warned him just before Christmas that Globopolis's days were numbered.
"Advent wanted us to find a buyer, but you can't draft a sale document and find a buyer in a matter of days, not in this market," Mr. Rogers said. He said Globopolis had originally expected to begin operating at a profit by the end of next year.
Globopolis was started last year, and had begun cooperating with a Western European city guide called Cityvox.com. Mr. Rogers said Globopolis was in talks to provide its content to Internet and wireless service providers including units of Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone.
Mr. Rogers said that, with the help of its backers, Globopolis was not insolvent, and several staff members would continue to maintain the Web site, hoping that a new investor could be found.
The news sent a shiver through Central Europe's tight-knit community of Internet entrepreneurs, who feared the eclipse of a high-profile company like Globopolis with a prominent backer like Advent could be read as a warning to other investors about Central Europe.
"It's a bad message," said Nikola Rafaj, chief executive of Villusion, a month-old company in Prague that has developed a system to handle very small payments over the Internet. "For American investors, Central Europe is just like one big country, so every message like this means bad news for all of us," he said.
Rafal Styczen, the founder and chief executive of the Internet Investment Fund in Cracow, Poland, said: "People are looking much more carefully, because they see they are having difficulty exiting their investments in Western countries. So they are not so eager to expand their business globally." 
He said Advent's sudden turnaround was typical of foreign investors in the region who misunderstand the forces behind its Internet economy and then pull out when profits are slow to arrive.
Many investors expected Central European Internet ventures to learn from the mistakes made by companies in the West and jump quickly into the black. But despite a wealth of programming talent, far too few consumers have Internet-wired personal computers, and the introduction of mobile phones with Internet access is more than a year behind schedule in the region.
Ms. James said Advent had no plan to scale back other investments by its $200 million Central Europe fund, but would focus on companies that bring Internet services to brick-and-mortar companies.

HEADLINE: Immigration Economics 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Americans (a) Love (b) Hate Immigrants" (Week in Review, Jan. 14): The one group whose interests should be paramount is the citizen workers with whom most immigrants compete. Our immigration policies (including lax enforcement) have generated a flood of unskilled, poorly educated job seekers. 
The oversupply of any economic resource means it will be underpriced and, therefore, actively sought. 
 When poor immigrants accept lower wages and fewer benefits and job protections, immigrant workers are exploited and the well-being of citizen workers is imperiled. Cheap labor has led to a perilous widening in wage disparity. The ensuing income inequality has been the Achilles' heel of the recent economic boom and will be the nightmare of the next recession.

HEADLINE: Sotheby's Defends Proposed Settlement of Suit 

BYLINE:  By RALPH BLUMENTHAL and CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
Sotheby's argued in court papers made public yesterday that an important provision of a $512 million lawsuit settlement would not shortchange thousands of customers who have contended that they were defrauded by illegal collusion between the company and its archrival auction house, Christie's. 
 Sotheby's defended the proposed issuance of $100 million in coupons to be distributed to customers for use against commission fees they would pay in future sales. The company contended that most customers would place full face value on the $100 million in coupons, which would be issued in lieu of cash under a plan awaiting approval by a federal judge. 
 But in its court filing, Sotheby's said that in the event that some coupons were discounted at less than face value, "additional coupons can be issued to make up the difference."
Thus Sotheby's argued that customers who sued the auction houses for overcharges from antitrust violations would benefit more from a settlement with coupons, which could have a higher aggregate value than an all-cash payment, than they would in a settlement without the coupons. 
Sotheby's, as well as Christie's, has also offered to redeem all unused coupons after five years for full cash value.
In addition, Sotheby's said that customers stood to earn millions of dollars more from interest on money being set aside for the damage settlement. Christie's lawyers did not return phone calls.
In its filing, directed to two economic experts hired by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan of Federal District Court in Manhattan to evaluate the merits of the coupons, Sotheby's disclosed that most of the dollar value of its auction sales involved repeat sellers. From September 1995 to December 1999, 66 percent of the value of its sales involved sellers in at least two separate auctions, the company said. Thirty-five percent of the sales in that period involved sellers in six or more auctions. They would be prime coupon users, Sotheby's contended.
The settlement, preliminarily approved by Judge Kaplan, would resolve class-action claims by more than 100,000 customers that grew out of a four-year Justice Department investigation into price fixing of commissions and other business practices at the auction houses.

HEADLINE: Padre Island Journal; 
Fighting Over Opening A Shortcut to the Gulf

BYLINE:  By ROSS E. MILLOY 

DATELINE: PORT ARANSAS, Tex., Jan 17 

 BODY:
From the front porch of Clem's Marina and Bait Stand on Padre Island, just a good long cast from the Packery Channel, Yancy Griffith points into a swirling winter fog toward the Gulf of Mexico -- just over a mile away across the island. 
 "The gulf is right there, right there, but we just can't get to it," Mr. Griffith says. "If Packery Channel is open I'm two minutes by boat from the gulf. But without it, the trip takes me two hours." 
 Packery Channel, a sluggish, meandering canal that until the 1920's flowed from the Intracoastal Waterway through Padre Island to the gulf, is impassable to ships because it filled with silt. Fishermen like Mr. Griffith must make a 20-mile voyage north to this fishing village, or 60 miles south to the Port Mansfield cut, to gain access to gulf waters from Corpus Christi Bay.
But now a coalition of real estate interests and sportsmen appears to have enough backing to be close to getting a project under way to reopen the channel. To some, the idea is an intoxicating dream; to others, it is a speculative boondoggle fraught with environmental hazards.
The project, expected to cost about $30 million, is undergoing final feasibility studies by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. It has tentative approval for $19.5 million in federal money. Additional money would come from a special taxing district for nearby land created by city officials in Corpus Christi.
Proponents say that opening the canal would bring new housing, hotel and retail opportunities along the coast. One study said an open channel could bring up to $700 million in development and 4,500 new jobs.
It would also improve the flow of water through the ecologically fragile Laguna Madre estuary, the proponents say, thus defeating a perennial problem of algae blooms called red tides, which threaten fish and crustaceans.
But Pat Suter, chairman of the local Sierra Club, calls the project a pipedream that real estate developers have been pitching since the 1880's. Mrs. Suter said that the assertions of environmental benefits from the project were a smokescreen for developers' efforts to exploit Padre Island for profit at taxpayers' expense.
"They tried to open up that canal just after World War II, and their dredging machine got stuck and had to dig its way out," she said. "They want to cut right through a beautiful gulf beach, just so they can make some money selling houses and condominiums."
Besides the damage to wildlife during construction and through increased human traffic, Mrs. Suter said, reopening the channel would disturb tidal patterns and inalterably change Padre Island.
"We're very much concerned about sand transfers up and down the coast," she said, "and from the backside of the island out to the gulf side. No one knows what tides and big storm surges might do." 
Packery Channel, named for meat packing plants that once used it for access to the gulf, is one of many cuts in Padre Island that have been opened by hurricanes over the years. Without protective jetties and constant dredging, the channels quickly fill with silt.
"Manmade inlets just don't do well along this coast," said Mayor Glenn Martin of Port Aransas. "When you put a cut through the island in one place, you just create problems someplace else."
Mr. Martin points to the Corpus Christi ship channel, dredged to a depth of 40 feet by the 1920's, as a prime example of what can happen.
"That caused Packery Channel to silt up in the first place," Mr. Martin said. "Tidal flow coming through the ship channel shifted the sediment around to the point that it closed Packery. Open it up again, and you just start a whole new round of problems somewhere else." 
He says the design of the new canal, which calls for an 11-foot deep channel 125-feet wide and protected by two jetties 1,400 feet long, is inadequate to deal with storms and tides.
"We see all kinds of engineering and safety issues with this thing that just haven't been addressed yet," Mr. Martin said. "They're going to have to spend a fortune trying to maintain it."
But Carl Anderson, a project manager at the Army Corps of Engineers, said that reopening the channel posed no special challenges.
"This is not a difficult or unusual construction project," Mr. Anderson said "We're just reopening an existing channel."
Nick Kraus, a physicist with the Army Corps of Engineers who studied the project as a private consultant in 1997, agreed that dredging the Corpus Christi ship channel caused Packery Channel to silt shut, but said he believed that modern engineering would keep the new canal open.
"As long as it's properly maintained, I foresee no problems," Dr. Kraus said.
But experts say that maintenance could cost $750,000 a year. Opponents say they are skeptical that the special taxing district created to pay for the project will generate that much revenue, and that they fear the expenses will eventually fall back on local taxpayers.
They have started a petition drive in Corpus Christi called "Let Us Vote," to force a referendum this year on creating the special taxing district.
But proponents of reopening the channel say taxes from the building boom would easily finance the maintenance. An open channel would pump $225 million into the local economy, according to one developer's study.
E. Paul Schexnailder, who has proposed building a $677 million resort on 400 acres he owns near the channel, envisions hotels, restaurants, canals, condominiums, a golf course and an amusement park, which he said would attract 640,000 visitors annually to the area.
Mr. Schexnailder seems confident the channel will eventually be reopened. "Technically our plan is right," he said, "and environmentally our plan is sound. We just need to build it." 
And Mr. Griffith, the fisherman at Clem's, stands ready to help. "Just get me a shovel and tell me where to start digging," he said. "I'm more than ready for that canal."

HEADLINE: TRANSITION IN WASHINGTON: FROM THE PAST; 
Excerpts From Inaugural Speeches With Challenges

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from notable inaugural addresses calling for the nation to meet great social or economic challenges:

Lincoln's Second Inaugural, 1865
 Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could be presented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly depends, is as well known to the public as to myself, and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. 
 With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured. . . . With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.

Reagan's First Inaugural, 1981
This administration's objective will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy that provides equal opportunity for all Americans, with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination. Putting America back to work means putting all Americans back to work. Ending inflation means freeing all Americans from the terror of runaway living costs. All must share in the productive work of this "new beginning" and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy. With the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength, we can have a strong and prosperous America at peace with itself and the world. . . .
It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the federal government and those reserved to the states or to the people. All of us need to be reminded that the federal government did not create the states; the states created the federal government.
Now, so there will be no misunderstanding, it is not my intention to do away with government. It is, rather, to make it work -- work with us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back. Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not stifle it. . . .
In the days ahead I will propose removing the roadblocks that have slowed our economy and reduced productivity. Steps will be taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels of government. Progress may be slow -- measured in inches and feet, not miles -- but we will progress. Is it time to reawaken this industrial giant, to get government back within its means, and to lighten our punitive tax burden. And these will be our first priorities, and on these principles, there will be no compromise.

Clinton's First Inaugural, 1993
To renew America we must be bold. We must do what no generation has had to do before. We must invest more in our own people -- in their jobs and in their future -- and at the same time cut our massive debt. And we must do so in a world in which we must compete for every opportunity. It will not be easy.
It will require sacrifice. But it can be done and done fairly. Not choosing sacrifice for its own sake, but for our own sake. We must provide for our nation the way a family provides for its children. . . .
Americans deserve better, and in this city today there are people who want to do better. And so I say to all of you here, let us resolve to reform our politics so that power and privilege no longer shout down the voice of the people. Let us put aside personal advantage so that we can feel the pain and see the promise of America. Let us resolve to make our government a place for what Franklin Roosevelt called bold, persistent experimentation, a government for our tomorrows, not our yesterdays. Let us give this capital back to the people to whom it belongs.
To renew America, we must meet challenges abroad as well as at home. There is no longer a clear division between what is foreign and what is domestic. The world economy, the world environment, the world AIDS crisis, the world arms race -- they affect us all.

HEADLINE: Euro Seen Taming Inflation 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
Finance ministers from the 12 countries using the shared euro currency said today that an economic slowdown in the United States would do little to dampen European economic growth, and they predicted that the rise in value of the euro would help tame inflation in Europe.
 The dollar has fallen by 11 percent against the euro in the last three months, on speculation that economic growth in the 12 nations may outpace that of the United States. 
 "We are not afraid of the evolution of growth in the U.S.; we are armed to resist a slowdown," the Belgian finance minister, Didier Reynders, said after leading a meeting of the ministers.

HEADLINE: Gasoline Use Fell Last Year, Oil Group Says 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
Gasoline consumption in the United States fell about 1 percent last year, the first decline since 1991 and a rare phenomenon during an economic expansion, the American Petroleum Institute said today.
 The institute, the oil industry's main trade association, also said that demand for all oil products was about the same in 2000 as in 1999, also unusual during boom times. Demand for jet fuel and truck fuel rose, offsetting the decline in gasoline. 
 The decline in gasoline consumption apparently resulted from less driving, because the number of vehicles continued to increase. According to the Polk Company, which tracks registrations and retirements of vehicles, 213.3 million vehicles were in use in the United States as of last June 30, up 3.79 million, or 1.8 percent, from the number a year earlier. And the mix continued to shift toward sport utility vehicles, vans and pickup trucks and away from cars, which are more fuel efficient. 
Gasoline prices were not at a record, at least on an inflation-adjusted basis, but "the increase in prices was enough to spur at least some consumers to lessen lower-priority travel and take other fuel-saving measures," said Ronald J. Planting, the manager of information and analysis at the petroleum institute.
Institute officials warned, though, that even with slightly lower demand, the system for making and distributing gasoline was vulnerable to disruptions because refineries were still operating very close to capacity, and the fuel market itself had become more complex. Environmental rules now require 14 kinds of gasoline in different jurisdictions around the United States, some with ethanol, some with the additive MTBE, some with low sulfur, and most of them with strict limits on ingredients that evaporate readily. Unburned hydrocarbons are a source of air pollution.
Red Cavaney, president and chief executive of the institute, speaking of volatile prices for oil and gas and continued growth in demand for many fuels and for electricity, said, "Our energy capacity has nearly maxed out."
Mr. Cavaney said that the industry thought that recent energy problems would put the issue back on the national agenda, and that "this past year has illustrated that more than just the experts are beginning to see the price we are having to pay for this void in government leadership."
The oil industry wants to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and in areas of the Gulf of Mexico from which it is now barred. He said the industry would also like to build more refineries but that the permitting process is too onerous.
The sharp rise in oil prices last year has already stimulated some parts of the industry. There were 28,050 well completions, up almost 50 percent over 1999, and in December, 255 drilling rigs were active. In August 1999, the rig count was at a record low, 98. Oil production increased in the Lower 48 states but decreased rapidly in Alaska, for a small net decline in production; oil imports reached a level of 56.6 percent of domestic consumption, the group said.
The release of the 2000 statistics follows by one day the Senate confirmation hearing for Spencer Abraham, who is President-elect George W. Bush's choice for energy secretary. At that hearing, Mr. Abraham and several members of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee said that the United States needed to reduce imports. They did not, however, discuss any specifics beyond the possibility of lifting drilling restrictions now in place on environmentally sensitive areas. 
The statistics released today included a comparison of oil production and consumption figures now and in the oil shocks of 1974 and 1979. Petroleum demand in 2000 was 20.6 million barrels a day, up from 18.5 million barrels a day in 1979, and 15.7 million in 1974. Imports of crude and products were up to 11 million barrels a day last year, from 8.46 million barrels in 1979, and 6.12 million barrels in 1974. And the average depth of completed wells in this country in 2000 was 6,105 feet, up from 4,689 feet in 1979, and 4,662 feet in 1974.

Power Crisis in California Is Taking a Financial Toll
The power crisis in California is beginning to take its toll on businesses, workers and consumers. This week alone, the cost reached $1.7 billion in lost wages, sales and productivity, according to the rough estimate of Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation.
 But while rolling blackouts and the immediate prospect of bankrupt utilities are uppermost in the minds of Californians, the bigger economic concern is longer term. No new power plants are expected to come online for at least two years, and demand is growing at a steady pace. Page A1. 

Back-to-Back Nasdaq Improvement
For the first time since September, the Nasdaq composite index finished its second consecutive winning week. The Nasdaq rose 1.89 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,770.38, on the strength of computer-related shares. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 90.69 points, or 0.9 percent, to 10,587.59, led down by a profit warning from Home Depot. And the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 5.43 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,342.54. C3.

Trade Deficit Narrowed in November
The United States trade deficit narrowed 1.7 percent, to $33 billion, in November as imports of oil, autos and computers fell, the Commerce Department reported. It was the first back-to-back decline in more than three years. C3.

Aetna Proposal to Settle Lawsuits
In a development that may provide a formula to help settle dozens of lawsuits against Aetna and other managed care insurers, Aetna is seriously considering nonmonetary ways of compensating plaintiffs. C2.

S.E.C. Rebukes KPMG on Violation
The Securities and Exchange Commission issued a cease-and-desist order against KPMG, the large accounting firm, after concluding that the firm had violated securities laws that required it to be independent from companies it audited. C2.

Class Action Against eBay Dropped
EBay, the online auction service, has won dismissal of a class-action lawsuit that asserted that the company had a responsibility to ensure the authenticity of the items sold through its Web site. Judge Linda B. Quinn of Superior Court in San Diego County, Calif., dismissed a case on Thursday in which buyers sued over eBay auctions for autographed sports memorabilia later found to be fake. C14.

Daimler Official in Mitsubishi Post
After the Mitsubishi Motors board voted to accept Rolf Eckrodt, left, into his new position as chief operating officer, Takashi Sonobe, president of Mitsubishi, vowed that his company would go ahead with a joint venture with Volvo. That deal would make Mitsubishi and DaimlerChrysler, where Mr. Eckrodt came from, competitors in the market for commercial vehicles in Europe. C2.

Sotheby's Makes Case for Coupons
Sotheby's argued in court papers that issuing $100 million in coupons as part of a $512 million lawsuit settlement would not shortchange thousands of customers who have contended that they were defrauded by illegal collusion between the company and its archrival auction house, Christie's. C2.

Bankruptcy Filings Climb in Japan
Bankruptcies in Japan climbed last month to the second-highest level since the collapse of the bubble economy in 1989. Given the bleak outlook for Japan's economy and financial system, insolvency is likely to continue. C2.

Lucent Seeks Buyers for Two Plants
Lucent Technologies said it planned to seek buyers for two of its four factories in the United States in the next six months and to cut costs by contracting out manufacturing. C3.

HEADLINE: NYC; 
Army of One Is Missing Sense of Duty

BYLINE:  By Clyde Haberman 

 BODY:
THE military's never-ending search for a few good men, and some good women, has gone underground in New York. There's nothing clandestine about it. This has to do with major subway stations like Grand Central and Times Square. If you've passed through them recently, you might have noticed soldiers handing out Army recruitment pamphlets alongside all those musicians looking for handouts of another kind.
 "You can come in contact with thousands of people this way," said First Sgt. Miguel Ramos, the senior enlisted man at the Army's New York City Recruiting Battalion, which hunts for new soldiers in the five boroughs and their suburbs. 
 Does the tactic work? Now and then, it seems. Shoot enough arrows into the air, and a few are bound to hit a target. Besides, a subway ride provides time for reading a pamphlet and giving it some thought.
"Someone will be interested," Sergeant Ramos said. 
The subway strategy is a sign of how the military has had to beat the bushes extra hard across the country to meet its enlistment quotas. New York is no exception, even if Sergeant Ramos's unit, based at Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn, can be found most years at or near the top among Army recruiting battalions. When the economy surges, it is never a cinch finding all the bodies needed for society's riskier jobs, from soldiering to pounding a police beat.
That is one reason the Army is changing its marketing practices. Its slogan for the last two decades, "Be all you can be," has gone the way of the old M-14 rifle. A new phrase is geared to a younger generation presumed to be highly individualistic and resistant to authority.
"I am an Army of one," a soldier says in a new commercial.
Sounds catchy. But this Vietnam-era draftee has a question: one what? Since when was the Army about individuality? When, except in those silly Rambo movies, was it about anything except group unity and sacrificing personal wants for the common good?
Oh, and one more thing: duty to country.
THAT last item is the one that reverberates among Americans who are convinced that solutions lie not in changing slogans but in restoring the draft, abandoned three decades ago in the national torment over the Vietnam War.
The pro-draft forces are definitely a minority: an academic here, a politician there, a general way over there. But they make themselves heard, people like Prof. Charles Moskos, a sociologist and expert on military manpower at Northwestern University. He believes that compulsory national service would be good for both the country and the people who serve. And that would go for women as well as men.
"We have lost the shared civic experience that a national draft would accomplish," he said. Now, about all that most of us have in common is jury duty. That doesn't quite do it.
As the professor sees it, national service does not have to mean the military. For starters, a peacetime Army could not absorb all the men and women who turn 18, draft age, each year. The Peace Corps, AmeriCorps and other alternative service must be available, he said, adding, "It should be a duty of citizenship."
Truth be told, the armed forces want no part of conscription. "The volunteer force meets or exceeds national security requirements," said Maj. Ryan Yantis, a Pentagon spokesman. "We have a good Army -- good recruits, good soldiers, high quality."
There is no question that memories of Vietnam haunt the generals, said Michael Peters, senior vice president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a retired colonel.
"But having said that," he added, "most military people feel that young people have an obligation to serve, that there should be some way to give back."
Would a draft have inequities? No doubt. It always did. One solution suggested by Professor Moskos is to first take America's most privileged. Start with the wealthy and graduates of the best schools.
"Who better to serve than those with the biggest stake in keeping the country going?" the professor said. Starting at the top of the social ladder, he added, would make it easier to get people to accept the draft's legitimacy.
Not that he thinks it is an easy sell, certainly not on this Inauguration Day, when we say goodbye to one president and welcome another, men with little in common except maybe this: Each, when faced with the big war of his generation, ducked the draft.

How Jewish Teenagers Accept Beliefs

BYLINE:  By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
All religious groups face the question of how well their young people will accept the teachings their elders pass on to them. The cause for concern is obvious: Today's adolescents will ultimately be responsible for their faith's institutions.
 An intriguing response to the question -- at least for the group involved -- comes in a newly released study, which compares the responses by nearly 1,300 high school students belonging to Judaism's Conservative movement to queries about religious and ethnic identity posed to them in 1995 and 1999. 
 "It's a longitudinal study -- we've gone back to the same young people four years later, to track them," said Jack Wertheimer, provost of Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, which trains men and women for the Conservative rabbinate. He is also director of the seminary's Ratner Center for the Study of Conservative Judaism. 
In 1995, about the time of their bar or bat mitzvahs, 1,466 teenagers nationwide were asked questions relating to their identity as Jews, in a telephone survey, a project by the center. In 1999, the center began a new survey, which reached 89 percent of those contacted four years earlier.
The results are in a 64-page report, "Four Up: the High School Years, 1995-99," by two scholars of Jewish population studies, Barry A. Kosmin and Ariela Keysar. The seminary mailed copies this month to Conservative rabbis and synagogue presidents nationwide.
Though it shows some areas of decline in belief and practice, the study also offers broad encouragement to those who would hope that young people retain the essential lessons of their religious education.
Professor Wertheimer said he believed that its results show the benefits of an increase in spending on Jewish education in the mid-1990's, when more money went to after-school programs, synagogue youth programs and Jewish community centers.
Among its findings, the study reports that in 1995 and in 1999, overwhelming majorities affirmed the value of being Jewish; large majorities regarded the Torah as either God's actual or inspired word, and majorities declared a strong allegiance to Israel. On the other hand, an erosion took place among the number of those who felt it important to live in a kosher home.
A part of the study also reports, not terribly surprisingly, that adolescents in Jewish day schools, after-school programs, summer camps and temple youth groups tended to be more religiously observant and more likely to say it was important to them to marry someone Jewish.
Here are two examples from the study:
In 1995, 20 percent of the adolescents said the Torah was God's "actual word," 60 percent said it was God's "inspired word" and 20 percent described it as "an ancient work of history" recorded by humans. When they were reinterviewed in 1999, the teenagers presented a somewhat different picture, with 9 percent calling the Torah God's actual word, 58 percent God's inspired word and 31 percent a human work of history.
On the subject of Israel, in 1995, 56 percent of the teenagers surveyed called that nation "very important" to them, 41 percent said it was "somewhat important" and 3 percent said it was not very important. By 1999, the proportions giving those responses had changed only slightly. Fifty-two percent said Israel was very important, 39 percent called the nation somewhat important and 8 percent said it was not very important.
Referring to surveys among Jewish adults, Mr. Wertheimer said, "The surprise there is the drop-offs in identification with Israel and Jewish peoplehood that we see in adults have not affected these young people."
But he said that he and the study's two authors felt it important to note that the young people surveyed grew up in a very different era than their parents or grandparents. The mid- to late 1990's were a time distinguished by an economic prosperity that contributed stability and an abundance of material resources to many families, he said, adding that it was also an era of "much greater openness in American society" to discussion of religion and spirituality.
Professor Wertheimer said some people have voiced skepticism about the study's generally positive results, suggesting that the teenagers were trying to be "good boys and girls," giving answers they thought their elders wanted. But he said he did not think most teenagers acted that way.
"I'd like to think their education has an impact," he said, referring to the Jewish education they received.

HEADLINE: CALIFORNIA CRISIS HURTS BUSINESSES AND IDLES WORKERS 

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
The power crisis in California is beginning to take its toll on businesses, workers and consumers across the state. 
 Managers at a Miller brewery, uncertain hour to hour if the power will be on, have shifted beer production to Texas, laying off 200 workers and counting $600,000 in losses from power shutdowns this week. 
 Valero Energy Corporation, whose refineries produce about 10 percent of California's gasoline, has been unable to ship fuel to parts of the state because blackouts have shut down the pipelines it uses.
With power interrupted, the West Coast's largest steel plant, California Steel Industries Inc. in Fontana, east of here, told most of its 1,000 workers to stay home today. 
This week alone, the cost to the state of its energy debacle amounted to $1.7 billion in lost wages, sales and productivity, according to the estimate of Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation. But while rolling blackouts and the immediate prospect of bankrupt utilities are uppermost in the minds of Californians, including business executives, the bigger economic concern here is what will happen in the longer term. 
With no new power plants expected to start operating for at least two years and demand growing at a steady pace, today's uncertainties are unlikely to disappear any time soon. And that, business leaders and some economists say, can only discourage growth in the world's sixth-largest economy, where the downturn in technology stocks has already slowed growth, leaving many fearing a recession is close at hand. 
"If you are looking at a picture of California and seeing these people trapped in elevators, of course people will think twice" about investing in the state, said Tom Lieser, a senior economist at the Anderson Business Forecast, part of the University of California-Los Angeles business school. "Why would anyone want to open or expand a business right now?"
Executives are marshaling their forces across the state to send this message to lawmakers: fix the power problem or watch the buoyant California economy run aground. And while the state's lawmakers increasingly recognize that utilities, power generators and corporate power users alike are angling for government action that favors their interests, they are loath to call any bluff, if jobs and economic vitality are at stake.
Craig R. Barrett, chief executive of the Intel Corporation, a keystone of the state's technology industries, has declared that the company will not be building more plants in California any time soon, blaming unreliable and expensive power supplies. 
And in Los Angeles, where the economy is driven largely by small businesses and light manufacturing plants, economic development officials are demanding meetings with top state leaders, saying companies that want to move here have put those plans on hold. Worse, they warn, persistently high energy prices could lead to substantial layoffs and companies leaving the state altogether. 
Elaine Cullen, who recruits high technology and biomedical companies to the San Gabriel Valley, east of Los Angeles, said California's Frankenstein-like experiment with power deregulation has cooled the interest of outsiders. Already, a food processor that her group, the San Gabriel Economic Partnership, was trying to lure has put its plans on hold, she said.
Los Angeles has endured earthquakes and riots, Ms. Cullen said, but the fact that a basic necessity like electricity is no longer guaranteed is almost too embarrassing to explain to newcomers. And losing a transplant is not even her worst nightmare.
"I'm trying to save the businesses I've got," she said.
The crisis here stems from short energy supplies and a deregulation plan that puts no limits on what utilities pay for electricity but strict limits on what they can charge their customers.
The dysfunctional arrangement has left the two biggest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison, on the brink of bankruptcy, and state officials tied in knots over how to clean up the mess.
So far, the business impact has been sharpest on companies like Miller Brewing that have agreements with the utilities to reduce their power consumption during state-mandated emergencies in exchange for lower electric rates.
In the first five years of its deal with Southern California Edison, service was interrupted just once to Miller's brewery in Irwindale, about 30 miles east of Los Angeles, said Victor Franco, the plant's community affairs manager. In the past six months, the plant has been shut down 22 times.
The costs are substantial. Miller has laid off 200 of its 750 workers, and the company has asked others to take vacations or sit through training sessions when blackouts idle the brewery, which sits on three and a half acres. Under its union contract, the company is required to pay the workers even if they are sent home from a shift. 
The alternative is to keep the lights on and the brewery operating in defiance of its power agreement. Then, Mr. Franco said, Miller's price for electricity jumps more than a hundred-fold, from 6 1/2 cents a kilowatt to $7.20 a kilowatt.
"We've always been this cutting-edge state," Mr. Franco said. "But I don't believe California can continue to suffer this kind of loss."
It is in no sense certain that the energy crunch will push California into recession, or even amount to anything more than a downward blip in a still powerful economic expansion.
If the state can quickly solve its midterm energy issues -- by securing electricity contracts to tide it over until the new power plants come online and encouraging power users to conserve -- the economic pain will be modest, said Mr. Lieser, the U.C.L.A. forecaster.
As for the effects beyond the state's border, market watchers say companies far from California are already paying extra for the overnight borrowings that finance their day-to-day operations, as lenders and investors grow anxious about any company that shows signs of weakness.
Neal Soss, chief economist for Credit Suisse First Boston, said a severe crisis here, with sporadic power interruptions for 90 days or more, would shave about one-half of one percentage point from the nation's gross domestic product. In that case, he said, the Federal Reserve Board might have to consider easing interest rates to keep the situation from growing more grave.
An immediate resolution to the state's problems is not apparent. Today, Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency, placed the State of California's debt on "credit watch," warning that Sacramento does not have adequate funding -- barring rate increases -- to buy enough power to avoid blackouts.
Currently, the state has a projected budget surplus of about $5 billion, and Gov. Gray Davis has proposed setting aside $1 billion of that sum to help the two big utilities stave off bankruptcy.
"They have some money to buy time, but beyond that they have to come up with a solution," said David Hitchcock, the Standard & Poor's analyst who monitors California.
Governor Davis has acknowledged that just about every knowledgeable observer -- save himself -- says the solution will include substantial increases in electric rates.
If and when those increases come, consumers and businesses both will have less to spend on everything else, sapping the economy of some degree of strength.
Even those who are part of the solution to the state's power woes are feeling the pain.
Utilities in California get 20 percent of their power from plants at schools, hospitals and factories that generate enough energy for their own needs and sell the rest, said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade group in Sacramento.
But now these power producers are not being paid. Hal Dittmer, whose Wellhead Electric Company in Sacramento owns three small power plants, said he received a letter from Pacific Gas and Electric this week asking him to forgo payments from the utility until April 1 -- what would amount to an interest-free loan to the utility of $10 million to $15 million.
"If I have to dig into my pockets to keep this company afloat, I will," he said. But if he cannot get credit to buy the natural gas that run the plants, Mr. Dittmer added, he will have no choice but to shut down, idling 42 workers.

HEADLINE: California Averts Blackouts, for a Day, as Utilities Thrash to Stay Afloat 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
State purchases of power today helped California avoid temporary blackouts for the first time in three days, but the alarming financial deterioration of the utilities led to a bitter collision between the companies and the government over how to keep the state's badly faltering energy system from seizing up.
 The California Public Utilities Commission filed its first ever temporary restraining order today, directing the utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison, to provide service to all their customers no matter how heavy their debt burdens, and even if they are forced into bankruptcy. 
 The commission cited what it described as threats by Pacific Gas and Electric to cut off a large portion of its customers because, crushed under a mountain of debt, it could no longer afford to buy power on the wholesale market.
Both utilities called the order an "insult" that might hasten bankruptcy, and insisted they had no intention of cutting off any customers because of the financial problems. But there were also clear signs that both were losing their struggle to stay afloat -- Southern California Edison missed more than $800 million in payments it owed this week -- as they are flooded with losses and debt. 
The confusing flurry of legal, political and financial steps suggested to many experts and lawmakers that Gov. Gray Davis may have to take two urgent steps that he has insisted he would resist: a large increase in power rates, and a state plan to help the utilities pay off roughly $12 billion in recent losses by selling state-backed bonds and having utility customers pay them off over a period of years through special charges, a step known as securitization.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who is close to Governor Davis and has been conferring with him through the crisis, flatly stated in an interview today that rate increases and some form of securitization were essential elements in solving the energy crisis.
"That's the fact, and you have to prepare people for the facts," Senator Feinstein said. "There is no politically painless solution. The more you get into this the more clearly you see it."
Her comments were just another sign that the state is rapidly running out of options as it seeks to grapple with what amounts to a war on three fronts: shortages in power generation throughout the Western states; shortages in the natural gas used to generate much of the power in the region; and the financial distress of the two utilities as the cost of both power and natural gas soars.
Adding to the sense that time was short and that there were few options, President-elect George W. Bush made a number of statements in Washington suggesting that his administration would be reluctant to provide federal relief to help the state out of its crisis. Governor Davis and other California lawmakers have sought to have the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission either impose a cap on the wholesale price of power in the West, or impose a price formula based on the actual cost of generating the power. The commission has refused so far, and it now seems unlikely that Mr. Bush would pressure it to do so after he becomes president on Saturday.
And in Sacramento there were also problems. As Governor Davis signed an emergency bill today granting the state the authority to make large scale purchases of power, lawmakers from both parties said they were reluctant to provide more than the initial $400 million allotted for the purchases. Even though all agree that the money could be used up in a week or so, they all said they were unwilling to provide an open-ended commitment.
Dave Cox, the assistant Republican leader in the State Assembly, said his party had supported the bill and the governor's efforts so far, but did not want to leave the state budget vulnerable to massive costs.
As he signed the bill today, Governor Davis said that he believed the measure would bring down prices and stabilize a jumpy power market, from which the two utilities have been all but absent because of their financial problems. But he also conceded, "I want to stress that this is not the long-term solution."
He insisted, in remarks made with a number of legislative leaders behind him, that the solution was in building more power plants in the state, which could take several years, and through initiating a big conservation program.
He added, "Every single human being on the planet Earth wants me to raise rates, except me, and the people standing behind me."
But throughout the day, there were signs that the energy system was looking more and more like a ship springing new leaks. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has been invoking federal emergency power for several weeks, forcing all generating companies to sell electricity to California's struggling utilities even with their financial problems.
The order has not stopped the state from suffering critical shortages in power, which caused the planned, rotating blackouts in central and northern California on Wednesday and Thursday. But the order helped make sure that all available power would be sold to the state.
Mr. Richardson had to issue yet another emergency order today, forcing suppliers of natural gas this time to make supplies available to the utilities for use in fueling power plants after apparent threats to cut them off because of the financial concerns.
In another ill portent, Southern California Edison failed on Thursday to pay the $215 million it owes for the power it bought in December on the California Power Exchange. The exchange, which was set up by the state under its failed deregulation plan to bring buyers and sellers of power together, said today that it was moving to seize and sell off the collateral that the utility had put up, yet another threatening step that could trigger other creditors to go to court seeking repayment of debts.
And the State Attorney General, Bill Lockyer, stepped into the fray by filing a petition with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission today seeking to block Pacific Gas and Electric from shifting assets away from control of a Bankruptcy Court if it is forced into such a filing.
On Jan. 12, the federal commission had approved a plan allowing the utility to shift some of its assets to a newly created entity. 
"Given all the talk about potential bankruptcy, we are concerned that PG&E used a stealth move to shield assets," Mr. Lockyer said.
The sense of a declining range of options was also apparent in remarks by various lawmakers from Western states, which have been selling large amounts of power to California. Some of the other states are worried that California's voracious appetite for power could be harming their own economies.
Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, commented, "The people of my state have been more than a good neighbor," in providing large amounts of hydroelectric power.
Senator Gordon H. Smith, Republican of Oregon, said, "My state is being set up to be an energy farm for California."

HEADLINE: Panel Urges End to City's 'Pattern Bargaining' With Unions 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed research group, urged the Giuliani administration yesterday to abandon the city's longtime practice of negotiating a contract with one union that sets a pattern for all other contracts.
 Instead, the commission called on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to grant large raises for job categories for which there is a shortage of applicants, like math teachers, but far smaller raises for jobs for which there is a surplus of applicants. 
 The commission made its recommendations as Mr. Giuliani appeared to be nearing a deal with a coalition of unions representing firefighters and some other uniformed workers. Several labor negotiators said the Giuliani administration wanted the coalition to sign a contract that called for wages considerably lower than several other unions were seeking, and in that way lock the other unions into the pattern. 
But the commission said it was important not to be pegged rigidly to a pattern.
"Where there are shortages, we want significant increases in order to be able to recruit the people the city needs to get services delivered," said Charles Brecher, the commission's research director. "But in areas where we see gluts, where there are abundant applicants, you don't need to give big raises. You can even do less than inflation."
The commission, a private group that has given many mayors advice on budgetary and management matters, called for a 20 percent, one-shot raise for math and science teachers and teachers at schools in poor neighborhoods that have a hard time with recruitment. But the commission called for a raise of just 1.2 percent, or about half the inflation rate, for job categories like elementary school teacher, firefighter and correction officer, for which it said there was a surplus of applicants.
"We're saying: 'Don't do across-the-board. Be responsive to the labor market,' " Mr. Brecher said.
The commission's recommendations have irritated City Hall and union leaders. For city officials, jettisoning the current practice, known as pattern bargaining, could create huge difficulties as unions haggle over who deserves how much and some unions inevitably cry that they are being shortchanged. For labor leaders, ending pattern bargaining could create major internal problems if their unions receive the lowest raises.
Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers and chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee, which coordinates bargaining strategy for city workers, criticized the commission for recommending a 1.2 percent raise for some workers after municipal employees accepted a two-year wage freeze as part of their expired five-year contract.
"It's not going to happen," Ms. Weingarten said. "The commission doesn't take into account all the sacrifices the unions made last time around. When there's a recessionary cycle, the Citizens Budget Commission asks workers to make sacrifices, then it conveniently forgets that in the next bargaining round."
City Hall officials did not reply to several calls seeking a response to the commission's recommendations.
They could take some solace, however, in the commission's recommendations. The commission said that any labor contracts should include merit pay provisions that would award money, on top of across-the-board raises, to workers who are strong performers.
Mr. Giuliani has proposed individualized merit pay based, for instance, on how well each police officer or teacher performs. Labor leaders have denounced this proposal, saying it would pit union member against union member.
Parting somewhat from Mr. Giuliani, the budget commission called for awarding merit pay not individual by individual, but to groups of workers. Saying it was important to foster cooperation to improve performance, the commission suggested awarding merit pay, for instance, to all the firefighters at a fire company or to all the third- and fourth-grade teachers at a school, as well as to the school's reading teachers.
The commission said merit pay could be financed by using money now going to automatic longevity raises: for example, when police officers reach the 5- and 10-year marks.
The teachers' union had limited praise for the recommendation to end pattern bargaining, because the teachers contend that they deserve a raise of at least 25 percent to catch up with suburban salaries. Ms. Weingarten said that an overall teacher shortage -- something City Hall denies -- helped her union make a stronger case than many other unions for a large raise.

After the Ball Is Over

BYLINE:  By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
Presidents come and go, but a Washington cliche is forever. Today we'll be lectured repeatedly on the poignancy of a president's exit (not that he's actually going anywhere), the promise of a new president's arrival, and on the glory of our Republic. We'll be reminded that there are no tanks in the streets when America changes leaders -- only cheesy floats and aural assault weapons in the guise of high school bands. 
 All true, and yet at this inaugural more than any other in any American's lifetime there is a cognitive dissonance between the patriotic sentiment and the reality. More Americans voted for the candidate who lost the election than the one who won. The Washington Post/ABC News poll says that only 41 percent believe the winner "has a mandate to carry out the agenda" of his campaign. Even before the Florida fracas, the country's black population rejected the Republican candidate (who assiduously tried to attract black voters) by a larger margin than any since Barry Goldwater (who had voted against the Civil Rights Act). And now come calamities ignored in a campaign that dithered about prescription drugs, tax cuts and schools: an energy meltdown in the nation's biggest state, and a possible economic downturn. 
 George W. Bush seems like an earnest man. When he says he has come to Washington to "change the tone" and "unite, not divide," I don't doubt his sincerity. But so far his actions are those of another entitled boomer who is utterly blind to his own faults. He narcissistically believes things to be so (and his intentions pure) because he says they are. 
Change the tone? As Clinton-Gore raised $33 million largely from their corporate masters for their first inaugural, so Bush-Cheney have solicited $35 million from, among others, the securities firms that want to get their hands on your privatized Social Security retirement accounts and the pharmaceutical companies that want to protect the prices of prescription drugs. And already foreign money is making its entrance -- in the form of a legal but unsavory $100,000 contribution from the deputy prime minister of Lebanon, channeled through his son. 
Now comes the news -- reported by the columnist Robert Novak -- that John Huang, the convicted Clinton-Gore fund-raiser, repeatedly took the Fifth Amendment in November when questioned in court about his alleged fiscal ties to Republicans, including Senator Mitch McConnell, the No. 1 opponent of the John McCain crusade for campaign finance reform that Mr. Bush has yet to credibly embrace. (Mr. McConnell is also the husband of Mr. Bush's latest labor secretary-designate, Elaine Chao.) 
Change the tone? Hard as it is to imagine that anyone could choose an attorney general as polarizing as the last, Mr. Bush has outdone himself. With a single cabinet pick he has reproduced the rancor that attended the full Clinton legal troika of Reno, Hubbell & Foster.
There's been much debate about whether John Ashcroft is a racist -- a hard case to make against a man whose history of playing the race card to pander to voters is balanced by his record of black judicial appointments. But there has not been nearly enough debate about whether our incipient chief legal officer has lied under oath to the Senate.
Perhaps his seeming fudging and reversals of his previous stands on Roe v. Wade and gun control can be rationalized as clever lawyerese. Perhaps some of his evasions can be dismissed as a politician's typical little white lies -- and I do mean white -- such as when he denies he knew that a magazine he favored with an interview, Southern Partisan, espoused the slaveholding views of Southern partisans. But it took a bolder kind of dissembling to contradict his own paper trail in public office. After he swore that the state of Missouri "had been found guilty of no wrong" in a landmark St. Louis desegregation case and that "both as attorney general and as governor" of the state he had followed "all" court orders in the matter, The Washington Post needed only a day to report the truth: A federal district judge in fact ruled that the state was a "primary constitutional wrongdoer" in the matter and threatened to hold Mr. Ashcroft in contempt for his "continual delay and failure to comply" with court orders.
Mr. Ashcroft may have left even more land mines in his testimony about the businessman, philanthropist and former law school official James Hormel, the Clinton ambassador to Luxembourg whose nomination he had fought. Asked by Patrick Leahy, the Judiciary chairman, if he had opposed Mr. Hormel because Mr. Hormel is gay, Mr. Ashcroft answered, "I did not." Then why did he oppose Mr. Hormel? "Well, frankly, I had known Mr. Hormel for a long time. He had recruited me, when I was a student in college, to go to the University of Chicago Law School," Mr. Ashcroft testified, before adding a cryptic answer he would repeat two times as Mr. Leahy pressed him: "I made a judgment that it would be ill advised to make him ambassador based on the totality of the record."
The implication of this creepy testimony is that Mr. Ashcroft, having known the 68-year-old Mr. Hormel for decades, had some goods on him. The use of the word "recruit" by Mr. Ashcroft also had a loaded connotation in context, since it's common for those on the religious right who argue (as Mr. Ashcroft does) that sexual orientation is a choice to accuse homosexuals of "recruiting" the young. 
No senator followed up Mr. Ashcroft's testimony about Mr. Hormel, who, unlike another subject of an Ashcroft character assassination, Judge Ronnie White, was not invited to testify at the hearings. I located Mr. Hormel by phone in Washington, where he had traveled for final meetings at the State Department after concluding his service in Luxembourg. He strongly disputed Mr. Ashcroft's version of events. 
"I don't recall ever recruiting anybody for the University of Chicago," Mr. Hormel said in our conversation Wednesday night. As an assistant dean involved with admissions, he says, he might have met Mr. Ashcroft in passing while touring campuses to give talks to prospective law school applicants, or in later office visits about grades or curriculum. But, Mr. Hormel quickly adds, he doesn't recall "a single conversation with John Ashcroft." Nor has Mr. Hormel seen him in the three decades since; Mr. Ashcroft didn't have the courtesy to respond to repeated requests for a meeting during Mr. Hormel's own confirmation process and didn't bother to attend Mr. Hormel's hearing before opposing him.
"I think he made insinuations which would lead people to have a complete misunderstanding of my very limited relationship with him," Mr. Hormel says. "I fear that there was an inference he created that he knew me and based on that knowledge he came to the conclusion I wasn't fit to become an ambassador. I find that very disturbing. He kept repeating the phrase 'the totality of the record.' I don't know what record he's talking about. I don't know of anything I've ever done that's been called unethical." The record that Mr. Ashcroft so casually smeared includes an appointment to the U.N. in 1996 that was confirmed by the Foreign Relations Committee on which Mr. Ashcroft then sat. 
Since Mr. Bush could easily have avoided the divisiveness of the Ashcroft choice by picking an equally conservative attorney general with less baggage, some of his opponents will start calling him "stupid" again. That seems unfair. Mr. Bush's real problem is arrogance -- he thinks we are stupid. He thinks that if he vouches incessantly for the "good heart" of a John Ashcroft, that settles it. It hasn't; polls showed an even split on the nomination well before the hearings. He thinks that if he fills the stage with black faces at a white convention and poses incessantly with black schoolkids and talks about being the "inclusive" president "of everybody," he'll persuade minority voters he's compassionate. He hasn't. 
George W. Bush likes to boast that he doesn't watch TV. He didn't even tune in as the nation's highest court debated his fate, leaving his princely retainers to bring him bulletins. Maybe it's time for him to start listening; he might even learn why so many Americans aren't taking his word for John Ashcroft's "heart." I don't doubt that our new president will give a poetic Inaugural Address today, but if he remains out of touch with the country, he will not be able to govern tomorrow.

HEADLINE: TRANSITION IN WASHINGTON: THE PARTY POSITIONS; 
At Hearings, Cracks Appear in Bush's Party Line

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
After a campaign in which George W. Bush demanded absolute loyalty from his staff and kept internal debates out of public view, some of his cabinet choices have inched away from the party line in their confirmation hearings. 
 In doing so, they illustrate the challenge to the new administration of maintaining a seamless front under the pressure of governing. 
 On three of the biggest issues facing Congress and the new administration -- education, tax cuts and helping the elderly pay for prescription drugs -- members of the president-elect's team spoke this week in terms that were different in nuanced ways from those used by Mr. Bush in the campaign and its immediate aftermath. 
Mr. Bush's choice for attorney general, John Ashcroft, also seems to have staked out a slightly different position from the president-elect on an element of the highly charged debate over abortion. 
On Thursday, a day after Mr. Ashcroft told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he would not seek opportunities to challenge Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court's landmark ruling on abortion rights, Mr. Bush said in an interview with Fox News that he would not rule out having his Justice Department argue for a change in the law.
Further muddling the incoming administration's position, Laura Bush, the president-elect's wife, told NBC News in an interview broadcast today that she did not think the Supreme Court decision should be overturned.
To some degree, the differences on such high-profile issues are not surprising given the array of pressure from interest groups and the complexity of trying to move an agenda through a Congress that is almost evenly divided between the two parties. In that sense, his new team might have been reflecting a calculated decision to shade or back off campaign promises in order to increase the odds of winning legislative victories or quick confirmation of cabinet choices.
It is also possible that the relative independence of Mr. Bush's cabinet choices reflected his decision to hire well-known men and women with established reputations and considerable executive experience, and to grant them authority and responsibility to carry out his plans.
But there is also the risk that a team of strong-willed, independent executives will stray, perhaps inadvertently, from the new president's thinking, creating the impression if not the reality of internal disagreement or even disarray.
In Mr. Bush's case, the transition from a tightly managed campaign, and an administration as governor of Texas that could proceed at a relatively leisurely pace, to the maelstrom and intense scrutiny of presidential politics, could be particularly abrupt. Like any new administration, this one will have to adapt to the reality that every utterance from anyone in a position of influence will be amplified and parsed for political meaning.
"That's one of the toughest challenges that any new president faces," said Leon E. Panetta, a former chief of staff to President Clinton. "The transition from what is usually a very tightly run campaign in which the candidate alone makes the news, to an administration of literally thousands of political appointees, each of whom in their own way suddenly realizes the power they have to make news, can be difficult."
None of Mr. Bush's cabinet choices has broken with him in any substantial way. All have loyally and enthusiastically endorsed his basic goals and philosophy. 
But in a town where the slightest shift in political tone and changes in the smallest detail can make news or break legislation, the secretaries-in-waiting seemed to have voices and thoughts of their own at their confirmation hearings.
Roderick R. Paige, Mr. Bush's choice to be secretary of education, put some daylight between himself and the president-elect's stated goal of giving parents of students in some failing public school districts vouchers to subsidize private school tuition. 
Asked about vouchers last week by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, Mr. Paige replied, "Not a priority, Senator," a response that amounted to waving a white flag on the initiative even before it was formally proposed.
Paul H. O'Neill, the prospective treasury secretary, gave a subtly but distinctly different rationale for tax cuts than the one used by Mr. Bush for the last month. Mr. Bush has been saying that tax cuts would be a critical antidote to a crumbling economy, but Mr. O'Neill said the real justification is that the federal government is running a surplus and it would be prudent to return it to the public in the form of tax cuts.
"I would not make a huge case that this is the instrument to ensure that we don't go into recession," Mr. O'Neill told the Senate Finance Committee.
Tommy G. Thompson, who is Mr. Bush's selection to head the Department of Health and Human Services, signaled that he might not push hard for one of the president-elect's main campaign promises, to provide states with an immediate infusion of $12 billion a year in federal financing to help them provide prescription drug coverage for the poorest of their elderly citizens. 
Faced with skepticism about the proposal from members of both parties, Mr. Thompson said that if Congress could quickly come up with a comprehensive plan to provide drug coverage to all Medicare beneficiaries, that would be good enough.
"Whatever can move the fastest, this administration will be very happy about," said Mr. Thompson, the governor of Wisconsin.
Mr. Bush's aides have said there are no differences in thinking or approach between the president-elect and his appointees. 
Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's spokesman, said today that Mr. Ashcroft's statements about not seeking to overturn the Supreme Court decision had to do with his commitment to enforcing the law as it now exists. Mr. Fleischer did not close off the possibility that Mr. Bush might someday seek to overturn the decision, but he said that for now Mr. Bush would concentrate on making abortions more rare.
He declined to comment on Mrs. Bush's remarks.
Asked about the administration's commitment to vouchers as part of its education proposals, Mr. Fleischer said Mr. Bush would stick to his plan as set out during the campaign. On tax cuts, Mr. Fleischer said this week that there was no rift between Mr. Bush and Mr. O'Neill.

HEADLINE: TRANSITION IN WASHINGTON: PUBLIC SENTIMENT; 
A Nation's Voices: Concern and Solace, Resentment and Redemption

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
Clearly the Blind Faith Cafe was not named with today's political climate in mind.
 On the eve of the inauguration of a president who won office after one of the most contentious and divisive elections in memory, a more apt name for a vegetarian restaurant in the Democratic-majority suburban town of Evanston, Ill., might be the Who-Do-You-Think-You're-Kidding Cafe. 
 "We'll have an inauguration that a lot of people are not excited about, and it's just like it's a cartoon," said Joanna Baker, a 39-year-old executive search consultant and yoga enthusiast, who was eating a barbecued seitan salad and worrying what a Bush presidency would mean for abortion rights and other issues she cares about. "It's like it's not really real."
At the next table, another Democrat, Dr. Ken Moses, a 58-year-old psychologist, gave a wry grin while describing how he was adjusting to the White House transition. 
"I happen to be a therapist that deals with nothing but profound losses," Dr. Moses said. "The issue of disappointment and how to deal with it is my trade."
Here in the Chicago area, and across the country in Miami, Denver and Boston, there is a sense that the nation has been through an extraordinary upheaval, and many people have been left a little stunned. 
Among supporters of Vice President Al Gore, there is resentment and disappointment. Among some of those who voted for George W. Bush, there is concern about whether he will be able to accomplish much, given a Congress so evenly divided and a mandate that is at most tenuous in the wake of his inability to win the popular vote.
And among people of both parties, there is a feeling that the electoral system needs to be fixed. 
Still, in interviews with dozens of people, no one seemed to feel that the nation was ill equipped to handle all that had happened.
Many Gore supporters said they had become resigned to a Bush presidency. Some said they took solace from their expectation that Congress would keep Mr. Bush from enacting what they viewed as his most extreme proposals, like a $1.6 trillion tax cut and school vouchers. Some also said they were impressed, by and large, with his cabinet choices, although most were strongly opposed to his selection of John Ashcroft for attorney general.
And many seemed to have adopted an attitude that in the end, Washington is Washington: the apparatus of government is still in place, skilled politicians and career civil servants still keep things running, and ultimately nothing apocalyptic is likely to happen. Dr. Moses, for example, said that he felt "embarrassed for the country" but that "I really do trust the system."
"There are enough people in Congress and in the government," he said, "that the system will work, and life will go on."
Joseph Flaherty, a 59-year-old former actor in Boston, exemplified the way some Democrats felt. 
"For the first time really in my adult life, I became alarmed at the man about to become president," Mr. Flaherty said at the South Station train terminal. "I fear that in my lifetime he is the single most unqualified person for the job."
But Mr. Flaherty said he had become "a little more reassured, simply because he has apparently been well advised, and he is keeping a relatively low profile, and he is trying to establish himself as a very cool, moderate person."
Further, Mr. Flaherty said, the country has an obligation to unite behind Mr. Bush.
"We cannot play the masochist simply because we do not like the person in the Oval Office," he said.
Perhaps what has helped some Democrats come to terms with the outcome of the election is that many were not passionate about Mr. Gore; they thought both candidates were opportunistic and self-interested. 
"There was an air that Bush was pulling every string," Ms. Baker said, "but I know that the Democrats were pulling every string they had, too. Their strings just weren't connected to the right places."
One staunch Gore supporter, Lloyd Athearn, an administrator for a nonprofit organization in Golden, Colo., said: "I think Bush stole the election fair and square. No one really won, which means the public punted."
Mr. Athearn and other Democrats interviewed did not seem disillusioned by a Supreme Court whose 5-to-4 decision gave Mr. Bush victory. But he said changes in the voting system were essential, starting with money for more modern equipment. 
Even supporters of Mr. Bush wondered how effective he would be. 
"I think it's going to be very hard for him to patch things up with the American people," said Mario Leteri, a Republican businessman in Miami. "For one thing, the Democrats are going to be on his back the whole time, and I'm sure will make his life miserable. He has definitely tried hard. He had a Democrat introduce him in his acceptance speech, and that shows how hard he's trying. Will it work in the long run? Probably not."
Vicki Ohoson, an independent in Denver who said she had voted for Mr. Bush, expressed concern "for the people that didn't vote for him, the people that still aren't happy."
"There's a lot of heat," Ms. Ohoson said. "We've got a country that's really divided, a national split. I think it's going to take some really special events and gestures to jump that chasm."
Another Bush supporter, 90-year-old Jeanette Peterson, who was shopping at an Evanston bookstore, said: "I think after the president goes in, there will be a lot of talk for months about the way the voting was handled. Different groups will mobilize. He's going to have a tough time."
Andy Oh, a graduate student at Northwestern University's business school, said expectations for Mr. Bush were "very low," because "he didn't get a mandate."
Mr. Oh, who approved of Mr. Bush's economic proposals but liked Mr. Gore on social issues, said he would advise Mr. Bush to first try to appropriate money for fixing the electoral system. Then, he said, if Mr. Bush can compromise by reducing the size of his tax-cut proposal, he can get a tax bill passed, and "that would go a long way to make me feel better about the situation."
As for the Democrats, he said, they "have to be careful not to go to an extreme and purposely try to make Bush look bad."
Among Gore supporters, African-Americans, many particularly suspicious of the Florida voting, tended to be feeling the greatest anger.
"I am extremely frustrated," said Theresa Thornton-Young, an employee of the Miami-Dade County school board. "The only way Bush can heal us is for him to get out of office and give it to Gore. I do not accept him."
But another black Gore supporter, Jamela Larson, a real estate agent in Miami, said: "At first it was a little tough to accept that George W. had sort of imposed himself, but with time I have gotten used to the idea. In a way, I feel bad for George W. The pressure is definitely on him. Honestly, now that I've had some time to digest all this election thing, I am kind of glad that Gore didn't win, because that would have meant that the pressure would have been on for him as well."
Ms. Larson was not the only Gore backer trying to find a silver lining. Ms. Baker said she thought that Democrats would be able "to raise a lot of money, just like the Republicans did during Whitewater," and as a result could regain control of at least one house of Congress in 2002.
She said she was "nervous about Bush's Supreme Court appointments, but people get on the bench and sometimes they don't act in ways that people who appoint them expect them to." 
And, perhaps grasping at straws, she suggested that a conservative current in the country might precipitate a cultural rebellion among artists and writers. 
"Someone said to me one advantage to this is that art might get more subversive because that's what happens when conservatives are in power," Ms. Baker said. "And that could be good."
Whatever the perspective, Democrat or Republican, the news today that the independent counsel had decided against prosecuting President Clinton, in exchange for Mr. Clinton's admission that he had made false statements in the Paula Jones case and his agreement to a five-year suspension of his license to practice law, seemed welcome. 
"We don't need to reward or rehash or reprimand -- we just need to end it," said Mike Shorten, a Republican sales representative having lunch in downtown Chicago.
Gail Hays, on a cigarette break outside her Chicago office, said of the agreement: "I think the whole country is winning with this. It's not a question of the Democrats or Republicans. We're all moving on."

HEADLINE: TRANSITION IN WASHINGTON: OVERSEAS -- RUSSIA; 
No Honeymoon Likely for New President's Foreign Policy Team

BYLINE:  By Patrick E. Tyler 

 BODY:
Every president takes office believing he can set the foreign policy agenda for his administration, only to discover that a major portion of that agenda has already been set by the world.
 The crises of the world do not take a time-out for a new American leader. President Clinton arrived hoping to focus on domestic issues, but was immediately faced by crises in places like Somalia, Haiti and Taiwan, along with hardy perennials like Russia and the Middle East. 
 President-elect George W. Bush was confronted by the killing of the president of Congo this week, and might see the election of a hawkish prime minister in Israel and the crumbling of the peace accord in Northern Ireland in his first month in office. Further down the line, Mr. Bush's enthusiasm for a missile-defense system is certain to generate fierce opposition in Europe and in Russia.
Much has been said, too, about Mr. Bush's inheriting the problem of Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi strongman against whom his father went to war, but whom he left in power. In recent years, Washington's focus has been on simply keeping sanctions against Iraq in force over growing opposition, especially from Russia and France.
In Asia, the first big decision, due in April, will be whether to sell destroyers, advanced weapons and radar systems to Taiwan -- a decision that could prompt China to respond by accelerating its own military buildup.
Beyond that a host of other challenges, large and small, will vie quickly for American attention. What follows is a tour of those likely to prove most urgent.
If Mr. Bush makes good on his pledge to unfurl a missile-defense umbrella over the United States, Washington and Moscow would be entering an era of profound disagreement about how to maintain global security against the use of nuclear weapons, even as they continue to work to reduce their number.
The prospect of missile defense threatens to drag the onetime superpower rivals, as well as China, India and Pakistan, into a new arms race, many experts say. Russia and China are alarmed that a new American "shield" might undermine deterrence -- that concept of strategic stability that comes from knowing that the terrible cost of using nuclear weapons is the certainty of retaliation.
Last year, Russia demonstrated that it intended to pursue an active foreign policy in Europe and Asia to defend what President Vladimir V. Putin sees as Russian national interests, whether the issue is missile defense or a desire to thwart the eastward expansion of NATO to the Baltic states in the north and to Georgia to Russia's south.
Mr. Putin insists he is not looking for a confrontation with the United States -- in fact, the opposite. Moscow, he says, will seek cooperation within a relationship where differences of opinion can be aired openly and frankly.
But those differences are sharp: Moscow is building a nuclear power plant in Iran and will now sell weapons to Iran's army. Russia and France have been courting Iraq, once a major market for each, and oppose continued sanctions against Baghdad.
Mr. Putin, a pragmatist thus far, realizes he needs assistance from Mr. Bush to strengthen the Russian economy. He will look to the United States and Europe for support in restructuring foreign debt, attracting investment and gradually integrating Russia into western institutions, including the World Trade Organization. For that, he needs a calm Western front. Patrick E. Tyler

HEADLINE: TRANSITION IN WASHINGTON: OVERSEAS -- THE BALKANS; 
No Honeymoon Likely for New President's Foreign Policy Team

BYLINE:  By Steven Erlanger

 BODY:
Every president takes office believing he can set the foreign policy agenda for his administration, only to discover that a major portion of that agenda has already been set by the world.
 The crises of the world do not take a time-out for a new American leader. President Clinton arrived hoping to focus on domestic issues, but was immediately faced by crises in places like Somalia, Haiti and Taiwan, along with hardy perennials like Russia and the Middle East. 
 President-elect George W.

Beyond that a host of other challenges, large and small, will vie quickly for American attention. What follows is a tour of those likely to prove most urgent.
Even with Slobodan Milosevic deposed, the Balkans are not going away. Mr. Bush has said he would "very much like to get our troops out" of the Balkans, where more than 9,000 American soldiers are stationed in Bosnia and Kosovo. But the Europeans and the Kosovar Albanians will oppose that.
The 1995 Dayton agreement was an American-imposed peace and Bosnia and Herzegovina is an American-designed country. Five years later, the peace is holding, but the country is badly riven by ethnic nationalism. Will a Bush administration redesign Bosnia and the Dayton accord if it intends to withdraw troops?
Kosovo, still formally a province of Serbia, is now administered by the United Nations and patrolled by NATO-led troops. With Mr. Milosevic gone, the push for independence, which is what most ethnic Albanians want, is becoming a dream deferred.
Kosovo is becoming more explosive, with new attacks on Serbs by the supposedly disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army outside of Kosovo but under the eyes of American peacekeeping troops.
The new democratic government in Belgrade wants to retaliate, and Kosovars trust Washington to protect them. Will a Bush administration confront the ethnic Albanians, let alone the looming and unanswered question of Kosovo's final status?
President Vojislav Kostunica of Yugoslavia is trying hard to hold on to Montenegro, Serbia's last partner in what remains of the Yugoslav Federation. Montenegro's president, Milo Djukanovic, is pressing for independence, and has scheduled a referendum on the matter this summer.
Will a Bush administration oppose Montenegrin independence and give the help Mr. Kostunica he thinks he needs, risking some Republican wrath, especially in the Senate? If Montenegro becomes independent, what answer will Mr. Bush give to Kosovo's Albanians? Or to the Bosnian Serbs, who want independence for their part of Bosnia and Herzegovina?
How hard should a new president push Mr. Kostunica to hand over Mr. Milosevic to the international tribunal on war crimes? American aid to Serbia, aimed at consolidating the anti-Milosevic victory there, will be cut off on April 1 unless Mr. Bush can certify to Congress that the new government is cooperating with the tribunal. That may mean that Belgrade must arrest some suspected war criminals.
Mr. Bush will have to consider how much pressure to place on the government when popular unhappiness with a bad economy, power shortages and a restive Montenegro is reaching its peak. Steven Erlanger

HEADLINE: TRANSITION IN WASHINGTON: OVERSEAS -- IRAQ; 
No Honeymoon Likely for New President's Foreign Policy Team

BYLINE:  By Neil MacFarquhar

 BODY:
Every president takes office believing he can set the foreign policy agenda for his administration, only to discover that a major portion of that agenda has already been set by the world.
 The crises of the world do not take a time-out for a new American leader. President Clinton arrived hoping to focus on domestic issues, but was immediately faced by crises in places like Somalia, Haiti and Taiwan, along with hardy perennials like Russia and the Middle East. 
 President-elect George W. Bush was confronted by the killing of the president of Congo this week, and might see the election of a hawkish prime minister in Israel and the crumbling of the peace accord in Northern Ireland in his first month in office. Further down the line, Mr. Bush's enthusiasm for a missile-defense system is certain to generate fierce opposition in Europe and in Russia.
Much has been said, too, about Mr. Bush's inheriting the problem of Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi strongman against whom his father went to war, but whom he left in power. In recent years, Washington's focus has been on simply keeping sanctions against Iraq in force over growing opposition, especially from Russia and France.
In Asia, the first big decision, due in April, will be whether to sell destroyers, advanced weapons and radar systems to Taiwan -- a decision that could prompt China to respond by accelerating its own military buildup.
Beyond that a host of other challenges, large and small, will vie quickly for American attention. What follows is a tour of those likely to prove most urgent.
"Bush Is Criminal," says a floor mosaic at the front entrance of the once gleaming Rashid Hotel in downtown Baghdad, and the portrait in stone depicts a rather sinister Bush senior. The artwork harks back to the 1991 Gulf War, when the first President Bush advocated toppling Saddam Hussein. The sentiments have not changed much on either side, nor, with the new administration, have the personnel.
The Arab press refers to the new president almost universally as "Bush, al-ibn," or Bush, the son, and an unbowed Saddam Hussein is expected to quickly test the new president to free Iraq of the fetters in place since his father was president. Mr. Hussein's target would be the measures the United States has pushed to hobble his regime: economic sanctions, military overflights and limits on armaments.
Just as likely, Iraq will probably continue testing missiles and continue to welcome flights at its refurbished Baghdad airport -- some in defiance of the blockade. It will also continue to refuse to admit any United Nations weapons inspectors.
International support for the sanctions will be ever harder to muster. Even France and Russia, who American officials say favor keeping some control over Iraq's checkbook, favor easing the United Nations policy of reviewing whatever Baghdad buys with its oil money.
Middle Eastern governments will be reluctant to support tougher sanctions given the growing anti-American sentiment among Arabs due to Washington's support for Israel. Doing something to alleviate suffering in Iraq has become a popular means of defying the United States. Neil MacFarquhar

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home; 
Ave Atque Vale

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
This country has made greater gains in the eight years of Bill Clinton's presidency than in any comparable period in memory. Personal income is way up, unemployment startlingly low. Decades of federal budget deficits have turned into huge surpluses. 
 Not just economic but social indicators have improved. Crime is sharply down, as is the rate of teenage pregnancy. On the Wall Street Journal editorial page the other day Francis Fukuyama wrote: "The relentless cultural decline that at the beginning of the 1990's seemed like a fact of nature ground to a halt and, miraculously, reversed direction while Bill Clinton was president." 
 None of this has moved the Clinton-haters. George F. Will, the conservative columnist, wrote of Mr. Clinton last week: "Other than by soiling the office, he was a remarkably inconsequential president, like a person who walks across a field of snow and leaves no footprints." 
Neither facts nor logic can move the true haters. Mr. Will, for example, attributed the budget surplus in part to a Republican Congress and said Mr. Clinton's policies "did not interfere with the private wealth creation" that made it possible. 
The fact is that President Clinton had to drive his budget-balancing measures through Congress over solid Republican opposition, spending great early political capital to do so. Republicans had talked for years but had done nothing. He did it. The low interest rates that were then possible opened the way to the longest economic boom in our history. 
Mr. Clinton is criticized, right and left, for borrowing the Republicans' clothes on the budget and other matters. Another way to look at that is to say that he recognized the need for change in Democratic Party policies that were mired in the past. 
There is much to criticize in Mr. Clinton's record as president. When he denied to the American people that he had had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, I wrote that he would and should be judged by the people if the denial was false. He was so judged, and for some Americans that episode will always put him beyond the pale. 
Far-right zealots backed Paula Jones's dubious lawsuit against him, and brought Linda Tripp and her tapes to the independent counsel Kenneth Starr. But their nastiness could not excuse Mr. Clinton's lying under oath, as in his plea agreement with Mr. Starr's successor, Robert Ray, he has now admitted he did. 
In policy terms, I think his great failure as president was on civil liberties. He signed the cruel Immigration Act of 1996 into law without a murmur of protest. He allowed the destruction of federal habeas corpus, rejecting a compromise that would have saved its essential role as protector of constitutional rights. He carried on the drug war as its futile savagery became more and more obvious.
On those issues I thought he lacked a commitment to justice -- or was prepared to barter it away for the political advantage of countering right-wing charges that Democrats are soft on crime. But on other issues he was courageous. 
It took great courage to bring the Irish Republican Army into the political process in Northern Ireland, and he got closer than anyone has to settling that conflict. The Middle East peace process is in ruins now; but if there ever is peace, it will be along the lines Mr. Clinton courageously laid out. After a halting start in Bosnia, he brought Slobodan Milosevic's war crimes to an end there and in Kosovo -- despite hangdog Republican opposition. 
For someone in the White House he was extraordinarily human -- "an Oprah guest," Michiko Kakutani wrote in The New York Times, "who feels our pain because he struggles like the rest of us with his weight, his marriage and his golf game." Some of his critics were disgusted by that quality. They wanted a more distant president, one they could revere. Well, Harry Truman is generally admired now, and he was not on any pedestal. 
With all his flaws, Bill Clinton as president was a bigger man, a more generous man, than those who hated him. Maybe that played a part in their dislike: their recognition that he was more intelligent, more vital, more interesting than they could ever be. A reader of mine, George Bayliss, said it was "sheer animal jealousy."

HEADLINE: TRANSITION IN WASHINGTON; 
Statements of Clinton and Prosecutor and Excerpts From News Conference

 BODY:
Following are statements on the agreement reached by President Clinton and the independent counsel Robert W. Ray, and excerpts from a news conference held in Washington yesterday by Jake Siewert, a spokesman for the president, all as recorded by Federal News Service Inc.:

Mr. Clinton
 Today I signed a consent order in the lawsuit brought by the Arkansas Committee on Professional Conduct, which brings to an end that proceeding. I have accepted a five-year suspension of my law license, agreed to pay a $25,000 fine to cover counsel fees and acknowledged a violation of one of the Arkansas model rules of professional conduct because of testimony in my Paula Jones case deposition. The disbarment suit will now be dismissed. 
 I have taken every step I can to end this matter. I have already settled the Paula Jones case, even after it was dismissed as being completely without legal and factual merit. I have also paid court and counsel fees in restitution and been held in civil contempt for my deposition testimony regarding Ms. Lewinsky -- which Judge Wright agreed had no bearing on Ms. Jones's case -- even though I disagreed with the findings in the judge's order.
I will not seek any legal fees incurred as a result of the Lewinsky investigation, to which I might otherwise become entitled under the Independent Counsel Act. 
I have had occasion frequently to reflect on the Jones case. In this consent order, I acknowledge having knowingly violated Judge Wright's discovery orders in my deposition in that case. I tried to walk a fine line between acting lawfully and testifying falsely, but I now recognize that I did not fully accomplish this goal and that certain of my responses to questions about Ms. Lewinsky were false.
I have apologized for my conduct, and I have done my best to atone for it with my family, my administration and the American people. I have paid a high price for it, which I accept, because it caused so much pain to so many people. I hope my actions today will help bring closure and finality to these matters.

Mr. Ray
Fifteen months ago I promised the American people that I would complete this investigation promptly and responsibly. Today I fulfill that promise. 
President Clinton has acknowledged responsibility for his actions. He has admitted that he knowingly gave evasive and misleading answers to questions in the Jones deposition and that his conduct was prejudicial to the administration of justice. He has acknowledged that some of his answers were false. He has agreed to a five-year suspension of his Arkansas Bar license, and he has agreed not to seek attorneys' fees in connection with this matter.
The nation's interests have been served, and therefore I decline prosecution. In doing so, I have tried to heed Justice Robert Jackson's wisdom: "The citizens' safety lies in the prosecutor who tempers zeal with human kindness, who seeks truth and not victims, who serves the law and not factional purposes, and who approaches his task with humility." 
I trust that the decision made today meets the expectations of the American people, who deserve a resolution that acknowledges the president's conduct, respects America's institutions and demonstrates sensitivity to our constitutional system of government. This matter is now concluded. May history and the American people judge that it has been concluded justly.

Questions and Answers
Q . How long have they been in negotiations on both cases? And when did he sign the order? Was that signed today? And what is his mood now? I mean, he's leaving with humiliation.

MR. SIEWERT -- The president's lawyers have been involved over the past several weeks in a discussion with both parties. Obviously, they've been in discussions with the Office of the Independent Counsel for a long time, along with the parties in Arkansas. But the case was brought to a close in the last couple of weeks, and the actual exchange of letters happened this morning.
The president -- I think you saw him last night, and he knew full well then what was happening today. The president is upbeat about his future, looking forward to putting this behind him and returning to life in New York and resuming his duties as a citizen of the United States. . . .

Q. Jake, was this deal contingent on him making this statement while he still held the office of president of the United States?
And why couldn't he have done this next week?

A. The timing was something that was agreed to between the president's lawyers and the Office of the Independent Counsel and the parties involved in Arkansas. But that was an agreement that I can't detail for you.

Q. Does the president feel this deal is fair? Does he feel he was pushed into acknowledging wrongdoing and that this is still kind of unfair?

A. Well, I think the president felt like the punishment in the disbarment case went well beyond what was ordinary in these cases, but he wanted to put it behind him, and he wanted to bring that chapter to a close. . . .

Q. How does the president feel about all of this coming down on his last day in office, a day that's normally a very special day for a president?

A. The president is looking forward to returning to life as a private citizen. He's had a great eight years. In many ways, there have been some difficult times, but he's putting this behind him now. And his record of economic achievement, of bringing leadership on issues of peace and prosperity to the United States, are unchallenged at this point. And he talked about that very directly last night in his farewell address.

Q. Doesn't that somehow stain the last day, though?

A. You can all make that judgment for yourselves. The president has acknowledged making a personal mistake, one that he regrets. . . .

Q. How will the president feel if the people of this country will look him in history as a liar who, during the indictment, was thinking that he was talking about the truth, but now he's telling in different words, "I was lying?"

A. I think it's very important to put this in perspective. The president has acknowledged many times that this was a very painful personal episode in his own life. When he gave that deposition, he was trying to be truthful, but he did not want to talk about the relationship that at that point had been over for an entire year. So he did his best to try to tell the truth but without being particularly helpful to people who were trying, frankly, to embarrass the president in a quest for information that was not particularly relevant and was in no way material to that case.
So the president has said before that that was a painful episode, he has apologized for misleading people about what happened there, but he wants to put this behind him. And he wants people to remember that every day that he was here, that he was working hard on the issues that mattered to them, and that's the reason why they elected and re-elected him.

Q. So Jake, how do you separate these two things: that he says that he knowingly violated the judge's order, but he didn't knowingly give misleading and false answers?

A. Obviously, these are documents written by lawyers and that were negotiated in a very particular way. And I think I'd probably refer you to Mr. Kendall as we get into the more arcane notions of this.

Q. No, but the bottom line ----

A. The bottom line is that looking back now, the president can see where his testimony was false.

Q. But he is not saying that he knowingly gave false testimony?

A. That's right.

No Honeymoon Likely for New President's Foreign Policy Team

BYLINE:  By Howard W. French

 BODY:
Every president takes office believing he can set the foreign policy agenda for his administration, only to discover that a major portion of that agenda has already been set by the world.
 The crises of the world do not take a time-out for a new American leader. President Clinton arrived hoping to focus on domestic issues, but was immediately faced by crises in places like Somalia, Haiti and Taiwan, along with hardy perennials like Russia and the Middle East. 
 President-elect George W.

Further down the line, Mr. Bush's enthusiasm for a missile-defense system is certain to generate fierce opposition in Europe and in Russia.

Beyond that a host of other challenges, large and small, will vie quickly for American attention. What follows is a tour of those likely to prove most urgent.
In his campaign, Mr. Bush raised the prospect of strongly reinforced ties with Japan, and if most Americans missed this message, Japanese leaders received it loud and clear. The Japanese are anxious to discuss a variety of fronts, from security matters to North Korea and the economy.
One major question involves the presence in Japan of 47,000 American troops, which are mostly concentrated in the southern province of Okinawa, where they have long drawn strong local opposition.
Foreign policy advisers to Mr. Bush have said that Washington should reduce its military presence there. But military planners say a reduction of the troops in Okinawa would require Washington to upgrade its presence somewhere else. At present Guam, a United States protectorate in the Western Pacific, is cited as the most likely candidate.
In economic matters, Japan, which has the world's second largest economy, remains stuck in a slow growth mode, barely above recession. The slowdown in the United States threatens Japan's nascent recovery, and the two governments will have to coordinate policies to prevent a global recession.
Japan's economic weakness, coinciding with the American slowdown, confronts the Bush team with a dilemma. On one hand, some of Mr. Bush's economic advisers have already strongly criticized the Clinton administration's longstanding advice to Japan to maintain its heavy deficit spending until growth is restored.
On the other hand, Washington will badly want Japan to help pick up some of the slack in global consumption due to the downturn in the United States. Howard W. French

Beyond that a host of other challenges, large and small, will vie quickly for American attention. What follows is a tour of those likely to prove most urgent.
General Powell's meetings with Africa analysts at the State Department this month did not register a reaction in Africa, where officials do not expect much of a change between the outgoing president and the new one.
Aside from the uncertainty in Congo, what relatively little attention Africa gets from the White House will be focused mostly on those nations considered important economically to the United States, the largest being Nigeria and South Africa. These countries, which suffer from various degrees of instability, also derive their importance from their critical role in tackling African problems that the West cannot ignore, including peacekeeping and AIDS. South Africa, the continent's economic giant, lurches forward, weakened by social problems, including an out-of-control AIDS rate.
Nigeria remains important because it is the biggest oil producer on a continent that is expected to supply more and more of the crude needed by the United States. And Nigeria and South Africa are the only nations with militaries capable of assuming the role of regional police force.
Like Mr. Clinton, the new president will not want to send American soldiers to Africa, preferring to train soldiers in Nigeria as peacekeepers for places like Sierra Leone. Angola, the continent's second biggest oil producer, remains devastated by its long-running civil war, with Washington now on the side of the government. Adopting a comprehensive policy toward Angola, as well as smaller oil producers like Congo Republic and Equatorial Guinea, might be a tantalizing possibility for the oilman in Mr. Bush.

 ON MONEY AND MARKETS
A Wall Street Memoir.
By Henry Kaufman.
388 pp. New York:
McGraw-Hill Publishing Company. $24.95.
 Henry Kaufman earned the sobriquet "Dr. Doom" during the turbulent 1970's, when he was the chief economist for the investment banking firm of Salomon Brothers. His frequent criticisms of government policies were right on target. So when, on the Tuesday morning of Aug. 17, 1982, Kaufman predicted the market had bottomed out, the effect was electrifying. The huge rally that day in both stocks and bonds was the beginning of what proved to be the longest bull market in history.
It was also more or less the last time anyone beyond the markets heard of Henry Kaufman. A power struggle at Salomon led to his resignation in 1988. He remained a respected commentator on markets throughout the 1990's, and he formed a small hedge fund with a partner in 1997, just in time to lose a bundle in the Asian financial crisis before cashing out last year. Without spectacular returns to brag about, or the big institutional setting he previously had enjoyed, Kaufman was no longer the kind of person whose pronouncements were trumpeted by the news media. He became instead a generous philanthropist. Now he has written a book. That's the capsule public history of Henry Kaufman. 
The deeper story related in "On Money and Markets: A Wall Street Memoir" is much more interesting. Kaufman was a leader of a generation of practical economists who, it can fairly be said, teamed up to save global capitalism at a critical moment. That is, having come to see inflation as a menace threatening to redraw the line between the public and private spheres in the industrial democracies, they capitalized on a lifetime of shared experience, including early years in the Federal Reserve System and the Treasury Department, to do something about it. 
It seems misleading to single out any single individual -- so characteristic a mode was partnership among members of this generation -- but Paul Volcker, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, undoubtedly deserves the lion's share of the credit. And it is Volcker who has written the preface to Kaufman's book. As soon as they had won the battle, however, these veterans were displaced by a new generation of traders and salesmen, who rode the financial boom to great heights. 
Born in 1927, the son of a kosher butcher in a small village in Germany, Kaufman had the usual German-Jewish education in extreme civics. The family fled the Nazis in 1937, as the sound of shattering glass and tales of the Weimar hyperinflation rang in the boy's ears. Then came high school in Washington Heights (Henry Kissinger and Alan Greenspan had preceded him by a year or two), New York University and a Columbia M.B.A. After five years as a credit analyst in an industrial bank, a night-school Ph.D. from N.Y.U. and five more years as an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, he was well prepared to join Salomon Brothers & Hutzler in 1962.
"Solly" in those days was mainly a bond house, a specialty player on Broad Street, not a power. Most of its partners sat among the traders and salesmen on the company's wide-open trading floor; they took their meals together in the partners' dining room and knew one another's business. Few had been to fancy colleges; some hadn't been to college at all. Kaufman was the first Ph.D. ever hired by the firm. 
But Salomon, even more than most of the rest of Wall Street, was on the verge of a terrific boom. Kaufman started as apprentice to a single man, the legendary historian of bonds Sidney Homer. He wound up supervising a staff of 450 analysts.
The seminal events of Kaufman's story took place during the roaring 1980's. Those were the years when Salomon, chronically short of capital to support its rampaging growth, merged with the giant commodities trading company known as Phibro and sold shares to the public. Phibro was digested relatively quickly and Salomon went on a borrowing binge to finance its entry into exciting -- and apparently risky -- new lines of business. 
But the gloomy Gus, Kaufman, was excluded from the firm's topmost management, as he had been before -- and he tendered his resignation in 1987, after the firm abandoned its commercial paper and municipal bond businesses in order to pursue high-yield lending (i.e., junk bonds). "I knew that the firm was now headed in a direction I fundamentally opposed and that nothing I would say would change that course."
In a sense, that is the climax of the book. Nothing else is as interesting -- not the takeover attempt by Ronald Perlman, the rescue attempt by Warren Buffett, the scandal of the Treasury auction squeeze in 1991 that led to Salomon's acquisition by Travelers Insurance and finally the merger of Travelers Insurance and Citicorp. Nowhere is Kaufman more succinct than when he describes the differences in culture between his generation and the next, as represented by the ultimate Salomon spinoff -- the group of traders and "quants" who formed Long-Term Capital Management. 
"They are of a new vintage," Kaufman writes, "trained in arcane mathematical techniques, prideful of quantitative risk analysis and not outward-going in demeanor. But like the buccaneers of old, they are eager risk takers, willing to employ huge leverage to succeed." And he continues: "I sensed that they would prefer to internalize the firm, to diminish client relationships and to increase the volume of proprietary activities." A few years later Long-Term Capital went spectacularly bankrupt, taking the international financial system to the brink of collapse. Between the sales-oriented "quants" of the new generation and the highly social "credit men" of the old falls the shadow. The upshot of the difference of opinion between them is not yet clear. 
Kaufman acknowledges the help of David Sicilia, a professional business historian, in the writing of this memoir, but that does not prevent several of his chapters from sounding like the speeches they were when they were young: "Learning From Financial Crises," "The Urgent Need for Regulatory and Supervisory Reform," "Financial Institutions in the New Century" and the like. But they are good speeches, bristling with examples and insights. And all of them support the basic argument of this very useful book: that the tension between entrepreneurial impulses and fiduciary responsibility is the oldest story in finance.

New Brunswick to Get Two New Rental Buildings

BYLINE:  By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK 

 BODY:
THEY have been covered with asphalt for more than a decade. But later this year, work will begin to erect housing on two parking lots across Neilson Street from each other and not far from this city's gradually reviving downtown.
 Within three years a total of 767 rental apartments in two buildings, one five stories high and the other 10, are to fill the lots. Between the buildings are to be 28,800 square feet of stores and 1,703 parking spaces, including a 1,025-car garage in the taller structure. 
 Two existing office buildings totaling 210,000 square feet that are adjacent to the lots are to be refurbished as part of the $130 million project, which is being developed by Plaza Redevelopment in partnership with the nonprofit New Brunswick Development Corporation. 
Plaza is a joint venture of Matrix Development Group of Cranbury, known primarily for its development of suburban warehouse distribution centers, and the Applied Development Company of Hoboken and the Roseland Property Company of Short Hills, both active residential builders. New Brunswick's Redevelopment Authority named the group the developer of the 10.5-acre parcel, bounded by Route 18 and Burnet, George, New, Liberty and Richmond Streets.
Matrix is to refurbish the offices. All three partners in Plaza are to be involved in the residential components, but Roseland will be managing partner for the 417-unit mid-rise building, the Highlands at Plaza Square, while Applied is to be the managing partner for the 350-unit high-rise, to be called the Metropolitan. 
The large commitment from the private sector, New Brunswick officials said, is a major endorsement of their 25-year effort to draw investment to the city. It will also bring more market-rate housing to downtown.
Three such projects, Riverwatch Court, Riverwatch Commons and Hiram Square Town Homes, totaling 200 rentals and 35 town homes, were completed by the Applied Company over the last three years on two blocks adjacent to the new project, showing that "people want to live in downtown New Brunswick," said David Barry, a vice president at Applied. The other developers agreed. The new rentals, they added, will surpass the existing ones in amenities and rents. 
"Expanding the housing to two adjacent blocks," said Glenn Patterson, director of the city's Department of Planning, Community and Economic Development, "will help create a critical mass of residents downtown." 
And more residents, said Christopher J. Paladino, president of the New Brunswick Development Corporation, will "impact the retail sector," which still needs a boost. Moreover, he said, the new housing will push forward other projects planned in that immediate area. 
They include a mixed-use building announced in 1999 that is planned to rise across George Street from the new rentals. It is to house hotel rooms, corporate apartments and a new home for the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development, part of Rutgers University. Mr. Paladino said that $12 million is being sought from the state to complete financing for the Heldrich Center project. 
THE 767-apartment housing development conforms with the state's Development and Redevelopment Plan, which encourages growth where highways, mass transit and utilities are in place and discourages it in less developed areas. 
While the plan, adopted in 1992 and now being revised, cannot block development, developers say that it has been made stronger by recent state initiatives, among them state agencies' using the plan to allocate funds and establish regulations, the state's pledge to buy a million acres of land and preserve it as open space, and the state's push to encourage the reuse of former polluted sites in cities. 
Previous plans for the two parking lots involved putting up office buildings. But none of those plans moved forward.
In 1999 Matrix Development Group, with AEW Capital Partners of Boston as a financial partner, bought the lots and the then half-vacant office buildings, for $14 million from a lender who had taken them back from a previous developer.
Joseph Taylor, Matrix's president, said the partners did so because "New Brunswick, with its train and highway access as well as record of investment, is a city whose time has come." He said the purchase also supported his company's ongoing efforts to diversify.
Originally, he said, the plan was to refurbish the office buildings and develop the lot closest to them, which is three acres, with more offices and some stores over a parking garage for existing office tenants as well future users. The other lot, 5.8 acres, would have been developed with housing. 
Mr. Taylor said it soon became clear that both lots should be developed for residential use, given the success of the nearby Riverwatch projects and the feeling that the demand in general in the city was stronger for housing than for more offices. 
One reason for choosing residential, said Marshall Tycher, a Roseland principal, is the competition from the nearby Princeton Route 1 office market, 15 miles to the south. Most of the 1.3 million square feet of office space completed in that market in the last two years has been absorbed, leaving it with a vacancy rate of 9 percent at the end of 2000, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the commercial real estate services firm. 
Mr. Taylor said the Matrix-Roseland-Applied joint venture was formed not only to tap the partners' experience but to spread the risk of so large a project. Matrix and AEW dissolved their partnership after selling the site to the new development group, Mr. Taylor said. He added that plans for the office buildings, now 80 percent leased, include renovating their lobbies and common areas. 
Mr. Tycher said that combining forces would speed the building process, attract financing and better withstand the repercussions in case of an economic slowdown. But, he said, making the economics work also called for getting the public sector involved.
The city amended its redevelopment area to include the site, which Mr. Patterson, the city's planning director, said enabled "us to provide the project with a 20-year tax abatement and to have a little more control on what gets built."
The Applied Company is also working with the New Brunswick Parking Authority to build the 1,025-car garage within the high-rise. The authority will sell tax-exempt bonds for the garage, and ultimately buy the garage, making the economics of high-rise construction viable, said Mr. Barry, the Applied vice president. 
Because the garage will also be used by the Heldrich Center development planned across George Street, its economics also are enhanced, Mr. Paladino said, adding that an underground garage planned for the Heldrich site has been eliminated. Construction of the center is expected to start this summer if the necessary money is obtained, he said. 
That is about the same time work is to begin on the Highlands at Plaza Square, designed by the Lessard Architectural Group of Vienna, Va. Mr. Tycher of Roseland said the mid-rise would contain apartments with one or two bedrooms, or two bedrooms plus dens, ranging from 711 to 1,560 square feet. 
THE brick siding and stucco building is to feature such amenities as washers, dryers and high-speed Internet access for each unit, a health club, a business center and an outdoor pool.
Rents are to be $1,300 to $2,200 a month, Mr. Tycher said, adding that the project is being targeted to young professionals working in New Brunswick as well as along the Route 1 corridor.
The Metropolitan, the high-rise, will feature studio to two-bedroom apartments with 800 to 1,000 square feet and will also have washers and dryers and high-speed Internet access in each unit, said Mr. Barry of Applied. 
Amenities planned for the brick building, designed by the Manhattan architect Peter DeWitt, include a 24-hour concierge desk and a health club. There will also be a landscaped courtyard atop the four-story parking garage, which will have retail stores on the first floor. Apartment rents are to range from $1,000 to $1,750 a month, Mr. Barry said. 
New Brunswick needs a total of 1,000 to 1,500 residences downtown to truly turn it into a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week neighborhood, Mr. Barry said. Adding the 767 new units, he said, will be a huge step in that direction.

HEADLINE: The La Guardia Syndrome 

BYLINE:  By Glenn Thrush; Glenn Thrush is a writer based in Brooklyn.

 BODY:
At 5:45 a.m., Mike Walker squeezes behind the controls of his fat, happy McDonnell Douglas 88 as it warms up at the Kansas City International Airport. The ground crew has been toiling on the subfreezing Tarmac since 4 a.m., cramming his plane with 22,000 pounds of jet fuel, two tons of luggage, 90 trays of heat-and-serve eggs Benedict and several cases of down-market Champagne. The glow of the control panel reflects against Walker's face as he rubs his hands together.
 "It's a great day to fly!" the 13-year veteran with Milwaukee-based Midwest Express Airlines says. "You live for days like this." 
 The Missouri sky is turning Tahiti blue, and the forecast 1,000 miles in all directions calls for more of the same. As the sun peeks over the plains, it reveals a frost-sprinkled Tarmac so empty and inviting that Walker could tool his aircraft around the runway like a soapbox racer. By 6 a.m. everything's on schedule in Kansas City for a 6:45 departure. 
Then Walker hears the report from La Guardia Airport, and his smile disappears. The tower has ordered a 45-minute "ground hold," meaning New York-bound planes at airports around the country are to be held at their home gates until they receive the go-ahead.
So, Walker puts down his little clipboard with the preflight checklist and plucks his disintegrating copy of "Lonesome Dove" from the dash. Here, on the far side of the Mississippi River, 1,100 miles from his destination, Walker cools his jets in a New York City traffic jam.

7:29 a.m., C.S.T.: We taxi out of the gate 44 minutes behind schedule, to a smattering of applause from the passengers. Rolling to a corner of the runway, we sit for another 15 minutes, awaiting La Guardia's final O.K.
The plane takes off at 7:48.
"You have to try as hard as you can to shave off time in the air," Walker says, "because they're always trying to steal it from you."
At least the weather is cooperating. Taking advantage of a stiff tail wind, Walker cuts our delay down to a little more than a half-hour by the time we enter La Guardia's airspace.
Mike Walker ranks No. 50 out of 359 Midwest pilots in seniority, so he gets to avoid New York most of the time. The pilots who get stuck with the assignment, for Midwest and other airlines, are the younger ones who don't have a choice. Walker says that anyone who needs to take a day off on short notice -- say, for the Super Bowl or a kid's birthday -- is likely to ask a friend, "Can I take one of your La Guardias?"
La Guardia may be the worst airport in the history of airports. Thousands of stranded passengers learned that during the spectacular delays that accompanied the blizzard just before New Year's. But most people understand bad weather. Any airport in the world would have had trouble pulling through a storm like that. It's the waiting for hours on seemingly perfect days that drives people crazy, and La Guardia specializes in that. Last September, the airport accounted for 127 of the 129 most-delayed flights in the United States.
As recently as a year ago, La Guardia was just run-of-the-mill bad. In fact, it used to be better than Newark International Airport, the longtime delay champ. Then, last April, President Clinton, under pressure from the Senate, signed A.I.R.-21, which removed a regulation capping the number of flights at La Guardia at around 1,050. The law was supposed to enable little airlines to compete at La Guardia, which, in theory, would drive down prices. 
But the big airlines muscled right in. Continental Airlines went after 156 of the newly minted slots to fly its 50- to 75-seat regional jets. Delta Air Lines wanted 186 new slots. US Airways, which has the biggest presence at La Guardia, bid for 82 slots. Though the airlines didn't get all they asked for, the number of flights a day at La Guardia jumped to 1,300, with some days running as high as 1,460.
Where were all these new planes coming from? Mostly midsize cities on the East Coast and in the Rust Belt desperate for status in the corporate world. As the economy has boomed, second-tier cities pushed hard for direct flights to and from New York, and this changed the airline business significantly; La Guardia became the hub of a vast commuter network. Meanwhile, delays tripled, which the airlines, to a one, insist is not their fault.
"Who am I to tell the citizens of Rochester they can't have nonstop service to New York?" says Gordon Bethune, Continental's C.E.O. "The market was there. We're not stupid people. If you take the controls off we are going to compete. La Guardia is the biggest market in the world. It's the center of the universe when it comes to business travelers."
The competition, however, seems to have gotten way out of hand. In 1999, there were 9 daily flights from La Guardia to Rochester; now there are 18. "Everybody knows that there's not the demand for all those additional flights," says an airline-industry lobbyist who backed A.I.R.- 21. "It's the dark side of competition."
All of those extra planes converge on the smallest major airport in the United States, a 680-acre wedge of land with two stumpy, intersecting runways, a woefully limited network of taxiways and tiny, overstuffed terminals. Built on landfill taken from Rikers Island in 1939, the place was originally constructed to handle seaplanes and light prop aircraft and was pretty much obsolete the day it opened. By 1942, three of its runways were collapsing under the weight of increased wartime traffic.
Six decades later, the collapse is less physical than systemic. A typical business day starts off badly, with delays snowballing early and wickedly accumulating through the course of the day. By 7 p.m. gate delays average one to two hours, with ground holds freezing planes all over the country. Even if a plane manages to push off from the gate on schedule (which gives the airline the right to claim credit for an on-time departure), it's likely to join a line of 20 or 30 other aircraft waiting for takeoff.
Back in Kansas City, the last flight from New York, scheduled to get in at 9:50, often drags in well after midnight. The late shift of the ground crew, which is supposed to get off work at 11 p.m., sometimes works until 4 a.m., when the early shift starts straggling in. "I'm sick of hearing about La Guardia's problems," says Anthony Goodman, the crew chief who loaded Walker's MD-88. "I wish they would just tear the place down."

11:06 a.m., E.S.T.: We land in New York, 41 minutes late. John Yowell, Midwest's station manager in New York, is waiting for us out on the Tarmac. He's like the chief of an Indy pit crew. His job is to get planes back onto the blacktop as fast as possible, and today his crew is working double-fast. It seems like a waste, considering that while we were landing, I counted 16 planes waiting to take off on the opposite runway.
"Where's the darn fuel truck?" shouts Yowell, standing under the plane's sooty wing, hands jammed in the pockets of his gray trench coat. By the time the first 10 passengers have rushed off the plane, a worker has attached a hose from his little truck to the aft toilet. 
With the fuel truck still M.I.A., Yowell, a painfully conscientious Missouri native in his late 40's, walks over to the conveyor belt and begins to throw luggage with the crew. His lapels flap in a stiff breeze.
Yowell used to ride a desk at Midwest's Wisconsin headquarters, first coordinating its Y2K system and later working on its disaster preparedness program. Cataclysm is his stock in trade, which is why he was sent to La Guardia in August. Some of the bigger airlines want to hire more ground crews to cut down on time between flights, but they can't find enough job applicants. American Airlines' ground-crew union estimates it is about 25 workers short, despite offering fifth-year pay ($8.05 an hour) to new hires.
Yowell has a full crew, but because Midwest Express is such a small carrier (it runs only eight flights a day in and out of La Guardia), the company has been assigned gates deep inside the terminal. That adds an extra hurdle: when the airport is busy it has to wait for other planes in front to clear out. 
Yowell's job has made him a prisoner of La Guardia. "I live at the Wyndham Garden across the highway," he says. "I come in at like 7 and go home at around 10 at night. I eat Wendy's every single day."
The fuel truck finally arrives, and as I hop on the plane, I ask Yowell if he has ever gone into the city to have a beer or see the Rockettes. "Sure," he answers. "Thirty years ago on my senior-class trip."
Yowell's crew did the job, turning the plane around in 26 minutes. While they were working outside, Captain Walker was crawling around the cabin, helping the flight attendants clean up. We leave the gate at 11:45, 40 minutes behind schedule.
At first, bad news comes from the tower. There's a traffic jam in the Midwest Express alleyway; we're hemmed in indefinitely. Then we experience one of those rare parting-of-the-clouds moments. The line for takeoff magically shrinks to six, and Walker skips his usual apology over the intercom. We make up more time when Midwest's flight-control headquarters gives us a northern flight path to avoid a strong head wind. The sunshine is spreading around the cabin.
I'm sitting next to a huge Missouri state trooper, who had been scowling in the airport lounge, scowling at cheerful John Yowell on the ramp, scowling even when the plane was taking off. Finally, he thaws out, chatting about all the people he has busted and ordering himself a club soda. Sara King, the bubbly 24-year-old flight attendant who serves him, tells me that she always wanted a life in the air, but now she's not quite so sure. Every time she comes to La Guardia, King spends at least an hour or two waiting on the Tarmac. "The passengers know what to expect," she says. "But that doesn't stop them from freaking out."
She spends a lot of time keeping customers from using the bathroom -- technically the plane is not allowed to inch forward in line if anyone is standing up. And lately, she has noticed an even more annoying trend: people are faking chest pains just to get the pilot to taxi them back to the gate.
"When things get bad, I end up hiding out," King says. "What are you going to tell people? It's hard to look them in the eye. You don't want to even let them into your personal space."

1:44 p.m., C.S.T.: We land in Kansas City, 29 minutes late. Just after we arrive, Mike Walker rolls his suitcase down the ramp and bids me farewell. The new crew boards, led by the chipper captain, John Leach, who views delays as something of a personal affront. "We'll see what we can do about it," he says, tossing his hat into the cockpit.
When I walk off the plane and into the waiting area, I can practically feel the bad vibes. An elderly woman who had been trying to refold a New York subway map crumples it up and jams it into her purse. I take a look at the schedule board. The departure time has been pushed back from 1:55 to 3:10 p.m.
Another ground hold at La Guardia.

3:10 p.m., C.S.T.: We leave the gate in Kansas City -- 1 hour 15 minutes behind schedule. Takeoff is at 3:20.
As usual, getting aloft gives wing to false hope. With a tail wind at nearly 500 miles an hour, the old MD-88's top speed, we appear to be making up time. Sixty miles south of the approach, Captain Leach gets an order to slow down, relayed from the La Guardia tower. There's no room to land.
It's only natural that pilots like Leach, however reasonable they may be, start thinking that the La Guardia tower is the seat of all evil. "They always do what makes their lives easier," Leach says.
A couple of days later, I visited the controllers in the tower, which is known as the Cab. There, pilots are thought of as Gomer Pyles with wings. "You got to talk to some of these guys like they're kindergartners," says a controller, Leslie Warfield, a Texan whose four-year tour in the Cab has given her major New York attitude. "They just don't see the big picture."
The Cab is a little round room nine stories above the runway filled with seven nervous controllers jabbering into headsets, eyes fixed on distant moving points outside of big plate glass windows. Occasionally, the men gently bump one another, like seven sleepwalkers in seven separate dreams. They place snacks on the windowsill in front of them so they'll never have to turn around -- a jug of grape Gatorade, three bananas, dented coffee cups. Behind them, taped to a wall, is this reassuring quote: "You can be a king or a street sweeper but everyone dances with the grim reaper."
The system is disarmingly low-tech. Each plane is assigned a "flight strip," which is placed in a little plastic caddy. The caddies are then slotted into metal cabinets: there's one for planes that are ready to leave their gates, another for planes lining up for takeoff and one for landing planes.
The controllers love the system because it's so simple, so concrete. When a flight lands, they simply chuck the old caddy into a plastic spackling bucket and move on to the next plane.
Lately, however, the simple, concrete system has been breaking down. Some days, there are more plastic caddies than can fit in the metal cabinets. Burnout is becoming a serious issue. Right now, there are 36 controllers. Roughly a third are new arrivals, and another third are hardened veterans who will never leave. The middle third -- Warfield included -- have submitted their paperwork to be transferred to a saner facility.

6:54 p.m., E.S.T.: We land in New York, 1 hour 19 minutes late. Captain Leach is slumped in a passenger seat shaking his head. He still has one more leg to go, the trip back to the Midwest Express hub in Milwaukee.
In the terminal, John Yowell is a dozen hours into his workday. In the evenings, he administers to the grumbling passengers who crowd the waiting areas. There have been nights, he says, when he can't just lie there watching TV at the Wyndham Garden knowing his customer-service reps are being yelled at. So he'll get up, put on his pants and take the shuttle van across the street.
"The rule in airlines, and I hate it, is that the louder you get, the more we will give you to shut up," Yowell says. "I had a guy in here last month who was yelling and screaming at one of my people, so I turned to him and said, 'Sir, you are looking at the man who decides whether or not you get on my airplane tonight.' That shut him up." More often, he opts for the velvet glove. "A couple of weeks ago we had a four-hour gate hold, so I bought everybody pizza. Pizza for 350 people."
Giving out food can be risky, though. Back at the US Airways terminal, desk agents flinch when they see customers carrying food court trays. "Lately," one clerk confides, "people have been throwing McDonald's."
Things are supposed to get better on Jan. 31. In December, the F.A.A. sliced 140 flights off La Guardia's daily schedule, about half of the new flights. A lottery was held to determine which ones to cut, and the major losers were US Airways, Continental and Delta; Midwest Express got to keep all of its new slots.
That will ease the crisis, but nobody expects a return to normalcy. There are still far too many planes competing for too little space. If there is anything resembling a long-term solution, it lies eight miles south in the Jamaica Bay swamps. Nobody would ever call J.F.K. a sleepy airport, but it runs fewer flights than either La Guardia or Newark, despite having four spacious runways, bigger terminals and acres of open ground space.
But the big airlines aren't interested. When the slot restrictions were lifted at La Guardia, they were also lifted at J.F.K. What happened? The airlines added a grand total of 15 new daily flights.
J.F.K.'s unpopularity can be traced to those extra eight miles from Manhattan, a cabby crawl through the terminally snarled roadways of deep Queens. The airport itself, in a seemingly perpetual state of reconstruction, is another worry.
"The Manhattan business traveler doesn't want to go there," says Continental's Gordon Bethune, who has a vested interest in boosting his company's Newark hub. "Midtown-to-J.F.K. is not competitive, and it never will be."
The crisis at La Guardia may ultimately change that. But so far, the only domestic carrier to run all of its flights out of J.F.K. is JetBlue, a start-up whose slogan is "J.F.K. is New York City's most on-time airport."
"I think it's funny people get fixated on the cab ride," says JetBlue's founder, David Neeleman. "You want to fly into La Guardia? Good for you. Sooner or later people are just gonna have to suck it up, drive the extra eight miles and get over the perception that La Guardia's the only show in town."

7:45 p.m., E.S.T.: We board for the final leg. 8:00: We are still sitting at the gate, doors closed, waiting for six airplanes in our alleyway to move out of the way. Customers get up to fiddle with their luggage in the overheads and to use the bathroom, ignoring the flight attendants. "I'll sit down when the plane moves!" one lady snaps.
8:02: We finally leave the gate, 1 hour 17 minutes behind schedule.
Take off at 8:18. "I know we're running an hour late," John Leach tells the passengers. "But we'll do our best to knock off a few minutes."
Leach is good to his word. 9:10 p.m. C.S.T.: We land in Milwaukee in a driving snow, 54 minutes late. The passengers stagger down the jetway while the MD-88 settles under a blanket of snow, resting up for another day of chasing the clock in and out of New York City.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
Lincoln Center's Next Big Production: Itself

BYLINE:  By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
FEWER and fewer things are not television. The dwindling list includes music, dance, theater, opera, movies and architecture. All six of these holdouts against post-civilization can be seen struggling for their lives at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. The arts complex itself is a grand artistic synthesis -- an opera, or Gesamtkunstwerk, in Wagner's term -- of pre-electronic communications. Nightly, it stages a meta-performance by artists, audiences and the physical settings that allow contact between them in public space.
 In the interest of survival, the settings are about to be remade. Lincoln Center is in the planning stage of a project that will result in the overhaul of its theaters and public spaces and perhaps even the replacement of some of them. The project could cost up to $1.5 billion and take a decade to complete. Lincoln Center officials hope to present a plan by early summer. 
 Bigger lobbies. More rehearsal space. Comfortable dressing rooms and offices. These are on the reasonable wish lists of Lincoln Center's constituent companies. There is also talk of building a second opera house on the site of Damrosch Park, perhaps with a revenue-producing office tower rising above it. They can build up, down, front and sideways, but space is limited in all directions. There is no excuse, however, to set limits on architectural imagination. Not in a place dedicated to art. 
Much has changed in the decades since Lincoln Center was built: the needs of the resident companies; the city's scale; its relationship to the world; the sources of its native cultural vitality; its economic shift from an industrial to a cultural base; and the impact of mass media on traditional forms. The reconstruction is an opportunity to reckon with these changes, not just forms and functions but the ideas behind them. Even if the visible changes amount to minor alterations (and this is not likely), these should be informed by full awareness of the transformations in urban life.
Above all, the project should be seen as a civic exercise in self-evaluation. Like the plans now being developed for the Con Edison site on the East River edge of midtown Manhattan and the proposal to host the Olympic Games in 2012, the Lincoln Center project is an opportunity to refocus the city's image by architectural means. I have neither prescriptions nor proscriptions to offer Lincoln Center's decision makers on the aesthetic direction their plans should take. I suggest only that they follow the advice of the architectural historian John Summerson and "sort out those aging ideas that get encrusted around past creative achievement and clog the proper workings of the imagination in changing times."
Recently, a friend sent me a photograph of Lincoln Center under construction. If you squint, the site looks like an ancient ruin: a Dionysian festival district, perhaps, dug up on Mediterranean shores. What I want to do here is conduct a kind of archaeological expedition: to dig up other fragments from the ethos that produced Lincoln Center, in the belief that its officials will want to build on an awareness of what they have.
I will hunt around, especially, for shards from the imagination of Philip Johnson, the youngest of the architects who led the Lincoln Center project and the one living member of the group. His role exceeded those of the others. He was architect of the New York State Theater, the most successful of the theaters; he designed the main plaza, and he prepared the site plan for the buildings that surround it. His work reveals the shifting values of the period that produced Lincoln Center.
When the complex was built, architects of major civic projects typically took a blank-slate approach. Under the aegis of urban renewal, they swept away vast tracts of cityscape to create a clean surface for their designs. Lincoln Center is a monument to the tabula rasa way of doing things. Those days are long gone. Instead, there are landmarks laws to protect entire districts from demolition, and community boards who demand that new buildings emulate the appearance of old ones. Architects themselves think in terms of physical context, incremental change and historical continuity. It's possible that these are now among the aging ideas to be sorted out.
No part of Lincoln Center has been landmarked. Nonetheless, it is a historic site. For better or worse, it is the mother of all performing arts centers. It echoes with memories of great performances. And it represents a pivotal moment in the history of architectural taste, a time when the orthodoxies of modern architecture were beginning to crumble. In this sense, Lincoln Center stands at the threshhold of the present state of the art. It ushered in an era of confusion that has since gone by many names: eclecticism, pluralism, postmodernism or the relativity of taste.
It should not be surprising, then, if even the most enlightened of Lincoln Center's officials find themselves without a fixed set of preconceptions for the redesign. They are, in effect, reaping the uncertainty sown at Lincoln Center four decades ago. An excavation of the Lincoln Center era can uncover much about the unfolding of architecture in the years ahead. It can also help clarify directions the designers may wish to pursue.
Planning for Lincoln Center began in 1955. The main theaters opened from 1962 (Philharmonic, now Avery Fisher, Hall) to 1966 (the Metropolitan Opera), with the Juilliard School arriving in 1969. Public and critical reception of the houses and the overall complex was mixed. Lincoln Center had novelty going for it, and optimism, and these qualities were more highly prized in architecture in the 1960's than they are today. But the positive response they generated was offset by negative reactions to the plan.
Many of these had to do with the basic concept of concentrating so many groups in one place. Why should art be set apart from the city, detached in an art zone instead of integrated into the urban fabric? This seemed like a 19th-century view of art. The concept also jeopardized the future of some well-known buildings and the neighborhoods they anchored. The old Met was demolished, and Philharmonic officials hoped that Carnegie Hall would vaporize, too.
Disappointment with the design revolved largely around the idea that the architects had retreated from the prevailing tenets of modernism -- relation of form to function and interior space; expression of structure and materials -- and instead had indulged a preoccupation with style, ornamentation, theatrical effects and historical reference. This, too, betrayed what many considered a 19th-century cast of mind, a throwback to the days when Victorian architects concerned themselves with "the styles."
"Monumental Temporary" was one epithet applied to the result, meaning: such confused intentions could only produce an architectural muddle. This was a reasonable criticism to make according to the standards of the day. In hindsight, however, it seems more likely that the problem lay at least as much with the standards as with the buildings to which they were applied. What seemed then to be an isolated instance of confusion -- a momentary lapse -- turned out to be a crisis in evaluation that has persisted to the present day.
The crisis involved the relationship of form and meaning. Modern architecture initially held strongly democratic, not to say socialist, connotations. Anti-elitist, non-hierarchical, socially as well as aesthetically progressive, it signified, and was intended to foster, solidarity among artists, intellectuals, workers, builders and patrons.
By the 1960's, however, this chain of connotations had broken. So-called Good Design had become a hallmark of elite good taste. The modern office tower was the new emblem of corporate power. And the masses did not universally take to the progressive dispensation initiated on their behalf. Many refused to accept the connection between aesthetic and social reform. Others looked toward buildings precisely as a refuge from the accelerating pace of social and technological change.
Moreover, there was a dawning awareness of the extent to which modern architecture was itself saturated with 19th-century thinking. It was an extension of the historicist idea that each age produced a distinctive style. Modern forms might speak of technology, but this, too, was rapidly becoming a dated concept, a belated reference to the industrial city of the Victorians.
For all these reasons, it was no longer possible for modern architects to maintain control over the public's interpretation of their forms. Nor was it possible to sustain the ideal of a common vocabulary for the era. The era itself was changing. What was to be signified, and by what forms?
Nowhere is the midcentury crisis more evident than in the work of Philip Johnson. In the late 1950's Johnson had yet to establish an identity as a major builder. He was best known for his Glass House in New Canaan, Conn., and the Museum of Modern Art sculpture garden, and as Mies van der Rohe's associate on the Seagram Building.
Because of such projects, people had pegged Johnson as a house architect for the rich and as a tastemaker for those who aspired to live like them. As such, he came to represent the conflict between modernism's egalitarian ideology and its later status as an idiom for the privileged. In the 1930's, as founding director-curator of the design department at the Museum of Modern Art, Johnson became the most energetic and influential promoter of modern architecture in the United States. After the war, he used that influence to establish modernism as the preferred image for the country's enlightened ruling class.
But by the 50's, Johnson had wearied of the Miesian aesthetic. He wrote against what he called the shibboleths and crutches of modern architecture. He argued that references to historical precedent could not be purged. He designed projects with deliberate quotations from classical architects like Ledoux. Given Johnson's tastemaker credentials, these heresies could not be dismissed as the waywardness of a single architect. They signified an erosion of the standards by which architecture had been judged and of the solidarity that had sustained them.
The New York State Theater was one of two New York projects designed by Johnson and completed in 1964. The second was the New York State Pavilion at the New York World's Fair in Flushing Meadows, Queens. (The building's rusting skeleton can still be seen en route to the airport.) Both projects were sponsored by the Rockefeller family, which had supported the modern movement with its unparalleled fusion of social, economic, political and cultural authority. And both departed from modernist norms.
The fair was a watershed event in the redefinition of postwar values. Critically it was a fiasco. Sophisticated people attacked it for lacking a coherent point of view, a governing aesthetic or any larger sense of purpose apart from Robert Moses' desire to create what would later become the world's most hideous park. But if you look at old photos of the fairgrounds, you may well wonder what the carping was about.
No governing aesthetic? In fact, the whole place looks to have been planned down to the last detail just yesterday by a dream team consisting of Rem Koolhaas, Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown. The clash of forms, the automated transportation systems, even the bubbular roofs of the Brass Rail restaurants: this was a preview of "Learning From Las Vegas" crossed with "Delirious New York." In fact, the 1964-65 fair predicted the future with far greater accuracy than the 1939 World of Tomorrow had done.
But in 1964, few could have named the defining quality generated by the fair: irony. This quality was not on conspicuous display in the fair's environment. It was created in the mind of the beholder. Only an ironist would have realized that you didn't have to choose between the austere Spanish pavilion and its kitschy Belgian cousin. Only an ironist could appreciate the installation that Jean Rosenthal designed for Michelangelo's "Pieta" in the Vatican Pavilion. The great marble sculpture looked like a novelty ice cube floating in a Trader Vic's cocktail made with blue curacao. And why not? When else would the "Pieta" get to take a vacation from St. Peter's? Why shouldn't it want to dive into a big blue daiquiri?
The irony didn't come out of nowhere. It was an effect of the cold war, a strategy for coping with the culture of mass consumption on which American prosperity depended. While industry was pumping out the furniture of suburban life -- cars, appliances, situation comedies -- modern architects were trying to keep kitsch at bay. How ironic was that for an aesthetic originally designed to represent the masses?
Perhaps alone among the fair's attractions, the New York State Pavilion captured the ironic stance. A double agent of a building, it carried dual credentials from the realms of high and low art. Technically it was a mature modern building, one that visibly expressed such structural innovations as its perimeter columns of slip-formed concrete. But these were combined with elements of pure Populuxe (to use Thomas Hines's nifty term): the roof of orange and blue plastic (state colors); the flying saucer observation platforms; and the rocket-pod elevators that ascended to them.
The pavilion was a people place. Beneath the garish roof, on a plaza inscribed with a giant map of the state, there were continuous performances by youth orchestras, high school glee clubs and marching bands, pop and jazz combos, and other musical groups of less than stellar profile. The pavilion's exterior was encrusted with works by Lichtenstein, Rosenquist, Warhol.
WARHOL'S "Most Wanted Men" was an American "Pieta." The mural depicted mug shots from a 1962 F.B.I. poster, blown up to the scale of May Day in Red Square. Painted over soon after the fair opened, it was a martyr to puritan sensitivities. The authorities feared lawsuits by families of the wanted, and there were other reasons to feel squeamish. Subliminal homoeroticism; anti-heroism; glorification of the outlaw; recognition that portraiture was alive and well in popular art.
Warhol said Pop Art was about "liking things." This idea marked a turning point in cold war attitudes. Pop Art offered an allegory of redemption. Guilty pleasures were purified. You could like Disneyland without despising yourself. The popularity of the Belgian Pavilion was nothing to be feared. Pop culture just wanted to play with us.
Only an ironist could appreciate that Monumental Temporary was exactly what Lincoln Center wanted to be. If you had put the site on a couch and asked it to tell you its dreams, it would have said: "All my life I have secretly longed to be Monumental Temporary.
"I want glass facades and travertine walls. No diamonds, please. Give me rhinestones. Arches that look paper thin. An opera house with Sputnik chandeliers that rise heavenward at curtain time. A massive grand staircase that goes nowhere. Just a place to pose on yards of red carpet. The biggest bad Chagalls in this poor diva's world.
"And an orchestra hall with movable kite-shaped acoustical panels. We'll call them clouds and put little lights in them. Frame the stage with spindly gold room dividers. And if we don't like it, we can tear it down and start all over again!"
Done!
Wallace K. Harrison, architect of the Metropolitan Opera house, knew all about Monumental Temporary. Another beneficiary of Rockefeller largesse, Harrison had designed the Trylon and Perisphere for the 1939 World's Fair. And his various schemes for the Met, especially those rendered by the incomparable Hugh Ferriss, could have furnished a fair entirely on their own.
The completed building, however, is the most disappointing of Lincoln Center's theaters. The great staircase has Saarinen's fluidity of plastic composition, but the rest of the house is dim. My sense of irony has never sufficed to take in the Chagalls. At the Paris Opera House, Chagall's ceiling had the benefit of contrast. At the Met, the painter's murals set the tone, and it's a bad one. Got gilt?
JOHNSON has described the work of those years as his ballet school period. The term evokes Picasso's neoclassical work in the interwar years -- lightly draped maidens gamboling amid columns on Mediterranean beaches -- and Stravinsky's ballet "Pulcinella," for which Picasso designed the sets. There is, too, a hint of the British cult of the beautiful young man, the Pierrot or puer eternus figure, and of his American devotees, including Pavel Tchelitchew, Paul Cadmus and, not least, Lincoln Kirstein, founder, with George Balanchine, of the New York City Ballet, and Johnson's closest friend.
There is an erotic undercurrent at the State Theater, where the New York City Ballet performs, that you don't find at the other houses. It flows partly from the overt eroticism of the spectacle on stage, and also from the amorous state of anticipation emanating from the other side of the footlights. But it is also in the architecture: the deep red and gold of the auditorium; the tactility of the bronze railings and the quilted pattern stenciled on the balcony fronts; the awesome carnality of the Nadelman sculptures; and the mellow, seductive lighting bounced from the promenade's gold leaf ceiling to the room's creamy marble floor.
Johnson's abiding preoccupation at the time was the idea of procession, the differentiation of spaces through which people pass. This was a departure from the structurally organized spaces of Mies. Procession in architecture is akin to narrative in literature. It describes the passage from an initial state of equilibrium through one or more unbalancing episodes to a heightened state of equipoise. At the State Theater, the narrative unfolds from the outdoor room of the plaza, through the spatial comprehension of the outer and inner lobbies, up the grand travertine staircases and their landings to the promenade: the outdoor plaza's dream of itself.
Auxiliary spaces -- the outdoor loggia, the perimeter balconies -- allow different degrees of distance from the story. Then the performance part of the narrative kicks in: stairs and corridors leading to the auditorium; the membrane of the theater walls; the Baroque organization of the seating; at last, the big gold curtain, brightly lit. The technique is strip-tease. Cultivated citizens are transformed into voyeurs by the progressive shedding of envelopes and wraps.
Beneath the wraps lay the invisible man: Balanchine. The State Theater was designed expressly for him. In the years between its opening and Balanchine's death in 1983, the theater was the brutal city's closest approximation to a temple of art. In the State Theater years, Balanchine was the last heroic figure of modern art -- a bridge from Diaghilev's day to Warhol's. Since no one could predict how long he would go on choreographing, it was urgent to make oneself available to every step his company took.
The 1970's were a good time to drop out of architecture and go to dance. Architecture was being rapidly consumed by a false and corrosive polarity between history and modernity, as if one could exist without the other. It was like oxygen to observe the ease with which Balanchine circulated through time, music, styles and sources, remaining firmly within the tradition of classical ballet while extending it toward the most advanced expressions of theatrical art to be seen on any American stage.
Formal and conceptual analogies to architecture were abundantly evident on Balanchine's stage: cantilevered construction; command of gravity; off-balance compression; music as platform; transitions from private to shared to social space. But what kept me coming back was his relationship to time, starting with the staggering amount of historical integration Balanchine poured into the training of his dancers.
"Agon," choreographed in 1958 to a score by Stravinsky, is the supreme example of this. The Seagram Building was completed the following year, and the ballet's resemblance to it was evident in the absence of sets, costumes and plot; in the positive use of subtraction (Stravinsky's silences, Balanchine's pauses); and in the illusory exposure of bodies that are in fact heavily clothed by classical technique.
The score was loosely inspired by a manual of 17th-century French court dances: sarabandes, galliards and branles. This source material is scarcely discernible in the choreography, though the classical ballet vocabulary was also codified at the French court. The title, "Agon," links the ballet to "Apollo" and "Orpheus," two previous Greek-themed works, story ballets also set to Stravinsky scores.
The plot in "Agon" is abstract: it is the struggle between the music and the choreography and between the two lead dancers. Their duet, a study in the active and passive aggression in romantic pairings, illustrated Balanchine's idea that conflict is fundamental to relationships. Every New Yorker can identify with that idea. We more or less patented it as a form of social conduct.
IT was difficult to leave the State Theater and face a world where architects were arguing over Classicism vs. Modernism. Ballet and architecture are different art forms with different historical traditions, but artists in both fields have faced the same issue: how to look at the relationship between past and present. Balanchine and Stravinsky defined one approach to this relationship. Classicism and Modernism are just names, words, terms for some of the many strands of information that contemporary artists can feed into the future if they have the talent to use them.
Nor was it useful to hear architects debating the relative value of appealing to elite or popular taste, as if it were possible for talented architects to choose one, the other or both. You came away from the State Theater convinced that art finds its own audience (or fails to) when artists say whatever they have to say as well as they can in the course of practice. Regarding the equal devotion Balanchine gave to crowd-pleasing spectacles and more ascetic works, Arlene Croce wrote, "If Balanchine does not discriminate among his poetic resources, why should we?" But perhaps only an artist of Balanchine's gifts can use that degree of freedom.
Architecture, too, is a performing art. Like procession, it unfolds in time as well as space. There is now an opportunity to mount a new $1.5 billion production of an act that has grown stale with age. The pivotal issue confronting the architects is the relationship between Lincoln Center and the city around it.
Forty years ago, the spatial isolation of the complex was a separation from chaos. That meaning has been lost. The cityscape has been substantially drained of its chaotic character. If anything, it is now too orderly, too homogenized, too contextual, too -- suburban. For Lincoln Center to stand out now, it will have to be slightly insane. Not everyone knows how to do this.
And the relationship of forms to meanings has shifted once again. No one seriously equates classicism with popularity, or aesthetic innovation with the elite; not since Bilbao, anyhow. No one goes to cities in search of suburban values. People expect to be wowed. They know that cities have an obligation to produce culture, not just to consume it, and that architecture, our most public art even in the TV age, is the most powerful form in which that obligation can be renewed.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 28, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about a planned overhaul of Lincoln Center referred incorrectly to the surviving members of the group of architects most responsible for the center's original design. Philip Johnson is not the only one; Max Abramovitz also holds the distinction. The article also referred incorrectly to the age of Mr. Johnson, who was born in 1906; he was not the youngest member of the group; that was Eero Saarinen, born in 1910.

HEADLINE: Words on Music, 25 Million of Them 

BYLINE:  By JAMES R. OESTREICH 

 BODY:
FEW writers about music would argue with Charles Rosen, himself one of the best, introducing his recent collection of essays, "Critical Entertainments: Music Old and New": "Of all the arts that have developed something like a complex expressive language, music is one of the most difficult to write about."
 The second edition of The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, to be published by Grove's Dictionaries on Jan. 30, must therefore stand in its sheer bulk as a monument to the indomitable human spirit. The facts and figures are astounding: 29,500 articles, 6,000 contributors, 25 million words. For the print version, 29 volumes, 119 pounds, 5,000 illustrations, a purchase price of $4,850. And a complete version online, to be updated regularly. 
 None of which might matter much without the expectation of quality raised by Grove dictionaries over more than a century, since George Grove first published his Dictionary of Music and Musicians in installments from 1878 to 1890, and in particular by The New Grove, edited by Stanley Sadie in 1980. At a mere 20 volumes, up 10 from the fifth and last edition of the old Grove (Eric Blom's in 1954), and thoroughly infused with modern scholarship, The New Grove was already overwhelming in its size and scope. 
Among the many practical obstacles it posed, it seemed a sure bet that no one would be able to review the thing with any meaningful breadth. No one, that is, until Mr. Rosen soared over the landscape in The New York Review of Books. "In its new professional form, The New Grove is the greatest musical dictionary ever published," Mr. Rosen wrote in his brilliant review, reprinted in "Critical Entertainments."
(First Grove's and now New Grove's closest competitor in terms of scale and authority has been the German Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart -- Music in Past and Present. Edited by Friedrich Blume, it appeared in 14 volumes from 1949 to 1968. Ludwig Finscher is now overseeing a second edition, which began in 1994 and is intended to encompass 21 volumes by its completion in 2004.)
Alas, Mr. Rosen's praise came after a withering survey of The New Grove's defects, which were said to include a lack of historical perspective and an isolation from nonmusical culture. Indeed, Mr. Rosen may have played a greater role in setting the agenda for the second edition than anyone but Mr. Sadie and John Tyrrell, the officially titled editors.
"There is not so much in the way of new facts," Mr. Sadie said at a recent reception unveiling the second edition at Carnegie Hall. "But ways of looking at music have changed. The New Grove has to be abreast of its time. It has to reflect changes in the social, political and intellectual atmosphere."
For one thing, the new edition has added a specific entry on "music," Mr. Sadie noted sheepishly, though without acknowledging that Mr. Rosen had cited the lack of one as a fundamental flaw in the enterprise. For music, despite the saw about its being an international language, is many things to many people, places and times. "Dr. Stanley Sadie's point, made in a letter, that they could find no one person who could have written on 'music' and the changing significance of the term through the ages," Mr. Rosen writes in a new introduction to his review, "was disingenuous."
The new edition, in any case, did enlist one person, Bruno Nettl, an eminent Czech-born American ethnomusicologist, for the task. "It was the first article to reach us, five years ago," Mr. Sadie said last fall over lunch at a restaurant near the Grove offices and Victoria Station in London.
Mr. Nettl's entry confirms both the need for a discussion of the subject and the difficulty of supplying one: "Presenting the word 'music' as an entry in a dictionary of music may imply either an authoritative definition or a properly comprehensive treatment of the concept of music, at all times, in all places and in all senses. That last would require discussion from many vantage points, including the linguistic, biological, psychological, philosophical, historical, anthropological, theological and even legal and medical, along with the musical in the widest sense. Imposing a single definition flies in the face of the broadly relativistic, intercultural and historically conscious nature of this dictionary." Accordingly, he goes on to fill a dozen pages.
Other bragging points of Grove's newfound historical and social consciousness are articles on nationalism, by Richard Taruskin; Nazism, by Pamela M. Potter; and feminism, by Ruth A. Solie. The hefty entry on musicology, the work of many hands, makes room for the latest trends, describing and seeming to sanction what some have called "new musicology" without using the term: "More and more musicologists are crossing borders and reconsidering the boundaries of their research, not only that which has separated classical and popular music, written and oral traditions, but also historical musicology from other disciplines including ethnomusicology and music theory."
Still, Mr. Sadie was exaggerating when he discounted the importance of new facts. Much has emerged since 1980, in part because of the spur given to certain areas of research by The New Grove itself, and a new edition was needed. A major selling point of The New Grove in 1980 was that the previous edition was a quarter-century old and thus, in fast-changing times, necessarily out of date. Now, in faster-changing times, The New Grove is 20 years old and more, for it was years in preparation without benefit of the advanced computerized printing processes available today.
Not that the Grove publishers were idle in the meantime. They produced a variety of updated and expanded spinoffs: a series of individual or collected composer biographies, a four-volume dictionary of American music, a three-volume dictionary of musical instruments, a four-volume dictionary of opera, a three-volume dictionary of jazz, The Norton/Grove Dictionary of Women Composers, and Norton/Grove handbooks on performance practice and other subjects. (Not to mention the 34-volume Grove's Dictionary of Art, which is another story.)
The frontal assault on The New Grove began in 1993, with the commissioning of articles. Some of the specialized material from the spinoffs was to be incorporated, though not generally in the same form. New article topics were assigned. The old entries were examined carefully and divided into three categories.
Category A articles were sent back to the original contributors for whatever minor alterations were deemed necessary. Some turned into major revisions.
"A lot of the articles grew," said Laura Macy, the publishing director. "Very few of them shrank." Ms. Macy joined Grove in 1997, in time to field many of those commissioned articles, and she becomes the overall editor, responsible for online revisions, now that Mr. Sadie (who has been recovering from dire injuries suffered in an automobile accident in Russia) and Mr. Tyrrell have retreated to advisory capacities.
Category B articles were sent back to the contributors for specified major revisions. Category C articles were basically rewritten or, more often, replaced with new articles by different contributors.
"We assigned the length, which I think people about universally disregarded," Ms. Macy said plaintively, beginning to sound like a stuck record.
Some entries were jettisoned for obvious reasons, like the Schubert and Verdi articles, roundly criticized by Mr. Rosen. David Brown's Tchaikovsky entry, which put a seal of authority on a briefly fashionable notion of the composer's death ("that he committed suicide cannot be doubted"), has given way to a new article by Roland John Wiley.
"Rumor attached to the famous dies hard," Mr. Wiley writes, "Paganini's pact with the devil, Salieri's poison." He flatly concludes, "We do not know how Tchaikovsky died."
Other articles were quietly reassigned for no obvious reason. Mr. Sadie did not want to be the one to revise his own admired Mozart entry. "Attitudes have changed," he said. "It's good to give another point of view." So he first approached Neal Zaslaw, who was too busy revising the Kochel catalog of Mozart's works, then turned to Cliff Eisen.
Coverage of world and popular music was broadened. And the treatment of Eastern Europe, where reliable information has become much more readily available since the fall of Communist regimes, was revised and expanded.
The new edition, originally projected at 23 volumes, grew incrementally to 29, with Volume 28 consisting of appendixes and Volume 29 being an index, the first in a separate volume since 1890. And all of this was scheduled to come together by last November: Nov. 22, to be exact, the feast of St. Cecilia, the patron saint of music.
The company executives cannot have been entirely sorry to see that fateful date come and go as the occasion for the American unveiling. For at the lavish presentation of The New Grove at the Waldorf-Astoria on the same date in 1980, Leonard Bernstein, invited to perform, unburdened himself of a maundering jeremiad, unforgettably reminding the festive crowd that Nov. 22 was also the anniversary of the assassination of John F. Kennedy and thus no time to celebrate.
Still, the publishers made a concerted effort to finish the project on schedule. In fact, Grove contributors started complaining a year or so ago that the publishers seemed more concerned about the November deadline than about accuracy or clarity of prose; that the editing was slapdash, last-minute and inconsistent; that editors constantly changed at the Grove offices, and the writers were often not sure whom to contact.
Grove representatives, in a typically self-congratulatory appearance at a gathering of American music critics last spring, responded intemperately to a query along those lines, accusing the complaining writers (Grove contributors, be it remembered) of intellectual arrogance. (Or was that charge meant to refer, as it seemed, to this humble questioner?)
The problem, the representatives suggested, was that some of the very writers howling loudest submitted their articles unforgivably late and, yes, long. But at least a few apologies were issued to aggrieved writers from the Grove offices.
"There were legitimate complaints," Ms. Macy said. "Sometimes the editing was too heavy-handed, usually when the copy was way over length. The editors were working within limits. We've been pretty good about setting things straight."
My first perusal of a complete article, the greatly expanded one on Bernstein, was not entirely encouraging, turning up one error -- "Thomson" (Virgil) for Thompson (Randall) -- and two sentences that scanned badly. At the same time, it must be admitted that the project is hopelessly unwieldy: if not yet un reviewable, certainly very nearly un editable. The scholars (Mr. Sadie included) were not entirely happy with even the extended deadline and never would be, for they could never nail down every detail to their ultimate satisfaction. The business managers, on the other hand, had to face the hard economic realities of this $33 million project and bring it to completion.
WHAT'S more, a remedy is at hand in the quickly correctable, expandable online version ($295 a year to individual subscribers). The promise of this new venture, which also offers convenient search capabilities, seems vast if not limitless. Already, areas of coverage are scheduled to be updated on a rotating basis.
Yet here lies another dilemma. For as laudable as it is to make any new or more accurate information available as soon as possible, doing so immediately diminishes the value of the print version in ways unknowable to the owner. Much the same happened with the first edition, rather haphazardly, when those enhanced spinoffs started appearing. But there, at least, owners of the complete dictionary were alerted to areas that might have been revised, and the truly brave could attempt line-by-line comparisons to find out what, specifically, had been changed.
Now anything could be changed at any time, leaving owners of the books none the wiser, in more ways than one. Obsolescence will accrue systematically. The heaviest investors in the new edition, the purchasers of the print version, could well be those most poorly served in the end.
Has the very notion of a print version become obsolete? Some within the publishing house seem to think so, and wonder whether another print edition of The New Grove will ever appear. Mr. Sadie, who has become the rear guard, is not among them.
"I'm not certain that the online version will answer all needs," he said. "Strolling isn't the same as driving. I hope that most people who use Grove want more than bits, that they want to read it."
Indeed, it has been a hallmark of Grove dictionaries over the decades that they make for good strolling, offering quaint, charming and unexpected byways. Grove himself, a civil engineer, was more enthusiast than scholar when it came to music. The early editions were valued as much for their literary qualities as for their sometimes soft scholarship and their often quirky aesthetic judgments.
THE scholarship became considerably more rigorous (and substantially more American) in The New Grove. Still, there were gratifying vagaries. Soon after that edition appeared, it was discovered that a noted contributor, the Scandinavian specialist Robert Layton, had slipped a phony entry past the editors: a description of the life and works of Dag Henrik Esrum-Hellerup, a fictitious Danish flutist, conductor and composer. Less well known is a shorter entry on Guglielmo Baldini, an Italian composer invented long ago by the great German musicologist Hugo Riemann.
The new edition duly expunges these intruders. What's more, it tries to smother their traces in scholarship, discussing them in a new entry on spoof articles by David Fallows.
"Spoof articles are deceptively easy to do," Mr. Fallows writes. "Many articles in Grove and elsewhere are based entirely on unpublished material, and many cite only rare local publications: the item on Baldini was reported as being in the 'Archiv fur Freiburger Diozesan geschichte,' which would (even if it exists) be hard to verify in London and hard to check at all without inquiries to libraries in both places called Freiburg (alongside, for safety, Fribourg) -- plainly not tasks for which subeditors are employed unless they have reason to distrust the author." So irreverent readers may hope for more fictitious delights in the new edition.
Mr. Fallows himself was responsible for one of the loveliest and subtlest touches in the 1980 Grove, which survives in the new edition. In Mr. Fallows's entry for the 15th-century Franco-Flemish composer Gilles de Bins Dit Binchois, that full name is spelled out in the initial letters of succeeding paragraphs in a bit of Renaissance-style sportiveness. But here is a prime example of something that can be taken in easily -- perhaps even discovered by the unsuspecting, though less easily -- in the print version, with the pages spread, but must be ferreted out online, in the fragmented section-by-section scroll, where only parts of paragraphs can be seen at a time.
In 1980, that entry appeared in Volume 4, which was charmingly identified on the spine by its beginning and end points, "Back to Bolivia." Now as then, the overall span runs from A to Zywny (Wojciech, a 19th-century Polish piano teacher and composer of Bohemian origin), and the other snippets on the spines are less poetic. Not that such things are ignored amid the press of more urgent matters.
"It looked for a time like Manilow would make the spine," Ms. Macy said, "but we fixed that." Some people get no respect.
Another part of Grove culture, shared with other British music publications, is an inordinate fondness for all things English. It receded somewhat in 1980 and continues to do so.
"There is probably still a slight English bias," said Ms. Macy, who was born in Evanston, Ill., studied at the University of California at Santa Barbara and the University of North Carolina, and taught at Pennsylvania State University. "It's not that we've shrunk English coverage, but we've expanded everything else."
Grove died in 1900, four years before the second edition of his dictionary would start to appear, edited by J. A. Fuller Maitland and expanded from four volumes (and a thin index volume) to five. Surely he could not have imagined the scale of the present enterprise. But just as surely, as both editor and writer, he would have understood why this grandest of tributes was fated to arrive just after the 100th anniversary of his death. He is undoubtedly still muttering about writers who submit their pieces late -- and long.

HEADLINE: Viewing Craftsmanship, With Fine Arts as a Backdrop 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM ZIMMER 

 BODY:
THE crafts world and the fine arts world have a tango-like relationship. They come together in certain respects, yet they insist on maintaining their individual values and personalities. These days the closeness is emphasized. Much is written and said about the blurring of the lines between fine art and crafts -- but much of that commentary is itself blurry.
 For 20 years, Jack Russell has been the director of Brookfield Craft Center, which he estimates is one of only 12 to 15 places in the United States unaffiliated with an academic institution that teaches a full spectrum of crafts at a professional level. 
 In an interview, Mr. Russell, who used to be a rock and roll drummer and later a sculptor, proved to be an ardent advocate of the values that crafts hold.
Q. What is the essential difference between craft and fine arts?
A. There are two essential ones. First, in craft there is a reverence and respect for the materials themselves, for the actual substances bring used. And secondly there is reverence for the processes and techniques identified with a particular craft -- the way things are put together. These are attractive differences and have brought a lot of fine arts people over to crafts. I know I was always upset about with the lack of craftsmanship in the fine arts. My touchstone is that if an object shows respect for both the reality and the spirituality of the material and the process involved in making it, it's craft.
Q. But is there an obscuring of the differences now? Are painting and sculpture heeding the lesson about the importance of materials and technique?
A. Both the term fine arts and crafts are moving targets; there are no hard-and-fast differences. I'm sure Michelangelo and Leonardo, two of the greatest artists, would have considered themselves craftsmen. Maybe the relationship should be thought of as a pyramid. At the bottom there is a lot of bad crafts and a lot of bad painting and sculpture; at the top there really is no difference.
Q. It's sometimes said of crafts that they're boring, that all vessels look basically alike. But then couldn't it be said that all paintings look basically alike, too?
A. A vessel has an exterior shape and an interior space. Other than that it can be anything. But some of the major differences between craft and fine art issues are more complex and don't all have to do with the items themselves. Rather they have to do with the market aspects of crafts. Essentially there are real, usable teapots and there are virtual teapots.
Q. But you didn't always have "edgy" teapots, did you?
A. Since I have been at Brookfield there have been what I would call undulations in the crafts world. But right after World War II the big revolution, evolution or renaissance occurred. A lot of skilled craftspeople had come over from Europe and returning G.I.'s wanted to learn a trade. Universities began to offer woodworking and ceramics courses, courses that used to be offered only by trade schools. The boomer generation changed things again: in the 1960's the "art" component entered crafts 
But getting back to economics, the actual teapot and the virtual teapot are made for different markets. The marketplace is central to the crafts world in a way that it isn't in the fine arts. Crafts objects are sold wholesale most of the time, to places like Brookfield Craft Center. This last holiday season a woman bought $1,100 worth of hand-blown ornaments to give as presents; it was a great idea because every such ornament isn't alike. The upshot of this merchandising aspect is that craftspeople are probably more savvy about business than arts people, and have a better idea of cost.
Q. Does this mean that the craft world is more tightly knit than the art world?
A. Yes, craftspeople share stories, information. There's an active grapevine. This is possible in part because the craft world has gone completely mainstream. You look at the pages of popular catalogs and it's hard to tell the difference between a teapot made by an individual artist and one that is mass-produced in some third-world country.
All of these marketing factors mean that craftspeople collaborate far more than artists do. It's rare to hear of artists collaborating. We're bound by the marketplace. 
Q. For all their visibility, crafts have less cachet than fine arts. What do you think might be the most helpful in moving the crafts world higher in public perception? 
A. There are several important craft magazines that cover both the aesthetic and business sides. But there's no crafts criticism. Perhaps we don't need it. Perhaps the object itself is its best critique. But there are areas to be worked on. A major one is that major museums display the work of dead craftspeople, but won't show work by living ones. That perception has to be changed.

HEADLINE: DINING OUT; 
A Steakhouse With an Italian Sideline

BYLINE:  By JOANNE STARKEY; E-mail: lidining@nytimes.com

 BODY:
PACE'S seems to have all the bases covered. The Hauppauge standby is a steakhouse at a time when big-beef emporiums are leading the popularity parade. It also tosses a bone to its Italian roots (it originally opened as an Italian restaurant) by offering a roster of pastas and an occasional Italian special. This inclusion is an insurance policy on an island where Italian is the favorite ethnic cuisine.
 But Pace's need not hedge its bets. Its steaks can make it on their own. The pastas were less impressive. We tried two of them, with mixed results. A platter of penne tossed with shrimp in a sun-dried tomato-basil cream sauce was worthy of any top-notch Italian spot. But linguine with white clam sauce was not. The tasteless mound of noodles harbored chunks of chewy clams. Chewy is also the adjective for some of the players in the Italian seafood salad, a special one evening. 
 Pace's decor says vintage steakhouse rather than Sorrento. The mood is set by nostalgic black and white photographs of old New York, sports' heros and scenes from classic films. There is a warren of small dining rooms here. Those at the restaurant's bustling center are not as appealing as the tucked-away spots: the cozy library or the barroom with its corner fireplace.
Steak is the way to go and for those who really love it, the porterhouse for one, a frequent special of 32 ounces of meat for $29.95, is the dish to order. The porterhouse for two, on the menu ($25.95 per person), is not twice as large and, on the night we tried it, didn't have the beefy flavor of the single. The velvety double filet mignon ($26.95) and the nicely crusted marinated shell steak ($22.95) were other pleasers. While these prices are not low, they run $5 to $10 less than comparable cuts at North Shore spots.
Pace's prices also include a salad, though it is not noteworthy. It is dominated by iceberg lettuce and includes tasteless California black olives. (Pace's Italian ancestors would shake their fists at this.) The salad dressings also miss the mark. The house vinaigrette is much like straight balsamic vinegar and the blue cheese dressing has no taste at all, unless one is lucky enough to encounter one of the rare chunks of cheese.
We loved the a la carte confetti salad ($8.50) of chopped green beans, shrimp, tomatoes, onions and bacon but found the Caesar ($6.75) overly acidic and out of balance.
For those not going the beef route, roast chicken with a blistered, crackly skin and expertly cooked salmon in a tangy dijonaise sauce are good choices.
Do not miss the steak fries. These medium-cut beauties have a splendid crust, soft interior and assertive seasoning. The crispy onions, creamed spinach and chunky, onion-flecked home fries also got thumbs up.
There is nothing wrong with the shrimp cocktail except the price. Some diners will gag at paying $11.95 for three (albeit jumbo) shrimp. This is especially noticeable at a restaurant that only charges $19.95 for a rack of lamb. A more economical opener is the seafood bisque ($5.50) blessed with nubbins of shrimp.
Two other recommended, though pricey, appetizers are the crab-meat cocktail and the plump roasted oysters (both specials). But say no to the run-of-the-mill, bready baked clams.
All of the desserts (except the imported-from-Italy sorbets served in fruit shells) are homemade. The so-called cobblers (blueberry or apple) are really crisps and are nothing special. The cheesecake is appropriately creamy, the chocolate mousse cake rich and the bread pudding moist and booze-laced.
The numerous servers at Pace's are speedy and attentive. If one's waiter is not at hand, any passing busboy or other staff member will take the check or fill a request for a drink reorder. They exhibit a friendly, can-do attitude that helps make Pace's a mid-Island favorite.

HEADLINE: The Twists And Turns Of Pedaling To the Job 

BYLINE:  By MELINDA TUHUS 

 BODY:
THERE'S an old song that goes, "Dead skunk in the middle of the road and it's stinking to high heaven." If you are commuting to work on a bicycle, that sentiment would be putting it mildly. 
 I commute to New Haven on my bike and not long ago on my way back to my Hamden home I saw ahead of me -- upwind -- a beautiful skunk lying in the middle of the road. I was riding right past him, a few feet away, when I got my first whiff, which indicated he was very recently departed. The stench made breathing impossible and almost toppled me from my bike. Because I was cycling uphill at that point, it took some time to pass it. There was no escape -- no windows to roll up, no air recirculation button to push. 
 That's the price I pay to smell the roses -- and the lilacs, and the newly mown grass -- as I bike around greater New Haven. I think of my bike as a two-wheeled convertible in low gear with the top permanently down. I hear the birds serenading each other in the spring and hear the squirrels skitter through the leaves in the fall. 
My cycling goal is to ride every day, which includes a 4.5-mile commute from Hamden to work in downtown New Haven, as well as longer recreational rides on weekends.
Some years -- graced by mild, snowless winters -- I have come pretty close to meeting my goal.
But the brakes fail in wet weather on my 25-year-old, naturally rusted, three-speed, no-name bicycle -- otherwise perfect for commuting -- on which I've logged more than 25,000 miles in the dozen years I've lived in Connecticut. So if it's raining when I'm starting out, I usually don't bike. If I'm out and it starts raining, I slow down and hope for the best.
Last fall, I was riding through East Rock Park. I love the sweep of trees, the narrow stretch of sky visible overhead, the families of turkeys I often see walking around. It was drizzling, and, as I took a sharp right turn out of the park, my bike slid out from under me. I used my hand to brace my fall -- 10 feet from a pick-up truck in the intersection. A few minutes later, I was at work with an ice pack on my pulsating palm. 
There have been a few other mishaps and near-mishaps over the years, none requiring serious medical care, but all making my heart beat faster.
None of these scrapes has reduced my enthusiasm for the freedom, the convenience, the exercise, the economy and the environmental awareness of bicycle commuting. 
I worked in New Haven City Hall for five years, and the amount of work time folks there spent feeding meters or moving their cars around to available parking spaces could have bought me a top-of-the-line bike every month.
Each day I bike, I save money on gas, parking, and depreciation on our car (yes, my family owns one), or bus fare. I also save a lot of money and time not belonging to a gym. I'm not a slave to bus schedules, car-sharing, or traffic jams. I'm making zero contribution to air pollution or global warming. I ride door to door, locking my bike in a bike rack or to a pole.
And motorized commuters think I'm the one making the sacrifice.

HEADLINE: Small Airports Are Getting Bigger; 
As Flying Grows, Plans for New Runways, New Terminals, New Hangars

BYLINE:  By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
WHILE Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks grabs the attention of most air travelers in the state, a growing number of business executives, big-name entertainers, private pilots and others are boosting traffic at the state's five smaller airports as well.
 The state's general aviation airports -- Oxford, Hartford-Brainard, Groton-New London, Windham and Danielson -- have seen about 15 percent more use in the last three years and are projecting that growth rate to continue. The airports are completing or planning more than $10 million in improvement projects, including privately funded investments to increase hangar space or improve safety. 
 "A lot of it is just the good economy in Connecticut," said Kenneth J. Robert, the aviation administrator for the State Department of Transportation. "Pleasure flying has always been something that people do with discretionary income, so when you have a good economy you tend to have more activity at the state airports." If the economy continues to slow, so will aviation. 
Richard Polidori, president of Lanmar Aviation, which is building a helicopter hangar and maintenance operation at Groton-New London Airport, said a good economy means Connecticut corporations and residents are more willing to spend money on private aviation because they're not tied to an airline schedule or risk missing a connection.
"There's a lot of frustration with air travel -- people who have money can't get where they want to get," Mr. Polidori said. "If I called a counter today and wanted to get to Fort Lauderdale tomorrow, I probably couldn't get a ticket, and if I could it would be on a shuttle with no first class. That's not what wealthy people want to hear."
For corporations, a missed connection could mean that a group of executives traveling to a meeting in a distant city miss an entire day of work, which affects productivity; flying the same route in a corporate jet eliminates that hazard.
Another big boost for aviation was a change in the tax law governing aircraft in the mid-1990's. Previously, they were assessed as personal property, and there were numerous instances of Connecticut residents parking their planes in New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island to avoid the tax. Then the state shifted to a registration fee that does not exceed $2,500 for general aviation planes, which meant the cost of keeping an aircraft in Connecticut was reduced to a fraction of its previous amount. A plane that was assessed at $1 million, for example, would have had a tax bill of about $31,500 under the old system.
"Until 1994 it didn't make economic sense to keep an aircraft in Connecticut because all the surrounding states had aircraft registration programs," Mr. Robert said. "Changing the law made us much more competitive."
Kenneth W. Milano, manager of Hartford-Brainard Airport, where aircraft takeoffs and landings have increased from 112,567 in 1997 to 130,000 in 1999, said three new hangars are planned, which will accommodate as many as 58 aircraft. Mr. Milano said a study of the impact of Brainard found that the economic impact of the airport, from the salaries paid to its employees to the cost of fuel and supplies to run the planes, totals about $37 million a year.
"That just looked at Brainard, but the same kinds of things apply to all the general aviation airports in the state," Mr. Milano said. The airport is also used for many tasks that would be much more difficult for flights going in and out of Bradley, such as hospitals flying organs in and out for transplants or National Guard landings in the event of a natural disaster.
"General aviation is a vital cog in the state's transportation system, and a lot of people don't understand that," Mr. Milano said. But increasingly, that fact is recognized by government officials.
"Every bit of economic development promotion that we do, we mention we have the second largest airport in the state right here," said Oxford First Selectman Paul T. Schreiber. "We see it as a great marketing tool for our industrial park and for the entire town."
There are 103 licensed airports in the state, ranging in size from grass landing fields on farms and landing pads for medical helicopters at hospitals, to Bradley, the star of the state's aviation community.
Bradley had a 20.3 percent increase in passenger traffic in September, its 30th consecutive month of growth. Most months this year, its passenger numbers have been up 20 percent or more from the previous year, and it is expected to move more than 7.6 million passengers when the final numbers are in, up from 6.3 million.
According to Airports Council International, a trade group, Bradley's 20 percent annual growth made it the fastest-growing airport in the United States of its size.
The state is also considering proposals to put Bradley under a quasi-private management organization that supporters said would be better able to market and develop the airport. Before the current $200 million renovation and expansion got under way, the last time the state made any significant investment at Bradley had been 1982.
There are also four airports operated by municipalities: Tweed-New Haven, Sikorsky-Bridgeport, Meriden-Markham, and Danbury airports. Bridgeport and New Haven are both considering ways to increase use of their airports.
Paul D. Estafan, manager of Danbury Airport, said general aviation airports take pressure off Bradley for small plane operations and provide convenience for private aircraft because they are geographically scattered around the state.
"Bigger does not necessarily mean better," Mr. Estafan said. "I wouldn't want to see Danbury any bigger than it is right now. It serves the needs of people in this area, and that's what it has to do."
He said Danbury has 120,000 to 130,000 takeoffs and landings each year and has been at that level the last two or three years. In the late 1970's, it was handling 196,000 takeoffs and landings per year, but that dropped to as little as 110,000 in the 1980's and early 1990's, before starting to climb back up. "The first industry into a recession is aviation, and the last one out is usually aviation," Mr. Estafan said. But that downtown means that Danbury can accommodate growth in the future without major changes.
"We do have the capacity to grow," Mr. Estafan said. "Nothing has changed since the 1990's -- it's the same runway, the same taxiway and buildings, so if we could handle it back then, we could handle it again."
The state spends more than $1.8 million a year operating its general aviation airports, not counting the cost of renovations and expansions that are heavily funded by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
The operating budgets of the general aviation airports, including salaries, range from $71,457 at Danielson Airport to $784,654 at Groton-New London, the only general aviation airport that also has commercial airline service.
"I don't think what Bradley is doing is going to have much of an impact on us, because we're serving a different need," said Catherine L. Young, the manager of Groton-New London. "What we see down here is more the corporate traffic and tourist traffic."
Groton-New London is just finishing a $4 million project that includes new runway lights, reconstruction of the main runway and renovation of the terminal. Reconstruction of a secondary runway next year will complete the project, but the airport is also planning a $600,000 safety study that could lead to more improvements.
"We're only at about 50 percent of capacity now, so there's a lot of potential even before the new construction," Ms. Young said. The pharmaceutical company Pfizer, which is headquartered in New York but operates a research and manufacturing operation in Groton, bases its helicopters at Groton-New London. Electric Boat, which builds submarines in Groton, not only operates its corporate jet out of the airport, but also has a shuttle service there to connect it to its shipbuilding partner, Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia. And Lanmar Aviation is building a $1.5 million helicopter maintenance and storage business there.
"There's only a couple of airports in the state that can accommodate us, and Groton was the best choice," said Mr. Polidori, president of Lanmar. 
Last year, the airport had about 80,000 takeoffs and landings, up about 10 percent from the previous year. 
Electric Boat operates three aircraft out of Groton-New London: a Citation for executive trips and two chartered Beech 1900D shuttles that run between Groton and Newport News, Va.
Neil D. Ruenzel, a spokesman for Electric Boat, said soon after the company began a collaboration with Newport News Shipbuilding in the 1990;s, it realized it could save money over commercial air fares if it had enough people making the trip to fill a small charter plane. Even more important, he said, the charters yield significant savings in employee time and the cost of hotels and restaurants.
"To get down there for a meeting at 7 o'clock in the morning, you have to go down the night before, and if it's going to be an all-day meeting you're probably going to have to stay a second night," Mr. Ruenzel said. "With the charter shuttle, you're down and back the same day."
Oxford Airport, with an operating budget of $370,160, less than half the level of Groton-New London, has seen some of the fastest growth. The number of corporate aircraft based there has increased from 160 in 1996 to 215 now, and almost 20 of those are jets. New runway extensions, a sewer project, and hangars are increasing its capacity. Later this year, it will complete work on an air traffic control tower that will be staffed by federal controllers.
"That will not only provide an extra set of eyes from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., it means if you want clearance through to another airport you can make your arrangements directly, rather than waiting until you're in the air and making the arrangements through New York," said Michael J. O'Donnell, the airport manager.
Of course, residents are often not happy when an airport expands (there have been complaints about Oxford), but airports try to accommodate their neighbors by limiting flights at night and retaining buffer areas between the airport and homes.
Mr. Robert, the state administrator for airports, said Oxford had become popular with business people from New York and New Jersey who make their home in western Connecticut.
"There's a lot of corporate executives who live in the area down there who want the convenience of being able to step out of their door and get into their aircraft, rather than have to go down to New York," Mr. Robert said.
Mr. Milano said convenience is also the reason singers performing at the Hartford Civic Center, or insurance executives traveling out of the downtown, are increasingly using Brainard Airport.
"If you have business to conduct in Hartford and you have a charter aircraft that you can land on our runways, a short cab ride and you're right in the heart of the downtown," Mr. Milano said. "With general aviation, you can drive right up to the terminal you want and get right into your aircraft."
Even the state's two smallest airports are seeing growth. Windham Airport is just finishing a $1 million taxiway, and Danielson Airport just spent $2 million repaving its taxiways.
Gary Boroughf, the manager at Danielson Airport, said the number of takeoffs and landings there had increased to about 21,000 a year, up about 20 percent since he took over Northeast Air Management, which manages the airport, in 1994. In the last few years Danielson has had its lighting, signs, runways and taxiways improved to international standards for general aviation.
"Recreational flying is where we've seen all our growth," Mr. Boroughf said. A two-seater aircraft in good condition can be purchased for about $13,000 and insured for perhaps $600 a year, he said.
And as more people discover flying is affordable, they are also discovering that Connecticut is a good state in which to take up the hobby, said Mr. Robert of the the State Department of Transportation.
"Connecticut's general aviation airports already have the reputation of being a lot better maintained than state airports in general," he said. "And with the projects that we have under way, that reputation is going to grow."

HEADLINE: L.I. @ WORK; 
For OSI and Aeroflex, 2000 Was a Banner Year

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
JUST before New Year's, Bloomberg Business News named the 10 publicly traded companies in the United States whose stock had increased the most in value in 2000. The list included two Nassau County companies: OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Aeroflex Inc. OSI's stock had soared ninefold, Aeroflex's nearly sixfold.
 Aside from their stocks' performance, they could not be more different. OSI is a fast-rising biotech company that has recently edged into profitability while squirreling away cash reserves. Aeroflex, an erstwhile defense contractor, has over the last several years reinvented itself as a fiber-optic niche manufacturer. 
 The success of both high-flying small caps epitomizes the region's "new economy" strengths and maybe some of its weaknesses as well.
OSI, based in Uniondale, has become the first local company to play in biotech's major leagues. Earlier this month, Dr. Colin Goddard, its chairman and chief executive, announced that OSI had signed development deals with two major pharmaceutical companies, Genentech and Roche. The deals, which one analyst called a blockbuster, put OSI in a position to dominate the emerging $1 billion cancer drug market, largely on the strength of successful trials of its drug known as OSI-774.
This past fiscal year, which ended in September, OSI finished in the red again, reporting a net loss of $16.3 million. Revenues increased 26 percent, to $28.7 million, and Dr. Goddard, a British-born pharmacologist, again managed to improve the company's cash reserves. 
That strategy impressed analysts like Joel Sendek, Lazard Freres' biotech analyst, because it provides something of a cushion from short-term pressures.
"The first year we have them profitable is 2004," Mr. Sendek said. "In biotech, one investment strategy is to buy well in advance of profitability and then wait. By the time you get the drug to market, you oftentimes have a monopoly position."
But 2004 is a long way off in today's equity market. In the first weeks of this year, despite Dr. Goddard's announcement, the stock tumbled to the mid-60's on Nasdaq. Earlier in the year it had risen 909 percent, from just below $8 to $80. 
"Yes, that was a blockbuster deal, but it was one that was widely anticipated," Mr. Sendek said. "It did not come as a surprise."
Aeroflex, too, is looking forward, although its time frame is far more short-term.
Until about five years ago Aeroflex was known primarily as a vendor to Boeing and other defense contractors, but since then it has set out on a conversion strategy that has clearly paid off. The company now designs and manufactures a range of microelectronic products and instruments for the fiber-optic and wireless communications markets. Its niche is the highest-speed broadband networks, and today, two-thirds of its sales come from the communications sector.
"We are one of the few companies on Long Island to make this conversion successfully," said Michael Gorin, Aeroflex's president since 1988. The company has built up a strong middle management and sales force, primarily by holding on to executives from companies it acquired during the last decade. The company showed a 595 percent rise in its stock price during the last calendar year, from just above $4 to nearly $29.
In terms of origins, Aeroflex and OSI are again disparate. In the early 90's, OSI was one of several local biotech companies to be spun off of research projects conducted at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Aeroflex, on the other hand, was formed almost 60 years ago by a Russian immigrant, George Margolin, who, according to legend, worked on the Spirit of St. Louis before Charles Lindbergh climbed into the cockpit. Mr. Margolin manufactured a variety of mechanical products, including aerator motors for hobbyists' aquariums.
"I really don't know much about the company's early years," Mr. Gorin said with a shrug. His real interest lies in what Aeroflex will be doing tomorrow. "Our future is an exciting story," he said. Investors seem to agree. 
Unlike most Long Island executives, who have ascended the ranks with lots of hand-on operational experience, Mr. Gorin came to his position after an early career in financial consulting with Arthur Andersen, followed by a stint with Republic Bank. Last March, he caught Wall Street by surprise when he moved Aeroflex from the New York Stock Exchange to Nasdaq.
In six decades nobody had made that switch, he said, but for Aeroflex, the move made sense. "Trading on the New York Stock Exchange, we were just a very small-cap company, and we were getting lost," he said. "I expected that amidst our peers on Nasdaq, companies like Nortel, Lucent and Cisco, we would be noticed. We have been performing, and we have been noticed."
Last week, Aeroflex's market valuation exceeded $1.5 billion on net income of $185.9 million.
As recently as the mid-90's, Aeroflex was still dependent on military sales; today those sales are dwarfed by the volume of business Aeroflex does with companies like Lucent that are building a global telecommunications infrastructure. 
On a recent afternoon at Aeroflex's headquarters in Plainview, a charmless box from the 1960's that the company has expanded to accommodate increased volume, workers wearing "clean room" hats and masks bent over assembly benches.
"You won't get me to say that women can do this highly precise work better than men," Mr. Gorin said without cracking a smile as he looked over an assembly room in which several dozen workers, almost all of them women, methodically went about the work of configuring electro-photonic circuits according to instruction sheets spread out before them.
About 80 percent of Aeroflex's equity is held by institutions, which tend to invest as much in a sector as in an individual company. Aeroflex has gotten a "buy" rating from five analysts who follow the company.
"The reason we're so excited," said Greg Konezny, a research analyst at Piper Jaffrey in Minneapolis, "is that a big part of their business is serving a very fast-growing sector of the fiber-optics market. They serve the 2.5-gigabyte-per-second market, and that's where the exciting growth is. They're in a market that's going to be doubling this year and will double again in 2002."

HEADLINE: Health Care Worker Shortage Is Felt Islandwide 

BYLINE:  By DONNA KUTT NAHAS 

 BODY:
SERIOUS staffing shortages at the Island's hospitals, nursing homes and home care agencies put patient safety and care at risk, industry executives and union officials say.
 Health care workers of all stripes are in short supply, from registered and licensed practical nurses and nurse's aides to respiratory therapists, operating room technicians and pharmacists. 
 While there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that worker shortages are linked to medical errors or even patient neglect and abuse, the number of patient abuse cases the state's attorney general's office prosecuted on Long Island rose from one in 1999 to seven last year.
In its most recent survey, conducted last January, the Healthcare Association of New York State, a lobbying group for hospitals and health systems, found that on average it took about 10 weeks to fill a registered nurse position, about 5 weeks to hire a nurse's aide and about 7 weeks for a therapy technician. 
Health care experts speculate that circumstances on Long Island are equally dire if not worse, though most hospitals are loath to admit it. A staffing survey conducted a year and a half ago by the Nassau-Suffolk Hospital Council, which represents the Island's nonprofit hospitals, found that 60 percent of the 21 member hospitals on the Island that responded had difficulty recruiting registered nurses for vacancies in the intensive care unit, and 40 percent had trouble filling openings in the coronary care unit.
"There's no doubt in my mind that the situation has worsened since this survey was taken," said Peter Sullivan, president of the council. "They are looking for technically skilled people to deal with patients who are sicker and the sophisticated equipment required to take care of people like that. They can't find them because they are not out there."
Industry executives blame the shortages in part on a booming economy and low unemployment that has created more job options in less demanding, higher-paying fields that offer more attractive benefits and perks.
Demographic changes, experts say, also play a critical role. While demand for health care is rising as the number of elderly Americans grows, the health care industry has its smallest pool of entry-level workers since the 1930's. The average age of nurses is above 40, and declining nursing school enrollments means fewer nurses will fill vacancies that will be left by the current crop of retiring nurses.
At Nassau University Medical Center in East Meadow, some positions for registered nurses, nurse's aides, respiratory technicians and ward clerks have gone begging. Susan Heidtmann, senior vice president for nursing services, said it took roughly two months to fill registered nurse and nurse's aide positions, double the time it took two years ago. She cited higher salaries and more flexible schedules offered by community health centers, insurance companies and managed care organizations as incentives for some to "jump ship."
Donna Hughes of Center Moriches has often mused about jumping ship. After nearly a decade as a staff nurse at Central Suffolk Hospital in Riverhead, she says she is fed up with the chronic understaffing, heavy workload and mandatory overtime that have become standard in the industry.
"What's the point of quitting to work at another hospital?" said Ms. Hughes, 46. "It's not better anywhere else."
Michael Chacon, a representative for Long Island at the New York Nurses' Association, worries that as nurses are stretched thin by increased workload demands like additional paperwork generated by managed care and caring for sicker patients with complex medical problems, the volume of errors will rise.
"You can't expect to tack on these responsibilities and not expect an increase in the number of mistakes and omissions," Mr. Chacon said. "There's a delay in treatments and medical orders don't get picked up because they were busy doing X, Y and Z."
But while demand for nursing services continues to climb, nursing school enrollments in baccalaureate programs have declined in schools in the Northeast by 7.4 percent, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing. Enrollment at some of the Island's two- and four-year nursing programs has declined between 20 and nearly 50 percent during the last five years.
Federal cuts made to the Medicare program three years ago, which hit home care the hardest, are still being felt throughout the industry. Under pressure from the federal government, home care agencies were required to scale back the number of hours patients can receive care. For nurse's aides, the cuts translate into lower wages, which range on Long Island from about $6 to $9 an hour, and chaotic work schedules, where the only way to make ends meet is by stringing together several one- or two-hour assignments.
At hospitals, the nurse's aide employment outlook is just as bleak. At University Hospital Medical Center at Stony Brook, the turnover rate for nurse's aides last year was nearly 50 percent, more than twice that for nurses, said Dr. Lenora McClean, chief nursing officer at the hospital and dean of the SUNY-Stony Brook School of Nursing.
Like many home care agencies on the Island, Better Home Health Care in Rockville Centre has had to turn away customers. Pat Huber, the director and owner, said that on a typical day she didn't have enough workers to accept nearly half of the 30 cases offered to her agency.
Nursing homes throughout the Island are also feeling the pinch. At the Nesconset Nursing Center, a classified advertisement for a nurse's aide vacancy two years ago would yield 15 to 20 resumes, said Erik Anderson, the director of human resources. "Now, we're lucky if we get six," he said.
And applicants' qualifications are declining, Mr. Anderson said. He said he preferred to fill nurse's aide and licensed practical nurse positions with candidates who have at least two years' work in a nursing home or with the elderly. Now, he said, he hires new graduates or those with substantially less experience.
Many nursing homes look to temporary agencies for relief. But while nursing home executives contend that temps can provide basic care, they fear that social interaction, especially with the more demented and frail patients who make up the bulk of the nursing home population, is largely lacking with temps who aren't around long enough to get to know their patients.
Jay Sackman, executive vice president for the nursing home division of Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union, which serves the metropolitan area including Long Island, argues that overburdened workers frequently cannot keep up with the personal care needs of their residents, let alone social interaction. He noted instances where residents who needed to be walked to the bathroom ended up soiling their beds because workers were unavailable. "We have workers complaining that they just can't do the right thing by their residents," Mr. Sackman said.
The worker shortage also includes pharmacists, who are lured away from hospitals by higher salaries and a more diversified work environment in drugstores, pharmaceutical companies and managed care. And, as in nursing, the pharmacist shortage can also be blamed, in part, on declining pharmacy school enrollments and the recent lengthening of the required course of study from five years to six.
To reduce the shortage, some in the industry, including the New York State Nurses' Association and other advocacy groups and unions, support legislation for mandated staffing levels. Two bills, one in the state Senate sponsored by Carl Marcellino of Syosset and another in the Assembly introduced by Richard Gottfried of Manhattan, establish minimum staffing levels in hospitals and nursing homes, respectively.
Senator Marcellino said his bill would establish an internal review mechanism in hospitals to ensure that staff-to-patient ratios are met. The hospital would be charged with providing feedback to the State Department of Health, which would enforce the legislation.
"We go under the assumption that hospitals vary in their need and function," Mr. Marcellino said. "We don't have a one-size-fits-all philosophy," adding that the Department of Health would work with unions and individual hospitals to work out a suitable ratio to meet patients' needs. 
But a mandatory staffing level won't automatically produce more health care workers. The New York Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, an advocacy group for nursing homes and adult care centers, along with other industry groups oppose the legislation, arguing that there is no money to hire additional workers. Other critics say the legislation will draw workers from one sector of health care to meet a staffing requirement in another, only to exacerbate the shortages.
Industry groups are proposing that the federal government and state restore cuts in Medicare and Medicaid funding to help recruit and retain staff. Other initiatives include recommendations to cross-train health care support staff. Currently, a nurse's aide who works in a hospital cannot work in the same job in a nursing home without being retrained. Tuition assistance, grants and loan forgiveness programs for nurses who agree to work in underserved areas of the country also aim to ease shortages.
Yet another program, which will be run by the State Department of Health and Department of Labor, would recruit and train low-income people to work in hospitals, nursing homes and home care.
Experts agree the industry needs a marketing campaign that will educate young people about careers in the health field and bolster its poor public relations image. 
"Right now, it's all dot-coms and high-tech," said Carl Young, president of the New York Association of Homes and Services for the Aging. "The pendulum doesn't necessarily swing back to the same place it was, but it doesn't stay in one place either. I cling to the hope that we will find a way to make the human services arena more appealing to people."

HEADLINE: Finding a Place for Bicycle Commuting 

BYLINE:  By MELINDA TUHUS 

 BODY:
NO one thinks that bicycle commuting will ever overtake driving as the favored way to get to work in Connecticut, but the use of bikes is being proposed as a way to at least ease the congestion on the state's highways.
 The State Department of Transportation estimates 214,000 hours of lost time commuting daily on state roads -- that would be time over and above delay-free commuting. Various estimates translate that into an economic cost of millions up to $1 billion annually. 
 Responding to the health and economic impacts of transportation gridlock, especially in the southwest corridor of the state, business and government leaders met in late September at the first Connecticut Transportation Summit to try to find a way out. A member of the Connecticut Bicycle Coalition attended the meeting. The summit focused on increasing the use of water and rails to move freight, beyond the 2 percent that currently moves by rail and even less by water, and getting some of the 18-wheelers off the highway. 
The summit also promoted getting some single-occupant cars off the road and increasing mass-transit use beyond the current 4 percent. (Those who travel the state's roads in single occupancy vehicles have jumped from 68 percent in 1980 to 78 percent in 1990, according to the latest census data available.)
One goal of the bicycle coalition, said Georgette Yaindl, who stepped down in November as executive director of the coalition and who attended the summit, is to get bike racks on buses. According to Andrew Clarke, the United States Department of Transportation's bicycle policy analyst, Connecticut is one of just a handful of states that have no bike racks on buses. Mr. Clarke was in Hartford in late October for a conference sponsored by the bicycle coalition; he rode his bike in from Bradley airport.
Federal statistics show that commuters will walk an average of one-quarter mile to a bus stop, but they will bike up to 2.5 miles to a stop, said David Head, bicycle/pedestrian coordinator for the State Department of Transportation. They could then either lock their bikes at the stop and hop on the bus, or put their bikes on a rack and continue their bike commute at the other end of the bus ride. That option would increase commuting flexibility, but would only be feasible if all the buses in one region are fitted with racks.
Mike Sanders, head of transit and ride sharing for the transportation department, said state planners are considering Stamford, with only 36 buses, for a pilot project. 
"We are willing to do something to try and discern what the market is," he said, adding that his office is also looking into providing bike racks and lockers at train stations and/or park-and-ride lots around the state where demand is adequate.
In addition, bike advocates would like to see employers provide amenities like showers and secure bike parking, but the lack of them hasn't stopped two-wheeled commuters.
Bob Hartman's commute is 6.2 miles from Windsor to the Department of Environmental Protection in Hartford.
"Some of the roads are rough," Mr. Hartman said. "A bike lane would be nice, but I don't see it happening."
Sandy Fry is senior transportation planner for the Capital Region Council of Governments, which includes 29 towns. The council endorsed a regional bicycle plan last spring that promotes safer access to roads. 
According to Mr. Head, in 1998 (the last year for which the transportation department has statistics), four cyclists were killed and 833 were injured in Connecticut in accidents involving motor vehicles.
Much of the council's plan speaks to the rights and responsibilities of both cyclists and motorists. 
Essentially, cyclists are to follow all rules of the road and when safety is in doubt, common sense says to yield to the motor vehicle. 
Ms. Fry has also initiated monthly bike-to-work days during seasonable weather, where commuters meet for breakfast in downtown Hartford. About 50 people have participated so far, but she said there are more bikers out there. "The hard-core riders may not show up at our events because biking is just how they get to work," she said. 
Ms. Yaindl said the coalition has written a chapter for the Department of Motor Vehicles manual called, "Sharing the Road With Bicycles." Bill Seymour, a department spokesman, said the chapter "will make existing policies more prominent to citizens who otherwise would have to consult state statutes."
The coalition has a $100,000 budget and includes 500 individuals and families, 25 bike shops, 12 cycling clubs and a dozen "support organizations" that conduct their own rides to raise funds and awareness on a variety of issues. Working with sympathetic legislators, the coalition helped win passage of two laws in the past two years that help govern the unequal relations between bikes and motor vehicles. 
One provides a wider margin of roadway in which a bicyclist can legally operate. The other gives the right of way to a bicyclist when being overtaken by a motor vehicle making a right turn. The coalition also succeeded in getting bike helmets exempt from the state sales tax.
Representative Michael Lawlor, a Democrat from East Haven who is co-chairman of the General Assembly's judiciary committee, is also the informal head of the legislative bike caucus, made up of about 20 legislators. He said their goal is to encourage people to use bikes more often.
He hopes the laws have a ripple effect. "Under the old law," he said, "if a motorist struck a bicyclist who wasn't all the way up against the curb, it was always considered the bicyclist's fault. To the extent that insurance companies become aware that drivers can be successfully sued in a collision with a bicycle, they will start to do their own education."
Mr. Lawlor added that efforts are under way to build in a role for bicycle advocates on transportation advisory committees, but he said that in the departments of motor vehicles and of transportation, "There is a good deal of bureaucratic resistance, like 'Who do these people, bicyclists, think they are?' "
But he pointed out two factors he said he believed will encourage bicycle commuting. One is the reverse migration from suburbs to cities, where getting around by bike is often easier, and certainly cheaper, than driving. The other is the more casual dress code in many workplaces, enabling cyclists to commute in their work clothes. 
About $8 million in federal-transportation enhancement money is available to the state annually for non-motorized transportation, according to state transportation officials, but most of it goes for off-road facilities like bike trails and restoration of historic transportation facilities, not for cycling improvements on the roadways. 
Arthur Spada, state commissioner of public safety, serves with about 10 other government and business leaders on the new Transportation Strategy Board, whose mandate is to come up with solutions to the transportation delays in the state. There are no bicycle representatives. Bicycle commuting "is not a high priority," Mr. Spada said. But he added, once the quasi-governmental agency is created to oversee transportation issues, "people who have an interest in bikes, in mass transit or concerns about the environment will then have access to come before this body and make their arguments."
Ms. Yaindl said she would like to see that scenario reversed, so that instead of coming to make their case before a committee where their interests are not already represented, bike advocates -- and mass transit advocates, and environmental advocates -- could be in on the ground floor. She points to Massachusetts, which just passed a law requiring that bicycle and pedestrian traffic be accommodated "in the planning, design and construction, reconstruction or maintenance of any project undertaken" by the department of transportation. 
Ms. Yaindl said that Connecticut played a pivotal role in the early history of bicycle transportation. 
"In 1866 in New Haven," she said, "Pierre Lallement filed the first patent for a pedal bicycle, and starting in 1878 bicycles were produced in Hartford at the Pope Manufacturing Company. Connecticut has a moral responsibility and a unique opportunity to reclaim its identity as a center for innovative transportation technology."

HEADLINE: Old Department Store May Get New Life 

BYLINE:  By NANCY DONIGER 

 BODY:
A NONPROFIT agency in Minneapolis with a 20-year track record of purchasing foreclosed buildings and reinventing them as space where artists live, work, exhibit, perform and conduct business has designs on the former J. M. Read Department Store in Bridgeport.
 The company, Artspace, has successfully converted 10 former commercial structures into self-supporting artist quarters in Minnesota, Oregon and Pennsylvania. Seven more Artspace restorations, including the Bridgeport project, are under way in New York, Florida, Nevada, Texas, Illinois and Minnesota. 
 Read's closed its landmark downtown store on the corner of Broad and John streets in 1981, leaving the boarded-up building as a reminder of the city's bygone prosperity. Supporters of the Artspace project hope to contribute to a downtown renaissance by enhancing the city's vision of becoming a major arts and entertainment hub. 
Many -- but not all -- of the plans to revitalize Bridgeport have come to fruition. A controversial casino was rejected, and the main private investor behind the $1 billion Steel Point harbor development project recently backed out, leaving the city to seek new investors and to proceed with the overall plan in smaller increments, according to Joseph Gresko, mayoral press secretary.
Recent successes, he said, include Harbor Yard, home of the Bluefish baseball team; the Polka Dot Playhouse, a live theater; and the 10-000-seat hockey and concert arena under construction, although over budget. Additional plans call for the restoration of the old Palace and Majestic Theaters on Main Street.
William Kraus, a real estate banker from Norwalk, has led the Artspace charge in Bridgeport since October 1999, after a previous initiative to preserve the historic Lock Building in Norwalk as artist quarters fell through, following a long and heated battle for its survival. 
Last August, Governor John Rowland appointed Mr. Kraus as one of 12 commissioners of the State Historical Commission. When the Lock project fell through in Norwalk, Mr. Kraus went to Bridgeport, looking for a suitable site to redirect the thwarted plans. Bridgeport's disposition manager, Robert Halstead, introduced him to the Read's building, which is a perfect fit, Mr. Kraus said. The Artspace plan meshes with the city's goals of preserving historic buildings and encouraging downtown activities, during and after working hours, Mr. Gresko said.
"We welcome Artspace's willingness to permanently locate artists downtown," he said. "We're not looking for any other use for the Read's building. The city believes this a perfect fit for what we're doing to attract people back to the downtown."
The Read's project has the wholehearted support of the mayor's office, the city council, the business community, area philanthropic organizations, artists, and grass roots organizations. Feasibility studies have been conducted, along with a survey of 3,200 artists, with more than 200 indicating an interest in moving to the building. Architectural drawings have been completed, and a development team has been assembled.
As evidence of the city's commitment, it has already taken the property by eminent domain, offered it to Artspace for $1, granted zoning approval, pumped three feet of water out of the lower level and promised to provide other in-kind services, Mr. Gresko said.
The proposed $12 million reuse plan for Read's entails renovating the five-story, granite, limestone and brick building into mixed use living and studio space for 63 artists with a retail center on the first floor. Listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated an Official Save America's Treasures Project by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the run-down but architecturally sound structure retains some of its distinctive features. Monumental, three-story pilasters support the classical cornice on the first floor and are enhanced by 22-foot ceilings, a decorative staircase and bank of manual elevators.
The building is centrally located within blocks of the train and bus terminal, Long Island ferry, and the newly renovated Housatonic Community College with its modern art collection and gallery, the Downtown Cabaret Theater, and other enterprises.
Artspace provides a financial model for new initiatives, Mr. Kraus said. Most of the financing will come through applications to foundations and direct requests and referrals to corporations and individuals. He is seeking pledges of $500,000 in private financing from corporations, foundations and individuals to help leverage the rest of the funding. He already has $200,000 and is seeking more investors.
"This base of broad public support has importance way beyond its dollars," Mr. Kraus said. "It's the fulcrum on which the whole project is leveraged." 
Mr. Kraus has a Jan. 31 deadline to submit an application for financing from the Connecticut Housing and Finance Authority, which will be the project's key financial source qualifying it for up to $6 million in housing tax credits. Mr. Kraus is also attempting to secure $2 million in Historic Preservation tax credits and $2.5 million in long-term, low-interest debt mortgaging. The Greater Bridgeport Area Foundation has allocated $40,000 to the project. 
"We're thrilled to be involved," said Lara Herscovitch, foundation director of programs. "This is one of the most exciting initiatives to hit the downtown area in years. I don't know of anything that has gotten this far along and fallen through. It has broad-based support." 
John Clapp, professor of finance and real estate at the University of Connecticut, said the arts community is an interesting one to subsidize because they "add a creative spark" and make an area a more attractive place, pointing to similar, arts-based creative redevelopment projects, such as Boston's Faneuil Hall and the Golden Triangle area of Pittsburgh that have drawn people downtown after periods of decline.
"Whether Artspace comes to pass in Bridgeport will depend on whether the city can get enough synergism going to overcome the financial, technical and political obstacles," Mr. Clapp said. "Is this part of an overall plan that includes cafes, restaurants and other places where artist like to hang out? Is there a large enough community of artists to move there? Can you convince people to invest in something this uncertain? These are issues that will have to be addressed."
Robert T. Keeley Jr., director of the Downtown Special Services District and a Democratic State Representative, concedes the project has "a lot of hurdles to cross to raise the $12 million" but believes medium-size projects such as Artspace are manageable and what Bridgeport requires for revitalization.
"We need to look at hitting singles instead of home runs," he said. "Read's Department Store is an important part of downtown. It contains a lot of memories. We think it's worth preserving, which is why the D.S.S.D. pledged $7,500. Norwalk's loss is our gain."
William Finch, the Democratic state senator and Bridgeport's Economic Development Corporation president, believes Artspace will "prime the pump for other projects. We need to look at revitalization in bite-size pieces. Bringing artists downtown is fun and funky. It's multidimensional, exciting housing and will help downtown businesses." 
Susan Fazekas, a graphic artist who lives and works in Bridgeport, said the concept is garnering excitement among the arts community.
"I know a lot of fine artists who are excited about it," she said. "People believe it will be a thriving city center, not just cheap space. There have been a lot of false starts here in Bridgeport, but this time it just may happen."
Edward Deak, an economics professor at Fairfield University, acknowledges the success of urban redevelopment projects, many of them focused on entertainment and sports themes, in rejuvenating depressed downtown areas. The Artspace proposal would not itself contribute tax dollars but could serve as a catalyst to tax-producing development, he said. 
"It's not a question of whether or not it's a good idea; the question is whether it serves as a magnet to attract private investment," Mr. Deak said. "Most people in Bridgeport would like to see taxable properties to help raise revenues and jobs. Re-positioning Bridgeport as an entertainment and sports center, rather than an old, dying industrial center, creates a picture that's different than the past 20 or 30 years. At the very least, it will create a buzz. The worst thing the city can do is nothing."

2 Stamford Building Sales Reflect Broader Changes

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn. 

 BODY:
THE recent sales of two major office buildings in Stamford and of an 80-acre light-manufacturing and office complex on the Norwalk-Westport line are emblematic of the area's maturing market and increased selectivity by huge corporations about property they own, real estate executives say.
 The Stamford properties that changed hands are First Stamford Place, a 776,000-square-foot complex of three buildings just south of Exit 7 on Interstate 95, and 400 Atlantic Street, the former corporate headquarters of Champion International, containing 482,852 square feet. In both cases, control is passing from owners with national interests to family-owned companies with a more regional focus. 
 "The office landscape has changed dramatically," said Darrell Harvey, co-chief operating officer at Albert B. Ashforth Inc., real estate brokers headquartered in Stamford. "The downsizing of Fortune 500 companies and technology that allows for location anywhere are major factors." 
Christopher Bruhl, executive director of the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association in Stamford, added, "Management that had been defined by its building is defined now by function, and location of a company is no longer influenced by where the chief officer lives."
Fairfield County, and particularly Stamford, lost its standing as the third largest corporate headquarters location in the United States (after New York and Chicago) during the real estate debacle of the 1980's, when Fortune 500 companies like American Can and Singer, which had built, owned and occupied their buildings, left Greenwich and Stamford. Today, said Irene Korin, senior executive at Stamford's Office of Economic Development, "there is no reason for companies to keep real estate if real estate is not their core business." She added, "It's not the best use of their cash."
Demands for large blocks of space are rare these days -- requests are predominantly for 50,000 square feet or less -- leading some real estate professionals to believe that Fairfield County is limited in its potential for future expansion. 
Brian Lipson, executive vice president for acquisitions at TrizecHahn, the Canadian real estate giant, which sold First Stamford Place to W&M Properties of New York and Stamford for $152 million on Friday, said his company had determined that small cities do not offer substantial enough opportunity for growth. "As a public company," he said, "we are more rewarded in major markets. In the case of Stamford, it would be difficult to grow further. Fairfield County is limited in general." His company is looking in those cities where it already owns 50 million square feet of office holdings, he said, including New York, Chicago, Washington, Atlanta, Houston, Dallas and Los Angeles."
Built by TrizecHahn as a multitenanted complex between 1982 and 1984, First Stamford Place contains all the amenities that developers strove to offer their tenants in what was then a hinterland for support services. It has a restaurant, a travel agent, beauty salon, barbershop, carwash, automated teller, fitness center and a shuttle to downtown Stamford and the train station, which is only a block and a half away. 
The three buildings are 99.6 percent occupied and will continue to operate with leases that extend for up to nine years. Its largest tenants are Citibank and the Odyssey Reinsurance Company, each with 100,000 square feet. Annual rents, which average $28 a square foot, "are 30 percent below market," said Anthony E. Malkin, president of W&M Properties, the new owner.
As leases expire, new rents will average around $40, he said. Some $23 million is to be spent on upgrading bathrooms, common areas, dining facilities and elevators and on financing capital improvements and tenant allowances. W&M is a family-owned company founded in 1965 by Lawrence A. Wien and Peter L. Malkin, Anthony's father. It operates in eight states as an owner of real estate; manager of offices, apartments and retail space; and participant in partnerships and financial institutions involved with real estate. 
Unlike Mr. Lipson of TrizecHahn, "we are extremely bullish on Stamford," Anthony Malkin said. "Pricewaterhouse has labeled Stamford a subcity -- a suburban conglomeration of 24-hour downtown activity within proximity of a major city. Stamford has become the only viable subcity to New York in the tristate area, fulfilling a demand for services, nightlife and a sense of community. It is dominated by a mix of smaller businesses -- that's where the growth has been."
Another family-owned real estate company, the Landis Group of Stamford and New York, founded in 1967 by Alan B. Landis, leads the partnership that bought the International Paper building (the former Champion International building) at 400 Atlantic Street on Dec. 28 for $105 million. 
DESPITE a tight market for financing new office construction, capital is available for quality buildings sold well below replacement cost "because, like Rockefeller Center, they can't be replaced," said Kenneth M. Krasnow, regional manager for Cushman & Wakefield, brokers on the sale. 
International Paper acquired the building last June in its $9 billion acquisition of the entire Champion International Company. International Paper also assumed $2 billion in debt.
Another local part of the acquisition was Treetops, the 110-acre estate on the Stamford-Greenwich border that was once owned by the 1930's nightclub singer Libby Holman. When International Paper put the estate up for sale and entertained an offer from a developer, a furor erupted in Stamford and in Greenwich, where 70 acres of the land lies. Conservationists who had been negotiating for the property as green space accused the company of gross insensitivity for failing to notify them of the other offer. The embarrassed company agreed to the conservationists' price of $11.5 million, to be paid by the state and the two towns by Jan. 31. 
In International Paper's view, the Champion building was equally expendable. Jack Cox, a spokesman for the company, explained, "We did not need a 15-story building in Stamford." It was sold to 400 Atlantic Associates L.L.C., a partnership consisting of the Landis Group, the RiverOak Investment Corporation of Stamford and Allegiance Capital Partners of New York City. 
A leaseback was negotiated for 132,000 square feet on the top two floors, to which I. P. will move its headquarters from Purchase, N.Y., in April of this year. "Stamford gives us more visibility than Westchester," Mr. Cox said. In Purchase the company was tucked into an office park, he said, with a number of smaller companies. 
About 140 former Champion and International Paper employees will occupy the new quarters. Some 300 Champion employees who formerly worked in the building were dismissed, and about 60 others got jobs with the company elsewhere in the country. 
Two additional tenants -- UBS Warburg (the former Swiss Bank, which is building a 338,000 square foot addition to its office and trading floor facility a few blocks to the west, for a total of 910,000 square feet) and Arthur Andersen, the accounting company -- have leases with options of up to five and seven years for 73,000 square feet and 36,700 square feet, respectively. "We are delighted to have them," said Scott Landis, a principal in his father's company, "and we are in discussion with our tenants to determine their future needs, including the Whitney Museum of American Art," which has a branch on the ground floor.
The Landis Group is a developer, owner and manager of 10 million square feet of offices in the tristate area, mainly in New Jersey. Its projects include the Carnegie Center, a 600-acre mixed-use campus near Princeton, and the Hilton Hotel in East Brunswick. There are 250,000 square feet left to rent at 400 Atlantic Street, starting at $45 a square foot, Mr. Landis said. The partners have set aside $3 million for work on elevators, air-conditioning, the lobby and parking deck.
On an 80-acre spread at 10 Norden Place in Norwalk, including 2 acres over the line in Westport, the potential exists for redeveloping one of the last large sites in lower Fairfield County. A 635,000-square-foot light industrial and office building was constructed on the property in the 60's by the United Technologies Corporation of Hartford for its Norden Systems subsidiary, a developer of radar equipment. 
United Technologies sold the Norden unit in the mid-90's and sold the property to SSR Realty Advisors and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company two years ago. On Nov. 16 of last year, Met Life sold it to Greenfield Acquisition Partners II for $40 million. Greenfield's partners are the Summit Development Company in Westport and the Spinnaker Companies, headed by Clayton Fowler, a major Stamford developer of offices and apartments. 
Under Norwalk zoning, up to a total 1.2 million square feet of light industrial and accessory office space could be built on the Norwalk portion. A zoning amendment would be required for putting up office buildings without an industrial component. Zoning for the two acres in Westport allows for single-family homes on one or two acre lots or an assisted-living facility on part of the site. 
A downsized Norden, now owned by Northrop Grumman, occupies about 75 percent of the building and recently renewed its lease with options up to 12 years, according to George Lambros III of Grubb & Ellis Commercial Real Estate, which said it represented Metropolitan Life in the sale. Mr. Fowler said the new owners are planning to convert the 25 percent of the property that is vacant into industrial or office space for a number of companies. The property is just off Interstate 95 between Exits 16 and 17, with views of Long Island Sound.

HEADLINE: Flexible Office Layouts Draw Tenants in Boston 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
RECENTLY occupied offices in the Boston area reflect new ways that space is being used and financed in a market where demand vastly outstrips supply and rents have risen as much as 50 percent in the last year.
 Technology companies and consulting and financial-service firms form a vibrant tenant sector that has led a reconfiguration of office layouts. Where once office layouts featured canyons of cubicles surrounded by closed offices for managers, tech companies with flat hierarchies have shrunken private space and opened floor plans to promote teamwork and communication. 
 They take down ceilings and walls, exposing ducts and power ports, to install increasingly complex data, voice and video systems, which become tools and decor that also draw clients and workers. Staff members or consultants visiting from their own virtual offices find small private spaces where they can plug in and work for a while. 
Despite a gritty industrial or artist-loft look, the standard $50-square-foot tenant fit-up cost has doubled or tripled, but the new approach offers the flexibility to frequently rearrange work groups and upgrade technology without tearing up the office.
So widely accepted has this new approach to office layouts become that even the most conservative technology companies have embraced it. At the end of the month, I.B.M. Global Services will officially inaugurate a 30,000-square-foot Internet consulting center overlooking the Charles River here. 
The center's sweeping circular layout reserves 60 percent of the space for group work. Walls curve, slide and even "speak" since some movable, interactive whiteboard room dividers can send scribbled notes to personal computers. A soon-to-arrive conference table will have overhead projectors that display interactive images on the tabletop that one can click through with a stylus in the way that a user clicks through links on a screen using a computer mouse.
"The interior design is all about how we work -- a one-team concept of creative, technology and business consulting talent," said Roger A. Letalien, manager of the I.B.M. consulting group that began occupying the center last summer. "Before, we couldn't always get all these people in the same room with the clients to quickly deliver solutions for them." 
As at 17 other such centers that I.B.M. has opened in New York, London, Tokyo and elsewhere, the interior design -- cool, curvy, replete with scooters and physioballs -- "is a huge draw for recruitment," he added. The plastic physioballs -- bigger than beach balls -- and the scooters are there to present the informal image of a dot-com company, and, he said, "it says the corporate world is doing more for its people."
EQUALLY design-intensive are some of the technology and new-media business incubator centers that have opened around the region in the last two years. For technology start-ups that cannot afford annual asking rents that reach $70 a square foot in Cambridge, $60 in the suburbs and $100 in Boston, companies have obtained venture-capital financing to lease and fit up blocks of space for budding entrepreneurs. Often the sponsoring company takes some equity in the start-ups in exchange for space, technology, management and consulting services.
Last April, Timothy D. Rowe opened the 18,000-square-foot Cambridge Incubator at One Broadway, an office building in Kendall Square owned by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the city's largest landlords. "We're a venture campus, a community of entrepreneurs," said Mr. Rowe, 34, formerly a management consultant who now invests venture capital in the companies occupying space at Cambridge Incubator.
In 1999, he wanted to start a business but was wary of signing a 10-year lease and the prospect of a two or three month wait for high-speed Internet access. Instead, he decided to provide space for other budding high-tech entrepreneurs and take stakes in their companies. He raised $11 million from the venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson and others, signed a seven-year lease, did a $2 million tenant build-out and moved into the space last April.
"We realized that we could create a platform of space, technology, furniture, insurance, payroll services, management and technology consulting," he said. 
Scruffy corrugated ceilings and translucent sliding walls define the common areas. Four start-ups now occupy a series of 400-square-foot bays. Each of the 14 bays is fitted with furniture, 24 connections for telephones and high speed Internet access. To expand, simply slide open the wall to the adjacent bay. 
"What makes this work is the layout: open and flexible with tight security," said Mr. Rowe, whose company now has 50 employees. Cambridge Incubator was charging rent of $38 a square foot a year but recently raised it to $60. "We make money on the investment side, not the real estate, but at $38 we couldn't get people to move out" to make room for new start-ups, he said.
Despite the softening economy, sticker shock will still jolt office seekers. In the last year, rents throughout the metropolitan Boston region have jumped 20 to 50 percent as vacancy rates fell to 3.7 percent regionally, 1.5 percent in Boston and Cambridge. Still, demand dwarfs supply. In Cambridge, tenants are searching for 1.4 million square feet of offices but only 400,000 square feet are available; in Boston they want 4.6 million square feet, with only 2.3 million square feet to be had, according to Benjamin Breslau, a research analyst for Spaulding & Slye Colliers, a real estate services firm. 
"The economic slowdown should unlock some sublease space," he said. "That's healthy for this tight market. Rents will stabilize, but they won't drop."
WHILE many publicly held technology companies may be struggling over all, in this region "technology-oriented businesses are driving a good part of the office demand downtown and in the suburbs," said Jon A. Southard, chief economist for Boston-based Torto Wheaton Research. Ten years ago, he noted, they congregated mostly in the lower cost suburbs. In the 12-month period that ended on Sept. 30, technology companies helped to occupy 5.5 million square feet of offices. "That's huge for this market, where the historic annual absorption rate is about 1.5 million square feet," he said.
Although technology companies may have popularized the open office environment, now almost all office tenants are adopting aspects of it. Even staid law firms are shrinking private offices to enlarge common areas, said Steven J. Basque, a principal at ADD Inc., the architectural firm that designed the I.B.M. Internet consulting center and Cambridge Incubator.
"There's been a technology-driven paradigm shift from isolation to community," he said. "New-economy companies tend to work in teams as they brainstorm for new concepts. Also, incubator space isn't offices. It's an environment to create ideas and build businesses."
He added: "In the past, offices just needed phone and computer systems. Now, technology is more complex and evolves so fast, often-upgraded systems can't be covered by drywall or marble." And since 1999, furniture makers have been marketing less costly, lighter pieces on casters for mobility. 
Change is constant for Michael J. Young, managing partner of global real estate programs for Accenture, the consulting and technology firm formerly named Andersen Consulting. "Our business is always evolving, and the more we lock into big lease commitments, the less able we are to adjust," said Mr. Young, whose company was an early, ardent convert to shared office space. "At first, the goal was to lower real estate costs. Now it has to do with technology and employee expectations."
In 1997, the firm moved out of a luxury tower in downtown Boston to occupy an entire 63,000-square-foot building in the Wellesley Office Park about 15 miles to the west. It set up the building as a "hoteling" facility where workstations are shared by road-warrior consultants who reserve space when they need it. 
Last year, the company also opened a business launch center in suburban Lexington and a small office in Boston's Financial District for meeting clients who fly into Logan International Airport. 
After decades of real estate experience, Mr. Young now thinks of office space differently than he did 10 years ago. "Technology decreases the need for people to come into the office, and we've only just scratched the surface," he said. "With wireless, people can work anywhere in the world."
"We no longer think of real estate," he said. "We think of creating the platform of space, technology and services that people need." 
"Work is not where you are," he added. "It's what you do."

EVEN the murals depicting the city's history were damaged by water that had seeped into the grand two-story room that had once provided a suitably impressive backdrop for officers of the National Newark and Essex Bank, then the state's largest. Now, three years after a change of ownership, the murals have been restored and a dropped ceiling has been removed to expose the rich details of the original plasterwork.
 The building at 744 Broad Street is as good a symbol as any of the revival of the office market in the downtown core of this formerly heavily industrial city. As rents have climbed to near record levels in Manhattan, and the Jersey City waterfront has begun to fill up, investors have been making acquisitions in Newark and tenants have been renting the refurbished spaces. 
 "There have been a lot of false starts in Newark in the past," said Arthur Stern, the chief executive of Cogswell Realty Group, which bought 744 Broad in 1998 and renamed it the National Newark Building. But this time, he said, the demand for well-located office space and other developments in the city are the basis for what he believes will be a sustained comeback. 
Plans for the first new private sector office building in the city in many years were announced recently. The proposed building's developers are Edison Properties, a large landowner and parking-lot operator, and the Rockefeller Group, which owns or controls four Manhattan skyscrapers on the west side of Avenue of the Americas across from Rockefeller Center and is building a million square foot building at 745 Seventh Avenue. The proposed 22-story, 350,000-square-foot building at 50 Commercial Street in Newark would face on the Passaic River adjacent to the refurbished Penn Station with its rail and PATH links to Manhattan.
Most of the major office buildings in downtown Newark have been sold -- and in some cases resold -- during the last three years. The new owners have been investing capital in the properties to restore their faded glory because of their confidence that tenants will be attracted by rents that are one-half to one-third those of comparable spaces in Manhattan.
The participation of major financial institutions in these investments is the best signal of Newark's revival, said Stanley C. Gale, a principal in Gale & Wentworth, a New Jersey-based investment and development company. His company owns two of the office towers in the Gateway office and retail complex, built in the 1970's and 80's near Penn Station, in conjunction with Tishman Speyer properties of New York.
"Jerry Speyer is linked with Citigroup, and my partner is Morgan Stanley," Mr. Gale said. "Lehman Brothers is backing Artie Stern in his projects," he added, referring to Mr. Stern of Cogswell Group. "With Prudential, that's four major investment groups that are active in Newark."
This is not to say all the city's problems have been solved. The population has declined for decades, falling to 246,950 in 1997 from a peak of 438,776 in 1950. Most real estate executives say the city needs a larger residential population near the downtown area to keep it alive after working hours, but say the troubled condition of Newark's school system could discourage young families from locating there. Remnants of the city's industrial past, when the absence of zoning made a mixture of housing and factories common, also inhibit housing development.
The New Jersey state government has developed programs to push development back into cities to preserve what is left of open space in the most suburban state in the country. "The state is putting a lot of money into redeveloping the inner cities," said Seena Stein, the president of Newmark & Company Real Estate of New Jersey. "There are special development zones in Jersey City and Newark." Companies that locate in the designated zones are eligible for tax breaks and other economic benefits. 
The refurbished buildings in Newark are attracting tenants at rents significantly higher than those charged in the recent past. According to Cushman & Wakefield of New Jersey, a brokerage and management company, the overall average asking rental rate rose to $27.14 a square foot a year in 2000, from $20.46 in 1999 and $16.67 in 1996.
"Some small units at Gateway are renting at $29 to $32 a square foot," said Sean P. Brady, a senior director at Cushman & Wakefield, who added that other representatives of the city's small stock of Class A buildings -- the most modern and well-equipped category -- are starting rent negotiations at $30 a square foot. Numbers like these, and a vacancy rate that has fallen to an average of 11.1 percent in 2000 from 17.8 percent five years earlier, tend to encourage developers.
Jerome Gottesman, the chairman of Edison Properties, which operates a surface parking lot at the Commercial Street site where the office tower is planned, said a new building could be more attractive to a company moving out of New York than a renovated structure 50 or more years old. Brokers seem to agree, saying renovated buildings are at best Class B+ space, while a new building would be Class A.
"New construction is a big advantage," Mr. Gottesman said, because a new building can be designed for modern communications and other technology, rather than adapted like an older structure. "All new buildings will have a floor devoted to telecommunications," he said.
Leslie E. Smith, Jr., a senior vice president of Rockefeller Group, said the market is ripe for new construction in Newark, although the joint venture will not proceed with the project until an anchor tenant is signed. "Newark is a wonderful alternative to Midtown Manhattan and Jersey City," he said. "The time has come for Class A buildings in Newark."
Both men noted that the building will be adjacent to Penn Station, with its connections to Manhattan, other parts of New Jersey and a monorail connection directly to Newark Airport, the largest air terminal in the region.
Meanwhile, assets the city has long possessed, including a strategic location in the metropolitan area with excellent transportation links and an abundance of fiber-optic cables under its streets, have been rediscovered. Telecommunications companies occupy the lower floors of 744 Broad for this reason, and the old Bamberger's store at Halsey and Market Streets has become a telecommunications hotel, housing servers and other internet infrastructure for multiple carriers.
INVESTMENTS that were made in public facilities in the wake of the devastating riots of 1967 have matured. Improbably to those who remember its days as a thriving blue-collar city, Newark is now a college town, with more than 40,000 students attending undergraduate and graduate classes at New Jersey Institute of Technology, Rutgers University, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Seton Hall University Law School, Essex County College and Rutgers Law School.
City planners and developers are looking at these students, who largely now commute from the suburbs, as potential residents once housing becomes available.
And some eyesores that have lingered for decades along Broad Street between the growing campuses and the sparkling New Jersey Performing Arts Center may be close to transformation because of the efforts of private benefactors and the Prudential Life Insurance Company, the financial giant of the city. The New Newark Foundation owns or controls a four block by two block swath of land on the north side of Broad Street that contains the long-closed Hahne's, Griffith and S. Klein stores.
The plan is to develop the area, which the New Newark executive director, James A. Schmidt, calls "the hole in the doughnut," into a 24-hour-a-day neighborhood, with ground-level retail and housing on the upper floors. When the foundation offered the Griffith and Hahne's properties last year, 18 development groups submitted offers, which have since been winnowed to six.
Mr. Schmidt said the goal is to select the winner or winners by early April, complete acquisition of the properties later in the year and begin construction in the first quarter of 2002.
Also under intense discussion is a new indoor sports arena that would house the Nets and the Devils, New Jersey's professional basketball and ice hockey teams. If built as planned, the arena and related development would clear out a faded industrial area on the western side of the downtown core and visually connect City Hall on Broad Street with the Gateway office complex near Penn Station.
Mr. Gottesman said he hoped that an old unused railroad bridge, which is over the main Amtrak lines, can be redeveloped as a pedestrian access from the rail station to the sports arena.
An open air baseball stadium, housing the minor league Newark Bears, is already in operation.
Meanwhile, Newark's already good transportation links are about to get better, with the city's existing light rail system about to be extended. The new loop of mostly surface rail will, for the first time, connect Penn Station with the Broad Street rail station, about one mile away. Thus, a person could board a train in, say, Morristown, get off at Broad Street, take the trolley across town to Penn Station and the use the monorail to get to the airport without having to brave the region's daunting automotive traffic.
Newark city officials say the money is in hand for the Broad Street to Penn Station link and new light rail cars have been ordered. Financing has not yet been secured for further phases of rail development, but plans are to eventually extend the line past the airport and into Elizabeth to the south. 
The convenience of rail transportation has promoted some developers to consider converting the long-vacant former Westinghouse factory that sits just west of the Broad Street station into housing.
Meanwhile, work is proceeding on Allied Junction in the Hackensack Meadowlands, which will connect most of the passenger rail lines in New Jersey and improve not only access to Manhattan but also north-south mass transit in the northeastern corner of the state. "When that is completed, a person could live in Bergen County and easily work in Newark," Mr. Gottesman said.
"Newark is one of the few places in the state with good mass transportation," said Roger Steinhart, director of leasing for the Kushner Companies, a New Jersey-based owner and developer. He said this might give the city an advantage over Jersey City, where most in-state residents still commute by car. (New York residents are able to take the ferry or PATH train.) "Jersey City will be a transportation nightmare when the waterfront fills up," he said.
Dramatic improvement in the region's infrastructure was not what was on Mr. Stern's mind on the day in October 1997 when he and a partner, Peter Marsh, drove to Newark to look at 744 Broad. Given Newark's reputation at the time, he said, his main concern was carjacking. 
ARRIVING safely at the building, they saw a structure much in need of repair. The 70-year-old building, although a national landmark, had been part of the Helmsley portfolio, where it had apparently been ignored for decades. On the first floor, a grand marble staircase had been ripped out to install metal escalators not in keeping with the building's neo-Classical tone. Elevator service was erratic, and the plumbing often did not work.
The building was two-thirds empty and had deteriorated to the point that most of the remaining tenants were threatening to leave, Mr. Stern said.
But the 33-story, 641,000-square-foot building was centrally located and had good bones. It was also cheap. Cogswell paid $7.5 million for the structure and then began a $55 million rehabilitation program, installing new computer-controlled elevators, new double pane windows and disability compliant bathrooms, remodeled common areas and refurbished the lobby.
The murals, painted by James Monroe Hewlett, were restored, the plasterwork on the leaky ceiling repaired and period-type chandeliers installed. Mr. Stern said that the hopes were to eventually lease the ornate high-ceilinged second-floor bank-officer space to a restaurant, with the former bank board room to be used as a private dining room.
He said the building's office floors were being occupied by professional firms, like architects and software designers, who do not want to pay Manhattan rents and need easy access to the airport. He said the building was currently about 82 percent full, compared with 19 percent occupancy when it was purchased.
Telecommunications tenants like MCI and Sprint occupied the lower floors even before the renovation, the space largely occupied by machines that do not care about elevator service, the state of the bathrooms or the cleanliness of the hallways. Mr. Stern said he was able to build on the infrastructure installed by those companies to extend high-capacity lines to the upper floors.
To publicly mark the restoration, the owners have installed lighting that floods the outer surface of the building with light after dark. "The building really stands out at night," said Mr. Steinhart, who said it is easily visible from his hilltop apartment about 10 miles to the west in the town of Verona.
The city's fiber-optic backbone, courtesy of the former Bell Atlantic, which had major operations there, brought a major new tenant to the city late in 1999, when International Discount Telecommunications leased the entire 450,000 square feet in the building at 520 Broad Street. The company, which provides high-speed Internet access and discount long-distance telephone service, is relocating from Hackensack. 
It may seem somewhat odd for a high-tech company to take over a building that was previously occupied by an insurance company, once one of Newark's major industries. The Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company owned the 1950's era building, but its business collapsed in 1991 and its insurance assets and finally its building were sold. The current owner is the Kushner Companies of Florham Park, N.J.
SINCE buying 744 Broad, Cogswell has purchased a building across the street at 765 Broad. The seven-story, 200,000-square-foot structure is currently occupied by Prudential and First Union Bank, which is the corporate successor to the old National Newark and Essex Bank.
Cogswell has also acquired another nearby building at 1180 Raymond Boulevard, a 30-story, 441,000-square-feet structure. It is planning to convert the old office structure into residences, with 300 rooms reserved for students at Seton Hall's law school. The remaining 195 units on the upper floors of the building will be market rate housing. It is scheduled to open in August 2002.
Although a lot of attention has been centered on the performing arts center as the key to Newark's revival, Mr. Gale of Gale & Wentworth said it was a combination of factors, including the arts center, the baseball stadium, the growth of the universities and the improvement of the transportation network, including the rail links and improved access ramps to the interstate highways -- Routes 280 and 78 -- that pass through the city.
"If you look at places like Cleveland and Baltimore, you will see that no one event can do it," he said. "The arts center would not do it, nor any one university. But with all these things in place, it is a much different situation than it was 10 years ago."

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the Newark office market misidentified the successor of the National Newark and Essex Bank, which once had headquarters in an office building that has recently been refurbished. The bank was ultimately acquired by what became PNC Financial Services Group, not by the First Union Bank.

Prosperity Beckons in the Highlands, a Slice of Appalachia

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: WEST MILFORD TOWNSHIP 

 BODY:
IT DOESN'T TAKE long to hike to the top of Bearfort Mountain, a 1,300-foot high fold of gneiss and granite that rises above the patchwork of glacial lakes, wetlands and forested valleys known as the New Jersey Highlands. The 20-minute trek from a makeshift parking area here brings hikers to a world ruled by bobcats, bald eagles and black bears, all of it just an hour's drive from the man-made canyons of midtown Manhattan.
 From the top of an old fire tower, a bitter wind turning his cheeks pink, Tim Dillingham points out Farny State Park, the Ramapo Mountains and the icy white patches of reservoirs that provide drinking water for nearly half of the state's eight million residents. 
 "People come up here and they can't believe this is New Jersey," said Mr. Dillingham, executive director of the Highlands Coalition, an organization that looks after the 750,000 acres of forest, farmland and rough-hewn escarpments that arc across the northwest of the state. 
But even in such a seemingly untrammeled landscape, signs of man's civilizing impulses are impossible to ignore. The gleam of new construction pokes through the blanket of oak and hickory, and Mr. Dillingham gestures to distant ridges that developers hope to plant with town houses, luxury homes and a world-class ski resort.
While a decade of prosperity has brought suburbia to vast stretches of rural New Jersey, environmentalists say they are especially alarmed by the forces reshaping the Highlands, a branch of the Appalachian range that rises up near Reading, Pa., and passes through New Jersey and New York before ending at Danbury, Conn. The region, which provides a refuge for 27 endangered and threatened species, is valuable for more practical reasons: at least four million people in New York and New Jersey rely on its 10 reservoirs and underground aquifers for their water, and its forested slopes help absorb rainwater that might otherwise inundate low-lying towns. 
Even though a 1993 study undertaken by the United States Forest Service called it a landscape of national significance, New Jersey's Highlands remain largely unprotected, with 80 percent of the land in private hands. Conservationists estimate that 3,000 to 5,000 acres are lost to development each year, a figure that could increase if New Jersey, as demographic experts predict, receives another one million residents in the next 20 years. 
Stewards like Mr. Dillingham, who dream of turning the area into a forest preserve, say the Highlands are at a crucial juncture.
"This is a last-chance landscape," he said. "It's our last chance to have a wilderness so close to suburbia and the largest city in the country. If we don't do something soon, this will all just be consumed by sprawl."
A growing number of elected officials, including both of New Jersey's Democratic senators, would like to see much of the Highlands preserved as national forest. Senator Robert G. Torricelli, who helped secure Congressional financing for the National Forest Service study, said a piecemeal approach using state open space funds and local tax dollars does not go far enough.
"We could have a green belt from the Hudson to the Delaware," Mr. Torricelli said in a telephone interview. "I want something that is comprehensive and irreversible." 
Of course, not everyone wants to see a Highlands National Park. Developers and even longtime residents worry that such a sweeping designation would lock out economic opportunity, leading to higher tax rates and a shortage of affordable housing. Many municipalities, engaged in the great ratables chase, have long viewed commercial and residential development as the only way to pay for schools and services.
Joanne Harkins, director of land use and planning for the New Jersey Builders Association, disputes the portrayal of the Highlands as a pristine wilderness that should be placed off-limits to construction.
"People have lived here for a long time, and there is plenty of room for development," Ms. Harkins said. "New Jersey already has a tremendous amount of regulations that protect land."
Thanks to strict environmental rules and New Jersey's fractured system of local governance, known as home rule, it is becoming increasingly difficult to build housing in the region, she said.
"Further restrictions would have serious consequences on the supply and price of housing in New Jersey," Ms. Harkins said.
To be sure, the Highlands is no isolated wedge of wilderness. Since the early 17th century, when the first Dutch settlers arrived, the Highlands has been a mosaic of farmland, forest and compact villages. Tilled by Scottish, English and Huguenot farmers, the region's high-grade deposits of iron ore were forged into cannonballs and bullets and helped American forces vanquish the British in the Revolutionary War. But by the 1830's, most of its trees, burned in iron-smelting furnaces, had vanished. Today, miles of abandoned tunnels and dozens of crumbling furnaces are the only remnants of that industrial past. 
"In the past 100 years, the Highlands forests have really bounced back, with many wildlife species returning," said Tom Gilbert, regional conservation director of the Appalachian Mountain Club. "When a forest is logged, it eventually grows. But this new wave of change is different. Once you pave it over, it's forever."
To drive through Parsippany along Route 46 is to get an idea of what Mr. Gilbert is saying. Less than a generation ago, this densely populated suburb was a bucolic town at the foot of the Highlands; today, environmentalists point to Parsippany's spreading crop of low-rise office parks and strip malls as an example of unplanned development run amok. 
Wilma Frey, project director at the Highlands Coalition, said there were at least 100 residential developments of 20 or more units in the region's rural areas, embracing four counties and 87 municipalities.
"The development pressure had become absolutely extreme," Ms. Frey said, driving on I-80, the east-west corridor that, along with Interstates 78 and 287, opened the region to suburban-style development. "People are fighting projects all over the place. If you look in the newspapers, there are more real estate ads than news."
Not far from Parsippany, in Montville, local officials are trying to derail a proposed mountainside golf club that would be ringed by $5 million homes, all of them with stunning views of Manhattan. In Vernon Township, the northernmost corner of the Highlands, a Canadian developer, with the town's blessing, is hoping to build a $500 million, Colorado-style ski resort on Hamburg Mountain, with 1,600 condominiums, hotels, a conference center and a golf course. At the southern end of the range, in Lebanon, the Pulte Corporation has been trying to win approval for 917 houses on a former cattle ranch known as Windy Acres Farm. 
David Epstein, executive director of the Morris Land Conservancy, said open-space preservation groups like his were competing with deep-pocket developers for some of the county's most scenic parcels.
"It's a tug of war, said Mr. Epstein, whose organization has preserved 524 acres since 1997. "Land out here has become amazingly expensive." 
Using a combination of state and local open space dollars, the conservancy hopes to buy 1,000 acres in the next year.
"We've saved a lot of great places," Mr. Epstein added. "But we've lost a lot too. It's really like death by 1,000 cuts."
As far as some of its longtime residents are concerned, Montville has experienced more than a thousand cuts. In the past five years, this Morris county township's population has grown by 4,000 people, to 20,000. Many of the newcomers live in condominium town houses with names like Jade Mountain, Campagna and Rachel Gardens. One Georgian-style complex, Hunting Hills on Heritage Court, surrounds the Henry Doremus House, an 18th-century stone structure where Washington rested in 1780. A year later, French troops camped in an adjacent orchard now filled with a crop of new homes.
Fred Eckhardt, a former town mayor who has lived in and around Montville all his 69 years, remembers when much of the area was peach and apple orchards. "It was a beautiful place, very rural, but now it's just a lot of houses," Mr. Eckhardt said. 
Like many Highlands communities, Montville has been transformed by the opening of I-80 more than 20 years ago, and I-287, which was opened in 1993. Although the highways allowed residents to reach Manhattan in 30 minutes, more significantly it opened the door to the campus-style office complexes that have sprouted in formerly rural areas, fueling an even greater demand for housing. And the economic boom in the 1990's has accelerated that process. 
"Things that couldn't sell 10 years ago are going for astronomical prices," said John Rosellini, Montville's mayor. "These days, anything that's built sells instantly. The average new home sells for over a half- million dollars."
Even though I-80 was recently widened, rush-hour traffic jams have become a fact of life, and Montville's main roads are clogged in the morning and the late afternoon. The water supply, largely drawn from private wells, has reached its capacity. Its schools, prized for their academic excellence, are struggling to keep up with the influx of new students.
"We just can't live this way," Mr. Eckhardt said. 
Many of Montville's residents have also decided enough is enough. The township has the state's most aggressive land acquisition program, which voters have approved three times. Montville's open-space committee, which raises $1.3 million a year from homeowners, has bought 2,000 acres of land since 1990, much of it along the wooded ridge lines that define the municipality.
Deborah Nielson, chairwoman of the open space committee, said it was becoming increasingly difficult to buy land, which has soared to $200,000 an acre. "We have to compete with developers," Ms. Nielson said. "And frankly, there isn't much land left."
Some residents worry about the plans of a local developer, Anthony Pio Costa, who wants to an exclusive golf club on 390 acres he owns atop Waughaw Mountain. Montville officials have expressed concerned that a thirsty 18-hole golf course with 50 homes would deplete the town's aquifer. Environmentalists who dream of creating a greenway along the western edge of I-287 say the project would take away crucial habitat. 
But Mr. Pio Costa, who has lived on Waughaw Mountain for 25 years, says his Sky Top Country Club could not be more environmentally friendly. He said he would leave 90 percent of the site undeveloped, and his water experts have told him the town's underground water supply would be unaffected. He said he was frustrated by opposition to his project, which could have been twice as large under the current zoning.
"It's the same old theory," he said. "The last one in closes the door."
John Capozucca, who lives in nearby Bloomingdale, said he cringed each day as he drives past Montville on his way to his job in Parsippany, where he works as an editor of medical and scientific publications.
"One day you see the beautiful ridge lines, and he next day you can actually see the bulldozers destroying the land," said Mr. Capozucca, the unpaid chairman of the township's environmental commission. 
With 7,900 residents, Bloomingdale remains a bucolic outpost on the fringe of suburbia, although Mr. Capozucca fears for its future. Bloomingdale's residents recently approved an open-space tax, even though he and others are trying to halt the construction of 360 town houses on Federal Hill, a mountain that separates the town from I-287. The mile-square mountain, which is home to wild turkey, bears and raptors, was the site of the Revolutionary War's only attempted mutiny by Washington's troops.
"Our town looks like Wayne did 25 years ago, before all the farms got bought up and developed," he said. "I didn't move here to live in Wayne West."
The same kinds of sentiment can be heard all across the Highlands. Down in Hunterdon County, in Lebanon, Nick Corcodilos and a group of neighbors are resisting the Pulte Home Corporation's plan to build more than 900 houses a few yards from his rear deck. Mr. Corcodilos, 46, an executive recruiter who moved here five years ago, said he had already sold two Mercer County homes to escape a changing landscape. 
"People come here to escape sprawl only to have suburbia chase them out," said Mr. Corcodilos, as he trudged through the snow to show a visitor the proposed site of Windy Acres, with its spectacular, crumbling barn. "This project would really ruin any sense of living in the country."
Wilma Frey of the Highlands Coalition says 113 species of birds have been counted on the farm's 292 acres, and the threatened wood turtle has been found along its marshy fringes. Still, Mr. Corcodilos said he and other opponents were not opposed to development on the site; they just want it scaled down. To them, 145 units would be ideal.
"The land just can't support something this big," he said.
Jeff Meyer, director of land for Pulte's central New Jersey market, said the company had already reduced the project by 41 units, and pointed out that the site, adjacent to I-78, lay within an area that the state plan had designated as a development corridor.
The plan, currently being updated, seeks to encourage growth near existing infrastructure while restricting it in rural areas. The project, he said, would contain a mix of luxury housing, smaller homes for first-time buyers and 145 units that satisfy the state's mandate for affordable housing.
He said that most of the townships farther east, among them Mendham and Bernardsville, had become too expensive for middle-class families.
"This is one of the few developable sites left in the area," Mr. Meyer said. "It's a place where people want to live."
If the Highlands are to retain undisturbed expanses of forest, open fields and untainted aquifers, environmentalists say the government must make hard decisions and dictate where people can and cannot live. 
But turning the Highlands into a national park would seem doubtful during the tenure of George W. Bush, who has expressed displeasure over his predecessor's land conservation policies in the West. Still, Senator Torricelli sees hope, especially because Christie Whitman, as head of the Environmental Protection Agency, will presumably have his ear on such matters. With the greatest population density in the nation, New Jersey offers a compelling case for saving an area that is a two-hour drive for 20 million people -- or one in 12 Americans.
"Unlike Western lands, which are great distances from population centers, the Highlands are easily accessible to millions of people," he said. "I hope to make the case to President Bush that there should be prejudice shown toward New Jersey."
Environmentalists often draw parallels between national treasures like Yosemite and the Highlands. The only difference, they say, is that unlike the Highlands, Yosemite is hundreds of miles from the nation's most populous regions.
"You can't bike there from Hackensack," said Jeff Tittel, president of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club. "And we don't get our drinking water from Yosemite. If we lose the Highlands, we lose our drinking water."
Although Mr. Tittel would like to see the Highlands become federal parkland, he would be relieved if the area were given the kind of status that protects the Pine Barrens, a million acres of environmentally sensitive land where development is allowed but severely restricted. 
While he and other environmentalists acknowledge Governor Whitman's aggressive push for open space, they say she failed to show leadership on the Highlands. Many say they are still disappointed that she dismantled Jim Florio's Highlands task force soon after her election in 1993. Others say the new state plan, which designates the region as a special-resource area, is simply a policy document that lacks teeth. 
"Time," Mr. Tittel says, "is not working in the Highlands favor."
A resident of Ringwood, he said he had watched over the years as some of his most cherished hiking spots gave way to condominiums and shopping centers. He is also tired of fighting a never-ending onslaught of construction projects.
Some of them are defeated, others are not. Three times he and others have fought and defeated proposals that would have obliterated Tory Rock, a local geological and historic landmark in Passaic County. 
"For every parcel of land that gets saved, we lose another three or four," he said. "It's like the Janis Joplin song: "Every new development tears a little piece of my heart out."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS; 
A Good Heart but Bad Sense Haunted Whitman on Race

BYLINE:  By Iver Peterson; Iver Peterson reports from New Jersey for The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
Think life is unfair? Try politics. 
 No, not the unfairness of Jim McGreevey being slammed for wanting to make businesses in Woodbridge fly the American flag. If anything, the mayor deserved being slammed for not knowing that flag-waving was a crime punishable by extreme ridicule when running for governor. 
 Think instead about the fairness, or lack of it, in the fact that Governor Whitman, who wanted to show good faith and sound policy on matters of race, should be leaving office the same way she came in -- dogged by accusations of racism. 
The governor had her victory in 1993 spoiled when her campaign strategist, Ed Rollins, declared while intoxicated by the heady vapors of victory that her campaign had paid black ministers to keep their Democratically inclined parishioners home on Election Day. Mr. Rollins, suddenly sober, withdrew the boast, but the governor was on the defensive from the start.
Now her departure is similarly tainted by her connection with racial profiling. Local civil rights groups, the New Jersey Black and Latino Caucus and even the Rev. Al Sharpton, who votes in New York, are urging the Senate to reject her nomination to head the Environmental Protection Agency. The fact that profiling barely came up when she was questioned by a Senate panel last week does not mean that it has gone away in Trenton.
Yet between these two bookends, Mrs. Whitman tried to say and do the right thing on racial matters, only to get in trouble by failing to show good sense along with a good heart. She appointed more minorities to her official family than any previous governor, Democratic or Republican, including the state's first black Supreme Court justice, James H. Coleman, Jr., and the first black Secretary of State, DeForest Soaries Jr. She also put dozens of minority members in important administrative and regulatory bodies, including Herb Tate, chairman of the Board of Public Utilities and point man on the tricky business of electric utilities deregulation.
Moreover, Mrs. Whitman made frequent speeches defending her policies of affirmative action, albeit on the milder grounds of inclusiveness and diversity instead of on the ground favored by some, of justice and compensation. She developed programs to speed up brownfields development on former factory sites in the cities, and created an urban initiative that for the first time gave inner-city residents a voice in the placement and design of urban renewal projects.
Yet the Legislature's Black and Latino Caucus voted to oppose her nomination to head the environmental agency, and then the entire Democratic Caucus in the Assembly followed suit. Was that fair? The governor and her staff do not think so, but then, Mrs. Whitman's appointments and speeches do not tell the whole story. Matters of race call for a sensitive ear, not just a good heart.
The governor weathered the Rollins business, but before long she was back in hot water for pointing out that some black men boast about the number of illegitimate babies they father by different women. The term they used was "jewels in the crown," the governor said, stepping over the unwritten rule of politics that white people do not single out black behavior for criticism, although plenty of blacks, including Mr. Soaries, have made the same observations. Mrs. Whitman tried to turn the outcry that followed her statement into a lesson on tolerance by holding free screenings of "Schindler's List," a movie about the Holocaust, but was again criticized for mixing the war against the Jews with the oppression of blacks.
The complaint against the governor on racial profiling was not that she condoned it, but that she did not see the warnings that the problem was real. Members of minorities had for years been complaining that state troopers were picking on them before Mrs. Whitman took office in 1994, but the alarms should have been audible across the Delaware from the governor's office in 1996, when Superior Court Judge Robert Francis ruled that profiling was a fact of life and threw out evidence against several people arrested on the Turnpike. Yet the governor let her staff continue to deny the problem until April 1999, when the state finally admitted what many knew.
But the Black and Latino Caucus did not oppose Mrs. Whitman's nomination to the E.P.A. because of racial profiling, but because of the notorious picture -- later blown up into anti-Whitman posters -- of her frisking an innocent black youth during a police tour of Camden. Mrs. Whitman has always been a get-out-and-try-it governor, teaching fourth grade in dozens of schools and being photographed behind the wheel of the snowplow or in the cab of a locomotive or bouncing down a bike trail and paddling a kayak on the Delaware. But grinning nervously while patting down a black youth seemed to say to a lot of people that the governor lacked that little voice that says, "This doesn't look like a good idea."
As it happened, the racial profiling issue was raised only once during her confirmation hearing last Wednesday, and the Camden photo never was. Instead, the questions were mostly about corporate responsibility to environmental regulations. Yet minority rights are hardly absent from the world of environmental regulation as the people who work in the most polluted jobs and get stuck in the cheapest housing near cleanup sites have attested. So Mrs. Whitman may get a chance to prove that she has good sense to go with her good faith on matters of race.

PERSON: Thomas E. Gallagher 

HEADLINE: PRIVATE SECTOR; 
Taking a Seat at a Tougher Game

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
WITHIN minutes of Thomas E. Gallagher's appointment as chief executive of Park Place Entertainment last October, he called Merv Griffin, the former talk show host. It had been only two days since Mr. Gallagher's charismatic predecessor, Arthur M. Goldberg, had died. 
 Mr. Griffin, who lured Mr. Gallagher into the gambling business a decade earlier from a lucrative job at corporate law firm, picked up his phone and chuckled. "You mean," he told Mr. Gallagher, "the guy who I dragged kicking and screaming into the gaming business is going to run the biggest casino company in the world?" 
 Since then Mr. Gallagher, 56, a tall, even-tempered man with a penchant for renovating his house when he is not working, has immersed himself in the particulars of running 28 casinos, with brand names like Caesars, Bally's and Hilton, in six states and five countries. That is 28,000 hotel rooms, 57,000 employees and two million square feet of slot machines, blackjack tables and baccarat rooms.
He is a stark contrast to Mr. Goldberg, who wheeled and dealed his way through mergers that turned Bally's, a leaky frigate of a company, into the equivalent of an aircraft carrier. Mr. Gallagher now must maneuver the behemoth just as the boom times that enlarged its revenue and cash flow in the 1990's appear to be fading.
One of Mr. Gallagher's first and most unenviable tasks was to deliver the bad news about a company long favored on Wall Street. In December, he warned that fourth-quarter earnings, to be announced on Tuesday, would fall to zero, compared with analysts' forecasts of 13 cents a share. He also cautioned that a $365 million deal to sell the Las Vegas Hilton could fall apart, undercutting efforts to pay down Park Place's $5.3 billion debt. The deal collapsed last week.
But for Mr. Gallagher, the bad news was temporary -- and all in a day's work.
"Unfortunately, I got my feet wet in what turned out to be a tough quarter," he said in an interview at his Las Vegas office, which has a view of the Hilton but not the prime intersection of the Strip and Flamingo Road, where Park Place casinos occupy three corners. "This is a very strong, stable company." 
Park Place was spun off from Hilton Hotels in 1998, a few years after Hilton merged with Bally's, which Mr. Goldberg had turned into a cash machine. He then bought Grand Casinos and Caesars World. With his company looming over the industry, he opened the $110 million Wild Wild West, a kitschy Gold Rush-theme casino in Atlantic City, and the $780 million Paris casino-resort hotel in Las Vegas. 
Mr. Gallagher attributed the company's fourth-quarter problems to winter storms that blanketed Atlantic City and the Midwest and kept gamblers away on New Year's weekend. He acknowledged that profits were also hurt by competition in Mississippi and by some extraordinary luck for gamblers in Las Vegas.
But he has also moved pointedly to fix problems created in the Goldberg era. When it became clear that revenue had plunged last year at the Paris, Mr. Gallagher replaced its president. 
Stephen F. Bollenbach, the chairman of Hilton Hotels and Park Place, said he picked Mr. Gallagher to run the company because of his managerial skills. But Mr. Goldberg's death at 58 also allowed Mr. Bollenbach to install his own executive at Park Place. According to several executives, Mr. Bollenbach often clashed with Mr. Goldberg, who had wanted Mr. Bollenbach's job. 
Mr. Bollenbach played down reports of friction. "The company is now strategically complete," he said. "Its value in the future doesn't depend on transactions. It depends on operations. Gallagher is suited to that."
Mr. Gallagher's ability to parachute into a new situation is clear from his resume. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1969 and went to work for the Los Angeles-based law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. After serving as chief counsel for then-Senator John Tunney of California for two years, he opened Gibson's London office, the first of many jobs, he said, as the firm's "fireman." He then opened an office in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where he advised the Saudi royal family and American corporations. 
His start in gambling came in 1988, when a partner recommended him to Mr. Griffin, who had just bought the troubled Resorts International from Donald J. Trump. Mr. Gallagher eventually became chief executive of the Griffin Group, expanding its hotels and media and gambling operations, before selling Resorts in 1996 to Sun International.
Just as he was leaving Griffin, Mr. Bollenbach recruited him as general counsel for Hilton Hotels. From there, he was a natural for the Park Place job.
"Tom is an enormously quick study," said James P. Clark, a partner at Gibson. "He sees problems, he figures out solutions and he's not afraid to pull the trigger." 
Mr. Gallagher's real test may be yet to come, if an economic slump threatens Park Place.
"Gallagher faces an increasingly difficult marketplace," said Anthony Gerstein, a gambling analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "We don't see a catalyst for the same level of growth in revenue and earnings that investors have become accustomed to in the last two years." 
He may have an ace in the company's strength in Atlantic City, which predominantly attracts day-trippers and is less vulnerable to a downturn than the expensive theme-park casinos of Las Vegas. Analysts expect revenue to grow in Atlantic City, where Park Place owns some of the most profitable casinos -- Caesars, the Atlantic City Hilton, Wild Wild West and Bally's Park Place. 
Mr. Gallagher said Park Place's geographic diversity enables it to handle weakness in any one area. One word continually crops up in his conversation about the company: discipline. 
"We're not going to scramble around acquiring for the sake of acquiring," he said. "The challenge is to be smart and disciplined in how we spend our money."
That discipline also applies to Mr. Gallagher's own financial habits. Although Mr. Griffin convinced him years ago that gambling was a growth business, Mr. Gallagher said he did not gamble. He acknowledged, though, that his wife and in-laws were "serious nickel slot players."

METRO-NORTH RIDERSHIP INCREASES

BYLINE:  By Elsa Brenner 

 BODY:
 Metro-North Railroad reported that overall ridership increased 5 percent last year, rising to 70.3 million rides, the most for any year in the rail line's 17-year history. 
The gain was not in suburban commuters going to Manhattan, but in overall riders traveling within Metro-North's service area north of New York City. A strong economy, reduced crime in Manhattan and renovations at Grand Central Terminal have helped attract more riders, Marjorie Anders, a Metro-North spokeswoman, said. "It means more people are trying the railroad as a viable alternative to auto travel within the county," she said. Elsa Brenner

HEADLINE: THE RIGHT THING; 
An Offer You Can't Refuse. Well, Maybe.

BYLINE:  By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN; Jeffrey L. Seglin teaches at Emerson College in Boston and is the author of "The Good, the Bad, and Your Business" (John Wiley & Sons). His column on business ethics appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail may be sent to: righthng@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
A GOOD employee is not only hard to find but also hard to keep. With the nation's unemployment rate holding steady at 4 percent -- the lowest in more than 30 years -- it is no wonder that many employers are having a difficult time tracking down and retaining top talent. But as the offers and counteroffers fly, an ethical question arises: Once you accept a job offer, is it ethical to go back on your word because someone else makes you a better deal?
 Clearly, courting employees and making offers can be time-consuming and expensive. Anecdotal evidence from the Society for Human Resource Management, a trade group based in Alexandria, Va., suggests that employers need, on average, 50 days to fill a vacant position. The average cost of the process is $4,588, according to the Saratoga Institute, a human resources research and consulting firm in Santa Clara, Calif., although many top executive recruiting firms charge a fee of one-third of the candidate's total annual financial package. It is no wonder that an employer becomes upset when a dream candidate gets away. 
 It's perfectly reasonable for anyone to want to shop around for a new job from time to time, even if only to establish a sense of worth in the marketplace. "People do go on interviews for jobs they don't really plan on taking, but then wind up taking them," said Amanda Bennett, 48, a former Atlanta bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, who did precisely that before signing on two years ago as managing editor of The Oregonian in Portland. In general, she likened such experiences to that of someone who goes on a blind date and ends up marrying the match, "quite to the amazement of both."
When people merely window-shop for positions, and ultimately stay put, executive recruiters miss out on hefty rewards. Still, they accept such practices. "There's nothing wrong with poking your head outside and taking a look," said Janet Tweed, chief executive of Gilbert Tweed Associates, an executive search firm in Manhattan. "But once you acquiesce and accept the offer, ethically you should take that job."
Everyone understands that during negotiations for a new job, neither side is totally forthcoming. It is a courting ritual, and either would be ill-advised to lay himself bare, warts and all, for the other to see. But, said Laura Nash, a business ethics consultant and a senior research fellow at the Harvard Business School, "they cross the line to unethical when they deliberately misstate the situation to deceive the other side."
It is not uncommon, however, for someone to accept a job offer, then receive a counteroffer from another company that is also courting him. But what should he do if his current boss walks into his office and smacks down a better offer? 
Ms. Tweed says that succumbing to such an enticement once you have made a commitment to go elsewhere is fraught with peril. The current employer, though successful in keeping you, may see your job hunt as a terrible breach of loyalty. "In the 20 years I've been doing this, I've worked for any number of companies where at the moment a counteroffer was made and accepted, the employer gave us the assignment to find someone to replace that person," she said.
It could be a no-win situation. Once a candidate goes back on his word of acceptance, he may well hurt his chances of ever working for the company that made the offer. The main reason isn't the time and expense of the courtship -- or the lost productivity of having held a crucial position open for so long, only to have to reopen the search. After a candidate steps over that line and says "yes," he has given his word, he has made a commitment, and he is ethically bound to take the position. Such breaches don't sit right and are not soon forgotten.
Of course, anyone can have a change of heart from time to time. But the time for reflection and rejection should come before accepting the job. It's the fair way to treat the company making the offer and the right way for any prospective employee to act.

HEADLINE: PRELUDES; 
On the Dole, Without the Guilt

BYLINE:  By ABBY ELLIN; Abby Ellin is a Manhattan writer. Her column on starting out in the world of money appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: preludes@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IT is a Thursday afternoon, and I have spent the better part of the day trying to get through to the New York State Department of Labor. I have just joined 5.7 million of my fellow Americans -- 4 percent of the working-age population -- who are unemployed.
 And, yes, I'll say it: I would love nothing more than to sit at home and receive a weekly government check for $405, the maximum for New York State. 
 My most recent ex-boyfriend, however, views unemployment insurance as "charity." 
"If I'm collecting, it means I choose not to work," he said. "If I choose not to work, it means I need to provide for myself. That's not the government's responsibility." 
His point is well taken, but I disagree (which could explain the "ex" before boyfriend). I see unemployment checks as a governmental reprieve. 
I'm not alone in my sentiments. The dot-com shakeout is affecting not only Internet companies, but also investment bankers, venture capitalists, public relations executives and business editors and writers, to name a few. Many of them are also calling their unemployment offices.
Should they be embarrassed about their situations? Should they take jobs they hate instead of money from the government? 
None of this would have ever made a difference to me as a longtime freelance writer, since independent contractors are not eligible for unemployment -- though we are more than welcome to pay the same taxes as our fully employed peers. (To be fair, we don't pay the unemployment tax.) 
But last June, I also took a senior writing position at a start-up business and lifestyle magazine, Fuse, which offered benefits that freelancers don't usually receive, like steady paychecks and health care insurance. At the end of November, after we had just published our first issue, management in San Francisco pulled the plug. The reasons had to do with the plummeting stock of the parent company, volatile markets in general and cost-cutting. 
I wasn't especially surprised; my seven colleagues weren't, either. But we were sad, not to mention annoyed. How could we have no control over our futures? How could they kill the magazine after one issue, just as we were getting into our groove? Then financial realities set in. I, for one, had never made as much money freelancing as I did as a full-time employee. I had become used to regular deposits in my bank account the second Friday of each month. Now what? 
The answer flashed before me: I'd collect unemployment! I set about finding the phone number. 
Not all of my former colleagues were as excited. "I never thought I was the type of person who'd take unemployment -- there was always a stigma attached," said the magazine's managing editor, Elizabeth Wallace, 29. 
She had no intention of applying for unemployment benefits until friends -- actors, stylists, other freelance types -- persuaded her. "They told me the government takes taxes out of paychecks for a reason, that there was money with my name on it set aside for me," she said. "I still wasn't convinced, but when I realized that I had no income, I decided to call."
Indeed, the stigma of collecting is slowly evaporating. The Labor Department would like to take some of the credit for this.
"We're completely focused on putting people back to work, in occupations that are in demand, and matching them with their job skills," said Betsy McCormack, a Labor Department spokeswoman in Albany. "The unemployment rate is so low you can get a job in any industry you want to work in." 
The department has also eliminated those mind-numbing in-person visits in favor of telephone filings. Simply punch in your vitals -- Social Security number, country of citizenship -- and then wait to speak with a real person (generally the most maddening part of the transaction, because they are usually swamped, which means you have to keep calling). Not everyone is eligible, of course: You must have worked at least two of the last four calendar quarters. You are permitted to collect benefits for a maximum of 26 weeks, but after 13 weeks you are required to accept a job if it pays at least 80 percent of the wages you made before being laid off. 
All in all, not a bad way to earn "fun and enjoyment checks," as Ann Sisco, a film editor in Los Angeles, called them. Ms. Sisco, 36, is often unemployed, as are most of her friends in the entertainment industry. "Everybody in L.A. collects in between jobs, even people in TV production whose shows are on hiatus. My friends and I call it the '$240 club,' because the most you can collect in a week is $240. No one looks down on it. That's the way it is." 
IN other industries, unemployment is not as routine. In 1998, after a restructuring, Keishi MatsumUra was laid off from his economic development job in Phoenix. It was a time when jobs were plentiful. "I felt like such a loser," applying for unemployment benefits, Mr. MatsumUra said. "But I needed the money, so I took it," even though it was only a fraction of his usual earnings. 
Mr. MatsumUra, 30, now an independent consultant, acknowledged that he would probably feel less embarrassed if he were collecting today, because more people of his age range and education level are in the same boat. Still, he said, he would rather have his old job back.
As for me, I'm not sure if I'm eligible for unemployment benefits, because I might not have worked enough hours in the quarters leading up to my claim; I filed only recently. Until I know for sure, I'll keep placing those weekly calls to the Labor Department to see what happens. 
Ms. Wallace, who will soon collect weekly unemployment checks, now looks at these benefits this way: "I need it; I have bills to pay. I feel like I've worked for it." She paused. "It's frustrating, because I can't figure out if this makes me more of a Democrat or a Republican."
Neither. It makes her a citizen.

DORIE GORDON has two children, and sometimes one or the other might be a bit cranky when she comes home to her apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. But her cocker spaniel, Dudley, is all tail wags and gaiety. 
 "To come home to a smiling dog, that's worth everything," she said. "I'd definitely, definitely spend as much money as I could to keep him happy." 
 To Nestle S.A., Ms. Gordon's tender emotions -- shared, as they are, with millions of other pet owners -- are worth $10.3 billion. That's the amount the Swiss food behemoth paid last week for the Ralston Purina Company. By combining forces -- specifically the Alpo, Purina, Friskies and Meow Mix brands, among others -- Nestle stands to dominate one of the world's fastest-growing food businesses: high-end vittles for pets.
In recent years, global sales of pet food have increased 4 to 5 percent a year, compared with 2 to 3 percent growth in the total food industry. Pet food in the United States outsells fruit juice, pasta and baby food. Total pet care expenditures, which also include veterinary care and other things, amount to $28.5 billion -- up from $17 billion in 1994 -- and now exceed the value of all the toys sold in the United States.
And the arrows all seem to point up. The Pet Food Institute reports that the number of dogs has steadily increased to 58.5 million in 1999 from 53.8 million in 1981, while the number of cats shot up from 44.6 million to 72.6 million. The American Pet Products Manufacturers Association said 62 percent of the population, or 63 million households, own pets, up from 53 million in 1994.
There are many explanations. More people are living alone, more work at home and incomes have steadily risen. But the most basic reason is that 84 percent of dog and cat owners consider their pets their children, according to a survey last year by the American Animal Hospital Association.
"A dog is as much a part of American family life today as baseball and apple pie," exulted Dennis Sprung, vice president of the American Kennel Club.
Perhaps more so. "In a way, pets are less complicated than other members of the family, because their love remains unconditional throughout their entire life with you," said Alan Manevitz, a psychiatrist at the Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City.
The slathering of love on beloved creatures is a far cry from the days when Snoopy and his brethren were banished to backyard doghouses. Not only has Rover moved inside, he can now go to day care; be covered by health insurance or join an H.M.O.; and get organ transplants or room service in expensive hotels. Doggie perfume? Sure. Might darling Socks have a taste for venison cat food? No problem.
All of which is nirvana for pet food makers. As companies offer ever-tastier and more nutritious products (or so they claim), consumers -- often feeling guilty because they fear they spend too little time with their loved ones -- line up to pay more. The product mix keeps being upgraded along with profit margins, in contrast to the trend in human foods toward cheaper generic brands. 
Another plus, says John M. McMillan, an analyst with Prudential Securities, is that pets, unlike their owners, aren't eating more and more meals away from home. "Thankfully, we're not taking our dogs to McDonald's," he said. After a pause, he added, "Yet."
The pet food industry began in the late 1800's when a London butcher tossed a failed batch of tea biscuits to an appreciative pooch, and gathered steam when Milk Bone Dog Biscuits appeared in the United States in 1908. Perhaps the industry's supreme accomplishment was convincing pet owners that the table scraps on which untold generations of household beasts had dined were dangerously unhealthy.
The pitch has since become more sophisticated, running the narrow but proven spectrum from warm and fuzzy to cute. An ad for Friskies cat food, a Nestle product, shows a tabby cat chowing down next to a tiger doing the same thing. The caption reads: "He's a Tiger at Heart. Feed Him Like One."
From the industry's perspective, the greatest thing about the appetite for healthier pet cuisine is that it is eminently exportable. Duane Exedahl, president of the Pet Food Institute, said foreign markets from Mexico to South America to the Far East offer the chance for double-digit sales in coming years. "There is an emerging middle class in many part of the world, and pet ownership kind of reflects that," he said.
Take Singapore, where retail sales of pet food have doubled over the past five years, according to the Department of Agriculture. A mix of lamb and rice is moving particularly well, because it is said to be good for doggie dermatitis in Singapore's steamy climate.
Though some think a recession could burst the pet food balloon, Mr. McMillan believes the need of so many to express tangible, edible love for their animals is unstoppable. The survey of the animal hospital group showed that 83 percent of respondents would risk their lives for their pet.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
If Earnings Depend On Investing, Watch Out

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
UNTIL 10 days ago, Yahoo had been in a class almost by itself -- a high-profile Internet concern that had figured out how to turn a profit for its shareholders. But on Jan. 10, after the market had closed, it reported that even though revenue rose 53 percent, to $311 million, in the fourth quarter of 2000 it would incur a net loss of almost $100 million for the period. By contrast, Yahoo earned $38 million in the fourth quarter of 1999.
 With the new economy slumping even more than the old one, Yahoo is facing, as it acknowledged, a tough year. But troubles in its core operations were not at the root of its fourth-quarter loss. The chief culprit was a $163 million write-down on the value of investments it had made in other companies. 
 As Yahoo goes, so go Apple Computer and Gateway, as well as older-economy companies like J. P. Morgan Chase and Nordstrom. And the list goes on. Halfway into the earnings announcement season, it is clear that the rapid slowdown in the economy is wreaking havoc on companies' results. 
But something else is putting pressure on corporate earnings today -- and to a degree never before seen -- that has little to do with the economy and even less to do with corporate operations. Yes, the economy is slowing, but that alone is not responsible for the double-digit declines in net income that so many companies are reporting. Also at work is the declining stock market that across industries is having a decidedly dampening effect on companies' earnings.
That the fortunes of the stock market can have an impact on corporate earnings is a relatively new phenomenon and a direct result of the decade-long bull market in stocks. 
As Yahoo shows. Like many other technology companies, it spent hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years investing in smaller concerns that it hoped would expand its reach, round out its business and increase its earnings. For a while, that strategy paid off, revving up its financial performance. The strategy also worked at companies like Gateway, Intel and Microsoft. 
Now, however, with the market for Internet stocks in the cellar, these investments are no longer producing gains; in many cases, like Yahoo's, they are damaging companies' results. 
But corporate investment was just one of the earnings-enhancement strategies tried by companies. Drawing from a well of creativity, they turned the market's climb to their advantage by offering millions of stock options as a substitute for paying higher wages. They also sold put options in their own stock to generate income, and they recorded gains that resulted from the rising value of assets held in the pension plans of their employees. 
In every case, reported earnings looked better than they would have if they had been based only on company operations. And each one worked only when stock prices were rising. 
"The rising stock market was a great boon to reported corporate earnings, and all of these things were buried so you had to look awfully hard to find them," said H. Bradlee Perry, former chairman of David L. Babson & Company, a money management firm, who has been an investment professional since 1952. "In past bull markets, these sources of earnings enhancement really were not available. So all these things sort of snuck up on people."
Now, however, stock prices are no longer galloping. And as many veteran money managers point out, shareholders are suddenly learning just how much of their companies' high-powered financial performance came from the bull market. At the same time, they are getting a whiff of how much their companies' earnings may be hurt in coming months if stock prices continue to stagnate.
"What every one of those things did was overstate earnings," said William Fleckenstein, president of Fleckenstein Capital, a money management firm in Seattle. "Even without economic weakness, the earnings are going down. What's going to be shocking is how fast and how sharply the earnings collapse."
CONTRIBUTING to the earnings shortfalls, of course, is the first significantly slowing economy in almost a decade. As the speed of that slowdown sinks in, Wall Street economists have been steadily paring back their forecasts for earnings this year at hundreds of American corporations. 
But there is another reason that this earnings season will look grim. With managers less able to pad results with stock-market related gains, earnings will suffer by comparison to last year, when rising stock prices were contributing handsomely to profits.
With investors tripping over themselves to get into the stock market in recent years, it is not surprising that corporate executives felt the urge to join the crowd. Intel was perhaps the biggest and most aggressive corporate investor. In its third quarter, which ended last September, Intel's portfolio was valued at $5.86 billion and produced investment and other income of $966 million.
How quickly those profits can evaporate. When Intel announced its fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, it said that the value of its portfolio had fallen to $3.7 billion and that it had produced $800 million in gains and interest income. More ominous, Intel said it expected gains and interest income to fall to $180 million in the first quarter of 2001, adding that it forecast "no net gains from the sale of equity investments" in the coming quarter.
Aside from making investments to propel earnings, many technology companies made a habit of lending to smaller companies, their customers, that needed money to buy equipment. Nowhere was this practice, known as vendor financing, more prevalent than in the telecommunications industry. Companies like Lucent Technologies, Nortel Networks and Qualcomm lent billions to their customers.
All went well until the stock market swooned last year and the corporate bond market froze -- leaving many of the fledgling companies that had received the financing unable to raise the additional cash they needed to keep their businesses operating. Now, with many of these companies experiencing severe financial difficulties, the companies that made the loans are being forced to write them off as bad debt.
CONSIDER the news last week from Globalstar, a company founded by Loral Space and Communications and Qualcomm to design and operate a satellite-based wireless telecommunications system. Globalstar, which has yet to make a profit, announced on Tuesday that it was suspending indefinitely the principal and interest payments on all of its debt, including its credit line and vendor financing agreements.
According to the company's regulatory filing for the third quarter, its loans from vendors totaled $765 million. Some $528 million, or 69 percent, was owed to Qualcomm. Globalstar also had a $250 million credit line with a bank that was guaranteed by other companies, including Qualcomm to the tune of $22 million. 
When Globalstar made its announcement, Qualcomm played it down, saying it would result in only a "small negative impact" to operating earnings in its quarter ended on Dec. 31. Qualcomm's stock barely budged, falling just 1 percent that day, even though the company owns 9.5 percent of Globalstar. Shares of Globalstar fell 48 percent.
Cecilia Wagner Ricci, professor of finance at Montclair State University in Upper Montclair, N.J., has studied vendor financing among telecommunications companies. "There are several problems for companies doing a lot of vendor financing," she said. "First, they are going to see increasing bad debt among their customers. At the same time, the companies they sell to are going to be spending less, because they will not have the money. I think the effect on earnings is going to be absolutely terrible." 
Making matters worse, Ms. Ricci said, many companies do not divulge how much they have lent to customers, leaving investors in the dark as to the depth of the potential problems caused by the practice. For example, while Lucent has stated how much credit it has extended to customers, some $8 billion, Cisco Systems has not. A Cisco spokeswoman said its vendor financing is very conservative. 
Rising stock prices have also plumped up corporate earnings through gains in assets held in employee pension funds. Accounting rules allow companies whose pension assets exceed their liabilities to feed the investment gains into their profits. The practice is commonplace. Although those gains certainly reflect the able administration of pension fund assets, the profits are less reliable than income from continuing operations. With stock markets at record volatility, those profits could quickly become losses. 
Thanks to the roaring stock market, pension gains became a significant contributor to profits at some companies. Northrop Grumman is a prime example. Roughly half of its earnings last year were a result of a strong stock market -- the company has 62 percent of its pension assets invested in stocks.
But last month, the company warned investors that diminished pension gains could slice $50 million, or 7.6 percent, from earnings expected by analysts in 2001. 
If taking pension gains to enhance earnings became popular in corporate America, so did using stock options as a form of employee compensation. In corporate accounts, options are "free," not deducted as an expense. By cutting the wage costs of a company, options make earnings look better than they would if it had to pay cash to employees. 
But stock options work as a form of pay only when a company's shares are rising. Now that many stocks have been crushed, many employee options are under water -- below the strike price that makes them valuable -- and some workers are beginning to demand fewer options and more cash. So corporate expenses will rise, and earnings will diminish.
Microsoft was one of the largest beneficiaries of the use of stock options in recent years. In 1999, according to Pat McConnell, an analyst at Bear, Stearns, if Microsoft had taken the $1.13 billion worth of stock options it dispensed as a business expense, the company's earnings would have come in 8 percent lower.
With the company's stock trading at about half its peak value last year, roughly 40 percent of the options that Microsoft has granted and remain outstanding are under water, based upon their weighted average prices. Not surprisingly, Microsoft executives recently warned that they might incur higher wage costs in coming years.
THERE was another type of option that helped companies bolster results: put options on their own stocks that they sold to private investors. Through such deals, companies like Dell Computer, Microsoft and Intel were essentially betting that their stock prices would not fall below a certain level within a specified time. The investors who bought the options from these concerns, for example, paid for the right to sell the shares back to the issuer at the specified price.
As these companies' share prices raced higher in the 1990's, sales of put options generated cash and never required the exchange of a single share of stock. Now, however, many stocks are below the so-called strike price of the put options, meaning that Dell and other companies may have to pay to buy back the shares covered by the puts at a higher-than-market price. In some cases, these purchases will require hard-earned cash that could otherwise be put back into the company's operations.
Consider the obligations that Dell faces because of its put option sales last year. Dell pocketed $59 million in proceeds from option sales. But if the company's stock remains at its current depressed price of $25.63 until its put options expire by September of this year, the company will have to pay $1.06 billion if the options are exercised at the average price of the range noted in the company's filings. That figure is 64 percent of Dell's net income last year. 
Baruch Lev, an accounting professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, said: "I really don't understand why would they speculate in the stock market. What you want to do is have built-in stabilizers if the market goes down that would protect you automatically, not make it worse."
MR. LEV said there was another bull-market practice that is no longer effective but that may leave companies struggling for future earnings growth: corporations' use of their own high-priced stock to make expensive acquisitions.
Between May 1999 and June 2000,Cisco Systems used its shares to make acquisitions totaling $15 billion. The purchases, a way for Cisco to get technologies needed to round out its business, had the additional impact of increasing sales and, it is hoped, future earnings. 
But with Cisco's stock down 51 percent from its peak last March, this currency is no longer as valuable. "Where is the future growth coming from now that they don't have this currency anymore?" Mr. Lev asked. If the company has to pay cash for its purchases, earnings will suffer. And if Cisco chooses to generate earnings growth from internal research, that will be more costly as well.
Without all of these financial devices, many companies may have a lot of explaining to do as they announce earnings this year.
"People thought the party was going to go on forever, and now it's over and they don't know what they're going to do," said Ms. Ricci, the professor. "Remember in high school when you went to a dance and they kept the lights down really low and when they turned the lights on at the end of the night, nobody looked as good as when the lights were low? This is what it reminds me of. Because the lights are definitely on."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: John Davenport; 
Evergreen Capital Growth Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
FOR John Davenport, running a mutual fund has had its ups and downs. His $540 million Evergreen Capital Growth fund lagged behind its large-capitalization value stock group by two percentage points in 1999, then soared past it in 2000 by more than 12 points. 
"I don't think most people realize how extreme the 1999 and 2000 markets were," Mr. Davenport said from his office in Richmond, Va., overlooking whitewater rafts bobbing down the James River. "I think the goal from here on out is not to take dramatic stands, but to grind out a return that's above the S.& P. 500 without taking a lot of risk." 
 Despite the volatility, he has kept his balance. The fund returned 15.9 percent a year, on average, for the three years ended Jan. 18, compared with 13.8 percent for the large-cap value group and 17.0 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Morningstar Inc. 
 In 1999, Mr. Davenport sold off many of his technology holdings too soon, while they were still rising. But in 2000, when technology stocks collapsed, his fund had little exposure to them. 
Mr. Davenport, 37, works with four analysts to pick 35 or so blue-chip stocks for the fund. "We're classic growth-at-a-reasonable-price managers," he said. "If you look at our portfolio, you'll recognize most of the names."
The team starts with the 500 biggest of the Russell 1000 index of the largest United States companies, then eliminates about 200 cyclical, slow-growing classic value stocks like those of automobile and commodities businesses. Mr. Davenport's team also eliminates what he calls "extremely highly valued hyper-growth names, like Yahoo, that trade at 100-plus times earnings."
About 150 companies make the cut; he and the analysts closely follow about 30 stocks each, searching for a portfolio of companies that they believe can collectively sustain annual earnings growth of at least 15 percent over the next three to five years. (They expect that rate to be about double that of the S.& P. 500 for the same period.)
He expects the chosen stocks to flourish. "The Federal Reserve's very aggressive reversal is likely to provide some support for the financial markets," Mr. Davenport said of its decision on Jan. 3 to cut interest rates, "But there's no way the Fed can turn the economy around in the near term. Because earnings are likely to continue to be broadly disappointing, particularly in the first half of 2001, the markets are going to favor companies with high-quality earnings and franchise stability."
To find these companies, the team uses tools like the "DuPont model," which forecasts profitability by examining growth in sales, operating margins and capital investment. The team gathers more data during company visits, then projects each company's earnings for three to five years.
Next, Mr. Davenport and the analysts decide how much they should pay for a stock. They consider long-term earnings forecasts and the stock's trading history, compared with the records of others in its industry and the S.& P. 500.
Over all, they want the average price-to-earnings multiple of the portfolio companies to be in line with the S.& P. 500 over the last five years. Mr. Davenport starts trimming a position as a stock approaches 120 percent of his target valuation, and he generally dumps shares after several disappointing quarterly earnings reports. Because the managers shift the weightings of portfolio stocks as valuations change, annual turnover averages 60 percent. 
Mr. Davenport recently bought more shares of Tyco International, calling it "one of the most under-followed and misunderstood global businesses because it has emerged so rapidly over the last eight years."
A series of acquisitions, including AMP in 1998, has made Tyco the pre-eminent player in the electronic connector business, he said. "It's one of the most stable and attractive areas of technology," he said, "because it increases as technology spending increases but doesn't have the volatility of other electronic components." Tyco also has big businesses in disposable health care products, like syringes, and in alarms and sprinklers for the fire protection and security industries, he added.
Over all, he predicts earnings growth of 22 percent, annualized, over three years. He originally bought shares in July 1994 at an average of $6; they now trade at $61.13. He figures that the stock could hit $80 in 12 months.
Another favorite is the First Data Corporation, a transaction processor based in Atlanta that owns Western Union. He calls Western Union's domestic business a "mature, stable cash cow" but expects its international business to grow 50 percent a year over the next three years. First Data is also a huge processor of credit card transactions.
"It's a play on the ongoing transition from paper money and checks to electronic transactions," he said, adding that he saw much room for growth.
He bought shares in March 1999 at an average of $42; the stock now trades at $55.63. His 12-month price target is $65. 
MR. DAVENPORT bought shares of Newell Rubbermaid, formerly Newell, at $30 in December 1999, after they tumbled because of problems with Newell's acquisition of Rubbermaid earlier that year. The company, based in Freeport, Ill., owns a stable of household products, including Sanford writing instruments.
Difficulties in integrating the Rubbermaid acquisition were compounded by rising prices of resins used to produce plastic, he said. A new chief executive, Joseph Galli, took over this month, and resin prices are dropping, Mr. Davenport said, adding, "I believe that for the most part, they are finally realizing the benefits" of the Rubbermaid deal. 
Expecting earnings to grow 11 percent a year for the next three years, he predicts that the stock, now at $27.13, will reach $31 within 12 months.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 28, 2001

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about investing in the Evergreen Capital Growth fund misstated the three-year annualized return through Jan. 18 for both the fund and its category, large-capitalization value funds. The figures were also incorrect in the adjoining chart. The fund returned 16.7 percent, not 15.9, and the category returned 8.9 percent, not 13.8. 
The article also misstated the three-year annualized return of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index over the same period. It was 13.4 percent, not 17.0.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
The Parties Are Over. So, What's Next?

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
IN this opening weekend of the Bush administration, the parlous economy makes the inauguration less festive. Stock market shock mutes the music, and bad news about the economy gets more attention these days than good news. Rarely in past slowdowns have there been so many warnings that a recession is just ahead, if not already upon us.
 Not that the Bush team minds the cold water. Somber recession talk on Inauguration Day makes it easier to blame the departing Democrats if a recession does develop this year. Paul O'Neill, the designated Treasury secretary, raised the "R" word at his Senate confirmation hearing last week. "There is no doubt that we are experiencing a slowdown," he said, and a few minutes later spoke of the "lingering uncertainty about whether this is an inventory correction or the possible unfolding of a recession." 
 The case for recession is strong. Manufacturing is already contracting, and companies in every industry are shedding workers. The stock market, sapped of its exuberance, is sapping consumers in turn. Consumer confidence plunged in December and is falling again in January, according to the University of Michigan's consumer surveys. The downsizing announcements and the stock market are making Americans nervous about their jobs, income and wealth -- and, as a result, more cautious about spending, says Richard T. Curtin, director of the Michigan surveys.
Reflecting the spreading pessimism, the nation's most prominent forecasters are regularly scaling back their estimates of economic growth in 2001. And companies everywhere, having stockpiled merchandise last fall in anticipation of strong sales, find that they cannot sell all they had ordered. What happens next to the economy may hang on what these companies do. If they stop ordering while they sell off some of their enlarged inventories, recession will surely follow.
So far, they have not stopped ordering, although there has indeed been a "slowdown in order rates," as Mr. O'Neill put it last week. For all their nervousness, people are still borrowing and buying. Retail sales over the Christmas season may not have shown the great improvement everyone had expected and yearned for, but sales were not weaker than the good Christmas of 1999. When summer finally comes, the worst of the slowdown may have passed -- without a recession.
The odds are against such a favorable outcome. But there is just enough good news to keep hope alive. Stock prices, for example, appear to have stabilized -- for the moment -- after the Federal Reserve's unexpected slash in interest rates Jan. 3. Despite the job-cut announcements, the unemployment rate is still low. Home construction, a pillar of the economy, was strong in December. And falling rates have set off a new round of mortgage refinancing, which means families are borrowing more against their homes without raising their monthly mortgage payments. The extra money becomes available for spending.
THEN there is capital spending. The 1990's drew much of their prosperity from the huge investments that corporate America made in machinery and equipment. And now the best hope of avoiding a recession is more strong investment. That does not normally happen in hard times. Businesses, like consumers, cut back. But the investment boom came mainly from spending for computers and software as companies pushed to keep up with advances in information technology. Now the hope is that the same drive will keep investment strong, despite the slowdown.
Dale W. Jorgenson, a Harvard economist and the president of the American Economic Association, offered just such an outlook this month in an address at the association's annual conference in New Orleans. As semiconductors double in speed every 18 months and fall in cost, companies hasten to upgrade their equipment, he said. And that investment will stave off a recession.
Maybe. Faster chips stimulate investment, but mostly when a new product emerges to take advantage of the speed. The advent of spreadsheets drew an investment rush. So did desktop publishing. "We always need new software to justify faster chips," said William Dudley, director of domestic economic research at Goldman Sachs.
The chips are still doubling in speed every 18 months. Moore's Law still holds, and any number of executives swear they will keep spending through a slowdown just to catch up with the new information technology already out there. That might be enough to stave off a recession, even if new software fails to materialize to stimulate investment. 
So hold the pessimism, and the optimism. Whatever the politics, the slowdown so far is still a slowdown.

HEADLINE: Favorite Feasts: Good Brands Hit by Bad Luck 

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
VULTURE investing may be an obscure financial discipline, but the bottom-fishing capitalists who engage in it come into contact with a surprising number of consumer brand-name companies. And they typically know which ones are in trouble long before it becomes apparent to the average person.
 Vultures are fond of companies with powerful brands because their assets are easier to value and, if necessary, to sell off. Over the last decade, vulture investors have feasted on the carcasses of the parent companies of the Vail ski resort; retailers like Barneys, Bloomingdale's and Macy's; and Continental Airlines, to name a few. In recent months, the roster of troubled companies has grown to include Polaroid, Trans World Airlines, Vlasic Foods and Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts -- and it is on the rise. 
 Vulture capitalists often have an easy time spotting a company in trouble. One tipoff occurs when stocks are trading at $5 or less. More important, they monitor the less-visible world of junk bonds or bank loans, watching for debt that trades at severe discounts.
Trouble usually turns up first in the bank loan market. "Banks get information from companies on a weekly basis, so often they are the first to sell out," said Marc Lasry, senior managing director at Amroc Investments, a brokerage firm that specializes in trading the bank loans of distressed companies.
Consider Xerox, whose stock fell to $3.75 in December and now is at less than $8. That price implies concern among stockholders about the company's future. But the prospects may be even worse than that price suggests. Xerox has a $7 billion revolving line of credit that trades at just 60 cents on the dollar, according to Amroc. If Xerox falters, bank claims must be satisfied before stockholders get anything, so the deep discount at which the loan trades implies a chance that shareholders could be wiped out.
The range of companies with securities at low levels is a bad sign for the economy, Mr. Lasry said: "Things are worse than people believe. In the distressed debt market we see things as they really are."

From the Grave Dancer, Rhyme and Contrary Reason

BYLINE:  By Riva D. Atlas 

 BODY:
Friends of the Chicago investor Sam Zell know not to expect the ordinary season's-greetings card at the end of the year. For six years now, a favored few have received an unusual gift from him -- an elaborate, sculptured music box meant to illustrate some theme in the markets that reflects the contrarian bent of Mr. 
Zell, whose taste for troubled or bankrupt companies earned him the nickname "Grave Dancer."
 This year's music box, which bears the legend "No Free Lunch," plays Mr. Zell's version of "What Kind of Fool Am I?" 
 The lyrics include: "What fools these mortals be, dreams of new economy. Consuming capital insatiably. How high grows a tree?" 
Mr. Zell's staff began work on the music boxes soon after Thanksgiving; they were mailed this month. Writing the lyrics, typically parodies of popular tunes, can be a challenge, said Peter Szollosi, Mr. Zell's creative director. "Often, Wall Street words are difficult to sing," he said. Riva D.

Seller's Market for Spokesmen

BYLINE:  By Julie Dunn 

 BODY:
Corporate America may be downsizing again, but it is still looking for a few good spokesmen and spokeswomen. 
More than a few, actually.
 The Council of Public Relations Firms, a New York-based trade association, says the industry is expected to grow at double-digit rates for the next three years. "Public relations is traditionally seen as recession-proof," said Sarah Drennan, vice president of the council. Even companies cutting jobs, she said, "are still demanding public relations services." 
 Ms. Drennan said there was such demand that employers must look for nontraditional public relations candidates with transferable skills. "You need to find new sources of talent or we will begin to cannibalize off each other," she said.

Looking Beyond All the Bad News

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
Earnings results poured in last week and, for the most part, companies met expectations that had been sharply lowered by the weakening economy. 
 There were some noticeable disappointments, like Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing and J. P. Morgan Chase, as well future profit warnings from the bellwether companies Intel and Caterpillar. 
 For the most part, though, investors shook off the bad news, buoyed by good results from I.B.M. and Citigroup and the expectation that the Federal Reserve would move to cut rates in the wake of a report of the biggest decline in manufacturing activity in more than two years and signs of moderating inflation. 
 The major stock indexes finished up for the week. The Nasdaq was at 2,770.38, up 143.88 points or 5.5 percent. The S. & P. 500 ended at 1,342.54, up 24.22 points or 1.8 percent. The Dow industrials also advanced, ending at 10,587.59, up 62.21 points, or 0.6 percent.
 Treasury prices rallied early in the week as investors fled to quality in the face of a looming default by two giant California utilities. By Friday, those concerns had eased, but the yield on the 10-year Treasury still stood at 5.16 percent, down from 5.24 percent a week earlier. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

HEADLINE: Unions Hit Lowest Point In 6 Decades 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
The percentage of American workers belonging to unions fell last year to 13.5 percent, its lowest point in six decades.
 In releasing its survey of union membership last week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics also found that the number of union members declined by 200,000 last year to 16.3 million, a discouraging development for the labor movement at a time it is straining to reverse the decline. 
 Economists offered several explanations for the decline, including retirements by union members, layoffs of many unionized workers because of foreign competition and the failure of unions to organize enough additional members to offset such losses.
"There are still many large economic forces acting against labor's holding on to the numbers it has," said Tom Juravich, director of the labor studies center at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. 
Last year's membership decline was a blow to union leaders after they had boasted of an apparent turnaround in 1999. That year union membership climbed by 240,000, its largest increase in more than a decade. In addition, the percentage of workers in unions remained steady at 13.9 percent, giving unions hope that they had arrested a steady decline in that percentage.
Despite small jumps and declines from year to year, the overall unionization rate has fallen compared with recent decades. Last year's 13.5 percent unionization rate was down from 20 percent in 1983 and a peak of 35 percent in the 1950's. 
For unions, one embarrassing aspect of the report was that the membership among private-sector workers fell to 9 percent, down from 9.4 percent in 1999. That has left unions with strong bargaining leverage in a handful of industries, including aircraft, steel and autos. 
In contrast, membership among government workers rose to 37.5 percent from 37.3 percent. About 9.1 million of the nation's union members work in the private sector, while 7.1 million are government workers.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. sought to put the best face on last year's slide, noting that membership was still up 150,000 from three years ago. Leaders of the labor federation said much of the drop stemmed from the loss of 160,000 manufacturing jobs in 2,000.
The decline came after John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., had prodded unions to invest more money and personnel toward organizing more members. Last year, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. said, unions organized 400,000 new members, compared with less than 100,000 in 1995, the year Mr. Sweeney became the federation's president.
But Mr. Sweeney said that for unions to add members on a net basis, after accounting for retirements and layoffs, they needed to recruit 500,000 to one million new members each year.
Leo Troy, professor of labor economics at Rutgers University, voiced skepticism that American unions would ever substantially increase their numbers. Professor Troy noted that the most rapid job growth was in fields like financial services and high technology where unions have little presence. He added that globalization was causing layoffs and even plants closings at many unionized operations, which often have higher wage and benefit costs than foreign competitors. 
"What happened last year is a continuation of a long-term decline in the unionization rate," Professor Troy said. "I don't think unions can turn it around. We've had the most favorable pro-union administration in office since President Carter, and maybe since President Johnson, and the unionization rate has declined steadily. And now there will be a new administration that's not going to be very supportive of unions."
Union officials were more upbeat. Several labor leaders asserted that unions organized fewer members last year because they threw so much money, energy and manpower into electoral politics. These leaders said labor would step up its organizing efforts, partly because the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has set organizing goals for its member unions.
Labor leaders said they had grown increasingly successful in organizing low-paid workers, like janitors and home health aides, as well as high-paid professionals, including doctors and psychologists. But such gains have been offset by the steady erosion of employment in labor's core industries, like autos and steel. 
"What's clear is that to stop any future decline organizing needs to stay absolutely on the front burner," Professor Juravich said. "There is no substitute for organizing."

HEADLINE: Searching for the Right Words For Saying 'Gotcha' in Turkey 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
You need a scorecard to keep track of the nearly two dozen corruption investigations unfolding in Turkey these days. Fortunately, the country's law enforcement officials conveniently coin names for each new inquiry. 
 Some are just punchy, like Hurricane, Matador, Parachute and Storm. Others are related to the subject. And where American newspapers often attach the suffix gate to major investigations, the Turkish authorities prefer Operation in front of another word. 
 So there is Operation Harvest, an investigation of fictitious exports of agriculture products, and Operation Buffalo, an inquiry into allegations that frozen buffalo was sold as beef. Operation Dirty Curtain involves possible fraud in the government theater system. 
Operation Whale is, fittingly, the biggest inquiry to date. So far, 85 people have been arrested, including government officials, in an alleged scheme to receive tax credits by falsifying export records. 
The people who think up the names seem to be working overtime these days because Turkish authorities are engaged in a big anticorruption drive.
About 400 people have been detained as part of 21 corruption investigations going on across the country, according to a tally this week in the Turkish Daily News.
The biggest impact has come from Operation Hurricane, which revolves around allegations of corruption in the banking industry. News reports and fears about an imminent industry collapse contributed to a financial crisis that sent the Istanbul stock market plunging last November and required an emergency bailout from the International Monetary Fund. 
During the last week, Operation White Energy has become a headline staple. It reportedly focuses on officials in the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources who may have been bribed to approve contracts. 
The investigation led to a dispute between politicians and the military over who initiated it and how far it will reach into the ministry. It also threatens to cast a pall over construction of a natural gas pipeline between Russia and Turkey. 
There seems to be a consensus among the authorities that an investigation needs to reach a certain prominence before it earns a name. For instance, allegations this week that a new police chief blew the whistle on colleagues who take bribes is only known as Bribery Bag because the scope is unclear. 
The bag part of the name comes from a story that when the chief arrived at his new job, a subordinate put a bag of money on his desk and suggested that he take his share. 
"The names come from the police and the prosecutors and sooner or later you become fascinated with them," said Yavuz Baydar, a Turkish newspaper columnist and television host.
The names are a mixed blessing to Turkey's good-government types. As the Federal Bureau of Investigation and American military know, people pay attention to something with a catchy name, like Operation Desert Storm. Along the same line, scandals with names increase public awareness of corruption.
"One of our goals is to increase awareness of corruption," said Ozdem Sanberk, director of the Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation. "If you name the investigations, of course people talk about it. It stays in their memories." 
But many of those caught up in the high-profile investigations are stigmatized without ever facing formal charges. 
Still, the foundation Mr. Sanberk runs is in the midst of an analysis of corruption and when the results of interviews with 3,000 people nationwide are unveiled in March, he would love to earn a nickname. Maybe something like Operation Clean Sweep.

Power Blackouts Afflict California

BYLINE:  By James Sterngold

 BODY:
 After weeks of near misses, it happened: on Wednesday and Thursday, power utilities had to switch off the lights temporarily across a broad swath of central and northern California because they simply ran out of electricity. The state's utilities have been struggling with power shortages, which grew more severe because of some generator shutdowns and a financial crisis caused by soaring prices on the overheated wholesale market. 
 Several million people and businesses lost power for about an hour at a time and had to figure out how to cope in the unpredictable environment. But no puzzle was greater than the one faced by the governor and the legislature. A bill was passed that made the state a major buyer of power; this will temporarily help the utilities, but the lawmakers did not craft a comprehensive solution that will cover billions of dollars in losses and, most important, keep the lights on in the nation's largest state.

HEADLINE: Harlem Renaissance 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I take issue with John Tierney's Jan. 16 Big City column, "Politicians Stand in Way of Harlem." The groundwork for Harlem's revival was laid by collaborations between community-based nonprofit developers, for-profit developers, New York City, nonprofit housing intermediaries, private lenders, foundations, block associations and tenants' associations. 
 These developments transformed neighborhoods, creating an environment where moderate-income rental and homeownership developments could be successfully marketed.
More recently, brownstone development programs have resulted in an increase in homeownership opportunities. Harlem's public officials understand that this community needs housing that is affordable. If this goal is not addressed, New York's economic growth may suffer.

This year, the library chose to focus on labor issues, including one that is current for many residents of Westchester and Putnam Counties: the working conditions of Hispanic day laborers.
 "It's a huge economic justice issue," said Stephen Kent, a Garrison resident and library trustee who organized the event as part of a series on civil rights history in the Hudson Valley. "These people come into Garrison to landscape our yards and renovate our houses, but they don't live here. And many of them still lack the most basic rights and workplace protections." 
 Last Sunday night, some 75 guests attended a potluck dinner, listened to a Latin band called Los Afortunatos and a lecture on labor history, and watched a new documentary on the circumstances of local immigrant workers produced by Voices From History, a videography team based in Peekskill.
The event's title, "Looking Backward: Civil Rights and Labor Issues 2000-1864," comes from an 1888 utopian novel by Edward Bellamy titled "Looking Backward," Mr. Kent said. In the novel, a man is transported forward to the year 2000, when labor struggles and economic inequality have been eliminated. 
The featured speaker was David Montgomery, a professor emeritus of history at Yale University, who described a little-known strike at the West Point Foundry in Cold Spring in 1864. 
The strike began on March 10, 1864, when 150 unskilled workers began marching through the plant, demanding raises. The plant usually had 300 to 400 workers, but under the pressure of the Civil War, which was then raging in Virginia, 1,100 workers were working overtime to make cannons for the Union army. 
Federal troops were quickly called to quell the strike, and some workers may have been killed, Mr. Montgomery said.
The strike was partly inspired by William Sylvis, a labor leader who began touring the Hudson Valley after the New York City conscription riots of 1863. The strike and others like it eventually helped lead to better working conditions and an eight-hour work day, Mr. Montgomery said.
A few years later, Mr. Sylvis became one of the first labor leaders to urge white workers to make common cause with blacks, Mr. Montgomery added.
Civil rights have come a long way since then, but Americans are still a long way from the utopia Edward Bellamy imagined, Mr. Kent told the crowd.
Besides their poor living conditions, many local day laborers have been cheated of their wages, said David Loretan, a member of the Hispanic Employees Labor Project at St. Anne's Parish in Ossining who attended the library event. The project, founded by the Rev. Edward Byrne, is one of the groups featured in the new documentary, which was shown at the library for the first time last Sunday night and is titled "The Newest Immigrants." 
In one case, five workers who helped build a house in Putnam Valley were cheated out of $7,000, Mr. Loretan said. In another, a laborer fell and broke his back, and the homeowner is refusing to take any responsibility. The Labor Project has tried to help many of these workers, and in some cases has taken employers to court to recoup their wages, he added. 
The legacy of Dr. King is relevant to these workers, Mr. Loretan said, because their civil rights have been violated. 
"The employers don't treat them as human beings," he said. "They take advantage of the fact that they can't speak English, they don't know the law and they don't know their rights."

Living the Edited Life: The Materialism of Scaling Back

BYLINE:  By RUTH LA FERLA 

 BODY:
IRENE ALBRIGHT longs for a life of stylish, self-imposed austerity. "I've always looked yearningly at movies and magazines that show you a room beautifully lit, with nothing in it but three magazines on a black coffee table," she said plaintively. "I've looked at those pictures a thousand times," added Ms. Albright, the owner of Imelda's Closet, a rental showroom clotted, as its name suggests, with handbags, suits and shoes. "But each time I've had to ask myself, 'God, how do people live like that?' "
 Her desire for a pared-down refuge and life to match mirrors that of many of her contemporaries, women, and not a few men, whose vision of Eden is replete with material comforts, yet so rigorously edited that it seems to contain almost nothing at all. They are the subscribers to new women's magazines like Real Simple and O: The Oprah Magazine, which encourage readers to carve out breathing room in hectic lives. They are consumers of products promising to lift one's mood and soothe the soul, like aromatic candles and feng shui fountains. And they are the devoted readers of the popular authors Elaine St. James ("Simplify Your Life") and Sarah Ban Breathnach ("Simple Abundance"), who advocate clearing life's clutter in order to leave space for reflection and other uplifting pursuits. 
 At a time when many Americans feel queasy about their wealth and simultaneously fearful lest it vanish in an impending recession, the idea of a streamlined life is seductive indeed. A recent Yankelovich Monitor survey of 2,500 Americans reported that 76 percent "are increasingly looking for a way of simplifying their lives." 
Ministering to them is an army of publishers, admen and merchants who know a promising market when they see one. A recent ad for Dockers pants, for example, shows a mother and child, the mother's eyes shut in blissful reverie. "Wouldn't it be nice," reads the copy "if we could all live like children? No calendars, no meetings, no bills?" The California Closet Company's most recent ad features a woman wearing a monastically plain-looking long skirt and sweater, posed in front of a closet emptied of all but the company's organizational systems. 
Sound familiar? It ought to, to anyone who remembers the Gap ads of the early 1990's, with their semi-celebrity models wearing pocket T-shirts and other wardrobe basics. The austere fashions of that time, often in black or white, coincided with the styles of an earlier economic downturn, and a desire to repent for the conspicuous consumption of the 1980's. Then, too, a simplicity movement sprang up, drawing inspiration from a 1993 book, "Voluntary Simplicity," and a periodical, the Tightwad Gazette, and fueled by the downsizing of hundreds of thousands of white-collar jobs. True believers took new positions at half their old salaries, sold big homes to move into rental apartments and traded down from Audis to Nissan Sentras. 
But there's a difference between the simplicity then and the simplicity now. Scaling back today takes a lot more purchasing power. Fostering balance and serenity requires the acquisition of a flood of goods. Spawned, though it was, by earlier waves of antimaterialism, the new simplicity is a call to guilt-free consumption, a movement that is material to its core. 
"Simplicity is the hot buzzword," said Irma Zandl, the president of the Zandl Group, a New York consumer research firm, who views the notion of getting back to basics as little more than a sales pitch. "Marketers," she said, are pushing the concept "that to be more simple you have to buy more stuff." 
"People are looking for balance in their lives," she added. "But the bottom line is that they're looking in a way that does not involve a significant lifestyle sacrifice." 
In the winter 2000-1 issue of SoHo Style, Deepak Chopra, the celebrity promoter of self-enlightenment, contributes an essay, "In Praise of Indulgence." O, the phenomenally successful creation of Oprah Winfrey (it has sold as many as three million copies a month since its debut in April), counsels scaling back and getting in touch with one's authentic self, but remains all the while a vociferous cheerleader for the lush life. 
In the January issue, sandwiched between uplifting features like "Are You Listening to Your Life?" in which subjects boast of ditching flourishing careers to find their bliss, there are catalogue-style editorial pages promoting indulgent purchases like Mont Blanc fountain pens ($350) and cashmere sweaters ($350 to $425). The magazine is a hymn to psychic self-invention -- and not less, a "look book" lavish with Ms. Winfrey's favorite things. They include an Hermes teacup ($135) because, as Ms. Winfrey croons in the caption, "I've discovered tea tastes better when it's sipped from a pretty cup." Elsewhere readers are urged to "jump start their spirit" by jettisoning unproductive habits -- and products. But it's hard to miss the implication that starting life fresh requires an array of fresh purchases.
"In this country, the longstanding solution to getting what you want is to buy something," said J. Walker Smith, president of Yankelovich Partners, a market research firm. "With such a tradition, it stands to reason that if what you want is simplicity, the knee-jerk response is, Find something to buy." 
A harsh statement, perhaps, but one with which Judy Jennings-Moritz, a Northern California real estate broker, would not disagree. Late last year, Ms. Jennings-Moritz, 61, and her husband traded the rambling house they had lived in for a more modest dwelling, to relieve themselves of financial pressure. Their deliberate downsizing left Ms. Jennings-Moritz feeling elated but somewhat incomplete. "I had the peace of mind I have prayed about for years," she recalled, revealing, however, that no sooner had she moved than she purchased the four-poster bed and plush carpet of her dreams. "I will be buying other furniture, too, so in a way I will be expanding," she acknowledged gaily. "But to me, simplifying is getting what I want, not compromising with something that just came to me."
More skeptical people than she have likewise succumbed to the blandishments of streamlining. Tony Peet is a freelance writer who left San Francisco several years ago for the calm of Pacific Grove, near Monterey. A former Madison Avenue advertising executive, Mr. Peet, 43, scoffs at the new simplicity's marketers, a highly diverse group that includes Ms. Winfrey, International Coffees and Bliss, the spa and purveyor of beauty balms and potions. 
"What these people are really doing is selling spiritual materialism," Mr. Peet chided, confiding in the next breath that he, too, had occasionally taken the bait. "My own first step toward simplifying was to buy a Ford Explorer," he said with a rueful laugh. More recently, he enlisted Christy Best, a professional organizer with a Web site called Clutterbug.net, to excavate his closet and bring some calm to his life. He shrugged off the folly of having paid Ms. Best to do a job he could just as easily have done himself. During a similar round of soul searching and streamlining several years ago, he found himself in California's Big Sur at the Esalen Institute, the fabled center for self-actualization. At the time, "we all wanted the pure, unencumbered life," he said of his fellow seekers, adding, "so we stowed our stuff in storage lockers." 
The publishers of O, Real Simple and Hush, a Hearst publication subsidized in part by California Closets, have embraced simplicity as a multipurpose mantra, one that subsumes both the latest wave of Asian-tinged spirituality and more recent Western strains of antimaterialism. A far less loaded word than spirit or soul, simplicity "is sort of like a Rorschach," said Carrie Tuhy, the managing editor of Real Simple. "It means many things to many people."
The magazine editors interpret simplicity as "an expensive stripping away of detail," said Paul H. Ray, the co-author with Sherry Ruth Anderson of "The Cultural Creatives" (Harmony Books, 2000), about people who value social justice and the environment more than getting and spending. "It's 'simplicity' in the way that the Bauhaus was about simplicity -- in other words, only an arbitrary style."
Ms. Tuhy of Real Simple sees no contradiction in promoting the kind of simplicity that can be bought. "We're not preaching a monastic life," she said. "We're talking about the edited life." The magazine's mission is to "help readers pare down in order to get to the things they really want to do," she continued. "One of those things, we presume, is to be good to yourself," she added. 
To judge from the proliferating temptations featured by the editors, from weightlifting gloves to cashmere blankets to pricey Richart chocolates, being "good to yourself" is code for self-indulgence. "But that's O.K.," Ms. Tuhy said brightly. "This is not sackcloth and ashes time. This is enlightenment living."
Her argument speaks to Ms. Albright, the fashion showroom owner. A move last month forced her to winnow her possessions to a few essentials that could be shoehorned into an 800-square-foot space. "I'm living in three little boxes and that's liberating," she said. "Now, I have time for myself." 
But she has also found time to purchase a gleaming glass-topped dining table and sisal rug. She confides she has her eye on a large flat-screen television and an even larger glass-topped dining table. "I hope I can stick with the basics," she said, gazing at rooms that to her mind plainly cried out for embellishment. "It's just there's no telling how long this mood will last."

HEADLINE: GRASS-ROOTS BUSINESS; 
Sublime Vegetables For a Demanding Niche

BYLINE:  By JOEL KOTKIN; Joel Kotkin is a senior fellow at the Davenport Institute for Public Policy at Pepperdine University. His column on the Main Street economy appears on the third Sunday of each month. E-mail may be sent to grassrts@nytimes.com.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
SOME entrepreneurs dream of ruling Wall Street while others imagine themselves as Hollywood moguls or as the next Bill Gates. But for Harbhajan Singh, founder of Samra Produce here, the quest has been to become America's "king of okra." 
 Raised and educated in India's fertile Punjab region, Mr. Singh, 41, came to Southern California in 1985 as a trained agronomist with a master's degree in economics. As a member of the agricultural Jat caste, it was natural for him to think about growing and selling food. He saw California as ideal for growing the kind of Indian specialties -- okra, eggplant, bitter melon, beans -- that he ate as a child. 
 "In Punjab, you can grow anything," Mr. Singh said. "It's like California."
Once he arrived, and with $500 borrowed from his family, Mr. Singh started buying vegetables from wholesalers and selling them to local Indian markets and restaurants from the back of a pickup truck. In the mid-1990's, he opened a 1,400-square-foot stall at the 7th Street Produce Market in downtown Los Angeles and started a small farm in Delano, in the Central Valley. But he found that because of the climate, the region grew only inferior versions of the okra and other produce traditionally used in South Asian kitchens.
Mr. Singh said he lost that farm, falling heavily into debt, but he eventually found his ideal spot in a hot, dry farming area near Indio, southeast of Palm Springs. Relying largely on credit from his customers, he slowly built Samra into a substantial business. His 150-acre farm grows okra -- a vegetable with a subtle, eggplant-like taste that also makes it popular in Southern dishes like gumbo -- as well as chiles, opo squash and daikon radishes. He also buys from other local farmers who produce vegetables suitable for the growing Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi immigrant market.
THAT area grows the best okra in the world," Mr. Singh asserted, sitting in his spacious warehouse in the sprawling produce market. As the business has grown, his space has grown to 18,000 square feet. 
Being the best, he said, has always been his obsession. By producing only the highest-quality produce and delivering it quickly, he could lead a market that was largely ignored by others. 
"At first, no one would listen to me," said Mr. Singh, who arrives at the market at 5 a.m. daily and usually stays past 4 p.m. "People ignored me. But when I delivered the best quality, they got confidence. Now they see I really am the king of okra."
Virtually a one-man operation in the mid-1990's, Mr. Singh's business now employs eight people. Last year, it had sales of more than $10 million, five times the 1998 total. He sells his produce -- some of it delivered in a company-owned 18-wheeler -- as far away as Vancouver, British Columbia; Toronto; Chicago; the New York region; and London, where there are large Indian populations.
His success reflects a broader reality in the nation's produce market. As ethnic populations -- and interest in ethnic food -- grow across the country, so do the opportunities for entrepreneurs like Mr. Singh, said Richard Meruelo, president of the Alameda Produce Market, which owns the 300,000-square-foot 7th Street market, built in 1919.
Mr. Meruelo also owns 600,000 square feet of space in the adjacent area and plans an additional half-million by 2002. He said that most of his clients were not the big produce companies that had been in Los Angeles for generations, but rather Asians and Latinos who ran small businesses with 400 to 20,000 square feet of space and sales of less than $2 million annually. They concentrate on traditional ethnic foods -- Thai, Korean, Chinese, Mexican, Salvadoran, Caribbean -- that are consumed by immigrants and an increasing percentage of the native-born population. 
"The growth in this business comes primarily from Asians and Hispanics who know what sells well in their own communities," said Mr. Mereulo, himself the son of Cuban immigrants. "The key is to specialize in something."
Supermarket chains like Lucky's and Ralphs, he said, "know how to sell an orange to the mass market, but these guys sell a special product that is not mainstream."
Immigration from India and elsewhere in South Asia has been rising steadily over the last 40 years; the number of South Asians in the United States and Canada is now estimated at 1.4 million to 6 million, concentrated in several large urban areas.
Wholesalers like Anuj Patel, who owns Darpan Vegetables in Maspeth, Queens, say that until they met Mr. Singh, it was difficult to acquire a consistent supply of high-quality okra and other vegetables used in Indian kitchens. "People can tell the difference," said Mr. Patel, an Indian immigrant, who says his business has tripled since two years ago, when he began buying produce from Mr. Singh. "The radishes he grows, the okra, it's like from back home. You have other growers but the quality is not there."
Such concern about vegetables may seem a bit unusual to many Americans. But Mira Advani, a leading Indian food critic in Los Angeles, pointed out that many South Asians are vegetarian. Quality takes on a greater significance because produce makes up the bulk of their diet -- the base for sauces, stews and soups, she said.
"Indians are very picky about their vegetables, their okra and their eggplant," said Ms. Advani, a native of India. "Their okra has to be the best -- small and firm. Nothing else will do."
Such demands suit Mr.Singh well. Now the self-proclaimed "king of okra" hopes to enlarge his kingdom: he plans to start a farm next year in Mexico and eventually to expand to major supermarkets.
"It's basically a tough business, and you win by using your mind and technique," he said, with evident pride. "People don't understand my kind of product. You have to know every detail. Okra and other vegetables are not boring. Okra is not just okra. It is very special."

Jerking The Other Knee

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Remember the knee-jerk liberals? Washington used to be full of people who viewed greedy businessmen as the root of all evil, who thought that a new government program was the answer to every problem. Some of them wielded influence in the early Clinton administration. But after the defeat of the health care plan, they were sent into exile. Bill Clinton became a pragmatist, someone who appreciated the virtues of the market without deifying it and understood the limits of government without demonizing it.
 Out with the old knee-jerks, in with the new. The new guys in town are knee-jerk conservatives; they view too much government as the root of all evil, believe that what's good for big business is always good for America and think that the answer to every problem is to cut taxes and allow more pollution. 
 In a way, the controversy over John Ashcroft has actually obscured the picture. With all eyes focused on the startling prospect that a champion of the religious right will become attorney general, George W. Bush's hard line on other issues has not been fully appreciated. 
One of those issues is, of course, the question of whether we ought to have a huge tax cut tilted toward the affluent. Many pundits thought that Mr. Bush would scale back his tax plan. Not a chance; instead, his people have only intensified their push, insisting that the tax cut is needed to prevent a recession.
To his credit, the nominee for treasury secretary has been a less than enthusiastic team player. In his Senate hearing, Paul O'Neill came remarkably close to damning the whole sales pitch with faint praise. "I'm not going to make a huge case that this is the investment we need to make sure we don't go into a recession," he conceded. "But I don't know why we wouldn't want a tax cut now. It wouldn't hurt." The good news here is not that Mr. O'Neill knows that his boss is making a bogus argument; Mr. Bush's inner circle knows that too. It is that the new treasury chief has some scruples about saying things that he knows to be untrue. I wonder how long that will last. 
Meanwhile, the clear and present danger to the economy is not the putative recession, but the power crisis in California. Mr. Bush made his first remarks on the subject last week, and they were revealing.
First, he rejected summarily the idea that the federal government might impose a temporary cap on wholesale electricity prices. One wouldn't have expected him to endorse such a cap just yet. Although there is actually a very good case for a price cap as an emergency measure -- under current circumstances it would probably lead to increased production -- that case takes some explaining. But it is a bit surprising that Mr. Bush would so thoroughly foreclose his options, especially when one bears in mind the political embarrassment that the profits from those soaring prices go in large part to generating companies based in, yes, Texas. 
Even more surprising was Mr. Bush's decision to use the occasion of the Western power crisis mainly as an opportunity to criticize environmental regulations, declare that when it comes to restoring salmon he won't give a dam, and call for oil drilling in wildlife refuges. It's true that federal (not state) air-quality rules are among the factors limiting power production in California. But they are not central to the crisis, and Alaskan oil has nothing at all to do with it. One can only conclude that just as Mr. Bush sees the economic slowdown as an opportunity to sell tax cuts, he sees the power crisis as an opportunity to sell weakened environmental protection.
There will soon be other economic tests for the new administration. How, for example, will it deal with the prospect of a series of airline mergers -- mergers that will further reduce competition in an industry where monopoly pricing is already a big problem? Somehow I have a feeling that I know the answer.
So in case you imagined that given the fact that the other guy got half a million more votes something bipartisan might be about to happen, forget it. Even before taking office Mr. Bush has made a number of policy decisions, and on not one of them has he deviated an inch from a knee-jerk conservative position. Were you expecting something different?

HEADLINE: A Cliche-Free First 100 Days 

BYLINE:  By William F. Buckley Jr.; William F. Buckley Jr., editor-at-large of National Review, is author of the forthcoming "Elvis in the Morning."

 BODY:
George W. Bush is president of all the people, as he does not tire of reminding us, but he is also leader of the Republican Party and custodian of its prospects in the future.
 Clearly, Mr. Bush felt the pull of cliches, the most frequently reiterated of them, in the days before his inauguration, this one about all the people, and earlier, the one about compassionate conservatism. His task in the 100 days ahead is to make his way around these cliches, because he is not likely to make any progress in fulfilling these sentiments. Thomas Aquinas explained how it is that God cannot make two and two equal other than four, and President Bush is fated to discover this. 
 What he can seek to do is make the losers smile through their tribulation, and this is not inconceivable, because ideological deprivation can be anesthetized by material benefits. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. didn't wage a very blary campaign in 2000 protesting free trade and Nafta because unemployment at less than 4 percent gets in the way of ululation.
President Bush needs concretely to appeal to American conservatives, who put him in the White House. To do this is in part a rhetorical challenge, in part a call to achievement.
On the matter of taxation, he needs quickly to rescue the question from the utilitarian hole it was stuffed into by his treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, who pondered exclusively, in his confirmation hearing, the question of the economic impact of lowered taxes. Conservatives will want to hear from Mr. Bush that there is a moral problem in the government's withdrawing from taxpayers' pockets more than is required by a conservative estimate of the government's obligations. He must avoid the endless arguments about whom to benefit, whom to deprive. This is accomplished only by a call to evenhanded reductions, on the order of the Kemp-Roth approach 20 years ago. He can speedily recommend a 3 percent tax decrease down the line, a modest figure, the uniform application of which would help in restoring conservative philosophical confidence.
On the matter of abortion, Mr. Bush might profitably startle both polarities by recommending to Congress a freeze on any federal action, while appealing to the governors of 50 states to conduct plebiscites soliciting community sentiment on modifications, if any, on absolute, mother-exclusive rights. Multiple claims -- those of the mother, the unborn, the father, the community -- invite multiple approaches. The president could note the preemptive passage, in l990, by the Connecticut Legislature of a bill assuring abortion rights in the event of a repeal of Roe v. Wade. Abraham Lincoln, after all, endorsed the Missouri Compromise permitting the continuation of slavery but barring its export into uncontaminated territories: precisely a political compromise on a moral issue.
Mr. Bush will find the growing church-state polarization most challenging to his good nature. He cannot, of course, reveal what is probably foremost on his mind, which is the ideological makeup of the Supreme Court. He has pledged that there should be no litmus test for membership in the court, but to remain true to this pledge would lead him to choose only candidates of the sort of philosophical impalpability that Justice David Souter once exhibited.
Mr. Bush can take comfort in the absence of any pending call for federal legislation that bears directly on the church-state question. The president's obligation will then be to reiterate his own position about the rights to practice religion and the desirability of doing so. He can ask the attorney general to file amicus curiae briefs defending, in federal courts, initiatives authorizing public funds for parents who elect to send their children to nonpublic and religious schools. On this issue, President Bush will need to be emphatic, and therefore divisive. But he can study the presidency of Ronald Reagan, who, on many questions, managed to make his point, and even occasionally to prevail, without inducing mutinous dissent.
On the matter of relations with minority groups, Mr. Bush will find it hard to increase disfavor for the G.O.P. among African-Americans, who voted overwhelmingly against him. He can do little more on this front than to take every opportunity to acclaim the progress made by minorities in the past 30 years on such indices as education and minority representation in legislatures and the courts. He might attempt, in his amiable way, to ask members of the Congressional Black Caucus to show how the president can demonstrate his concern for all Americans.
As party leader, he can encourage black political dissenters to press upon the black community the credentials of aspirant, conservative-minded, black leaders. The trouble with pointing to Gen. Colin Powell's appointment as secretary of state as an example of the kind of opportunities the G.O.P. can offer to minorities is that General Powell is not thought of primarily in terms of his race.
There is some political condescension out there in the assessment of Mr. Bush. It is based on the progenitive launch of his career. If Abraham Lincoln had had a son who contended for and won political power, he'd have had the same problem, even as John Quincy Adams did. George II can satisfy his conservative constituency by reaffirming the best in the blood line and improving on it where he can -- God, subject to the restraints of the First Amendment, willing.

HEADLINE: Taking Power, With People's Blessing 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

 BODY:
Like nearly everyone in the Philippines, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo slips into reverent tones when talking about Corazon C. Aquino, the heroine of the 1986 uprising known as people power.
 "She is a role model to me," Mrs. Arroyo said in an interview in Manila last October. "She ousted a dictator in a peaceful manner." 
 Yesterday, Mrs. Arroyo toppled another Philippine leader, Joseph Estrada, to become the second woman to be president of this politically turbulent country. While Mr. Estrada's supposed crimes are penny ante compared with the epic larceny of Ferdinand E. Marcos, the uprising against Mr. Estrada has turned Mrs. Arroyo into a symbol of healing, much as Mrs. Aquino was.
But that is where the similarities end. Far from being thrust into her historic role by tragic happenstance, Mrs. Arroyo planned her ascension to the presidential palace with discipline and foresight.
Mrs. Arroyo, 53, was one of several cabinet officials to abandon Mr. Estrada after he became engulfed in a corruption scandal last fall. She resigned as social welfare secretary but remained vice president, which kept her in line for the presidency. While not openly calling for his resignation, she quickly unified the opposition to Mr. Estrada around herself.
"My role is to be leader of the united opposition," she said at the time. "It is a more modest role. We don't want a revolution."
In fact, Mrs. Arroyo assembled a shadow government during the three months of political upheaval. When the military withdrew its support of Mr. Estrada on Friday, it seemed not only proper but inevitable that the defense secretary and armed forces chief would stand behind the 5-foot-1-inch vice president.
Certainly, she will be a stark contrast to Mr. Estrada, the hard-living former movie actor who reveled in his popularity among the poor. An economist trained at Georgetown University, Mrs. Arroyo is the daughter of Diosdado Macapagal, who was the president of the Philippines from 1961 to 1965.
At Georgetown, she became friends with a classmate, Bill Clinton, whom she still visits on trips to Washington. Mrs. Arroyo had settled into a career as an academic before she entered government in 1986 as the under secretary of trade in the Aquino administration. She was elected to the Senate in 1992 and the vice presidency in 1998, forging an alliance with Mr. Estrada.
The two made an odd pair. Mr. Estrada is shambling and plain-spoken while Mrs. Arroyo is neatly groomed and tightly controlled -- a politician who never gives a two-word answer where one word will do.
Like Mrs. Arroyo, her husband, Mike, is the scion of one of the Philippines' elite families. The couple, who live in one of Manila's best neighborhoods, have three children.
In her speech after being sworn in, President Arroyo drew a contrast between herself and Mr. Estrada, saying she would "promote a work ethic and a dignified lifestyle."
"The presidency is not a position to be enjoyed," she declared. "It is a position where one must work very hard."
Whether diligence alone will endear Mrs. Arroyo to the Philippine people is not clear. Her popularity ratings hover above 70 percent, but analysts say she lacks the affection among poor voters that until recently sustained Mr. Estrada.
"Gloria has always been popular as long as there was no competition," said Karina Constantino-David, a sociologist who served in the cabinet with her. "Whether she can convert that popularity into loyalty is another question."
Perhaps the most immediate test for Mrs. Arroyo will be the economy. Her first appointment on Saturday was of a new finance secretary, Alberto Romulo, who served as budget secretary under President Aquino. She said her top priority would be to eradicate poverty in the Philippines.
Analysts said Mrs. Arroyo was also determined to win back the confidence of foreign investors, which had been badly shaken by the metastasizing corruption scandal. As a senator, Mrs. Arroyo helped draft the legislation that enabled the Philippines to join the World Trade Organization.
Still, at the Edsa Shrine in Manila where thousands gathered to protest last week, the focus was so much on getting rid of Mr. Estrada that the demonstrators had given little thought to Mrs. Arroyo. "We're fed up with all politicians," said Kathy Sage, 15. "My God, how they rip off the Philippines."
Mrs. Arroyo is not immune to some of the criticisms leveled at Mr. Estrada. Her family has had close ties with Bong Pineda, a reputed leader of illegal gambling rings. She said she has no involvement in the kind of rackets from which Mr. Estrada is accused of skimming $8 million in kickbacks.
Indeed, Mrs. Arroyo said any future president of the Philippines would have to combat the gambling culture that is deeply ingrained here. "There are places in the Philippines where there is very little gambling," she said. "In the end, it comes down to political will."

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
Tradition and Legitimacy

BYLINE:  By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
Inevitably, a question mark hung over George W. Bush as he raised his right hand in the chill, damp air of the capital today and swore to "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States." But at that very moment, through that very act, the new president started to dispel the challenges to his legitimacy.
 Unlike most of his precursors -- but like John Quincy Adams, Benjamin Harrison and a handful of other presidents past -- Mr. Bush entered the White House without an unchallenged, universally accepted title to office. 
 A half-million more Americans voted for Al Gore than for Mr. Bush, which counted for nothing in the legal sense but for something, at least, in the political sense. Mr. Bush became the first president since Harrison in 1888 to lose the popular vote but win in the Electoral College. Only the intervention of the United States Supreme Court, itself as deeply divided as possible, 5 votes to 4, tipped the Electoral College vote in Mr. Bush's favor.
Arguments about the legitimacy of the Texas governor's victory have persisted even as the country accepted the fact that he had won. Thousands of the doubtful and disenchanted took to the streets of Washington today in angry protest.
But the debate is likely to grow softer as the nation grows accustomed to pictures of Mr. Bush speaking from the Oval Office, boarding Air Force One, accompanied everywhere he goes by the strains of "Ruffles and Flourishes" and "Hail to the Chief." In the television age, those images, more than anything else, confer the mantle of authority and legitimacy on a leader.
The process began, in a sense, with the ceremony in which Florida's secretary of state, Katherine Harris, certified Mr. Bush as the winner of that state's pivotal electoral votes. Carefully staged in a tribunal setting, nationally televised, it was immediately challenged as bogus and premature. But it solidified the conviction of many Americans that Mr. Bush had won the election.
What counted for far more was the inaugural ceremony itself, one of the surpassing rituals of the American democracy, connecting Mr. Bush and the United States of today, a military and economic colossus that bestrides the world, with the young, small and frail country that chose George Washington as its first president.
Today's events will align in the nation's collective memory with Franklin D. Roosevelt's ringing assurances that a people battered by Depression had "nothing to fear but fear itself" and Robert Frost's struggle to read the poem he had written to celebrate John F. Kennedy's inauguration and Jimmy Carter's unprecedented walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. And surely one of the symbols that will last is that of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who cast one of those five votes that assured Mr. Bush of victory, administering the oath of office to him.
That and the new president's speech (short but not all sweet, with references to the need for character and responsibility that seemed to many to be aimed at the departing president) and the 21-gun salute by the massed howitzers and the parade down Pennsylvania Avenue -- all the pomp and ceremony could not help but solidify Mr. Bush's claim to the presidency.
Bill Clinton -- who rode to the Capitol with his successor, following another hoary custom -- spoke this morning in his final radio address from the Oval Office of "the magic, the mystery, the miracle of American democracy" encapsulated in the ceremony marking "the peaceful transfer of power from one administration to the next." The United States does not do coups.
The protesters made a point of pledging that they would demonstrate peacefully, however intense their feelings of "outrage about the trampling of the electoral process and the disenfranchisement of voters," in the words of Les Souci, an organizer for Voter March, one of the protest organizations.
There were more protesters than at any inaugural since 1973, when the placards denounced the war in Vietnam. But no matter how many voices were lifted in protest, the presence on the platform of Al Gore -- departing vice president, defeated presidential candidate -- spoke just as loudly of acceptance and ratification.
No doubt Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore, along with hundreds of thousands of Democrats, felt that they had been cheated of something.
A new CBS News poll, made public on the eve of the inauguration, attested to that. Although 51 percent of the respondents said they considered Mr. Bush's victory a legitimate one, only 19 percent of Democrats -- and 12 percent of blacks -- said so.
It is often like that in the first months after a very, very close election like this one. Rutherford B. Hayes, chosen president by a special commission after an election marred by widespread fraud and endless legal maneuvering, said this in his Inaugural Address in March 1877: "Human judgment is never unerring, and is rarely regarded as otherwise than wrong by the unsuccessful party in the contest."
John Quincy Adams said the odd manner of his election sent him into office with little confidence.
Mr. Bush made no such allusion to the agonizingly close result of the 2000 election and its controversial resolution by the courts. But like Mr. Clinton, he celebrated what took place this morning.
"This peaceful transfer of authority," he said, "is rare in history, yet common in our country. With a simple oath we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings. As I begin, I thank President Clinton for his service to our nation, and I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace."
In the end, of course, it will be Mr. Bush's actions, not his words, that will ratify his legitimacy, or fail to, in the electorate's eyes. But he began his presidency as he had conducted his campaign, by emphasizing moral behavior -- and implicitly contrasting himself with Mr. Clinton, who ended his presidency with what amounted to a plea bargain with a special prosecutor.
"Together," he said, in what he had described as the key sentence of his speech, "we will build a nation of character." At another point, he spoke of fulfilling the nation's promise through "civility, courage, compassion and character."
And at yet another point, he made this promise: "I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility; to pursue the public interest with courage; to speak for greater justice and compassion; to call for responsibility and try to live it as well."

A Road Not Traveled: The New Era of G.O.P. Control

BYLINE:  By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
WHEN George W. Bush took the presidential oath of office yesterday, the Republican Party took control of not only the White House but also Congress. The accession of Richard B. Cheney to the vice presidency puts him in position to break the 50-50 tie in the Senate in the Republicans' favor, and they already held a narrow margin in the House of Representatives.
 For the first time since 1955, in the presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Republicans control all three of Washington's centers of elective power. But much has changed since then. Gone are the spittoons, the high-top shoes and the party discipline on Capitol Hill. Gone is the urgency of the Cold War and the Imperial Presidency it engendered. Gone is the interparty comity. 
 So there are only obsolete road maps to the political terrain Republicans and Democrats must navigate.
For the Republicans, the biggest problem is the tenuous margins by which they hold power. Essentially, the country split down the middle in November, giving the Republicans their tiny majority in the House, an even split in the Senate and a man with an asterisk at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. 
So what should the Democrats do? Their man Al Gore prevailed in the popular vote, and came so agonizingly close in the Electoral College. Along with many Democratic voters, and Bill Clinton, many Congressional Democrats believe he won, only to be cheated by the Republicans' machinations. So the instinct is fight back.
Their "great dilemma," as Lloyd N. Cutler, one of their senior statesmen, called it last week, is this: They have the theoretical power to block many of President Bush's initiatives, by using the filibuster and other procedural devices, but in doing so they risk exposing themselves to public scorn and electoral retribution. By flexing their muscles, in other words, they risk making Mr. Bush stronger. The country is down on partisanship.
That is one big reason why a Democratic filibuster against John Ashcroft, whose nomination for attorney general has generated immense hostility among liberals and some moderates, is so unlikely.
Though the parallel is not exact, there are lessons for both parties in the early years of the Clinton administration. Elected by a narrow margin after proclaiming himself a centrist, Mr. Clinton nonetheless mounted attacks on the status quo, reversing Reagan-era policies on abortion, nominating such controversial figures as Lani Guinier for office, pushing for gays in the military and proposing a massive health care reform plan.
The 1994 election turned into a referendum on the president, which he lost. But then the newly rampant Republicans in the House, led by Newt Gingrich, fought bitterly with Mr. Clinton, challenging him at every turn and ultimately closing the federal government down in a dispute over spending policy. Having seemed on the ropes, Mr. Clinton bounced back and won in 1996.
He learned the lesson; given a second chance, he walked as moderately as he talked, and on most issues, he prevailed. The new president has learned it, too, or so he says. Asked last week in an interview on CNN to appraise Mr. Clinton, Mr. Bush said he was "very good at the politics of dealing with the Congress."
In an earlier era, another feisty Republican Congress gave another Democratic president, Harry S. Truman, a severe battering on a series of economic and labor issues, passing the Taft-Hartley Act and a tax bill over presidential vetoes. Campaigning against Congress as a collection of good-for-nothings, Truman won a famously unexpected victory in 1948 as his party gained nine seats in the Senate and 75 in the House.
So the Democrats would be wise to tread softly, at least at first. Their leaders, especially Thomas A. Daschle of South Dakota in the Senate, have been speaking the language of compromise, and Mr. Daschle proved his mettle by working out a temporary power-sharing agreement with the Republicans.
On some issues, Democrats can let the Republicans do the heavy lifting. Even before Mr. Bush raised his right hand outside the Capitol, for example, Republican lawmakers expressed skepticism about the president's campaign proposal to give limited help to low-income elderly people for drug purchases. Mr. Bush "should be very flexible," warned Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the finance committee.
On other matters, compromise should not be out of reach if Democrats fight their corner with skill. A tax cut that is neither as targeted as the Democrats would like nor as large as Mr. Bush has proposed is possible, for example, and Democrats should be able to help shape the changes in the Pentagon that seem inevitable.
But bipartisanship and good will cannot bridge every chasm, especially in the Congress, where suspicion and sheer nastiness have taken root. That is especially true on the social issues that Mr. Bush played down during his campaign, like abortion and gun control, and the most vexed question of all, racial relations.
Mr. Bush ran abysmally among blacks, pulling no more than 9 percent of African-American votes. The divide was no less evident on social issues. He ran poorly in states that favor gun control, gay rights and abortion rights, such as New York, Illinois and California, building his electoral majority in the Plains and Rocky Mountain states and the South. He vowed during the campaign to "draw a moral line," and he has begun by nominating Mr. Ashcroft, a Christian conservative, to a key position, and by opposing United States government support for international groups that favor abortion.
The Democrats will fight him on social issues. Mr. Bush will, no doubt, look for support among conservative Democrats from states he carried, such as Texas and Florida. But the more he pushes, the more fiercely the Northern, urban Democrats will fight. The question is will the two sides be able to keep the ensuing struggle from poisoning debate on the more tractable issues.
MANY of the most successful presidents used control of Congress to mobilize support for major programs. Thomas Jefferson, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson are in that category. But since Johnson, the first president of the television era, shoved through an enormous package of legislation in 1965, no president has been able to count on solid partisan backing on the Hill. By making it possible to run without much party support, television deeply eroded party loyalties.
Mr. Bush, who has reportedly been reading about Theodore Roosevelt, will have the benefit of the bully pulpit that T.R. found the White House to be. For all the changes in the last half-century, one fact remains: Executive power is concentrated in the president and the presidency, but legislative power is diffused.
Senator Fred Thompson, Republican of Tennessee, said recently that he expected Congress to revert to its old scrappy ways. What happens then, he said, "will depend on the degree to which he can successfully go over our heads to make his case to the public."
If he is half as good at it as Bill Clinton, the Democrats will find themselves in a real bind.

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION: THE AGENDA; 
To Do: 1. Undo Most Recent Actions of My Predecessor

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
Faced with a to-do list that is long and getting longer, President Bush got off to a fast start today, acting to delay or block some of the Clinton administration's final initiatives.
 Less than two hours after taking the oath of office, Mr. Bush had his chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., take steps to keep his predecessor's last flurry of rules and regulatory decisions from taking effect. 
 In his final month in office, President Clinton had used his full range of executive powers to reshape policy on a wide range of issues. He issued new guidelines for health maintenance organizations serving Medicare patients, proposed new safety standards for meat and poultry products and created new environmental protections for wetlands. In a proclamation signed on Friday, Mr. Clinton granted new protection to a part of Governors Island in New York Harbor by declaring it a national monument; it is unclear whether Mr. Bush's action would affect that designation. Page 44. 
In announcing his action in a memorandum to executive departments and agencies, Mr. Card said it was necessary "to ensure that the president's appointees have the opportunity to review any new or pending regulations." Even as he was seeking to undo the last administration's work, Mr. Bush was looking ahead to a heavy workload on other issues.
Power shortages in California are threatening to set off an economic and political crisis in the nation's most populous state. Peace negotiations in the Middle East are again approaching a critical stage. Mr. Bush's choice for attorney general, John Ashcroft, is under attack from Democrats on Capitol Hill.
The economic outlook is murky and the stock market is edgy. The new president must make a choice in a matter of weeks about whether to proceed with one version of a national missile defense system. He has a thick stack of initiatives that he wants to send to Congress, but he has not formulated a budget to show how he will pay for them.
Mr. Bush and his aides were clearly eager to get to work. They had signaled for weeks their intention to review and reverse some of Mr. Clinton's recent actions.
The steps Mr. Card took today blocking publications of some rules in the Federal Register and delaying the effective date of others are tactics often used by incoming administrations to give themselves time to deal with complex issues left behind by their predecessors.
While bureaucratic, today's order vividly illustrated the shift in power from a Democratic administration to a Republican one, the immense authority inherent in the presidency and the scope of the ideological battles taking place as Washington adapts to a new set of leaders.
And if they do not know it already, Mr. Bush and his team will soon learn that pushing their own agenda will be only part of what occupies them, even in a time of general peace and prosperity.
"There are issues that are pushing in on him, and there are things that he has in mind to do, and the two are not synonymous," said Thomas Mann, a political analyst at the Brookings Institution, the research group.
"As far as the first group goes, the California energy crisis is front and center, although it's not clear what policy role there is for him to play," Mr. Mann said. "Getting a budget ready to send up to the Hill will be important. And third, I would say, is the Middle East peace negotiations. A decision will have to be made pretty quickly about what role, if any, the Bush administration wants to play in what is shaping up as another marathon negotiation before the Israeli elections."
Mr. Bush and his team will not only have to deal with the unexpected and events beyond their control, but also have to confront the reality of the 535 legislators of both parties on Capitol Hill, who are intent on pressing their own issues in their own way.
It is no coincidence that the first member of Congress that Mr. Bush is scheduled to meet with one on one next week, other than House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and Trent Lott of Mississippi, his party's leader in the Senate, is Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. Mr. McCain, who battled Mr. Bush in the primaries last year, is going by the White House for a private chat on Wednesday evening.
Mr. McCain has pledged to push quickly for his proposed overhaul of the campaign finance laws, and he seems close to having enough votes to win. The initiative is opposed by Mr. Bush, and has the potential not only to give the new White House a case of political heartburn, but also to slow the president's push for early consideration of his own priorities. 
Mr. Bush's aides are planning an intensive push next week to build support for the new president's education proposal, which he intends to send to Congress on Tuesday as his first legislative initiative.
The proposal is built around giving the states more money and streamlining the federal requirements for using it, in return for greater state and local accountability for improving student performance.
It will also include a provision to allow parents of students in some failing school districts to take their share of federal financing and put it toward private or parochial school tuition, so-called vouchers.
"You can anticipate a lot of action on education next week," said Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's spokesman.
On foreign policy, the new administration will confront difficult questions about how to deal with unstable and potentially aggressive nations like Iraq and North Korea.
At the Pentagon, Mr. Bush faces pressure from the uniformed leaders of the armed services to immediately increase spending. Even then, the services' programs for buying new weapons -- from the Air Force's F-22 to the Army's mobile artillery system -- far exceed projected spending levels. 
The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization at the Pentagon has outlined a schedule for the new team that requires Mr. Bush to decide by March whether he will proceed with the initial steps of a limited missile shield this year. 
Most of Mr. Bush's energies in the first few months, however, are likely to be focused on domestic issues.
Mr. Bush's team, including Paul H. O'Neill, who will lead the Treasury Department, and Lawrence B. Lindsey, the chief economic adviser in the White House, are busy revising the president's $1.6 trillion tax cut plan.
The administration is also looking at proposals to help retirees pay the cost of prescription drugs, an issue that both parties in Congress have near the top of their list as well.
But Congressional leaders said they did not anticipate any push to help Mr. Bush ring up quick legislative victories on his priority issues. 
"The issues George W. Bush wants to address are big issues," Mr. Lott said. "You need to take a little time to get that right."
Still, by moving quickly to frustrate the last pieces of Mr. Clinton's agenda, the new administration served notice that it would not wait until every post was filled.
In a memorandum to the heads and acting heads of executive departments and agencies today, Mr. Card ordered these steps:
*No proposed or final regulation may be sent to the Office of the Federal Register unless it has been reviewed and approved by a senior department or agency official appointed by President Bush.
*Rules that have been sent to the Federal Register office, but not yet published, must be withdrawn, in accordance with the procedures of that office. These rules will be reviewed by the new administration.
*The effective date of new regulations will be postponed for 60 days if the rules have been published in the Federal Register, but have not taken effect. Rules typically take effect 30 to 90 days after they are published.
The breadth of Mr. Card's order surprised some Clinton administration officials.
Timothy M. Westmoreland, director of the Center for Medicaid and State Operations at the Department of Health and Human Services, said: "The Bush administration is being extremely short-sighted. Some of our rules would save money. Others would provide basic protections for H.M.O. patients and for children subjected to abuses in psychiatric hospitals."

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION; 
President: 'I Ask You to Be Citizens'

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Bush's inaugural address yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:
 Thank you all. Chief Justice Rehnquist, President Carter, President Bush, President Clinton, distinguished guests and my fellow citizens. The peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country. With a simple oath, we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings. As I begin, I thank President Clinton for his service to our nation. And I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace. 
 I am honored and humbled to stand here, where so many of America's leaders have come before me, and so many will follow. 
We have a place, all of us, in a long story, a story we continue, but whose end we will not see. It is the story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old. The story of a slave-holding society that became a servant of freedom. The story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer. It is the American story, a story of flawed and fallible people, united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals.
The grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promise: that everyone belongs, that everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant person was ever born. Americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws. And though our nation has sometimes halted, and sometimes delayed, we must follow no other course.
Through much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea. Now it is a seed upon the wind, taking root in many nations. Our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country, it is the inborn hope of our humanity, an ideal we carry but do not own, a trust we bear and pass along. And even after nearly 225 years, we have a long way yet to travel.
While many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise -- even the justice -- of our own country. The ambitions of some Americans are limited by failing schools, and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth. And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent, but not a country.
We do not accept this, and we will not allow it. Our unity, our union, is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation. And this is my solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity. I know this is in our reach, because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves, who creates us equal in his image. And we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward.
America has never been united by blood or birth or soil. We are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds, lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens. Every child must be taught these principles. Every citizen must uphold them. And every immigrant, by embracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less, American.
Today we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation's promise through civility, courage, compassion and character.
America, at its best, matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility. A civil society demands from each of us good will and respect, fair dealing and forgiveness.
Some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because in a time of peace the stakes of our debates appear small. But the stakes for America are never small. If our country does not lead the cause of freedom, it will not be led. If we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character, we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism. If we permit our economy to drift and decline, the vulnerable will suffer most.
We must live up to the calling we share. Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment. It is the determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos. And this commitment, if keep it, is a way to shared accomplishment.
America at its best is also courageous. Our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war, when defeating common dangers defined our common good. Now we must chose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us. We must show courage in a time of blessing, by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations.
Together, we will reclaim America's schools before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives. We will reform Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent. And we will reduce taxes to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working Americans. We will build our defenses beyond challenge, lest weakness invite challenge. We will confront weapons of mass destruction, so that a new century is spared new horrors.
The enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake, America remains engaged in the world, by history and by choice, shaping a balance of power that favors freedom. We will defend our allies and our interests. We will show purpose without arrogance. We will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength. And to all nations, we will speak for the values that gave our nation birth.
America at its best is compassionate.
In the quiet of American conscience, we know that deep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation's promise. And whatever our views of its cause, we can agree that children at risk are not at fault. Abandonment and abuse are not acts of God, they are failures of love. And the proliferation of prisons, however necessary, is no substitute for hope and order in our souls.
Where there is suffering, there is duty. Americans in need are not strangers, they are citizens; not problems, but priorities; and all of us are diminished when any are hopeless.
Government has great responsibilities, for public safety and public health, for civil rights and common schools. Yet compassion is the work of a nation, not just a government. And some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor's touch or a pastor's prayer. Church and charity, synagogue and mosque, lend our communities their humanity and they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws.
Many in our country do not know the pain of poverty. But we can listen to those who do. And I can pledge our nation to a goal: When we see that wounded traveler on the road to Jericho, we will not pass to the other side.
America at its best is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected. Encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats, it is a call to conscience. And though it requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper fulfillment. We find the fullness of life, not only in options, but in commitments. And we find that children and community are the commitments that set us free.
Our public interest depends on private character, on civic duty and family bonds and basic fairness, on uncounted, unhonored acts of decency which give direction to our freedom.
Sometimes in life we are called to do great things. But as a saint of our times has said, every day we are called to do small things with great love. The most important tasks of a democracy are done by everyone.
I will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with civility, to pursue the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call for responsibility and try to live it as well. In all these days -- ways -- I will bring the values of our history to the care of our times.
What you do is as important as anything government does. I ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort, to defend needed reforms against easy attacks, to serve your nation, beginning with your neighbor. I ask you to be citizens. Citizens, not spectators. Citizens, not subjects. Responsible citizens, building communities of service and a nation of character.
Americans are generous and strong and decent, not because we believe in ourselves, but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves. When this spirit of citizenship is missing, no government program can replace it. When this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against it.
After the Declaration of Independence was signed, Virginia statesman John Page wrote to Thomas Jefferson: "We know the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong. Do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm?"
Much time has passed since Jefferson arrived for his inauguration. The years and changes accumulate. But the themes of this day he would know: our nation's grand story of courage, and its simple dream of dignity. We are not this story's author, who fills time and eternity with his purpose. Yet his purpose is achieved in our duty and our duty is fulfilled in service to one another.
Never tiring, never yielding, never finishing, we renew that purpose today: to make our country more just and generous, to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life.
This work continues. This story goes on. And an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm.
God bless you all, and God bless America.

HEADLINE: THE INAUGURATION: THE PRESIDENT; 
BUSH, TAKING OFFICE, CALLS FOR CIVILITY, COMPASSION AND 'NATION OF CHARACTER'

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI and DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 20 

 BODY:
George Walker Bush was sworn in as the 43rd president of the United States today and, in an Inaugural Address that sought to unify the nation after one of the most disputed elections in its history, asked Americans to match "a commitment to principle with a concern for civility."
 Mr. Bush used that last word again and again as he sounded a call for a common national purpose that transcended political divisions and partisan tempers. 
 "Civility is not a tactic or a sentiment," Mr. Bush said in relatively brief inaugural remarks, which he delivered from a platform outside the United States Capitol under a thick cover of clouds. As hundreds of thousands of spectators huddled against chill winds, he said: "It is the determined choice of trust over cynicism, of community over chaos." 
Mr. Bush pledged to dedicate himself to that ideal and, his voice and words as muted in their way as the gray scene around him, spoke of unity and duty and responsibility.
"I ask you to be citizens," Mr. Bush said. "Citizens, not spectators. Citizens, not subjects. Responsible citizens, building communities of service and a nation of character." Transcript, Page 14. 
Minutes earlier, the 54-year-old former governor of Texas, a political latecomer who had arrived at his presidential ambitions rather haphazardly, took the oath of office with a hand placed firmly on the same 1767 King James Version of the Bible used by his father, the nation's 41st president, 12 years earlier.
Gathered around George W. Bush on the platform, built along the West Front of the Capitol, were the people who helped propel him to the presidency: his wife, Laura Bush, whom he credits for leading him toward discipline and purpose in his adult life; his father, former President George Bush, who bequeathed him a name and a network of connections that lent a crucial momentum to his campaign; Bill Clinton, whose personal scandals gave Mr. Bush a fighting chance against a sitting vice president in an era of prosperity; and that vice president, Al Gore, who ran what many political analysts deemed a lackluster campaign.
In addition, the man who administered the oath of office to Mr. Bush just after noon, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, had voted with the bare majority of the Supreme Court last month in Bush v. Gore, the case that effectively ended Mr. Gore's legal contest of the returns from the polls in Florida. That court ruling determined the outcome of a breathtakingly close election.
After taking the oath, Mr. Bush hugged his wife and kissed his 19-year-old twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara. Over Mr. Bush's shoulder, just a few yards away, his father stood watching. And in the minute or two that the new president waited to begin his remarks, casting two small waves to the crowd that stood in thick mud on the Mall, a tear trickled from one of his eyes.
After the inaugural ceremony, Mr. Bush quickly got down to business, issuing a series of executive orders -- including one that sought to delay, review and roll back some of the last-minute regulations of the Clinton administration -- even before his post-inaugural luncheon with Congressional leaders was over.
At that luncheon, Mr. Bush acknowledged that because of the election's closeness, many Americans believed "we can't get anything done" and "nothing will happen, except for finger-pointing and name-calling and bitterness."
"I'm here to tell the country that things will get done," Mr. Bush said, later adding, "Republicans and Democrats will come together to do what's right for America."
They certainly avoided any discord in a 13-minute-long session of the Senate this afternoon, during which seven of Mr. Bush's cabinet nominees, none of them considered to be controversial, were confirmed.
They were Colin L. Powell, 63, the new secretary of state; Paul H. O'Neill, 65, the new treasury secretary; Donald H. Rumsfeld, 68, the new defense secretary; Roderick R. Paige, 67, the new education secretary; Spencer Abraham, 48, the new energy secretary; Donald L. Evans, 54, the new commerce secretary, and Ann M. Veneman, 51, the new agriculture secretary.
Mr. Bush's inaugural had a strikingly different feel and tone than Mr. Clinton's in 1993. At that time, there was the sense of a new generation taking power, of a shift as much cultural as political.
But the political leaders near Mr. Bush today belonged to the past as well as the future. The new vice president, Dick Cheney, 59, who was sworn in just minutes before Mr. Bush, had previously served as the defense secretary in the first Bush administration. James A. Baker III, who also had a ringside position for the ceremony, was that administration's secretary of state.
And the sepia-toned look of the television images, a product of the miserable weather, at times combined with Mr. Bush's relatively subdued demeanor and language to give the proceedings an almost old-fashioned aura.
For his address, which lasted about 14 minutes and was interrupted by applause 14 times, Mr. Bush turned to a loftiness of oratory that he had often avoided in the past, when he would regularly prune his speechwriters' language to fit his folksy, unpretentious image of himself.
His remarks today were sprinkled with elegant locutions, artful syntax and alliterative phrases. He spoke to many audiences: the 50.46 million people who voted for him, the 50.99 million people who voted against him, and the hundreds of millions of people abroad who would examine his words for any hint of how the world's largest economic and military power may now use its influence.
In a vague echo of John F. Kennedy, who was inaugurated in the same spot 40 years ago today, Mr. Bush said, "The enemies of liberty in our country should make no mistake: America remains engaged in the world, by history and by choice, shaping a balance of power that favors freedom. We will defend our allies and our interests."
His reference to "shaping a balance of power" suggested that Mr. Bush sees America as the first among many, but not necessarily a sole superpower that can act unilaterally. Reflecting his oft-stated concern that America must act humbly on the world stage, he added, "We will show purpose without arrogance." Quite deliberately, he did not go as far as his father once had in describing America as the world's peacemaker.
Mr. Bush opened his address by noting that a "peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our country."
Those words seemed to recognize the messiness of the election and the ambiguity of Mr. Bush's mandate, just as his exhortations to altruism -- reminiscent of his father's inaugural remarks -- seemed designed in part to rally Republicans and Democrats alike around his leadership.
Mr. Bush praised Mr. Gore for "a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace" and briefly thanked Mr. Clinton "for service to our nation."
But Mr. Bush's remarks also dwelled on the personal character he hoped to bring to office and thus served as a reminder of the extent to which he turned character -- specifically, Mr. Clinton's -- into an issue during the presidential campaign.
"I will live and lead by these principles -- to advance my convictions with civility, to pursue the public interest with courage, to speak for greater justice and compassion, to call for responsibility, and try to live it as well," Mr. Bush pledged, a subtle and fleeting acknowledgment of the turmoil that constantly swirled around Mr. Clinton.
Mr. Bush also immediately issued a code of ethical conduct for the staff of the executive branch. While it largely restated existing rules, it clearly carried symbolic import, especially coming a day after Mr. Clinton admitted to giving false testimony in a deposition as part of a deal to avoid prosecution. 
There were other reminders of the end of Mr. Clinton's tumultuous era today. Two hours before leaving the White House -- where he briefly indulged one last dance in the foyer with his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton -- Mr. Clinton signed 176 pardons and commutations, including several for former aides and associates who had been convicted over the course of his presidency.
As Mr. Clinton attempted to clean up the past, Mr. Bush used his Inaugural Address to look forward, talking in his speech about the importance of diversity and the contributions of immigrants. He was pressing his vision of the Republican Party as an inclusive one, an image sometimes obscured by recent battles over some of the more conservative nominees for his cabinet.
Mr. Bush said that "everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant person was ever born."
He pledged to improve the nation's schools and to push forward on his proposal to reduce taxes by $1.6 trillion over 10 years. That plan was already being revised as he spoke, but his mention of it drew the biggest applause from the spectators on the Mall.
The inaugural ceremony was suffused with a customary sense of spectacle, which even the dank skies and intermittent drizzle could not stamp out. The luminaries simply made the requisite adjustments, with the new president's mother, Barbara Bush, and his former rival during the Republican primaries, Senator John McCain of Arizona, slipping plastic raincoats over their otherwise dignified attire.
After the event, Mr. and Mrs. Clinton took a helicopter to Andrews Air Force Base, where the newly ex-president could not resist one more address to his supporters, one more meditation on the good he felt he had done the country, one more goodbye.
"So you see that sign there that says 'Please don't go'?" Mr. Clinton asked. "I left the White House, but I'm still here." His supporters laughed.
"We're not going anywhere," the now-former president said, referring to his wife as well.
For the new president and his family, shaping up to be one of the most significant dynasties in American political history, the day began quietly and sweetly enough.
The Bushes had stayed together overnight at Blair House, the official guest quarters opposite the White House, and left around 9:15 a.m. for a prayer service at St. John's Church, just across Lafayette Square.
The expression on Mr. Bush's face as he went into and out of the service captured a play of emotions: slight exhaustion from the frantic and festive days leading up to this one, incipient excitement about the moment to come and, possibly, traces of relief.
For 36 long days after Nov. 7, he had been unable to celebrate what indeed turned out to be a victory in the 2000 presidential election. Today, that was no longer the case.
At 10:30 a.m., Mr. and Mrs. Bush arrived at the White House for a meeting with Mr. and Mrs. Clinton, who waited outside to greet them. At first, the body language seemed a bit tense.
But then Mrs. Clinton reached out to touch Mrs. Bush's arm, leading her inside. And the outgoing and incoming presidents followed their wives, Mr. Clinton managing a beaming smile in Mr. Bush's direction.
Mr. Gore, there to meet his successor, Dick Cheney, had a heavy expression, although later, in the minutes before the inaugural ceremony, he too flashed a grin.
Outside the Capitol, Mr. Clinton approached former President Bush, the man he had defeated in the 1992 election, and shook his hand. A horn section blared a patriotic refrain.
In some senses, the Bush family seemed like any other. Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, the new president's younger brother, flashed pictures with a disposable camera.
When George W. Bush emerged from the Capitol around 11:45 a.m., his posture was as straight as it had ever been and his lips were locked tight together. But occasionally, as he caught a friend or relative's eye, the corners of his mouth curled upward.
For Mr. Bush, this was the climax of an extraordinary personal journey from volatility to steadiness, from a tendency toward mischief to a talent for discipline. His campaign was a testament to that transformation.
But this was also the beginning of Mr. Bush's greatest challenge: to lead a divided country that, for all its prosperity, faces significant problems. They range from a slowing economy to growing suspicions of American power, particularly in Russia and China.
And Mr. Bush vowed repeatedly in the days leading up to his inauguration to deal with all of that and to shrink from none of it, but today was not yet the time.
After the ceremony was the parade, and once the car transporting the new president and first lady down Pennsylvania Avenue had passed most of the protesters, the couple climbed out of the vehicle to walk only the end of route.
Onlookers roared their approval. Then the rain picked up, forcing Mr. Bush to retreat under an umbrella, where he tried to stay dry as he looked forward another evening of revelry, capped by a first night in the White House when he would be the host, and the rest of the Bushes the guests.

HEADLINE: Dark Days Send Chill Through Dairyville 

BYLINE:  By EVELYN NIEVES 

DATELINE: TULARE, Calif., Jan. 19 

 BODY:
To understand how serious the utility crisis has become in California, consider the case of the Land O' Lakes Inc. Western Region factory here, the largest milk processing plant in the United States.
 Every day, 34 shiny, refrigerated tankers capable of carrying 50,000 pounds of milk each make several round trips from 200 dairies across the state to a six-block compound here. These trucks bring in a total of 230 tanker loads, or 11 to 12 million pounds of milk, every 24 hours, 365 days a year. 
 To keep the production line from dairy to processing plant flowing smoothly, Land O' Lakes runs a tight operation: tankers come in, unload their milk and go. If a plant was shut down, the milk trucks would be delayed, the dairies' operations would get backed up and their perishable product would have to be dumped. 
At noon today, when the power to the plant was restored after being off for six hours, 20 tankers were waiting at the unloading zone. On Thursday, when the compound was off for 16 hours, all 34 trucks had a wait.
"We know that suppliers are already dumping milk," said Jack Prince, the executive vice president and chief operating officer of Land O' Lakes Inc.'s dairy foods group, as he sat in the dark in an office that felt colder than the outdoors. "I could also say that some suppliers cannot keep this up for more than a week or two."
For California's $4.3 billion dairy industry, the largest in the country, the problems could not be more dire. Even before power was deliberately cut this week in California -- for the first time since World War II -- the dairy industry was in serious straits. Natural gas prices began rising several months ago, worsening the losses that dairies were already absorbing in this depressed wholesale market for milk. And that was before the higher rates for electricity were approved this month. Since California's dairies and milk processors represent a large part of the national industry, producing a fifth of the nation's milk, the effects of a dairy industry disaster here -- farms shut down and production diminished -- would be felt across the country. 
"You have to understand that this is a phenomenon that's only 45 to 60 days old," said Jim Gomes, vice president of operations for California Dairies Inc., the second-largest farmers' cooperative in the nation.
"The impact of this has not even fully been felt yet," Mr. Gomes said. "We don't know what's going to happen. But I could tell you this: the state is going to be sick in terms of economic activity; it's going to be very sick."
Over the last several weeks, as the power crisis has deepened, agricultural industry leaders here have been meeting to devise emergency plans in the face of blackouts. Last week, the Western United Dairymen, a trade association representing about 1,100 of California's 2,000 dairy farmers, asked the California Department of Food and Agriculture, which regulates dairy prices, to raise the price of milk to reflect the climbing energy costs. 
Michael Marsh, the chief executive officer for the association, said that dairies had been operating at a loss for the last year, producing milk at a cost of $1.05 a gallon and making 94 cents a gallon. "Two cents of that $1.05 is for utilities," Mr. Marsh said. "If the price goes up to four cents, multiplied by thousands of gallons a day, farms will not survive."
Mr. Marsh said a decision is expected by Feb. 1 on the request by the industry to raise milk prices, which would translate to perhaps a penny a gallon at the retail level, from about $3.19 to $3.20.
But if power shutdowns continue, even a price increase will not keep the industry afloat, milk producers and processors both predict.
After 40 years in the milk-making business, Frank Faria said he was wondering whether it was worth it. His family farm, Faria Dairies Inc., which produces 8,500 gallons of raw milk from 1,400 cows a day, is already suffering the effects of natural gas increases over the last few months, Mr. Faria said. 
"Our gas bills are up 140 percent," Mr. Faria said, adding that he was not sure how long the business, which houses 13 employees and their families, could absorb the cost. "We haven't gotten our electric bill yet," he said. Of three sites, two have backup generators, but a blackout affecting even the one without backup power would be catastrophic, he said.
"Cows have to be milked twice a day every day," Mr. Faria said. "If they're not milked, they get very sick. If that happens, we lose cows."
Anxiety is eating at the industry at all levels.
Hilmar Cheese Company, in Hilmar in the Central Valley, the largest cheese-producing plant in the world, voluntarily shut down one of its three processing plants on Thursday so that the surrounding community, serviced by a public utility, the Turlock Irrigation District, would not be faced with blackouts, said John Jeter, Hilmar's chief executive. But with one-third of its operations down, it was losing money, on top of absorbing huge increases in the cost of natural gas; it cost 475 percent more for gas in December than in it did the December before. 
Mr. Jeter said that since the company competed nationally against processors who were not faced with these higher costs, it had already lost business.
"We'll take in anywhere from 160 to 180 tanker loads of milk a day," he said. "It comes in 24/7, 365 days a year. To stop at any point in the process from dairy to processing is very damaging economically. People making business decisions are going to ask, 'Should I buy my cheese from California or from Wisconsin?' "
Land O' Lakes' Western Region plant, which receives its power from Southern California Edison, has had to make hard financial decision this week. The compound is on "interruptible power," which means that in exchange for lower utility rates, the company agrees to have its power shut down at times of peak demand. For more than 10 years, or as long as anyone who works in the 550-employee operation can remember, power was never interrupted. But since mid-December, power has been disrupted 17 times. And each time, the length of the interruption has increased.
From Tuesday to today, Land O' Lakes' factories were shut down every day for 6 to 16 1/2 hours at a time. On Wednesday, faced with a choice of backing up operations for a day and forcing dairies to dump their milk, the company chose to operate and pay tens of thousands of dollars per hour in penalties for using power, said Mr. Prince, the chief operating officer.
The rule of the agreement stated that the plant would be without power for only six hours, Mr. Prince said, but that has not happened. "Yesterday we were down for 16 hours with a half-hour of power in between," he said.
Beyond the losses in milk production are larger economic losses in the community. To conserve energy, the company has shut down one of its four processors, sidelining 125 workers. That's 125 more unemployed households in already depressed Tulare County, one of two counties (the other being Kings County, which includes Sacramento) with the most dairy farms in the state. The unemployment rate in Tulare is hovering at 14 percent, compared with 4.9 percent statewide.
"The impact that we're having in California can be mitigated by our other plants in other sites," Mr. Prince said. "But ultimately, there are going to be some very substantial implications to the economy of the state and the industry if this crisis continues."

HEADLINE: New Economy; 
The updated context notwithstanding, the issues behind unionization drives at dot-coms have a familiar ring.

BYLINE:  By Tim Race 

 BODY:
INSTEAD of the old union hall standard "Joe Hill," the new economy labor movement may need a more up-to-date anthem, like a Napster download of Confrontation Camp's "Against the Elements." And yet, the labor issues of the dot-com era seem to involve the time-honored antagonisms between capital and labor -- issues like pay, schedules, promotions and management's willingness to listen.
 Those issues were thrust into the news recently by word that 13 customer service workers at Etown.com, a publisher of consumer-electronics reviews and product data in San Francisco, were about to vote on whether to join the Communications Workers of America. It would have been the first union vote at a dot-com company. 
 In the end, the balloting was postponed for at least six months, pending the outcome of a National Labor Relations Board complaint the union filed against Etown. But the episode seems to have become a parable for work life after the Nasdaq cataclysm. 
During the last few years of exuberant irrationality in the Internet industry, the old rules of running a business sometimes seemed to apply no longer. With a frontier mentality, trailblazing entrepreneurs led pioneering teams that traveled fast and light and whose members packed bedrolls for the all-nighters that came with staking a claim to the new economy. Any disgruntlement tended to be diffused by gauzy hopes for stock-offering wealth or by the caffeinated excitement of building something insanely great, or maybe just insanely.
But with submerged stock options, dot-com closings and widespread layoffs, comes the realization that the old issues of managing and motivating people never went away. For a variety of reasons, many of these issues came together at Etown.
Through last fall, there were more than two dozen customer service workers at Etown, which is owned by Collaborative Media, a five-year-old company that is still private and is losing money.
Etown has amassed an extensive database of its own consumer-electronics reviews and recommendations and acts as a referral service for online electronics dealers. Its customer service department is available by telephone or online around the clock to answer questions and offer advice. These workers each received 1,200 stock options when they were hired, and they earn $420 to $640 for a five-day, 40-hour week.
Current and former workers say that the modest number of stock options were never really the draw. What mattered, they say, was building a company and feeling like they had a say in which schedules they would work, when they would have to put in overtime and whether they would receive raises when they took on extra duties like trouble-shooting their co-workers' computers. The department's managers, they contend, were not responsive to their complaints on such matters.
Two employees lost their jobs after leading a one-day sickout in October. At that point, the Etown customer service workers sought advice from the C.W.A. local in Seattle that has been trying to organize workers at Amazon.com. The Seattle people, in turn, put the Etown workers in touch with the Northern California Media Workers Guild, a C.W.A. local in San Francisco.
"The great thing about the Etown folks is that they were already very organized," recalled Erin Tyson Poh, a guild representative. "They had spent the summer talking to management, and they felt they were getting a deaf ear."
Lew Brown, president and chief operating officer of Collaborative Media, says former managers of the customer service department let a crisis develop before alerting senior management. Mr. Brown, 46, joined Collaborative Media in 1998 after helping run a company that managed customer service centers for wireless companies including AT&T and Sprint. He says he is no green dot-com entrepreneur and is not antiunion.
"I'm a lifelong Democrat and union supporter," he said. But Mr. Brown argues that the Etown employees' complaints can be resolved without the formal apparatus of a union. "I don't really know what brought this to a head," he said, "other than the union saw us as an opportunity to create a bellwether for unionizing the dot-com industry. They couldn't get in Amazon, so they thought they could get Etown. But we're not a deep-pocketed company. Basically, we're operating on a bridge loan, seeking a third round of financing."
Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley who specializes in labor and the global economy, said the financial rigors of keeping an Internet company afloat have tended to overshadow management matters. "Venture capitalists," he said, "seldom ask 'What's your employee-relationship structure?' "
In late November, the union organizers filed with the labor relations board to hold a vote among the Etown customer service representatives. On Dec. 1, citing "ongoing pressures from our investors," Mr. Brown announced the elimination of 28 jobs -- 13 of them from the customer service division. He said the company would concentrate on licensing its product database and "scale down our costly consumer operations."
Earlier this month, three days before the scheduled union vote at Etown, Ms. Poh's guild unit filed a complaint against Etown with the labor relations board, accusing the company of efforts to thwart the union drive. The filing had the effect of delaying the vote for at least six months, as the labor board investigates, and Ms. Poh said she did not know if the vote effort would be revived. 
Eric Anderson, a 22-year-old customer service worker at Etown who has been active in the union effort, said some of the issues had already been resolved through meetings with management. "People are no longer being scheduled to work 10 days straight or being forced to work overtime," he said. He declined to discuss other specific grievances, saying he still hoped they could be worked out. Will the voting effort be resumed? "Our feelings on that seem to change, day to day," he said. 
Professor Shaiken speaks of "shadow unionization" in the dot-com and high-technology industries -- moves by employers to pre-empt formal union organizing by addressing labor issues in consultation with employees. 
Maybe that is what is now happening at Etown, where Mr. Brown expressed confidence that the complaints before the labor relations board could be resolved and the employees' remaining problems addressed because "they know my door is always open."
But don't expect him to stop fuming any time soon about last month's union rally outside Etown's building, where a chanting crowd of about 100 compared him to Jeff Bezos, the wealthy chairman of the big online retailer Amazon. "They were shouting 'Down with Brown. Down with Bezos,' " Mr. Brown said. "That's about as ludicrous as you can get. I drive an S40 Volvo and my stock options are worth nothing."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
A Question Of Conflict Amid a Web Of Interests

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
For the last four years, Harry J. Carr has been ahead of the curve in the communications equipment business. Should investors follow?
 In 1997, after 16 years at AT&T, Mr. Carr became president of Yurie Systems, a Maryland-based developer of switches for telecommunications networks. Less than a year later, the AT&T spinoff Lucent Technologies bought Yurie for $1 billion, and Mr. Carr reaped a $35 million windfall. 
 He was soon promoted to run Lucent's broadband carrier networks division, where he sold the kind of sophisticated equipment that undergirds the Internet. As Lucent stock peaked in December 1999, Mr. Carr quit to become chairman and chief executive of Tellium, which makes optical switches to control the flow of data where fiber-optic cables meet. 
To lure Mr. Carr, Tellium, based in Oceanport, N.J., offered him options to buy 13.2 million shares -- 7 percent of the company -- for about $1 a share. 
Now, after signing three big sales contracts for its switches, Tellium has filed to sell shares to the public for about $15 each. At that price, Mr. Carr's stake would be worth $200 million. Tellium has not yet set a date for the offering, but it has generated strong interest from institutional investors.
Mr. Carr deserves much of the credit for Tellium's success so far, said Jennifer Pigg, executive vice president for the Yankee Group, a consulting company that has worked for Tellium. "He is a good combination of somebody who is operationally proficient, can make sure the company is staying within budget, and yet also is a very good strategist as well," Ms. Pigg said.
But potential Tellium shareholders might want to consider that at Yurie and Lucent, Mr. Carr oversaw and participated in deals that, although legal, stretched ethical standards, in the view of some independent analysts.
When Mr. Carr was president of Yurie in 1997, one third of Yurie's sales went directly or indirectly to a company controlled by Yurie's vice chairman. Skeptics questioned whether Yurie could have received the same prices for its equipment on the open market. In any case, the sales fattened Yurie's sales book.
At Lucent, Mr. Carr personally invested in a company that sold equipment to his division. In an interview last Thursday, Mr. Carr said his actions had been proper and fully disclosed to investors and his superiors. He said related-party transactions and equity sweeteners are common in the information technology industry, as are executives who make personal investments in their companies' suppliers and customers.
Whatever Mr. Carr's personal integrity, Yurie's heavy reliance for sales on Splitrock, a company controlled by Yurie's vice chairman, Kwok Li, raised eyebrows among short-sellers -- investors who place bets that a company's price will fall.
In 1997, Yurie had about $51 million in sales. Of that total, $12.6 million went directly to Splitrock. Another $7.3 million went to Ericsson, which later sold $5 million of the Yurie equipment to Splitrock. In all, $17.6 million of Yurie's $51 million in sales went to Splitrock.
"The Yurie product never really took off," said Russell Young of Hintz Holman and Hecksher, a hedge fund. Splitrock was "really propping up the numbers of Yurie," Mr. Young said. "All their sales were going to Splitrock."
Investors should be wary of sales between related companies, because it is impossible to be sure that the deal is fair to both sides -- even if the companies protest otherwise, said Jack Ciesielski, publisher of The Analyst's Accounting Observer. "If you look at a lot of these disasters that have happened," he said, "you do find a trail where you have related parties."
Mr. Carr said Yurie had done nothing wrong. Yurie fully disclosed the connections between the two companies to investors, and Lucent validated Yurie's technology in 1998 when it bought Yurie for $35 a share, almost triple the price of Yurie's initial offering a year earlier.
When the Lucent acquisition was announced, "I was happy to have all those people who bet against the Yurie management team lose an incredible amount of money," Mr. Carr said. "The market proved that they were just wrong."
The market told a different story a year later, when Mr. Carr became involved with Fantastic, a Swiss company that develops software to manage the flow of data over broadband networks.
In June 1999, Mr. Carr, who at the time was vice president of Lucent's data networking division, announced that Lucent would become a reseller of Fantastic's software. Lucent agreed to buy $10 million worth of Fantastic software, almost 40 percent of Fantastic's total sales for 1999. Lucent also became an investor in Fantastic, buying several million dollars in Fantastic stock.
Later that summer, Mr. Carr personally invested in Fantastic. He declined to disclose the size of his investment. "It's a number that some people might think is significant," he said, "but relative to my net worth it isn't."
But Mr. Carr's investment in Fantastic -- which was doing business with the Lucent division he ran -- was problematic whatever its size, said Steven D. Levy, an analyst at Lehman Brothers.
"It does not take a whole lot of economic incentive for any individual in my experience to have a conflict of interest," Mr. Levy said. "If you have executives who have hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in potential earnings -- I don't care how saintly they are, I have to believe they're going to be influenced."
Mr. Carr disagrees. He said that he cleared his Fantastic investment, in writing, with Lucent, and that he recused himself from the relationship between Fantastic and Lucent after he made the investment.
"I don't really see it as a conflict of interest," he said. "I guess there could be a purist view that it is a conflict of interest, but the reality is it's done all the time."
Mr. Carr said he made the investment for the same reason that he put Lucent into business with Fantastic -- because he liked the company's software. "I believed in the company," he said.
The deal turned out to be a bust commercially, as Lucent was unable to find customers for Fantastic's software, according to two former Lucent executives. But both Mr. Carr and Lucent profited on their investments in Fantastic, which had its initial public offering on Germany's Neuer Markt in September 1999.
Lucent sold its Fantastic shares in March 2000, making about $50 million. Mr. Carr said he sold his own shares in the summer of 2000, making a "moderate" profit.
Many other Fantastic shareholders were not so lucky. After peaking last February at 55 euros, or more than $50, a share, Fantastic closed Friday at 3.12 euros, or less than $3.
Paul Sagawa, a senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said he was troubled when executives invest in their suppliers or partners. "The insidiousness of a conflict of interest is you can't prove either way that it made the difference," Mr. Sagawa said. "It reeks of kickback."
Mr. Carr said his views have not changed now that he runs his own company. He will allow employees at Tellium to invest in companies they do business with, he said, as long as they disclose those investments.
And Mr. Carr has not been afraid to offer the chance to buy Tellium stock as a sweetener to executives at potential customers.
In September, Tellium gave executives at the telecommunications carrier Qwest the opportunity to buy $10 million in Tellium stock for $15 a share, according to Tellium's prospectus. Tellium also gave Qwest itself 4 million warrants to buy Tellium stock as part of a $300 million contract that Qwest signed to buy Tellium's switches.
Mr. Carr said Tellium needed to offer warrants and stock to its customers as a way to compete with bigger competitors that can offer potential customers low-interest loans. 
"What this really is is a form of vendor financing," he said. "A lot of time companies are making decisions not based on who's got the best product but who's got the best financing."

HEADLINE: New Plants In California Racing Time 

BYLINE:  By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: YUBA CITY, Calif., Jan. 18 

 BODY:
These farmlands north of Sacramento seem an unlikely spot to represent California's hope of staving off the economic turmoil that threatens the state. The largest growers' cooperative in Sutter County is in bankruptcy proceedings, and the unemployment rate is 13 percent. 
 There has never been a high-tech boom here, local officials say, nor much tourism. And much to many residents' continuing ire, Yuba City showed up a few years ago dead last on Money magazine's annual survey of the 300 best places to live in America. 
 But southwest of town, hundreds of workers are struggling in two 10-hour-a-day shifts to build a huge power-generating plant in the nation's largest state, which has not built a major energy plant in more than a decade. Several such mammoth construction projects are under way in California, and energy analysts say they are essential to easing the deepening electricity crisis that has led to rolling blackouts in recent days, threatening the livelihood of businesses including Internet companies in Silicon Valley and farms in the inland valleys. 
Still, the construction of the plant here and at least eight others, many in similarly downtrodden areas, is a race against time. Some officials warn that, with no end in sight to the energy problems, the risk of blackouts may be even greater during the hottest days of the summer, the season when California normally hits its peak demand.
Even though the projects represent a total of 6,723 megawatts -- enough electricity to power nearly seven million homes -- they do not by themselves guarantee an adequate supply for California, since roughly half of the existing power plants are more than 30 years old and are in danger of being retired, according to the California Energy Commission, a state agency.
Whether the construction can outpace such mothballing is an open question, and, in a fitting touch of symbolism, the state's current power problems even impinged on the 500-megawatt plant here, known as the Sutter Project and owned by the Calpine Corporation of San Jose. Construction ground to a halt for more than an hour on Wednesday when the rolling blackouts spread across Sutter County.
"How bizarre is that?" said the project manager, Tom Miller, with a rueful chuckle as he walked through the plant today. "It takes power to make a power plant, and here we were, just shut down."
Despite that brief interruption, the gas-fired Sutter plant is on target to feed electricity to a transmission line stretching south toward Sacramento in July, and another 500-megawatt project, in Pittsburg, northeast of Oakland, is also scheduled to go on line by then, according to the energy commission. But Claudia Chandler, a spokeswoman for the commission, said it would not be until 2003 that the state is expected to have enough capacity to meet the peak demand in summer.
In the short term, many independent experts say that the only way the state can avoid supply problems is to expand conservation measures, especially those that significantly bring down the peak demand level. One way to do that is to make the power more expensive at times of the day when demand is greatest, giving businesses and consumers an incentive to change electricity use. 
"There needs to be a more rational pricing scheme," said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute, a research organization on the Berkeley campus. As important as the new plants under construction are to solving the overall problem of electricity supply in the state, he said, they are not a panacea.
"There is a definite concern that we're going to lose capacity with older plants shutting down just as we're adding this new capacity, and the demand has kept growing," he said. "So when we're going to catch up with this problem depends in great part on what happens on the demand side." 
California narrowly averted blackouts last summer by importing about one-sixth of the 46,000 megawatts it needed to meet peak demand, according to the California Independent System Operator, the nonprofit manager of the state's power grid that was created under the state's 1996 law that deregulated the electricity market.
In a move that has generated considerable hostility from California's neighbors, federal energy officials in recent weeks have ordered suppliers in the Northwest, the Rocky Mountains and elsewhere to export electricity to California to help stave off its problems. Normally, at this time of year, California has been in a position to export power, especially to states to the north who reach their peak demand for electricity during winter.
California's deregulation experiment is now the subject of near universal denunciation, from average consumers who suddenly found their lights turned off this week to Gov. Gray Davis, who in his recent annual address to the Legislature called deregulation a "colossal and dangerous failure" that had allowed "profiteering companies from out of state" to raise wholesale electricity prices by nearly 1,000 percent. 
And yet, on another level, the deregulation measure did exactly what it was supposed to do: it led to a wave of proposals by energy companies for projects like the one here in Yuba City that will use cleaner technology, meaning they are supposed to pollute less than the current generation of power plants. Many of those companies had held off from such construction for years because of uncertainty over how and even whether the state would move toward deregulation.
"The sort of facile blaming of the lack of construction on California's environmental restrictions is misguided," said Professor Borenstein. "California does have serious environmental rules, as a lot of other states do. But the real reason investors didn't build plants in the 1990's is that for a long time, no one knew what the rules were going to be."
In any event, no major plants were built during a decade when the state's population grew by four million and a soaring economy, led by the boom in high technology, sparked demand for electricity as well. Since deregulation passed, California has approved the nine plants now under construction, compared with none in the prior decade, and 22 more are in the regulatory pipeline. 
"The reputation of California being a Nimby state has been shattered," Steve Maviglio, Governor Davis's chief spokesman, said recently, referring to the "not in my back yard" reaction that prevented many plants from being approved in the past.
But the new plants do not represent any immediate solution to California's electricity shortages, which are aggravated by the precarious state of two big utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison, which are billions of dollars in debt. They are on the verge of bankruptcy, they say, because they had to buy electricity on the open wholesale market as prices have risen, but, under California's deregulation law, cannot pass costs on to the consumer.
And by and large, the new plants are not being built near the state's biggest metropolitan areas, but instead in places like Yuba City, where local officials welcomed the plants as an economic boon or where opponents lacked the clout to prevent them from being approved. Especially since the state's shortages became clear last year, state officials have moved aggressively to cut the regulatory procedures, and Governor Davis persuaded the Legislature last fall to pass what he called "fast-track" approval measures. 
But even as those new plants come on line here and elsewhere in the inland valleys and along the Mexican border, providing more electricity to the state's power grid, the transmission system has bottlenecks that prevent the power from getting to where the demand is heaviest. That problem is especially acute in the San Francisco Bay Area, where some industry officials liken the problem to the congestion on a freeway off-ramp that creates a jam even if the main highway is running smoothly.
Perhaps even more than the plants themselves, large transmission lines and their towers have been the subject of intense opposition. "If you think power plants are hard to build, transmission corridors are even harder," said Katherine Potter, a spokeswoman for the Calpine Corporation. 
Here in Yuba City, there was some opposition to the new plant, especially from those who live in areas closest to it or along the transmission corridor that will carry the new electricity into the state's power grid. 
"This power isn't really going to be used here," said Rosie Foster, a fourth-generation prune and walnut farmer who lives near the plant and belonged to a group that led the fight to block construction. "In the places where people want the power, that's where the power plants should be built," she said. "But this is a poor county. The people who run the county wanted the money." 
Sutter County officials say that the money -- $3 million a year in school and property taxes, and other benefits built into the package negotiated with Calpine -- was indeed a significant inducement. They said they hoped it would help attract more industry to the county, though they found it a bit of a paradox that the state was now looking to a place like Yuba City to help keep its economy robust.
"Sutter County has always lagged behind," said Larry Combs, the county administrative officer. "We've tended to lag behind when there's been an upsurge in the economy, but we fall immediately with a downturn. If having this plant here is going to help the state get out of trouble, that's got to be good for the county too."

A Crowded Field In L.A. Mayor's Race

BYLINE:  By B. Drummond Ayres Jr. 

 BODY:
Compared with last year, 2001 will be a slow year when it comes to elections. 
 New Jersey and Virginia will choose governors, and there will be a couple of special elections to fill vacant Congressional seats. But that's about it -- except for 500 or so mayoral races. 
 Many of the nation's biggest cities have contests scheduled, among them Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, New York, Seattle and St. Louis. But few, if any, have more candidates competing than Los Angeles.
Twenty-four candidates have signed up for the nonpartisan contest, among them a stand-up comic (hey, it's L.A.) and the pilot of one of the television news chase helicopters that brought the world O. J. Simpson (how very L.A.).
But at best only 6 of the 24 contenders have a realistic shot at replacing the departing mayor, Richard J. Riordan. They are Xavier Becerra, a congressman; Kathleen Connell, the state controller; James K. Hahn, the city attorney; Steve Soboroff, a real estate broker; Antonio Villaraigosa, the former speaker of the California Assembly; and Joel Wachs, a city councilman.
Which of the six is strongest is a guess considering how big and fragmented the overall field is and how big and fragmented the city is, particularly at a juncture when its population and economic bases are in great flux. So ultimately the best bet may be that the April 10 balloting will produce no clear winner and a runoff between the top two finishers will follow in June.
What is clear is that the eventual victor will instantly become a national figure and a possible contender for governor or some other higher office. But the job also carries political risks, including the challenge of convincing unhappy residents in some neighborhoods, especially the San Fernando Valley, that breaking free from the city to form their own independent cities is a disastrous idea.

 Articles on Wednesday and Thursday about Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed budget referred imprecisely to his proposal for school aid. 
His office says that his proposal for a 2.8 percent increase, when adjusted for projected declines in inflation and student enrollment, would still result in a net increase. Only if inflation and enrollment followed current trends would it amount to a slight decline in real dollars.

HEADLINE: Dell Increases Its Market Share As PC Sales Slow 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Global sales of personal computers slowed sharply in the fourth quarter, but the industry's second-largest seller, the Dell Computer Corporation, increased its share of the market with strong sales growth, two research companies said.
 Large makers of personal computers cut sales forecasts or turned in poorer-than-expected results for the last quarter, when holiday buying slumped unexpectedly. Many analysts have blamed economic uncertainty and a slower upgrade cycle for the weaker sales. 
 But a "saturation of the consumer market and a general lack of compelling reasons to buy may be more serious concerns," Loren Loverde, director of research for the International Data Corporation, said in a statement released Friday.
Fourth-quarter global growth in personal computer sales was 9.2 percent, a sharp slowdown from the rate earlier in the year, according to International Data.
Figures from a competing market research firm, Dataquest, a unit of the Gartner Group, estimated the growth rate at 10.1 percent in the quarter, with 37.9 million units sold. Dataquest said the slow close to the year dragged down the annual growth rate for all of 2000 to 14.5 percent, from 23 percent in 1999 and 15 percent to 16 percent in 1998 and 1997.
Both research firms said the Compaq Computer Corporation remained the top personal computer vendor in unit terms but posted the slowest growth of the top four companies.
Dell gained the most. International Data showed Dell gaining 2 percentage points of market share, with 30.9 percent growth in the fourth quarter, while Dataquest said Dell unit sales rose 41 percent.
Hewlett-Packard, the third-largest computer maker, had a sales increase of just less than 19 percent, both firms said.
Andrew Neff, an analyst at Bear, Stearns, said Dell's growth positioned it to take the global market share leadership from Compaq in a year or two. But he said the strong showing did not necessarily mean there was upside to his sales estimates for Dell.
Dataquest also said that slow sales at Apple Computer pulled down the industrywide data.
"Apple's shipments in the U.S. and worldwide markets fell by 50 percent and 40 percent respectively. Had Apple achieved flat growth, total market growth would have been almost 2 percentage points higher in the U.S. and one percentage point higher worldwide," Dataquest said.
Both firms saw more opportunity for PC sales growth outside the United States, where people and businesses own fewer computers.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Southern Energy has a new name, a new logo and a plan to let everyone know about the changes.

BYLINE:  By Jane L. Levere 

 BODY:
SOUTHERN ENERGY, one of the largest power companies in the United States, has changed its name to the Mirant Corporation and will begin advertising the change today.
 Mirant, based in Atlanta, which is 80 percent owned by the Southern Company, is scheduled to complete a spinoff from the parent company on April 2; 20 percent of Southern Energy was sold in an initial offering last fall. One requirement of the public offering was that Southern Energy, started in 1992 by Southern Company, changed its name. 
 When the spinoff is complete, Mirant will continue to focus on power production and on energy risk management and marketing in North and South America, Asia and Europe. 
The president and chief executive of Mirant, S. Marce Fuller, said more than half of the company's profit was earned in the United States, an amount that she expected would decline to 40 percent and 50 percent in the next five years.
After the spin off, Mirant will remain a regulated holding company for utilities serving Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Mississippi.
Mirant hired Siegelgale of New York, a branding and strategy agency, to develop its new name and create a branding and marketing strategy.
Executives at Siegelgale said the name Mirant was derived from the Latin words "mire," which they said means to wonder, and "mirum," which they said means extraordinary or remarkable.
"The name embodies our vision for the company," Ms. Fuller of Mirant said. "We see opportunity and seize it. We want to change the world with energy, wherever we go we want to make a difference."
David Srere, who oversees Siegelgale's work for Mirant, said his company had determined "that the truth of Southern Energy is that it's a very nice, honest group of people with incredible drive who see opportunity where others don't."
"The concept of seeing opportunity defines and differentiates them," Mr. Srere said.
Besides creating the Mirant name, Siegelgale has also devised a new logo, two triangles in two shades of blue that intersect to form a third triangle, in a third shade of blue.
"Southern Energy's business," Mr. Srere said, "integrates operations and generating expertise with risk management and marketing. These two pieces come together at a point in the logo, and that point is Mirant."
Ms. Fuller also suggested that the three triangles in the logo represented the three geographic regions where Mirant did business, the Americas, Europe and Asia.
She also said that in developing its name and branding campaign, Mirant was concerned that it not lose "all the good things we brought from Southern Company, technological excellence, financial strength and commitment to communities."
"We wanted to take our proud image from the past," Ms. Fuller said, "and build up a new reputation and image, to show we are innovative, inventive and market driven."
"Our strategy is to aggressively grow the company at least 20 percent to 25 percent per year," she added.
To publicize the name, Mirant will spend $6 billion to $8 million on a campaign aimed at inside and outside of the company.
The campaign will include global meetings with Mirant's 7,000 employees, to educate them about the name and branding efforts; announcements to customers, business partners and government regulators and a revamped Web site.
Another part of the campaign is print advertising, which will begin today.
Advertising aimed to Mirant's customers and the general energy market are running in publications like The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times, The Houston Chronicle, The Atlanta Journal and Constitution and The Economist.
The first advertisement says "Nice to meet you" in several languages and continues: "We're not going to waste a lot of energy introducing ourselves. You already know us. We're Mirant, a new global energy company formerly known as Southern Energy. We believe our energy is best spent finding opportunities for our customers. . . . Because today, the most important thing an energy company can generate is opportunity."
In discussing the challenges that Mirant would face after its spinoff, Kit Konolige, a managing director at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said the company must sell "a commodity that is undifferentiated from that of all their competitors."
"Trying to get customers to pay more than they do for their competitors' product will be difficult," Mr. Konolige said. "What they'll try to sell is reliability of service, that we'll be there no matter what."
He also said he did not know "how much difference" Mirant's new name would make. 
It's a pretty hard thing to put a finger on," he said.

HEADLINE: Roadblocks Right and Left for Mexican President 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
President Vicente Fox took power promising nothing less than a second Mexican revolution. Seven weeks later, reality is setting in. 
 If Mr. Fox wants to be more than a cheerleader for change, he must persuade a recalcitrant Congress, dominated by his opponents, to pass new laws and amend the Constitution. The old guard is putting up resistance, right and left. 
 This is the new politics of Mexico, which Mr. Fox helped create: the rough-and-tumble of democracy. 
Each of the new president's first big proposals -- to transform Mexico's electric grid with help from abroad, rewrite the tax code and guarantee rights for 10 million Indians -- represents the struggle between what Mexico was in the 20th century and what Mr. Fox wants it to become in the 21st. 
But Mexico's Constitution virtually forbids foreign investment in electricity production. Political and popular opposition to tax reform is fierce. Some members of the old ruling party say that granting even limited autonomy to Mexico's 10 million Indians would be the death of the nation. All signs are that the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, which ran Mexico for seven decades, and the left-leaning Party of the Democratic Revolution, may block these big initiatives.
For 70 years, a Congress led by the governing party rubber-stamped the all-powerful presidents' proposals. Now things are different, as Mr. Fox acknowledged in his Dec. 1 inaugural address. "The President proposes; Congress disposes," he said. 
"He's going to run into a wall with this Congress, which has its own authority, if he tries to abuse his power," warned Marti Batres, the Party of the Democratic Revolution's leader in the lower house of Congress.
No party now holds a majority in Congress, which was elected, like Mr. Fox, in July. Nothing can pass if supported solely by members of Mr. Fox's National Action Party, which holds 46 of 128 Senate seats and 207 of 500 seats in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies. And no coalitions are coming together. 
The PRI, bloodied but unbowed by Mr. Fox's election, still holds a plurality -- 60 seats in the Senate and 211 in the Chamber. Its national leader, Dulce Maria Sauri, insists that it is "not just the party of opposition, but the party of choice" in Mexico. And it looks as if the party will choose to oppose Mr. Fox at nearly every turn. 
For the left-leaning Party of the Democratic Revolution, ideology is the issue when it fights in the name of workers and the poor against Mr. Fox's pro-business policies. But for the long-governing party, it is power. Its leaders hope that if Mr. Fox fails to deliver on his big promises, the party could win back the presidency six years from now.
It has already attacked his schemes for rewiring the electric grid and imposing new taxes. And few predict that the party will embrace Indian rights when hundreds of Zapatista rebels march from the jungles of Chiapas to the capital to begin peace talks in six weeks. 
Five days after his inauguration, Mr. Fox formally asked Congress to approve accords reached four years ago between the government and the Zapatistas, but never enacted. They would let all Indian communities make local laws and elect local officials through village meetings, give them "equitable access to the distribution of national wealth" and grant them land rights they have lost. 
The measure is a constitutional change, requiring a two-thirds vote in Congress. The Senate president, Enrique Jackson, a PRI leader, flatly says the party will oppose it. Without the party's votes, the accords cannot pass, and the peace talks probably will be doomed.
Then there is Mr. Fox's move to impose a 15 percent tax on food and medicine -- perhaps the most unpopular measure he has proposed so far. 
In the United States, taxes are 30 percent of the gross domestic product; in Mexico they are only 11 percent. If that rose to 15 or 20 percent, Mr. Fox could increase spending on the basics -- schools, roads, poverty -- while balancing the budget. 
Tax avoidance in Mexico is widespread. Many rich people and small businesses simply pay nothing. As much as a third of the economy is off the books. Tackling tax evasion would be an enormous task and would take years to accomplish. So Mr. Fox and his advisers believe that the quickest and easiest way to increase revenues is to tax most types of food and medicine.
But Congress will not go along. Most members won't even discuss it, Mr. Batres of the Party of the Democratic Revolution says. 
"The two parties are clearly opposed," said Miroslava Garcia, the economic policy chief in the lower house for the Party of the Democratic Revolution, which holds 15 seats in the Senate and 52 in the lower house. "I don't see how President Fox can advance it alone." 
The PRI's fiscal chief in Congress, Jorge Chavez Presa, is openly dismissive of the tax plan and the thinking behind it. "It's a new administration, with stars in its eyes," he said. "If Fox insists on presenting this type of proposal, it will be a total failure."
The plan has been denounced by everyone from pharmacy owners to Catholic prelates; the archbishop of Jalapa, Sergio Obeso Rivera, called it barbaric. The senora in the street is unenthusiastic, too. 
"Toothpaste, you can tax toothpaste, that's one thing, but medicine is quite another," said Beatriz Vergara Espinosa, 33, who works in a Mexico City insurance office. Her boss, Guadalupe Bello Morin, 46, agreed. "I'm sure the government can find something else to tax," she said. "There are a lot of people in this country evading taxes. We pay, but they don't."
Mexico's economy, in a long, slow but fairly steady recovery from the disastrous peso crash of 1995, may survive and even thrive without new taxes. But without new sources of electrical power, it might not.
Since 1995, demand for electricity has been growing 6 to 8 percent a year; power production has risen by 1 or 2 percent. Tens of billions of dollars must be invested in new plants to meet the need. Mexico cannot afford that, Mr. Fox says, so it must turn to foreign investors.
The problem is that the Constitution gives the government exclusive power to produce energy, as a point of national pride. "With electricity, the only way to capture the interest of investors is by modifying the Constitution and removing state exclusivity," said Juan Camilo Mourino, a member of the lower house from the National Action Party and chairman of the chamber's energy commission. 
President Fox proposes to change the Constitution to let private companies generate electricity, without selling off government power plants or transmission networks to private companies. Today, the federal government spends $3.5 billion a year subsidizing electricity for domestic use, paying 13 cents to produce each kilowatt-hour, but selling it to people for 6 cents. Mr. Fox intends to pit government production against private companies, selling electricity at the lowest cost on an open market. 
But his predecessor, President Ernesto Zedillo, tried privatizing electricity in 1999 and ran into a brick wall. Not even his own party supported him; with an election looming, it ducked the issue. The left remains opposed on the ground that private investment will be "the death of a public service," said Maria del Rosario Tapi Media, a Chamber of Deputies member from the party.
Mr. Fox may have better luck if the old ruling party will cut a deal with him. "Fox's electricity proposal is less radical than Zedillo's," said Agustin Basave, the head of the political science department at the Technical Institute of Monterrey. "But getting it passed is going to depend on Fox's relationship with the PRI. The PRI is not going to give its support free."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Education Leads Silicon Valley Wish List

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
So what do technology executives want from President Bush? And will they have a voice?
 Over the decades, with various men in the White House, top executives from information technology heavyweights like I.B.M., Motorola, Intel and Hewlett-Packard have been well known and sometimes influential figures in Washington. 
 Robert W. Galvin and other Motorola executives played prominent roles in trade disputes with Japan from the 1970's on, John A. Young of Hewlett-Packard became the business world's most prominent spokesman on American competitiveness in the 1980's and Thomas Watson Jr., after retiring from I.B.M., took on the sensitive post of ambassador to the Soviet Union in the cold war.
The Clinton years, though, featured the passage into political adulthood of younger companies linked to the growth of the Internet, an eclectic group including equipment vendors like Sun Microsystems, EMC and Cisco Systems and software and service providers like Oracle and America Online (now AOL Time Warner). 
Policy makers also gained new respect for Silicon Valley's venture capitalists and entrepreneurs at start-up companies -- not to mention a taste for the campaign contributions they generated. 
Such newcomers may find themselves in a position to exercise substantial influence with the new Bush administration, according to experts like Barry Rubin, a professor at the George Washington University Graduate School of Political Management in Washington. 
Mr. Rubin said the technology sector had matured enough that many more executives recognize Washington's relevance, especially when it comes to the decisions President Bush makes in filling vacancies on regulatory agencies and naming assistant and deputy secretaries in crucial cabinet departments. 
"That's where their influence could really be felt," Mr. Rubin said. 
Besides sympathetic political appointments, though, what does the technology industry want from Washington? 
"Education is the issue that resonates, whatever party they're from," said Rich White, a former congressman who recently became chief executive of TechNet, a nonpartisan political meeting ground for Silicon Valley executives. "They are all concerned with math and science education and getting technology into the classroom. There's a strong sense of the need to do something quickly."
Mr. White says TechNet also sees a strong consensus for pushing Congress to grant President Bush so-called fast-track authority for negotiating trade agreements. 
There is a growing awareness that the technology industry could be affected by government policies affecting the general economic climate -- but little agreement on what should be done in that sphere, he said. Nor is there a consensus in the high-technology industry on antitrust and many other issues, Mr. White said. 
Indeed, some of that diversity is apparent even among the technology executives Mr. Bush invited to Texas earlier this month for a private briefing that was part of his preparation to succeed President Clinton. 
Because this silicon cabinet was hand picked to include only people who had backed Mr. Bush in his race with Vice President Al Gore, it was hardly surprising when reports of that meeting recounted their support for Bush initiatives like a broad-based tax cut. 
Craig Barrett, president and chief executive of Intel, said in an e-mail message to a reporter after the meeting that a tax cut and "coherent energy strategy" would be the best ways to restore consumer confidence. 
But when the 16 executives who visited with Mr. Bush were each asked recently to comment on the most important steps the government could take for high-technology businesses, the half-dozen who chose to respond tended to cite priorities other than a tax cut. 
Here are excerpts from the six executives' responses:

Richard J. Egan
Chairman and co-founder
EMC
We need to keep our economy growing smarter by investing in the skills of our children. In spite of the wealth of new opportunities, the number of graduates in computer science and engineering continues to be inadequate. To change this, we need to get students more interested in math and science at an early age. We need to do more than simply bridge the digital divide with technology in classrooms. Gifted teachers in K-12 can make all the difference in the career path of a child. Programs to attract new teachers for science and math and to allow retired technical professionals to teach math and science in the classroom would go a long way in helping to address the unprecedented opportunities ahead of us.

Gregory W. Slayton
Chairman and chief executive
ClickAction
Massive gains in private sector productivity -- due in large part to improvements in information technology -- have not been matched in the public sector. If federal government labor productivity grows at even one-half the rate of private sector nonfarm labor productivity over the past four years, this administration could realize $65 billion to $85 billion in labor savings over the next four years. President Bush has an opportunity to save billions for use on other initiatives or to pay down the national debt. At the same time, he would be freeing up thousands of younger professionals who might have otherwise taken public sector jobs for work in the private sector, where they are badly needed. More effective utilization of information technology makes this a very real possibility. 

James C. Morgan
Chairman and chief executive
Applied Materials
While the Fed rate cut and front-loaded tax cuts are needed as short-term stimulators, nothing will impact America's long-term prosperity more than strong trade policy. Technology is America's enduring competitive advantage in the global economy, and we must leverage this advantage to boost exports and grow high-quality, high-wage jobs and provide tax revenue here at home by opening markets around the world. Trade policy affects the technology community in many ways, from tax policies to export controls to work-force issues. It will be President Bush's job to build a new consensus on Capitol Hill and across America that trade and global commerce are critical to our national well-being. 

Craig Barrett
President and chief executive
Intel
The government needs to provide leadership to help fix the K-12 education system, especially in the areas of math and science. Science and mathematics drive new technologies, and new technologies drive the standard of living and economic growth. To maintain a competitive edge requires widespread math and science competency. This is a complex issue, and it will not be solved easily. It will require government, industry and educators to cooperate; it will require teaching improvements; and it will require accountability in the system. The National Commission on Math and Science Teaching for the 21st Century recommendations, combined with President Bush's emphasis on reading skills in early school years, is a good place to start. 

Michael Dell
Chairman
Dell Computer
Improving the quality of America's education is the single most important impact the federal government can make on business. Education is essential to the development of a competitive work force and the Internet must be integrated into learning environments from the beginning. Access to technology in the classroom challenges children, encourages them to learn and can put them on equal footing with peers around the world. Government must continue to support programs that will bring technology and the Internet into the hands and minds of children and teachers.

Scott McNealy
Chairman and chief executive
Sun Microsystems
The single most important issue facing America's high-tech sector is also the most important issue for everyone else: keeping the United States economy strong. I have great concern that the Fed has been too obsessed with inflation, and that by continually raising interest rates, considerable damage has been done. With low unemployment, a rising G.D.P., and more people making good wages, you shouldn't have to raise interest rates. Those are all good things. Let's hope the recent rate reversal isn't too little, too late.

HEADLINE: Head of Bank of America Said to Be Planning to Retire Early 

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
Hugh L. McColl Jr., chairman and chief executive of the Bank of America Corporation, will announce this week that he will retire in April, more than a year ahead of schedule, officials familiar with his plans say.
 Mr. McColl described his plans last week at a meeting with employees. 
 In recent months, Mr. McColl, 65, has turned over most management decisions to Kenneth D. Lewis, president of the bank. Industry experts expect Mr. Lewis to succeed him. 
Mr. McColl's "day-to-day involvement has been on the wane for a while now," said Thomas Theurkauf Jr., an analyst with Keefe Bruyette & Woods, a brokerage firm. A spokesman for Bank of America said he could not comment on the report.
Mr. McColl became chief executive of the NCNB Corporation, a Charlotte, N.C.-based bank with $12 billion in assets, in 1983. A famously aggressive ex-Marine, he pursued a string of mergers and acquisitions, ultimately combining what was then NationsBank with the BankAmerica Corporation in 1998. Today, Bank of America, with $642 billion in assets, has operations in 21 states and the District of Columbia. 
Mr. McColl originally planned to retire in 1999, a year after the Bank of America deal was completed. But after David Coulter, his heir apparent and the former chief executive of BankAmerica, resigned, the bank's board asked Mr. McColl to stay on until June 2002. Mr. McColl's new retirement plans were first reported yesterday in The Charlotte Observer.
The change in leadership comes at a rough time for Bank of America. It has lent aggressively to highly leveraged companies, and with the economy slowing, executives are preparing for a possible increase in problem loans. 
Bank of America's provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter was $1.21 billion, compared with $350 million a year earlier, and the bank's chief financial officer said last week that provisions for credit losses could reach $3 billion this year.
Thanks in part to concerns about loan quality, the bank's stock has fallen as the economy has weakened. Based on Friday's closing price of $49.19 a share, Bank of America's stock has fallen 35 percent from its post-merger peak of $75.50 a share in July 1999. 
Mr. McColl is regarded as a highly successful deal maker, but Bank of America's focus now is on streamlining operations, Mr. Theurkauf said. "Now it's execution time," he said. "Hugh McColl was a great builder, but now that the bank is built, it's time to make it better."
Mr. McColl's impending retirement is part of a changing of the guard at the top of the banking industry. He is now expected to retire just weeks after his biggest rival in banking, Edward Crutchfield Jr., the chairman of First Union. Both men undertook a series of deals to build Charlotte-based regional banks into national powerhouses. And both banks are now suffering from business setbacks and rising numbers of problem loans as the economy slows.

HEADLINE: Iraq Rebuilt Weapon Factories, U.S. Officials Say 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN LEE MYERS and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 21 

 BODY:
Iraq has rebuilt a series of factories that the United States has long suspected of producing chemical and biological weapons, according to senior government officials. The new intelligence estimate could confront President Bush with an early test of his pledge to take a tougher stance against President Saddam Hussein than the Clinton administration did.
 The factories -- in an industrial complex in Falluja, west of Baghdad -- include two that were bombed and badly damaged by American and British air raids in December 1998 to punish Mr. Hussein for his refusal to cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors, the government officials said. 
 The new intelligence estimates were mentioned, but without any such specific details, in a report on weapons threats released on Jan. 10 by the outgoing secretary of defense, William S. Cohen. It warned that Iraq had rebuilt at least its weapons infrastructure and may have begun covertly producing some chemical or biological agents. 
Last week, the officials provided details on what they said was the reconstruction of the two factories, and the resumption of the production of chlorine at a third in the same complex.
The factories have ostensibly commercial purposes, but all three were previously involved in producing chemical or biological agents and were among those closely monitored by the United Nations inspectors, the officials said. One of the rebuilt factories, for example, is making castor oil used in brake fluid, the Iraqis say, but the mash from castor beans contains a deadly biological toxin called ricin, the officials said. 
Since the air strikes in 1998, Mr. Hussein's government has refused to allow a new team of international weapons inspectors to begin work in Iraq. Officials said that without on-the-spot inspections, the United States did not yet have firm evidence the factories are now producing chemical or biological agents. "There's no smoking gun," one said.
But a senior military officer who closely follows Iraq and its president, Saddam Hussein, said, "We don't know for sure, but given his past known behavior, there's probably a pretty fair chance that's what's happening."
Throughout the campaign and transition, Mr. Bush and his national security advisers pledged to confront Mr. Hussein more aggressively than Mr. Clinton had. Some of the same men -- particularly Gen. Colin L. Powell, the new secretary of state, and Vice President Dick Cheney -- helped President Bush's father lead the international coalition that ousted Iraqi forces from Kuwait a decade ago. 
But Mr. Hussein remains in place, and poses a problem that is in many ways more complex now, with arms inspections blocked and many of America's allies questioning the sanctions that remain in place against Iraq.
"The Iraq problem has changed a lot since the last Bush administration left office," said a government official who will continue to work in the new Bush administration and has been involved in preliminary briefings on Iraq. "It's become a lot more complex. That's beginning to dawn on them."
In his inaugural address on Saturday, Mr. Bush did not mention Iraq specifically but vowed to "confront weapons of mass destruction, so that a new century is spared new horrors." In an interview before taking office, he suggested that his administration would not tolerate an Iraq rearmed with nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.
"Saddam Hussein must understand that this nation is very serious about preventing him from the development of weapons of mass destruction and any thought in his mind that he should use them against our friends and allies in the Middle East," Mr. Bush said.
Condoleezza Rice, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, was receiving intelligence briefings at the White House today and did not return a call requesting comment.
Since the election, neither Mr. Bush nor his aides have detailed how they intend to change Mr. Clinton's diplomatic and military strategy against Iraq.
Some advisers, including Mr. Cheney and the new secretary of defense, Donald H. Rumsfeld, have previously advocated a more hawkish approach. But even some of Mr. Bush's advisers acknowledge that containing Mr. Hussein, much less isolating him, will be increasingly difficult.
American and British planes continue to patrol the "no-flight" zones over northern and southern Iraq. Such patrols are routinely fired upon; indeed, Iraq launched a surface-to-air missile at one only hours before Mr. Bush took office on Saturday, prompting American jets to respond by striking antiaircraft batteries and a radar site.
Such strikes help ratchet up Iraqi anger at the United States; today, the Iraqis said the American strikes killed six civilians in Samawa, an assertion that American military officials did not immediately dispute, while noting that they had not intended to strike civilian targets.
The sanctions imposed against Iraq after it occupied Kuwait in August 1990 are gradually losing international support, with even some American allies exploring ways to end them. Diplomats and businessmen from countries as varied as Russia, Turkey and Italy have defied the ban on commercial flights into Iraq's capital, Baghdad.
The rising price of oil has also allowed Iraq to raise billions in revenues, significantly easing the strains placed on its economy after the Persian Gulf war. While most of that revenue is strictly controlled by the United Nations, intelligence reports suggest that Mr. Hussein has been able to divert $500 million to $1 billion a year and raise another $1 billion to $2 billion in illicit smuggling.
Iraq's military remains a shadow of the force that invaded Kuwait in 1990, but American intelligence officials strongly suspect that Mr. Hussein is using at least some of that money to rebuild parts of his military, which has been in steady decline since the gulf war, as well as his weapons programs. 
Two government officials said Iraq has successfully created front companies that are now being used to purchase and smuggle into Iraq equipment, weaponry and spare parts that are prohibited under the sanctions, including tires for Iraqi jets and transmissions for its tanks. One official said those companies were also helping to procure illicit items used in nuclear, chemical and biological programs. 
Mr. Hussein's government has also asked the United Nations to approve purchases for equipment or material -- including things needed to produce chlorine -- that American officials suspect are being diverted to prohibited weapons programs.
As a condition for ending the Persian Gulf war, Mr. Hussein's government agreed to destroy its nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programs, as well as production of long-range missiles able to launch such weapons.
Despite years of cat-and-mouse games with the Iraqis, the previous team of United Nations inspectors succeeded in destroying large quantities of weapons and discovering covert programs to create chemical and biological weapons.
For more than two and a half years, however, there have been no meaningful inspections inside Iraq. After the air raids in 1998, Pentagon officials estimated that they had set back Iraq's weapons programs by a year or two -- a period that has now elapsed.
President Clinton vowed that the United States would resort to military force if Iraq resumed work on its nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, but until the end officials in the administration and the intelligence agencies had conflicting views on whether the Iraqis had done so.
One senior defense official who will continue to serve under Mr. Bush said that there was "lots of circumstantial evidence," including the reconstruction of the factories, the resumption of production at chemical-warfare plants that had been closed and efforts to import components needed for chemical or biological weapons production.
Another official who is also staying on said he did not believe that Mr. Hussein had begun producing prohibited weapons in mass quantities. He argued that Mr. Hussein, sensing an erosion of support for the American position, would not want to give the United States a justification for renewed strikes.
Nevertheless, the factories in Falluja -- whose reconstruction has been detected in satellite photographs -- have raised alarms, the officials agreed.
Besides the factory making castor oil, the second rebuilt factory is believed to be producing pesticides and herbicides. "You don't know what they're doing in there," the official said. "They could be making pesticides or they could be making something more nefarious than pesticides."
While officials have previously disclosed that Iraq had rebuilt missile plants destroyed in the 1998 strikes, the Jan. 10 report released by Mr. Cohen was the first public acknowledgment of the resumption of work at suspected chemical and biological plants.
"Some of Iraq's facilities could be converted fairly quickly to production of chemical weapons," the report said at one point. It went on to warn, "Iraq retains the expertise, once a decision is made, to resume chemical agent production within a few weeks or months, depending on the type of agent."

HEADLINE: The Fugitive Commodities Trader Who CanGo Home Again 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
They are both billionaire philanthropists who enhanced their fortunes in financial deals that put them into big trouble with the federal justice system. But when President Clinton issued 140 pardons on Saturday as one of his last official acts, Marc Rich made the list and Michael R. Milken did not.
 Mr. Milken, a premier junk bond financier of the 1980's, was apparently bumped after prosecutors and securities regulators protested. In the case of Mr. Rich, the commodities trader who went to live in Switzerland after he was charged with evading $48 million in taxes and violating United States sanctions by trading oil with Iran, the protests may have arrived too late. 
 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was the United States attorney whose office prosecuted Mr. Rich in 1983, said yesterday that he was "shocked that the president would pardon him," because, "after all, he never paid a price."
"He ran away" and flouted American law, the mayor added. "He was one of the most wanted fugitives by the F.B.I. for years and years."
Other financiers who also received presidential pardons included Mr. Rich's former partner, Pincus Green, who went with him to Switzerland and Salim B. Lewis, a trader who pleaded guilty to criminal charges that he had helped manipulate a stock price in 1986.
Mr. Rich, 65, was indicted on charges of trading in Iranian oil at a time when Americans were being held hostage in Iran. If he had been found guilty of all the charges against him, he could have faced more than 300 years in prison. He reportedly offered to pay fines to settle the charges but refused to agree to Justice Department officials' insistence that he serve time in prison.
Later, he was accused separately, but not charged, with skirting sanctions against South Africa by selling oil there from the Soviet Union for above-market prices and helping Russian oligarchs to extract millions of rubles from the foundering Russian economy.
His former wife, Denise Rich, a songwriter and a philanthropist, is a fund-raiser for Democrats, including President Clinton and Senator Hilary Rodham Clinton. Ms. Rich declined to discuss her financial agreement with Mr. Rich in a recent interview with The New York Times. According to one of her lawyers, their divorce was bitterly disputed.
Neither of the Riches could be reached for comment yesterday. 
Marc Rich was born in Belgium and came to the United States with his parents during World War II.
After the indictment, he moved to Zug, Switzerland, where he cut a wide swath, financing local sports teams and befriending officials. Switzerland did not recognize extradition requests based on charges of infractions of financial laws.
He has traded in crude oil, aluminum and lead as well as real estate in Spain, Switzerland and Eastern Europe. His philanthropic gifts have included several million dollars to museums in Jerusalem, gifts to concert halls in Switzerland, an eye clinic in Zimbabwe and a health program for Palestinian children, according to Bloomberg News.
He told the Israeli newspaper Ma'ariv last year that he had offered to pay $100 million in fines to settle the tax fraud case.
Mr. Lewis, who was once a special adviser to the Securities and Exchange Commission, was indicted, along with his brokerage firm, in 1988 on charges of stock manipulation, conspiracy and related offenses. He was charged with driving up the price of shares of the Fireman's Fund Corporation before a public offering of that company's shares.
Mr. Lewis pleaded guilty to three counts of stock manipulation, violating margin requirements and keeping false books and records. Mr. Lewis's actions benefited the American Express Company, which Mr. Lewis had assisted in earlier transactions. There were no charges brought against American Express, which said at the time that an internal investigation had uncovered no wrongdoing.
Mr. Lewis was sentenced to three years' probation and several thousand hours of community service.

HEADLINE: Victory in Schools Suit Spotlights Need for Free Legal Work 

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
Five years ago, Michael A. Rebell found himself celebrating one of the greatest victories of his legal career with a knot in his stomach. New York State's highest court, the Court of Appeals, had just ruled that a lawsuit filed by a tiny nonprofit group that he helped found, the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, could continue.
 The group was accusing the state of using a school financing formula that shortchanged schoolchildren in New York City of hundreds of millions of dollars a year. In a common legal maneuver intended to save court time, the group's lawsuit had been combined with similar suits filed by the City of New York and its Board of Education. 
 But in its ruling, the Court of Appeals threw the city and the school board out of the case, finding that only individual parents, like the plaintiffs in the campaign's lawsuit, could sue the state. The campaign would face the mammoth task of suing the state on its own.
"I remember standing in our conference room with Bob Hughes," the group's only other lawyer, Mr. Rebell recalled. "We were both scratching our heads and saying 'My God, what are we going to do now? We're going to have a huge trial against the state of New York.' "
Mr. Rebell said he sent out "a legal S.O.S." to the city's major law firms. What happened next was an anomaly.
Several law firms expressed interest in handling the lawsuit, but in the end Mr. Rebell chose Simpson Thacher & Bartlett because of its strong commitment to the case. The firm assigned eight lawyers to the case and ended up donating $14 million in legal work and expenses. The legal battle stretched over five years, ending with a seven-month trial.
Two weeks ago, the tiny nonprofit and its large for-profit legal partner finally prevailed, winning a ringing, benchmark ruling that declared the state's financing formula deficient and discriminatory against minority students. The firm's work is believed to be the largest single donation of pro bono legal representation in the city. 
That is increasingly unusual in New York and other cities. Through the longest peacetime economic expansion in American history, the amount of pro bono work by New York's major law firms has risen slightly. Nationwide, pro bono work by major firms has plummeted.
"I would hope this case would serve as a motivator for other firms," Mr. Rebell said. "They see what can be accomplished."
For decades, government financing of nonprofit groups and pro bono work by private firms have helped provide legal services for those who cannot afford it, in many cases the working poor or the elderly involved in landlord-tenant, pension or other disputes. But in recent years, government cutbacks and a booming economy have resulted in an increased need for legal services. At the same time, major firms have not increased their pro bono work.
"There are a tremendous number of cases where people need lawyers and can't get them," said Tanina Rostain, a professor of legal ethics at New York Law School. "There is a desperate need."
The healthy economy, she said, has overwhelmed firms with paying clients. Internet companies and soaring stock markets led lawyers to demand higher and higher salaries. As a result, firms devoted resources to increasing earnings and froze or scaled back pro bono commitments.
The amount of pro bono work done by firms in New York City has risen only slightly in recent years, said William J. Dean, executive director of Volunteers of Legal Services, a local nonprofit that encourages pro bono work.
Several major law firms continue to take on major pro bono lawsuits against the city or state, he said. Debevoise & Plimpton helped sue the city over its policy of releasing mentally ill inmates from Rikers Island without a plan for continued treatment or housing. Davis Polk & Wardwell is helping sue the state over its failure to raise pay rates for court-appointed lawyers for the poor since 1986.
Mr. Dean said that while some law firms and lawyers do large amounts of pro bono legal work, others do next to none. A survey by The American Lawyer magazine published last July found that the major city firms doing the largest amounts of pro bono work per lawyer in 1999 were Debevoise & Plimpton; Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison; Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson; and Schulte Roth & Zabel.
The cost of pro bono work can be small when compared with what major firms take in. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett's $14 million donation over five years in the school case is dwarfed by its gross revenues in 1999 alone -- $434 million. Pro bono work also produces some benefits. A commitment to it helps firms recruit lawyers, many of whom find charity work rewarding, and the work can generate good publicity.
Mr. Rebell said Simpson Thacher & Bartlett's interest in his case stemmed from its chairman, Richard I. Beattie. Mr. Beattie founded New Visions for Public Schools, a local nonprofit group, and served on the Board of Education in the mid-1980's.
Joseph F. Wayland, the partner who coordinates the firm's pro bono work, became the chief litigator in the case. He grew so emotionally invested in it that he worked nights and weekends on the case and broke down in tears while delivering his closing argument at the trial.
Mr. Wayland, 43, said his devotion stemmed from his background and the "simple unfairness of providing hundreds of thousands of children with an inadequate education." An Upper East Side resident, he grew up attending public schools in Norwich, Conn., a depressed former mill town. 
The son of an electrical engineer who built nuclear submarines in nearby New London and a mother who did charity work, Mr. Wayland said he believed public schools are pivotal to American society. "Growing up in a middle class environment, schools were a place that provided opportunities," he said. "Schools were a vehicle for future success."
Now a partner in a white-shoe firm where senior lawyers routinely charge more than $500 an hour, he admitted that the city's public schools are not an issue in his life. "I send my children to private school. I can pay for it," he said. "But in New York City, 99 percent of the people don't have the choice that I have." 
Mr. Rebell, the campaign's lawyer, said he does not agree with the axiom that money buys justice. He said his group might have won the case without its wealthy patron, but he conceded that the victory would not have been as big. 
"We never could have given the judge the solid record he had," he said, referring to the evidence presented at trial. "We never could have gotten a decision of this profundity, this magnitude and depth without them."

Just Like a Film Script, From Jobless to Genius

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA DREIFUS 

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I. 

 BODY:
Dr. Shawn Carlson's biography reads like a mutant graft of Mr. Wizard meets Horatio Alger: an unhappy physicist working in a mainstream laboratory decides to quit his job and start a nonprofit organization aimed at encouraging the projects of backyard tinkerers and garage experimenters.
 As Dr. Carlson devotes himself to organizing his Society for Amateur Scientists, he drives his family to near-penury. Just as he is about to go broke, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation comes to the rescue with a "genius grant," and nearly $300,000. 
 "After MacArthur, I was a certified 'genius'; the day before I was just certifiable," Dr. Carlson, 40, said over coffee one morning in Providence, where he and his family have recently moved. Stocky, with sandy-blond hair, he has an open face and an easy laugh. 
In addition to his organizational work, Dr. Carlson has written the "Amateur Scientist" column in Scientific American magazine for the past five and a half years.
The column, however, is to be suspended in March to make room for "other good ideas for columns," said John Rennie, the magazine's editor in chief. "Amateur Scientist" had been a regular feature of the periodical since 1928.
Q. Define "amateur scientist."
A. We think of amateur scientists as anyone who is engaged in scientific inquiry for the sheer joy of it. If you include all the home tinkerers and amateur naturalists, there must be several million in the country.
Q. How American is the movement?
A. As American as apple pie. Many of the founding fathers were amateur scientists -- Benjamin Franklin.
Since the mid-1800's, farmers and everyday folk have been organized to make weather observations with the Smithsonian Institution. Thomas Jefferson organized weather-watchers in Virginia and gave them instrumentation to study climate change.
Q. Aside from the occasional eclectic discovery, are there areas where amateurs can make a discernible difference to the general body of scientific knowledge?
A. Most scientists don't really realize the tremendous contributions that amateurs have made over the decades. For instance, most of the global warming debate hinges on data collected by amateurs before the 1950's -- farmers, people like that.
Bird watchers have done incredible work on calculating the fate of various species. On environmental questions, I see a situation where amateurs could became a vast data collection army, measuring all kinds of things -- thickness of birds' eggs, magnetic field fluctuations.
Q. What exactly does the Society for Amateur Scientists do?
A. Democratize science. We hope we help encourage the scientific creativity in the everyday citizen. We believe that you don't just have to be a Ph.D. to do interesting science. S.A.S. serves as a switchboard for amateurs to trade ideas. In addition to publishing our bulletin, we print how-to information for projects and provide access to inexpensive equipment and chemicals. We also have mentors to help with projects, and a Web site: www.sas.org.
The Amateur Society has just opened up an observatory with a 16-inch telescope inside New Milford High School in Connecticut. Now the question is, What is the mission going to be? We're still having meetings about that.
First, we want to get the students in there, but there is going to be a tremendous lot of open time available on the thing. I'd love to link this to the Internet, so that amateurs around the world could use it, for a small fee. The idea is, If we can get the amateur astronomy community on it, we could maybe make $1,000 a night and then have the money to constantly upgrade the telescope.
Q. Name a few amateur projects that have come across your desk and that have intrigued you.
A. There's a guy named Roger Baker, and he has a design for a magnetometer that allows you to measure changes in the earth's magnetic fields. He uses materials bought at Radio Shack for about $10.
A wonderful project was done by two dear friends: George Schmermund and Greg Schmidt. They have developed a system to measure extremely tiny masses with very high precision.
The secret is to go to a surplus store and to buy one of those old analog meters. George invented a way of taking an old discarded galvanometer and turning it into a device that can measure a millionth of a gram. And then, my friend Greg computerized that device for a couple of dollars and turned it into a really powerful instrument so that now any amateur can measure tens of micrograms.
Q. Tell us about your grandfather, the late George Donald Graham.
A. Grandpa Don was a free-spirited wild man, a person with incredible scientific creativity. But he was one of those personalities who couldn't go through the standard course of instruction.
So he pursued his passion for mathematics and geology and biology on his own and he would frequently write really interesting papers that he couldn't get published because he didn't have "Ph.D." after his name.
My grandfather would produce a brilliant paper on gravity and corn -- and it just killed me that someone of this kind of talent would be excluded from the discussion just because he didn't have the credentials. Grandfather wore these rejections like a badge of honor on his sleeve. The only place that would publish him was the "Amateur Scientist" column of the Scientific American, a column which I authored for five and a half years.
Q. How much are you your grandfather's boy?
A. I'm very much like him. I've got his scientific talents. But as a younger man, I didn't want to make his mistakes -- so I got myself a Ph.D. in nuclear physics from U.C.L.A. and worked as an astrophysicist at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory from 1991 to 1993. There, I discovered I was like him in another way: I couldn't work on someone else's project and I couldn't keep a job. I drifted more and more toward involvement with the amateur scientific community.
Then in 1994, my wife and I left the Bay Area. She was about to enter graduate school in San Diego. I decided to use this change and take a huge chance to try to make a contribution as an amateur scientist.
I took the little savings we had and put it toward starting an organization for people like me -- a society for amateur scientists. I had dreamed about doing this for 10 years. It was a way of paying tribute to my grandfather.
Q. How does an unemployed astrophysicist get to be an organizational entrepreneur?
A. It was hard. I never took a salary. Mostly, my wife, Michelle Tetreault, and I ran up credit card debts and put our own money into it. We had a child, eventually two -- and we lived on my wife's graduate student stipend.
In 1995, I was asked to take over the "Amateur Scientist" column in the Scientific American and that provided $1,000 a month, later $1,500. You can imagine the difference that money made.
Q. Why were you so poor? Did your organization have difficulty finding funding?
A. Oh, yeah. We fell outside the normal funding guidelines. We couldn't get research dollars because -- guess what -- our investigators didn't have Ph.D.'s after their names. We couldn't get educational money because we weren't focusing on children.
On the other hand, we got a lot of moral support from prestigious science professionals. People like Kip Thorne, Douglas Osheroff and Robert G. Coleman were our advisory board.
The financial problems all came to a head in June of 1999, when Michelle was about to finish up her Ph.D. and have our second child. One day, she sat me down and said, "You may have to close S.A.S. down because you have to take care of your family."
And just like in the movies, as I stood there shaking my head, saying, "no, no, no," at that very minute, the phone rang with the news that the MacArthur people had granted me a "genius" fellowship -- $290,000! Once the MacArthur prize hit, we were legitimate.
Q. Next month, the Scientific American will cease publication of the "Amateur Scientist" column -- a feature that magazine has run with different authors since 1928. What are your feelings about the demise of a column that has meant so much to you?
A. Well, of course, I'm heartbroken.
Q. On a lighter subject, when you want to shop till you drop, where do you go?
A. I would like to say Radio Shack, but I would have to say that my favorite place is Hyatt's Electronics in San Diego. It's this little hole in the wall run by this guy named Dick Hyatt. In there, you can find -- anything. I go and say, "Dick, I need 250 resistors." And he'll say, "Fine, I've got six million. What values do you want?"

HEADLINE: The Call of the Wild Takes Its Toll on Reindeer 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE 

 BODY:
In Alaska, as elsewhere, natural disasters usually come in the form of an earthquake, flood or drought.
 But Gov. Tony Knowles recently sought a federal disaster declaration because an entirely different kind of natural force is destroying the livelihoods of many Alaskans: the call of the wild. 
 Its victims are Eskimos on the Seward Peninsula, the tundra-draped shoulder of land that juts west toward Russia. They are confronting a great gray-brown tide, bristling with antlers and thundering on more than a million hooves -- the Western Arctic caribou herd. 
The herd, which swells and shrinks in little-understood, decades-long cycles, has exploded in recent years. Recently, for only the second time in 100 years it began spilling onto the peninsula during its annual migration. That's when the trouble started. 
As the caribou arrive, they encounter the free-ranging reindeer, a domesticated subspecies of caribou that Seward's Eskimos have been herding commercially for 100 years.
As the caribou sweep the tundra seeking tufts of lichens, their tamer cousins, essentially following the call of the wild, join the migrating masses.
"It's like trying to stop waves coming in -- there's no way you can do it," said Rose Fosdick, the program director for the Kawerak Reindeer Herders Association in Nome, which represents 20 herders on or near the peninsula. 
The caribou, considered wildlife under state law, cannot be legally herded, although they can be shot at a rate of five a day per hunter. But caribou meat is stringy and tough because the rugged animals migrate hundreds of miles each year. The reindeer have richer, more tender -- and thus more valuable -- meat because they generally stay in one place.
The reindeer were first introduced from Siberia in the 1890's by missionaries and the United States government to provide a stable source of meat and income for Eskimos. 
Herders have also earned significant cash income each spring by cutting the reindeer's freshly emerged, velvet-coated antlers for export to manufacturers of traditional Asian medicines. (Adding to herders' woes, that market has shifted recently away from Alaskan reindeer antlers and toward New Zealand deer antlers, agriculture officials say.)
In a survey last year of the Eskimos running seven of the biggest herding operations on the peninsula, wildlife biologists from the University of Alaska at Fairbanks found that six had watched herds shrink to zero from 1,300 or more a few years ago.
Tom Gray, the seventh herder surveyed, was able to hold onto 600 of what had been a herd of 2,418 reindeer by moving them onto a remote spit on the coast that had not yet been reached by the caribou.
Mr. Gray also runs an adventure travel business, but other herders have few options. The caribou invasion is threatening what has become an entrenched -- albeit introduced -- way of life. 
"Right now, it's pretty dismal," said Dr. Knut Kielland, an ecologist with the Institute of Arctic Biology of the University of Alaska "We're scientists, but our sentiments are with the herders."
But not everyone on the peninsula is upset by the return of caribou, which vanished from the area in the 1800's, partly under the assault of hunters supplying meat to miners and others.
The herd has swelled to more than 400,000 animals from a low of 75,000 in the 1970's. And sport hunters and people involved in the growing tourism business in the region are thrilled, said John Coady, the regional director of the division of wildlife of the Alaska Fish and Game Department. 
"It's a complicated issue," Mr. Coady said. "If you or I were a reindeer herder, we'd be wringing our hands and wishing the caribou would go away, and wanting agencies to do everything they can to discourage caribou from moving onto their ranges. But the herders represent a small minority of our constituency, even on the Seward Peninsula."
Nonetheless, the herders have a substantial influence on the economies of a scattering of small villages around the peninsula, where twice-yearly roundups of reindeer provide employment and meat and also generate work for snowmobile repairmen and helicopter pilots and the like.
In 1998 and 1999, the herders received a total of $250,000 in aid from the Agriculture Department for loss of range land due to the invasion of caribou, said Karen Olson, the executive director of the state's Farm Service Agency, a branch of the federal agriculture agency. 
But in 2000, the federal rules changed and now a disaster declaration is required before any more aid can flow, Ms. Olson said. Losses to caribou herds are no different from losses to grizzly bear or wolves, she said.
"It's all part of what you get here when you're trying to make a living out of an area that's still in the wild," she said. 
Still, to the herders, she said, the caribou invasion is nothing less than a catastrophe. "It's kind of like a 100-year storm," she said. "Only it's a storm of animals."
The animals are both the same species, Rangifer tarandus, but about 7,000 years of domestication in Eurasia has produced the reindeer's tendency to circle in tight groups, in contrast to the caribou's tendency to spread far and wide.
Herders sometimes are able to disentangle their animals from the caribou, said Dr. Greg L. Finstad, a biologist leading the University of Alaska reindeer research effort. The reindeer are marked with colored plastic ear tags but, more important, have far less endurance than their wild cousins.
If a herder chases a mixed cluster of animals long enough with a snowmobile or helicopter, the reindeer become exhausted and drop out. The problem, Dr. Finstad said, "is that no matter where you go there are more caribou," so the retrieved reindeer simply run off once again.
If even a single caribou is accidentally driven into a corral with reindeer, it can disrupt the herd as it flails and leaps and tries to escape.
In the meantime, runaway reindeer that join the migrating caribou rarely end up fitting in. They do not generally interbreed because the domesticated animals mate and give birth a month earlier than caribou. This out-of-sync cycle creates other problems for the reindeer because pregnant does drop their calves before the mass of animals reaches its summer calving grounds on the North Slope.
Mothers that stay behind to nurse their calves are often picked off by predators or hunters. If they move with the herd, the abandoned calves soon die, Dr. Finstad said. 
For the moment, Mr. Gray, whose home base is the village of White Mountain, says his goal is to maintain at least a core of reindeer that can serve as the nucleus for a new industry if and when the caribou population drops.
"All you can do is hang on," he said.

HEADLINE: With Seattle a Vivid Memory, W.T.O. Seeks a New Host City 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization's last top-level meeting, which left Seattle reeling after violent protests, scores of arrests and property damage, was not the greatest advertisement to lure countries to be the host of its next big gathering later this year.
 Nonetheless, two of the W.T.O.'s 140 member countries are vying for the meeting, and the contest between Chile and the Persian Gulf state of Qatar has turned into another diplomatic wrangle. In the middle is the coming ministers' meeting, which is expected to attract thousands of representatives of governments and nongovernment groups as well as journalists. 
 The meeting, tentatively scheduled for next fall, will draw global attention because the W.T.O. may again try to start the round of trade talks that never got off the ground in Seattle in December 1999.
The venue, however, is looming as a problem because of unofficial worries about Qatar's ability to hold the meeting. Qatar, a nation of only 540,000 people, already had its collective feelings ruffled when Chile floated an offer last month.
Qatar's trade envoy, Fahed Awaid al-Thani, pointed out that his country had bid for the meeting as long ago as the Seattle meeting and had made an official offer. In October, however, Qatar acknowledged that it might not have enough hotel beds for the five-day meeting, and other countries were encouraged to make bids.
A team from the W.T.O. went to Qatar's capital, Doha, last year and found adequate conference facilities. An assessment team has also traveled to Santiago, however, though Chile has yet to make a formal offer.
Qatar has since sweetened its bid, saying it will rely on luxury villas and cruise ships to make up the lodging shortage.
Both countries were reviewed by the W.T.O.'s decision-making body last month, but no choice was made.
While countries typically seek out such huge international gatherings because of the prestige and money they bring, the W.T.O. has not been overwhelmed with offers since it became the target of disruptive protests. Even Geneva, the organization's home city, has been quietly reluctant.
A key sticking point for Qatar's candidacy is the admission of representatives of nongovernment organizations. Qatar has pledged free access, and an informal poll of W.T.O. representatives last week found no opposition to it.
But Human Rights Watch, based in New York, said today that a meeting in Qatar would shut down any possibilty of peaceful protest. Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said that holding the meeting in a country that limits the rights of assembly and association "would send a signal that it's O.K. to build the global economy on a foundation of repression -- exactly the oppoosite message the W.T.O. should be pronouncing."
Mr. Thani, whose enthusiasm for the meeting is tempered by memories of the two days he spent shut in at his Seattle hotel room, said: "We welcome peaceful demonstrations. We have the ability to control it."

HEADLINE: American Express Profits Met Forecast in4th Quarter 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
The American Express Company said yesterday that its fourth-quarter profit rose 12 percent as it gained new cardholders but said earnings growth in 2001 would be at the low end of its current target.
 The company, known for its signature green charge cards and traveler's checks, earned $677 million in the quarter, or 50 cents a share, compared with $606 million, or 44 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. 
 Analysts had expected American Express to earn 50 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. 
The company also said it expected earnings-per-share growth in 2001 to be at the low end of its expected 12 percent to 15 percent range because of weak financial markets and a slowing economy.
Shares of American Express fell $3.63, to $45.
The economy slowed in the fourth quarter, pinching growth at many financial companies and raising concerns about borrowers' ability to repay debt. But consumers continued to spend on their charge cards, and American Express was a beneficiary. In addition, it gained fees from managing money.
American Express made money as its total cards in circulation increased 12 percent, to 51.7 million, and its customers charged an average of $2,113 each to their cards in the quarter, up from $2,102 in the quarter a year earlier. Total loans to cardholders rose 23 percent, to $28.7 billion in the fourth quarter, it said.
More storeowners began accepting American Express cards in the quarter, helping the volume of business, it said.
Its revenue rose to $5.7 billion from $5.2 billion while its total billed business rose to $79 billion from $70.8 billion. And despite Wall Street's mounting concerns about bad loans, American Express said its net write-off rate, or percent of loans it does not expect to recover, improved slightly to 4.4 percent in the fourth quarter from 4.5 percent in 1999.
Profits at its travel-related services arm, which includes its large charge card business, rose to $470 million, up 16 percent from the 1999 fourth quarter.
At its financial advisers unit, profits rose 2 percent, to $242 million. The quarter's stock market slump dented growth at this unit, the company said. Profits at its small banking unit edged up to $6 million from $4 million.

HEADLINE: Indicators Fell Again In December 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
The index of leading economic indicators fell for a third consecutive month in December, indicating that further interest rate cuts may come in the near future, a private research group said today.
 The Conference Board said the index fell 0.6 percent in December after dropping 0.4 percent in November and October. The November drop was revised from a previously reported 0.2 percent decline. 
 The December reading was much lower than the 0.3 percent drop expected by Wall Street economists.
But the drop was deepened by a technical adjustment, which put the leading and lagging indexes in sync with the coincident index, a barometer of current economic trends, said Ken Goldstein, an economist with the Conference Board.
"It is important to emphasize that because of the new scaling procedures, these declines are larger than they would have been in the past," he said.
Without that change, December leading indicators would have fallen 0.3 percent, he said.
The December report also reflects annual benchmark revisions going back to 1959, the Conference Board said.
Despite declines in the index of leading indicators for three consecutive months, "the overall signal remains one of moderation in the pace of economic activity, but no recession looming on the horizon," Mr. Goldstein said.
He said that over the last six months, the leading index had fallen 3.2 percent but that the decline was less than the 3.5 percent threshold that would signal a recession.
"We are seeing the clear emergence of a slowdown, which makes the need for an additional interest rate cut at next week's Federal Reserve meeting all the more important," said Jerry Jasinowski, the president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
The Fed will meet next Monday and Tuesday to decide whether to cut interest rates again. It lowered rates earlier this month to stave off possible recession.
The Conference Board said the coincident index edged up 0.1 percent in December after an identical rise in November and a 0.2 percent drop in October.
The lagging index, which measures past trends in the economy, fell 0.1 percent in December after gains of 0.4 percent in November and 0.7 percent in October.
Seven of the 10 components that make up the leading indicators index gave negative signals about the future economic course in December, led by the average workweek and consumer expectations.

HEADLINE: Digging for Oil; 
Canada Is UnlockingPetroleum From Sand

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: FORT McMURRAY, Alberta 

 BODY:
Ten building cranes looming over North America's largest energy construction project here are the visible peaks of a $22 billion mountain range of oil investments that are quietly transforming this patch of Canadian wilderness into what may soon be the continent's leading oil producing area north of the Gulf of Mexico.
 Within five years, oil flowing south from Alberta's oil sands is expected to surpass the current output of one million barrels a day from Alaska's North Slope. By the end of the decade, two million barrels a day, the current production of Nigeria, is to be pumped from here into a North American pipeline network that stretches from Portland, Ore., to Portland, Me., helping feed a market in the United States that now consumes about 20 million barrels of oil a day. 
 "By 2010, 75 percent of oil sands production will go down to the United States," predicted William Almdal, regional coordinator for Athabasca Oil Sands Developers, a private planning group here. After many lean years, Mr. Almdal says, the strong oil prices of the last 18 months have unleashed such a torrent of investment that today's biggest development obstacle is not a lack of money or overcoming objections from environmental groups but a growing shortage of skilled labor. 
While debate in the United States swirls over President George W. Bush's support for opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil drilling, little attention has been paid to Alberta's oil sands, which have recoverable reserves 40 times as large as the estimated reserves of the Alaska refuge. Although oil has been produced here for three decades, companies have barely scratched the surface, extracting less than 1 percent of reserves.
Almost ever since 18th-century fur traders watched Indians caulk their canoes with bitumen, a form of heavy oil oozing from the banks of the Athabasca River, dreamers and developers have debated how to exploit the massive deposits of sands here impregnated with oil. According to Canada's National Energy Board, there are at least 300 billion barrels of recoverable oil within a 250-mile radius of this northern city, about 15 percent more than the proven reserves of Saudi Arabia.
For years, mining Canada's oil sands was dismissed as a costly, roundabout way to produce oil. Multibillion-dollar "energy independence" fiascos -- like the failed effort, subsidized by the United States government, in the early 1980's to mine Colorado's oil shale deposits -- soured investors on most "synthetic oil" projects, or oil not from wells.
But now, Canada -- long the largest foreign supplier of natural gas and electricity to the United States -- is becoming important in oil as well. During the first 10 months of 2000, Canada edged out Saudi Arabia as America's largest outside source of oil and petroleum products.
For the United States, where domestic production has dropped by 40 percent since 1970, increased Canadian oil production means increased energy security; trade treaties lock Canada and United States into a continental energy market. Last year, the United States imported foreign oil to meet 57 percent of its needs, up from 37 percent in 1975.
With Canada in the midst of an energy boom involving natural gas, oil and hydroelectric power produced to feed the growing appetite in the United States, mining shovels here in northern Alberta are digging at a faster pace into oil-soaked sand and loading it onto huge trucks. After passing through crushers, the sand is mixed with hot water and moved by slurry pipeline to a plant where the bitumen is extracted.
The basic separation process dates back to 1920, when Karl A. Clark, an Alberta scientist, shoveled oil sand into his family washing machine, where it was mixed with hot water and caustic soda, causing the bitumen to float to the surface.
In recent years, investors' negative views about oil from tar sands have largely faded as technological improvements have pushed production costs down sharply. When the construction cranes come down next summer from the upgrading units of the Millennium Project of Suncor Energy, costs will be around $9 a barrel, roughly one quarter of 1970's levels, according to Rick George, Suncor's hard-driving, Colorado-raised chief executive. Mr. George has set a goal of $5.50 a barrel, aiming to make his company the lowest-cost oil producer in North America.
While prices vary by quality, a barrel -- or 42 gallons -- of crude oil sells today on average for about $30.
Planning to nearly quadruple production to about 425,000 barrels a day by 2008, Suncor is in the midst of a $2.3 billion investment program -- $1.85 billion for Millennium and $500 million for Firebag, a project that involves injecting steam into deep sand deposits to produce oil.
Next door, Syncrude Canada plans to spend $5.3 billion over 10 years to retain its position as the world's largest oil sands producer. By 2008, the Syncrude Project, a Canadian-American joint venture, expects to produce 465,000 barrels a day, more than double its 2000 levels.
Although past oil price plunges caused companies here to shelve some earlier plans, companies now say they can make a profit even if oil prices return to the low teens.
"In the mid-1980's, when crude oil prices hit the tank, we focused on producing oil at lower costs," said Jim E. Carter, president and chief operating officer of Syncrude Canada. "We can make money at $10 a barrel."
Money is being saved by using gigantic trucks in mining operations, by moving half-processed oil sand to upgrading plants in heated slurry pipes, and by using steam injection to extract oil from deposits too deep for open pit mines.
"The economics of Alberta's oil sands are looking pretty robust," Martin Meyers, global oil research director for the consulting firm Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said in a telephone interview from its Massachusetts headquarters. "Over time, that resource base is just guaranteed to attract development dollars."
With much of North America's low-hanging energy fruit already culled, mining existing oil sand deposits is now less expensive than searching for new oil fields and pumping it from deep-water platforms off the coasts of Newfoundland or Louisiana.
"There is no exploration risk," said Gerald J. Kepes, a managing director of the Petroleum Finance Company, a consulting firm based in Washington. "These are basically mining operations."
While high prices have helped get many projects off the ground lately, the labor shortage and the uneven record of the new technology of steam injection have caused some companies to hold back. Of the $22 billion announced for 58 projects through 2010, about $10 billion still lacks final approval from company directors.
Companies have also announced investments of $1.2 billion to improve pipelines leading south to central Alberta refineries and to United States markets.
With easy American market access, guaranteed delivery by pipeline and minimal exploration costs, the roster of multinationals investing here includes Gulf Oil, Exxon Mobil, the Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Chevron. During last summer's World Petroleum Congress in Calgary, one of the most popular field trips for visiting oil executives was a tour of the tar sands around here.
Mobil Oil Canada, a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil, has already begun work on a nearby $2 billion project that hopes to produce 160,000 barrels a day, starting in 2006. A consortium of Shell Canada, Chevron Canada Resources and Western Oil Sands is planning to invest $3 billion in another project. By the end of the decade, production is supposed to hit 155,000 barrels a day.
In another major venture, True-North Energy, a Canadian unit of Koch Industries, is investing $1.3 billion to produce 190,000 barrels a day by 2008.
And about 35 miles south of here, Gulf Canada Resources is operating a pilot project for oil sands extraction using steam. Next year, a decision is to be made whether to invest $600 million to produce 25,000 barrels a day by the end of the decade.
While 80 percent of the announced investments are for the Athabasca Deposit, a region that immediately surrounds this city of 42,000 people, investments worth $3.3 billion have also been announced for 19 projects at the Cold Lake Deposit, about 100 miles south.
Over all, oil sands production is scheduled to triple during this decade. With conventional production from western Canadian oil wells expected to keep falling, the contribution of Alberta's oil sands is to jump from about a third of Canada's oil today to about half in 2007.
While the oil companies are racing ahead, though, Alberta's oil sands have also drawn the attention of environmental groups.
Last March, five protesters from Greenpeace locked themselves to a 400-ton piece of refining equipment that Suncor was planning to move from Edmonton, Alberta's provincial capital, to the Millennium Project. Beaten by subfreezing temperatures, the protesters eventually relented, but not before they had unfurled a banner accusing the oil companies of being "Climate Villains."
Greenpeace is calling for "a halt to the expansion of all tar sands projects," Cim Nunn, a spokesman for Greenpeace Canada, said from Toronto. "If these projects are allowed to proceed, over the next 10 years greenhouse gas emissions from tar sands will make up 25 percent for all of Canada. We urge that those investments be sunk into renewable energy sources."
The environmentalist critique is twofold. First, they say, the energy-intensive mining process here spews vast volumes of carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to gases that scientists say play a big role in global warming. Syncrude, for example, maintains an industrial power plant here capable of providing enough electricity for a city of 400,000 people.
Second, the environmentalists argue, the $22 billion invested here represents an enormous step in the wrong direction, prolonging North America's addiction to oil.
On the first point, oil company executives say that they believe they share common ground with their environmental critics.
By cutting energy used in production, they cut costs. From 1990 to 2008, measured per barrel, energy use in mining and refining is to be cut 35 percent and carbon dioxide cut 45 percent, according to a study by Athabasca Oil Sands Developers, the industry-supported group. From 1995 to 2008, sulphur dioxide emissions will be cut in half, the group calculated, despite a tripling of output.
While Suncor is investing millions of dollars in researching future energy alternatives, the serious billions are still devoted to oil. Over the next 20 years, world oil consumption is expected to increase 50 percent, to about 115 million barrels a day.
"We don't know if oil is going to be in vogue 50 years down the road," said Mr. Carter, the Syncrude president. "For Canada's benefit, we should develop it now. If it is replaced with something else in 50 years, this would be just dirt in the ground."

HEADLINE: Gains Reported for Children of Welfare-to-Work Families 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Some of the welfare-to-work policies adopted by states in recent years benefit children in low-income families by improving their school performance, researchers said today.
 Requiring single mothers to work as a condition of receiving cash assistance did not hurt their children, as many people had feared, the study said. When the work requirements, combined with other policies intended to reward work, led to an increase in family income, the children actually did better in school than youngsters in similar poor families that simply received cash assistance under the old welfare rules. 
 "The new study provides the first evidence that some approaches to welfare reform -- policies that simultaneously increase work and income -- can improve children's lives," said Judith M. Gueron, who supervised the research as president of the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group based in New York. 
Rigorous evaluation of 11 welfare programs in six states provides "strikingly consistent evidence" of the benefits to children, Dr. Gueron said in an interview.
"If you reform welfare in such a way that people go to work and their income increases, then we see better results for school-age children," she added. "That's a new finding in the welfare debate."
The research focused on children 3 to 12 years old in California, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. School performance was measured by test scores and by the evaluations of teachers and parents.
The study concluded: "Welfare reforms and antipoverty programs can have a positive impact on children's development if they increase employment and income. But increasing employment alone does not appear sufficient to foster the healthy development of children."
Authors of the report said their findings "provide some reassurance" that mandatory employment programs do not harm children of elementary school age. But critics of the new welfare policies have said that it is impossible to know whether welfare and work programs would have the same effects in a time of economic downturn.
The study examined the effects of several programs that provided families with extra money or noncash benefits, like child care subsidies, if they worked. The positive effects were most pronounced for the children of people who had been on welfare for two years or more.
Short-term welfare recipients were more likely to have work experience and the skills needed to obtain jobs on their own.
The welfare programs analyzed in the study began operations from 1991 to 1994. Congress adopted similar policies for the entire nation in 1996. Authors of the report said their research provided a powerful tool for understanding how these policies affected children.
The 1996 law reversed a half-century of welfare policy by ending the federal guarantee of cash assistance for the nation's poorest children. Each state receives a lump sum of federal money, with substantial freedom to shape its welfare program, provided it requires work and sets time limits on the receipt of cash assistance.
The findings of the new study have immediate implications for federal policy makers, who will debate reauthorization of the 1996 law over the next two years. They also offer lessons to state policy makers, who must decide how to spend federal money that remains unused as the number of welfare recipients continues to plummet.
One lesson of the study is that states should supplement the wages of people who move from welfare to work. Without such supplements, welfare recipients typically lose a dollar of cash assistance for each dollar they earn, so their income does not increase with their work effort. The study cites Connecticut and California as states that provide strong incentives for people to work by allowing them to continue receiving welfare benefits as their earnings rise.
Programs that helped children -- the programs that raised the income of working families -- also tended to increase government costs, the study said. This is consistent with the admonition of Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, the man nominated by President Bush to be secretary of health and human services.
"For welfare reform to be successful," Mr. Thompson said last week at his Senate confirmation hearing, "you have to make an investment up front. It can't be done on the cheap. You can't expect welfare mothers to go to work unless they have child care. They've got to have health insurance, transportation and training. All cost money. The savings to taxpayers, and they are substantial, come later as caseloads decline."
The study sounded a note of caution on one issue. Even in programs that had favorable effects on children, many families still had incomes that put them below the poverty level. "Their incomes were generally very low despite the increases in income produced by the program," the report said.
Researchers had no firm conclusions about how time limits on welfare affected children. Based on one program, which combined time limits with work requirements in Florida, there seemed to be few effects.
Pamela A. Morris, an author of the study, said: "If parents succeed in the labor market, children may continue to do well even after their families reach a time limit. But if family income declines, children may not do as well."

HEADLINE: Palestinian Memo on Clinton's Role: Some Angry Words 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: TABA, Egypt, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a memorandum issued today by the Palestinian Media Center assessing the role of the Clinton administration in Middle East peace talks:
 No third party has been as involved and influential in the Palestinian-Israeli peace process over the last seven years as the United States and, in particular, its special Middle East coordinator, Dennis Ross. In view of the United States' inability to facilitate the realization by Palestinians and Israelis of a just and lasting peace in accordance with Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and other sources of international law, it seems prudent, at the close of the Clinton administration, to assess U.S. involvement and to identify some of the reasons the United States' involvement has not yielded better results. 
 Under U.S. supervision, the Palestinian-Israeli "peace process" has become a goal in and of itself. A false sense of normalcy has been created because of the on-going process of negotiations. The lack of visible resistance to Israeli occupation from the Palestinian side, except for temporary flare-ups, and Israel's ability to continue negotiations while continuing to build settlements in occupied Palestinian territory, has created the false impression that the "process" of achieving peace could substitute for peace itself. 
Thus, the difficult substantial issues at the core of the conflict, including acceptance that Israel's occupation of Arab territory it conquered in the 1967 Israeli-Arab War is illegal, have been constantly deflected in order to maintain talks without requiring Israel to face up to its obligations.
In fact, the United States advocacy of "constructive ambiguity" has had disastrous consequences for the peace process. Both parties to the conflict have mistakenly assumed at different times that either the Israelis had accepted to end the occupation or that the Palestinians had agreed to forgo some of their fundamental rights as a result of vaguely worded agreements. . . . 
Unfortunately, the U.S. emphasis on process over substance has led the domestic constituencies of many governments in the region to conclude that the peace process was only a mirage designed to trick their governments into prematurely establishing economic ties that would help Israel break out of its regional isolation. This has had the added repercussion of promoting not only anti-Israeli sentiment in countries that have established economic ties with Israel, but has also promoted anti-American sentiment in all countries of the region, as demonstrated by the grass-roots popular boycott of American products in many states. . . . 
Unfortunately, over the last seven years in particular, the U.S. has become increasingly identified with Israeli ideological assumptions. . . . The result has been that while Israel's security, including the security of its occupation forces, have been the focus of each agreement, the quality of life of Palestinians has continued to decline. The dichotomy between the comfort of Israelis, including those occupying Palestinian land in settlements with green lawns and swimming pools, and the poverty and misery of Palestinians, has only further inflamed an already volatile situation. . . . 
A comprehensive peace agreement between Palestinians and Israelis must not only be considered a valuable photo opportunity. . . . There is much the United States can contribute to encouraging justice, peace and stability in the Middle East, but only if it can learn from the mistakes and failures of the last seven years. There remains much at stake, and for every day that the Israeli occupation continues and settlements continue to expand, peace becomes that much harder to achieve.

HEADLINE: THE NEW ADMINISTRATION: THE TRANSITION; 
Ousted Clinton Appointees Join Unemployment 'Club'

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 

 BODY:
It is not exactly a soft landing for Clinton loyalists in the federal government, but if they could not take time out in their last frenetic days at work, today they can apply for unemployment insurance. 
 Over the last few weeks, the District of Columbia Office of Employment Services went from federal department to department briefing 1,700 appointees on the worst-case option. They were told that to be eligible, they must be unemployed "through no fault of your own." 
 Payment is on a sliding scale depending on income, but employees earning more than $32,000 a year -- or just about all of the 6,000 or so federal workers that a president appoints -- are eligible for $309 a week. 
"They're calling us the 309-ers; it's like a club," said one lower-level Clinton appointee on Friday, his last day of work at a $56,000-a-year job.
"There are at least hundreds, possibly over a thousand," the appointee said, on condition of anonymity.
"We all kind of feel a little bit bad about taking it," the appointee said, adding, "the system wasn't created for a kid with a master's degree to take some money." 
The workers include drivers, personal assistants and cabinet secretaries. Typically, many leave for jobs on the outside right after Election Day, if not sooner; this is especially true at the higher job levels. At lower levels, many workers compete for a small number of jobs on the staffs of newly elected senators and representatives, or leave politics.
For those who have not figured out their next move, the $309 is better than nothing, but not much. An office director at the Energy Department said that it would not approach his monthly mortgage payment, and that it was barely more than the private health insurance he was buying for his family of three.
At the Office of Employment Services, Diana Johnson, a spokeswoman, acknowledged, "unemployment isn't enough to sustain you for a long period of time."
Ms. Johnson said she did not know how many political appointees had filed because her office, which takes applications only from residents of the District of Columbia, does not count the appointees separately from people who lose their jobs in more conventional ways. Appointees from other jurisdictions must apply for benefits where they live.

HEADLINE: Despite Strong Sales, Dell Warns of Lower-Than-Expected Earnings 

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

 BODY:
Despite sales growth that quadrupled the average for the personal computer industry, Dell Computer warned yesterday that earnings would miss its estimates by as much as 8 cents a share for the current quarter.
 Blaming the economic slowdown and dwindling demand for PC's, Dell said it expected to report fourth-quarter earnings of 18 or 19 cents a share, compared with 15 cents a year before. The Round Rock, Tex., company had predicted earnings of 26 cents a share, a penny more than Wall Street's estimates. Revenues will be $8.5 billion to $8.6 billion, Dell said, coming in slightly below its previous estimate of $8.7 billion. 
 As the economy cools off, Dell, the world's largest maker of built-to-order PC's, is leading an aggressive price war that it expects its competitors cannot follow. The company's worldwide sales grew more than 40 percent year-on-year, the company said, compared with the 10 percent average growth that analysts forecast across the sector. Gartner Dataquest, a research firm based in San Jose, Calif., said last week that Dell cut heavily into the market share of Compaq, the overall leading maker of PC's, jumping from 9 percent to 11.3 percent.
"This performance clearly distinguishes us from other computer-systems companies, given current realities of the global economy and computer systems market," Michael S. Dell, the chief executive, said in a statement issued with the profit warning.
Dell was the last of the major PC makers to warn that a brisk decline in demand would lead to a disappointing December quarter. Compaq, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard and Apple all cautioned that earnings would miss expectations.
Though the strategy had earned Dell market share, it had also cut into the company's profits. Analysts said Dell was trying to win customers during hard times in an effort to maintain them when sales picked up again.
"The message I got was that Dell's out to kill the competition," Charles R. Wolf, an analyst with Needham & Company, a New York-based investment bank, said after a conference call with Dell executives yesterday. "I think you've seen a shift in their strategy, from being an industry cooperator to an industry aggressor."
James M. Schneider, Dell's chief financial officer, said revenue would have fallen to nearly $8 billion if not for the company's price reductions.
"The market dynamics led us to this more aggressive pricing tactic," said James T. Vanderslice, a Dell vice chairman.
The announcement came before the Nasdaq opened yesterday, but investors have factored the industry's current woes into the stock prices of most PC manufacturers. After falling as low as $23.63 yesterday, Dell shares rebounded on heavy trading to close at $25.50, down 13 cents. 
Wall Street was quick to defend Dell, calling it the best house in a bad neighborhood.
"If we look at history, Dell has accelerated its market share gains during bad times," said Eric Rothdeutsch, an analyst with Robertson Stephens, which upgraded its recommendation on Dell from "market perform" to "long-term attractive." "It's clear that it is doing that again. We think Dell is going to emerge a much stronger industry player when business does get better." 
Ashok Kumar, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, maintained his "aggressive buy" rating on Dell's stock, but cited concerns about the company's ability to cover its weaknesses and follow corporate dollars as they move out of personal computers. Mr. Kumar said Dell must expand its services in the market for high-end servers, powerful computers that run networks, where profit margins and growth opportunities are more plentiful.
"Here is a classic case of, may the best man lose," Mr. Kumar said. "The dollars and the margins are moving upscale into the enterprise-service segment of the market. The question is: Is Dell in a position to benefit from that?" 
Dell executives said they remained confident about the industry, but that a murky economic climate prevented them from updating their estimates for the coming fiscal year until Feb. 15, when Dell reports earnings for this quarter. 
"They're going to cut right through the soft landing," Mr. Wolf said, "or whatever landing we happen to have, and continue to grow faster than they have previously guided."
Industrywide, the top makers of PC's continued to see their sales growth decline during the December quarter as the market suffered from saturation, Dataquest said. 
Compaq, scheduled to announce its quarterly earnings today, continues to hold the top spot in worldwide PC sales, with 12.4 percent of the market, Dataquest said. Compaq's lead over Dell dwindled, however, because its sales increased by only 1.5 percent from the previous year. Dell, with 11.3 percent of the market, grew 41 percent. Hewlett-Packard, which grew 18 percent, remained in third place with 7.7 percent of the market. I.B.M. was in fourth place. Sales slowed 5 percent for NEC and 9 percent for Gateway, which held the fourth and fifth slots.

Not Happening

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia 

 BODY:
 There's something strange going on here. If you look around the Balkans today you'll see that democracy movements are tentatively sprouting in the two ethnically pure Balkan states that caused the most trouble during the Bosnian war: Serbia and Croatia. And democracy is least alive and well in the place where NATO and U.S. troops are present, namely multi-ethnic Bosnia (and Kosovo). 
 What gives? Has NATO pacified Bosnia at the expense of democracy? Not quite, but sort of. Let's review the facts: In ethnically pure Serbia, a popular revolt last fall ousted the evil President Slobodan Milosevic from power and spurred a peaceful transition to the decent, democratic coalition led by Vojislav Kostunica. In ethnically pure Croatia, the death in December 1999 of its hard-line nationalist leader, Franjo Tudjman, has led to his corrupt party's being swept from power by democrats in a free election. 
Meanwhile, though, in multi-ethnic Bosnia, where the Dayton accords have forced Bosnian Serbs, Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims to live together in an artificial state, pluralism and democracy are going backward. In the Nov. 11 elections, held under NATO's aegis, extreme nationalist/separatist parties triumphed -- demonstrating that five years and $5 billion in aid have done little to produce a new generation of Bosnian Muslims, Serbs and Croats who could live together in a self-sustaining multi-ethnic democracy.
Lesson: In a region like the Balkans, where ethnic identity and hatreds run so deep, it is easier to produce a self-sustaining democracy in ethnically homogeneous countries, like Serbia and Croatia, than it is in diverse ones, like Bosnia. 
Why? Because democracy means the willingness to have your group or party be outvoted and have power go to the competing group or party, observed the Johns Hopkins University foreign affairs expert Michael Mandelbaum. To do that, though, the party or group that loses has to trust the new majority and believe that its basic interests will still be protected and that there is nothing to fear from a change in power.
That trust, a senior NATO commander said to me, is simply "not here in Bosnia." The corrupt nationalist parties, he explained, manipulate the still substantial "fear and pain of the people," so none of the ethnic groups trust being ruled by the others. Bosnia may get better, but right now it is not happening. For now, Bosnia remains a bad Rubik's Cube. The pieces don't quite fit: Bosnia can be democratic and self-sustaining, but only if the country gives up being unified and multi-ethnic. Or Bosnia can be multi-ethnic, democratic and unified, but not self-sustaining. NATO would have to hold it together forever.
America's democratic pluralism is built on individuals from different religious backgrounds who have voluntarily chosen to live together. But that is not where Bosnia starts. Here you have religious groups living together against their will, under NATO, after a terrible war. The Dayton accords assumed that the parties would eventually meld into a functioning democracy, with a little NATO supervision and a lot of money. But they are not. Dayton and democracy don't go together in Bosnia. 
We can continue using NATO to force Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Muslims to live together in an artificial Bosnian state, as the Dayton accords mandated. Or the NATO allies can abandon Dayton and instead push for a soft partition of Bosnia, by letting the Serbian sector fall under Serbia and the Croatian sector under Croatia and leaving the rump Muslim sector as an independent mini-state. Serbia and Croatia, the two big powers in the region, would then be responsible for stabilizing the area, and NATO could operate a small protectorate around the Sarajevo Muslim mini-state.
But forcing Bosnia together and pouring money in won't make a difference. Multi-ethnic democracy will emerge, and the lure of globalization and economic integration work its stabilizing magic, only when other issues are settled -- particularly who lives inside which borders -- so people feel free to think beyond tribal interests. It is not an accident McDonald's still refuses to operate here. 
So the real question for the Bush team is not how many troops to keep in Bosnia, but what is Bosnia to be all about: Dayton or democracy? It can't be both.
