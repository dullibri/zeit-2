Beyond Sushi
Sushi bars continue to be popular in New York, but Japanese cuisine has far more to offer, as exemplified by these 12 restaurants. (These summaries are taken from dining reviews, columns and articles in The Times by William Grimes, Eric Asimov and others.)
 
1. Esashi
 +
 (212) 505-8726
 32 Avenue A, near Third Street
 East Village
 $ All major cards
Esashi is a modest, informal restaurant that stands out for its sushi and many other well-prepared Japanese dishes. The sushi selection is not particularly large or unusual, but everything is exceptionally fresh and beautifully presented. A house specialty is shrimp dumplings made with tofu wrappers. Tiger eye, an unusually beautiful appetizer with a subtle flavor, is a strip of cooked skate wrapped around salmon with a layer of seaweed.

 SoHo
 $$ All major cards
The buckwheat noodles called soba are notoriously difficult to make, but the chefs at this elegantly spare, quietly soothing Japanese restaurant have mastered the art. You can begin with a dish of edamame, fresh salted soy beans still in their pods, and cold sake served in a salt-edged cedar box that somehow makes the flavor of the sake seem even purer. Try another appetizer if you're hungry, then bring on the noodles. In their most elemental form, they are eaten cold, dipped in a sauce of soy, rice wine, bonito flakes, kelp and sugar. They are also served hot with toppings like sliced duck or button mushrooms.
 
3. Inagiku
 ** Rating: 2 stars
 (212) 355-0440
 Waldorf-Astoria Hotel
 111 East 49th Street
 Manhattan
 $$$$ All major cards
The menu at this cosmopolitan sanctuary is full of unfrightening dishes intended for wary travelers, but the Japanese businessmen who go to Inagiku choose completely different dishes. The waitresses bring a seemingly endless parade of small, beautifully arranged "classic little dishes." You might begin with seaweed that you slurp from a small ceramic bowl or with the more ordinary (but no less delicious) boiled spinach in sesame sauce. Black cod marinated in sake lees and grilled is a rich, irresistible morsel of fish. Rosy slices of raw tuna are topped with grated yam. Many of the Japanese businessmen begin their meals with a "sashimi extravaganza," a gorgeous presentation.
 
4. Katsu-Hama
 +
 (212) 758-5909
 11 East 47th Street
 Manhattan
 $ All major cards
Katsu-Hama doesn't offer much in the way of atmosphere or creature comforts, but it is an authentic Japanese experience. Upon entering the dining room you encounter an almost entirely Japanese crowd that has come not for sushi but for tonkatsu: deep-fried pork cutlets, which are the restaurant's specialty. The meal begins with a bowl of excellent miso soup. Then you are given a mortar and pestle to grind sesame seeds, which you mix with the house sauce, resulting in a blend that evokes a combination of chutney and freshly made Worcestershire sauce. Finally the tonkatsu arrives, a beautifully fried cutlet coated with crunchy Japanese bread crumbs and sliced to ease handling with chopsticks. Dipped into the sauce, the meat is moist and delicious, and the leftover sauce is perfect poured over rice.
 
5. Menchanko-Tei
 +
 (212) 247-1585
 43 West 55th Street
 Manhattan
 $ All major cards
Great big bowls of noodles in steaming broths, full of shrimp, chicken, pork and other more exotic ingredients are the thing at Menchanko-Tei, which means House of Mixed Noodles in Japanese. The house special, fat egg noodles in a chicken broth full of shrimp, little rice cakes and ground fish, is served in a huge metal bowl. Ramen, a thinner, coarser noodle, comes with shards of sweet roast pork, shredded mushrooms and scallions. Japanese business executives seem to find a home away from home here and at the restaurant's two other Manhattan branches: 131 East 45th Street and in the concourse at 5 World Trade Center.
 
6. Nadaman Hakubai
 ** Rating: 2 stars
 (212) 885-7111
 Kitano Hotel
 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street
 $$$$ All major cards
A visit to one of this restaurant's tatami rooms is like a quick trip to Japan. Here some of the most exquisite kaiseki cuisine can be experienced in a serene atmosphere. Kaiseki cuisine, associated with the tea ceremony, is food for the soul as well as the body, meant to feed the eye with its beauty and the spirit with its meaning. The courses follow a strict order, and the way to enjoy this is to abandon yourself to the experience, appreciating the peace, the subtlety of the flavors and the sense that you are being pampered as never before.
 
7. Sakagura

 (212) 953-7253
 211 East 43rd Street
 Manhattan
 $$ All major cards
This opulent Midtown sake bar, hidden in a basement, offers about 200 varieties of sake and a small menu of well-prepared food. The elegant but casual room is a beautiful golden color, with filtered golden light and blond wood chairs with almost silken surfaces. Most of the clientele is Japanese, with business executives early in the evening and couples arriving later.
 
8. Shabu-Tatsu
 +
 (212) 477-2972
 216 East 10th Street
 East Village
 $ All major cards
Shabu-Tatsu specializes in yakiniku, sukiyaki and shabu shabu, dishes that are cooked on circular metal grills set over burners in the center of each table. Yakiniku dishes are cooked directly on the grill. Trays of meat ranging from tissue-thin slices of rib-eye to tripe arrive, and after a brief grilling you use chopsticks to dip the meat in sweet soy or sesame sauce and eat. Delicious! Shabu shabu and sukiyaki dishes are simmered in pans of broth or water. Shabu shabu is easy. Pick up the beef with chopsticks, swirl briefly in the boiling broth, dip and eat. Sukiyaki is a little more complicated, but the attentive staff is happy to help. Another branch of Shabu-Tatsu is at 1414 York Avenue, at 75th Street.
 
9. Soba-Ya
 +
 (212) 533-6966
 229 East Ninth Street
 East Village
 $ All major cards
Soba-Ya specializes in soba, the buckwheat noodles for which the Japanese have an almost mystical reverence. But Soba-Ya also offers some sensational appetizer specials and small delicacies, like cooked spinach marinated in soy and rice wine and sprinkled with sesame seeds. The soba noodles, pale tan and smooth, are served hot in soups or cold with a cool dipping sauce made of soy, dashi and rice wine. When you have slurped your last noodle, a waitress will arrive with a steaming pitcher full of the cooking water from the noodle pot. She pours it into the remaining dipping sauce, creating a mild, pleasant broth that puts a warm finishing touch on the meal.
 
10. Sugiyama
 *** Rating: 3 stars
 (212) 956-0670
 251 West 55th Street
 Manhattan
 $$$$ All major cards
The food is so extraordinary at this tiny restaurant that a visit feels like a dreamy voyage to Japan. The chef and owner, Nao Sugiyama, serves modern kaiseki meals: you tell the chef how many courses you want (5 to 14) and how much you are willing to spend, and simply put yourself in his hands. This artful food makes no concessions to American prejudices. Splendid sushi is a part of each meal, but there are often tiny crabs no larger than a fingernail (you pop the whole creature into your mouth), lily roots and ginger buds. The meal often begins with ankimo, the smooth Japanese version of foie gras (actually monkfish liver), served with a tiny wooden spoon. Most meals continue with zensai, beautiful little appetizers arranged with great delicacy, then an assortment of sashimi, then perhaps rich, decadent black cod marinated in sake lees. The meal invariably closes with miso soup, pickles and rice.
 
11. Toraya
 +++
 (212) 861-1700
 17 East 71st Street
 Manhattan
 $ All major cards
Entering Toraya is like stepping into a hushed and peaceful Japanese temple. Quiet music creates a tranquil mood, and flower arrangements provide little bursts of color against the patterned granite and tile walls. This tea salon has a menu of unusual Japanese dishes, but the highlights are the beautiful, meticulously fashioned pastries, like zangetsu, a soft ginger-flavored pancake folded over a filling of sweetened azuki bean paste, etched with a pattern of chrysanthemum petals. The zangetsu and other pastries are delicate, delicious and unforgettable.
 
12. Ya Bowl
 +
 (212) 764-3017
 125 West 45th Street
 $ All major cards
While the atmosphere at this sweet little restaurant is unmistakably Japanese, the small dining room could almost be mistaken for any New York living room. The raison d'etre of Ya Bowl is the bowl meals, one-pot meals in which hot food is served over rice in a bowl, a delicious and economical method. Salmon teriyaki is typical -- a well-cooked salmon steak brushed with sweet teriyaki sauce, which drips into the rice below. Even better is the unusual sukiyaki, the beef-and-vegetable stew, which is simmered in a sweet soy sauce and served with egg over rice.

HEADLINE: Buyers Gain Online Rights In Europe

BYLINE: By PAUL MELLER 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Nov. 30

 BODY:
The European Union passed rules today that would allow consumers to sue in their own country an online retailer based in another union country.
European officials argue that such a consumer right is essential to help get e-commerce off the ground in Europe. 
 "A lack of consumer confidence is the main thing holding up the development of e-commerce here," said Leonello Gabrici, a spokesman on judicial matters for the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union.
By handing jurisdiction of cross-border disputes to the courts in the consumer's country, the regulation will encourage consumers to purchase online, he said.
But industry representatives argue that the regulation, which takes effect in March, will create legal uncertainty for small companies using the Internet.
"For large companies it isn't a problem, because they have offices and lawyers in all E.U. countries," said Wim Mijs, vice president for European Union affairs at ABN Amro, the Dutch banking giant. Smaller online companies, however, would be burdened with substantial legal and insurance costs if they sought protection against litigation from outside their home market, he said. "As a result, venture capitalists might be a little more cautious about investing in a European Web venture."
Mike Pullen, a lawyer based in Brussels with the British law firm of Dibb Lupton Alsop, said the ruling "means we will still have 15 separate markets in th E.U. rather than one unified internal market, which I thought was the aim."
Europeans have been somewhat slow to embrace online commerce, in large part because of cross-border issues, including differences in taxation and in the quality of shipping. Last year, European e-commerce revenue was $5.4 billion, roughly a sixth of what it was in the United States. But consulting groups like Forrester Research Inc. of Boston have predicted explosive growth in e-commerce among the 15 member nations of the union over the next few years.
The European Commission, said today that the text agreed to by justice ministers is a compromise solution, addressing the concerns of consumers and online companies alike.
"It is a compromise because it states clearly what court has jurisdiction in cases of conflicts arising from e-commerce," said Antonio Vitorino, the justice and home affairs commissioner.
But even some justice ministers disagreed. One described the regulation as "a lawyers' charter," because it creates so much uncertainty, according to an official who witnessed the closed-door debate.
The regulation was passed before the meeting of an international forum that will debate the question of jurisdiction in cross-border online disputes. The wording of a working paper -- which will be debated by representatives of the major trading powers, including the United States, at the forum in the spring -- says that the courts in the consumer's country should have jurisdiction only when a Web site is specifically aiming at that country, Mr. Pullen said.
The European Union regulation states that if the Web site does not specify a country, then it should be assumed that the online company has all countries as its target.
Mr. Vitorino denied that there was a contradiction between the two approaches. "There is no contradiction here because we are mandated to represent the E.U." in the negotiations in this spring, he said.
Angela Mills of the Internet Advertising Bureau, criticized today's decision, saying that "it is unfortunate that the justice ministers decided to go ahead with this regulation" before an international agreement.
"We were asking for a delay until then," she said.

HEADLINE: Jim Tuppeny, 75, a Coach And Director of Penn Relays

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY 

 BODY:
Jim Tuppeny, who coached track at Villanova for 13 years and the University of Penn for another 13 and was the director of the Penn Relays for 18 years, died on Wednesday night at his home in Carroll Park, Pa., five miles from the Villanova campus. He was 75.
The cause was heart failure resulting from complications from stomach cancer, his daughter Betty said. 
 Tuppeny was a tall, cheerful man who seldom worked without a clipboard. From 1953 to 1966, he was an assistant to the legendary coach James (Jumbo) Elliott at Villanova and helped coach Olympic gold medalists like Ron Delany, Charlie Jenkins, Larry James and Don Bragg.
In 1966, Tuppeny became the head track and cross-country coach at Pennsylvania. His track teams there compiled a 127-29 record in dual and triangular meets and won eight team titles in the Heptagonal Games, which involved the eight Ivy League teams plus Army and Navy. His cross-country teams went 103-15 in dual and triangular meets and won two Heptagonal titles.
In 1970, he took on a second job at Pennsylvania as director of the Penn Relays. In 1979, with that job taking up more and more of his time, he stopped coaching to devote more time to the Relays.
The Penn Relays, which began more than 100 years ago, are the largest relay meet in the world. For three days on the last weekend in April, 15,000 athletes from hundreds of colleges, high schools and clubs compete in programs lasting up to 13 hours a day. The athletes have ranged from current Olympic heroes like Michael Johnson, Maurice Greene and Marion Jones to fifth-graders and 90-year-old master athletes.
Tuppeny added distance races at night, a marathon, a decathlon, a heptathlon and an entire day when only women compete.
He saw his first Penn Relays when he was 9, carrying his lunch in a paper bag and taking a trolley to Franklin Field. He saw every one since except for two years during World War II, when he was stationed in the Pacific with the Navy.
In 1946, he competed in the Penn Relays pole vault, using, as the others did, a bamboo pole. On his first vault, the pole broke in half.
James Patrick Tuppeny was born Sept. 20, 1925, in Philadelphia, where he was raised. He earned a bachelor's degree in economics and education from La Salle University in 1950 and a master's in administration and finance from Villanova in 1955. Before, during and after college, he worked as a teacher, welder, pipe fitter, machinist and bartender. He began coaching at Malvern Prep from 1950 to 1953.
He served from 1979 to 1981 as president of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Track and Field Coaches Association and in 1986 as vice president of the sport's national governing body, The Athletics Congress, now known as USA Track and Field.
He married the former Kathleen (Kass) O'Doherty of Philadelphia in 1947. She died in 1990. He is survived by five daughters, Kathy Williams of Charleston, S.C.; Michelle Ronan of Lake Zurich, Ill.; Diane Tuppeny-Hess of Ardmore, Pa.; Betty Tuppeny of Philadelphia; and Barbara Tuppeny of Havertown, Pa.; nine grandchildren and a brother, Charles Tuppeny of Honeybrook, Pa., still active as a high school track coach at age 80.
Jim Tuppeny retired from the Penn Relays in 1987 and became executive director of athletics for the Philadelphia Convention and Visitors Bureau. In 1994, he became associate head coach at Villanova, handling administrative details for John Marshall, then the head coach, and Marshall's successor, Marcus O'Sullivan. Tuppeny was active there until a month ago.
"I inherited him," O'Sullivan said yesterday. "Thank goodness, I did. If not for him, I wouldn't have gotten through my first two years as coach. The coaching part wasn't tough, but the paperwork was. Just putting on a meet on was tough. He told me the job was going to be a long, long race, so pace yourself."
"In coaching runners," O'Sullivan said of Tuppeny, "he had a good intuitive skill in knowing where the edge was, knowing when you're pushing a kid too far. In the last two years, he was starting to coach totally by feel, like someone making a cake without a recipe. That helped him touch people, and he touched thousands."

HEADLINE: This Half-Price Sale Is a Sign of Economic Woes Ahead

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
CHRISTMAS is more than three weeks off, but the half-price sale is already going on.
It is stocks that are on sale; to wit, the Nasdaq variety. At the low yesterday, the Nasdaq composite was down 51 percent from the giddy highs it reached during trading on March 10, when Internet fever peaked. 
 In fact, if you're looking for deeply discounted merchandise, that statistic makes the supply seem smaller than it is. Half the Nasdaq stocks in the computer and telecommunications sectors are down more than 75 percent since March 10. Fewer than 5 percent have risen.
Those brutal facts are not news to many investors, and they help to explain why this Christmas will not be nearly as joyful for retailers as might be expected given the low unemployment rate. But the broader question is whether the Nasdaq collapse portends bad economic times.
Most of Wall Street thinks not. The consensus is that the economy is making a soft landing that will leave the annual growth rate around 2.5 percent for a while. The Nasdaq decline is viewed as a correction of overinflated valuations, plus perhaps a little overreaction that has created bargains among the ruins.
At the heart of the optimism is the view that the so-called new economy is alive and well. Consumer purchases of personal computers may be plunging, as Gateway shareholders just learned, but companies are sure to keep investing to reap productivity gains. Those gains in productivity are slashing costs enough to assure that inflation will not be a threat, whatever happens to such old-economy indicators as oil prices. That means the Federal Reserve will be able and willing to bail out the economy by cutting interest rates next year.
The weakest part of that argument is the assumption that business spending on technology will continue at the explosive rate of recent years. Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company, notes that the durable goods report issued this week shows that orders for electronic and other electrical equipment from July through October were running 6 percent ahead of the 1999 pace. In the first half of the year they were up 24 percent.
A rise of 6 percent is far from horrible, but it is hard to believe that the drop stops here. Most of those computer and telecommunications companies on Nasdaq were buyers of hot new hardware and software. Now many are scrambling to pay their bills, and new orders are out of the question. The Chicago Purchasing Managers survey of new orders -- a barometer of industrial health in the Midwest -- fell yesterday to its lowest level in 18 years.
"This is not a valuation adjustment with no economic repercussions," Mr. Barbera said.
The huge surge in capital spending, which is now coming to an end, may turn out to be the signal economic event of the last five years. It raised overall corporate profits because the profits made by the sellers were not offset by expenses of the buyers, who treated the spending as investments. That encouraged investors, and the availability of cheap capital encouraged more capital spending, which pushed up profits further and sparked talk of a new era.
Now that virtuous circle is ending. Profits will suffer as depreciation expenses rise. Consumers will cut back as their investments suffer. Tax receipts will be surprisingly low as capital gains payments fall.
The Fed will try to help by cutting interest rates next year, but the surprise may be how little help that provides.

HEADLINE: Weak Showing For Incomes And Spending

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30

 BODY:
Americans' personal income, buffeted by a big swing in federal farm payments, fell by 0.2 percent in October, the first decline in nearly two years. Consumer spending rose at the slowest rate in six months.
The Commerce Department reported today that consumer spending increased just 0.2 percent in October, the weakest performance since a 0.2 percent rise in April. Spending had increased 0.9 percent in September. 
 The 0.2 percent drop in incomes, the first decline since December 1998, resulted from a big swing in federal subsidy payments to farmers, which had soared in September only to return to more normal levels in October. Personal income advanced 1.1 percent in September.
Without the big changes in farm payments, though, personal incomes would have risen just 0.4 percent in September and would have posted a 0.5 percent increase in October.
Disposable personal income, the amount left after paying taxes, fell 0.4 percent in October, the biggest decline in four years. The combination of falling incomes and a slight growth in spending pushed the personal savings rate down to a record low in October of minus 0.8 percent -- meaning that on average, for every $1,000 Americans received, they outspent that by $8.
Still, given the special factors, analysts were not alarmed by the income decline and the weak growth in consumer spending. With the unemployment rate currently at a 30-year low of 3.9 percent, they expect incomes to grow in coming months.
In another report, the Labor Department said today that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week to 358,000, the highest level in more than two years.
The increase in new claims from the previous week was an unexpectedly large 19,000. Labor Department analysts cautioned that the Thanksgiving holiday might have played a role in the big swing in claims. Jobless filings are particularly volatile during holiday weeks.
While the economy has been slowing under the effect of the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases, many economists say that they see little threat of the record-long expansion's deteriorating into a recession. Instead, they think that an originally forecast economic growth rate this year of more than 5 percent will slow to around 3 percent growth next year.

HEADLINE: The Big City;
Can Power Transcend Knotted Silk?

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
WHAT does it take to be the chairman and chief executive of the most highly valued corporation in America? The answer was clear this week at Rockefeller Center: light gray pants, a blazer and an open-necked button-down blue shirt.
That was the uniform on both John F. Welch Jr. and Jeffrey R. Immelt at their news conference anointing Mr. Immelt as Mr. Welch's successor at General Electric. The next day's newspaper showed their photo along with pictures of the two G.E. executives who were passed over for the top job, for obvious reasons. Both wore dark suits, white shirts and strange knotted strands of silk. 
 Known as neckties, these articles of clothing were until recently common on executives, particularly in New York. But now the Casual Friday look has conquered even Midtown and Wall Street. Why bother with a tie for the most important news conference of your life? Corporate lawyers and investment bankers go to the office looking like college professors. Except for politicians and courtroom lawyers, just about the only workers in ties are waiters and doormen.
The rest of New Yorkers have become what I call Fashion Casualties, a term used not in derision -- I'm one myself -- but in warning. New York's economy depends in large part on the city's image of power and glamour. That's why outsiders pay so much for the high-priced talent here. But how long will they keep paying if the alleged power brokers are dressed like their neighbors at the mall?
New Yorkers need respect, and the way to get it is to keep the neck covered. Throat-baring is a common sign of vulnerability among both animals and humans. It's used by crocodiles, wolves and dogs to show submission, and by men and women to signal romantic availability. If people want to look forbidding, they cover up with beards, beads, armor, scarves, cravats, ruffled collars, turtlenecks, Nehru jackets or anything else that protects the neck dimple, that vulnerable spot directly behind the knot of a tie.
"Ever since the Middle Ages, powerful men in the West have covered their throats," said Anne Hollander, a historian of art and fashion, whose books include "Feeding the Eye" and "Sex and Suits." The uniform of the G.E. leaders reminds her not of power brokers but of romantic poets.
"It's the kind of outfit that Shelley and Byron wore," Mrs. Hollander said. "They posed in light cotton trousers, a nice jacket and a formal shirt unbuttoned at the neck with no cravat. But men in powerful political and financial positions would not show their necks in formal portraits."
But then, in the old days the most powerful men weren't techno-nerds like Bill Gates. That's why the necks can now be bared, said David B. Givens, the director of the Center for Nonverbal Studies in Spokane, Wash., and the anthropologist who coined the term "neck dimple."
"The exposed-neck look in business attire is a true paradigm shift," Dr. Givens said. "In the old days of just a few years ago, you had to look powerful in business. But now information has won out over brute politics and corporate hierarchy. The information-rich young staff gained power and pushed for casual dress, and the first items removed were the MBA scarf and the necktie. When you've been to Information Mecca, you no longer need to wear the veil. It's redundant as a power cue."
DR. GIVENS expects necks to remain exposed in computer and media companies, but not necessarily in other industries. "In occupations that rely on trust, workers will continue to conceal the neck dimple to seem more authoritatively and convincingly trustworthy," he said. "New York bankers and lawyers shouldn't throw out their tie collections. Nor should Microsoft types, at least the ones who negotiate with outsiders, because strangers don't know how information-rich and brilliant they are."
Mrs. Hollander, too, expects the suit and tie to survive, in part because men cannot cope with the ambiguities of casual wear. "Women are used to changing fashions, but men want simple rules that don't change," she said. "Men are also very much concerned with the relation between their status and their garment."
There's one other factor working against today's Fashion Casualties, as Mrs. Hollander noted. "When you open your collar, everyone gets a better look at your sagging jowls," she said. "The suit and tie is a fashion that's becoming to the figure and the face. It looks so great on everyone that I can't see it going away for good. It will be back."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY;
Japan's Top Mobile Phone Company to Buy AT&T Wireless Stake

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest mobile phone company, agreed yesterday to buy a minority stake in AT&T Wireless for almost $10 billion.
For AT&T Wireless, which has 15 million customers and is the third-largest cellular telephone company in the United States, the deal would provide money for growth as it plans to spin off from its parent, AT&T. The investment also comes at a time when all of the nation's wireless companies are preparing to spend heavily to update their networks with new generations of technology. 
 For current customers of AT&T Wireless who use conventional cell phones, the deal would have minimal effect. Those phones will remain usable far into the future, the companies said, even as they encourage customers to adopt new types of phones with new capabilities.
But by next year, customers who switch to a new type of phone are to have access to NTT DoCoMo's mobile Internet service, known as i-mode. The service is popular in Japan for exchanging e-mail and transmitting data and simple images like horoscopes and cartoon strips. It is uncertain whether such services will catch on in this country, where far more people are accustomed to using the Internet with a personal computer. But the deal means AT&T is intent on joining the trend toward wireless Internet applications.
Just as significant, in agreeing to move into the future with DoCoMo, AT&T Wireless said yesterday that it would adopt a type of network technology that would be more compatible with overseas systems than AT&T's current technology. That means customers would eventually be able to travel to Europe and Asia and use the same mobile phone they use at home.
For a 16 percent stake, NTT DoCoMo, which is controlled by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone of Japan, will pay $6.2 billion to AT&T Wireless, and $3.6 billion to AT&T. The spinoff of AT&T Wireless, part of a breakup plan that AT&T announced last month, is scheduled to be completed next year.
"We're saying loud and clear with all of this that we think the mobile Internet will be a very big thing," John D. Zeglis, chief executive of AT&T Wireless, said in an interview.
For AT&T Wireless, the new money could help the company expand by buying other companies or acquiring additional wireless radio spectrum for systems capable of handling large amounts of voice and data traffic.
NTT DoCoMo hopes to gain a foothold in the United States to sell its popular wireless i-mode Internet service now used by 15 million customers in Japan.
Other potential beneficiaries are the equipment companies Lucent Technologies, Nortel Network, Ericsson and Nokia, all of which AT&T Wireless said yesterday would provide much of the equipment needed for its new networks.
"Not only would we expect AT&T to spend several billions of dollars to upgrade their network, but this alliance could increase pressures on their competitors to do the same," said Michael Ching, an analyst who covers telecommunications equipment companies at Merrill Lynch.
As part of the announcement, AT&T Wireless became the nation's first large wireless carrier to commit itself to a future technical standard known as W-C.D.M.A., for wideband code division multiple access, which is expected to be used within two or three years.
As an interim step during the next two years, AT&T Wireless plans to shift from the technical format it currently uses to two global standards for mobile communications -- G.S.M. and G.P.R.S., for general packet radio service -- that are more common in Europe and Asia than in the United States.
The decision by AT&T Wireless to base its longer-term future on the W-C.D.M.A. standard is likely to heat up the industry contest over who wins and loses from the transition to new wireless technologies.
The news had a negative effect yesterday on the stock of Qualcomm Inc., a wireless technology company, whose shares fell $2.38 to close at $80.25 yesterday. Analysts say that Qualcomm, based in San Diego, could receive fewer patent royalties from networks using W-C.D.M.A. technology, instead of the C.D.M.A. 2000 system that Qualcomm backs.
The move by AT&T Wireless also puts pressure on competitors like Verizon Wireless and Cingular Wireless, the nation's largest and second-largest wireless carriers to declare a future technical format.
Cingular is the newly named wireless venture formed by SBC Communications and BellSouth, which have used a variety of technologies so far. "Cingular is in the worst boat because they need to find a way to converge three different standards and do it quickly," said Rex Dwyer, senior equity analyst at Firsthand Funds in San Jose, Calif.
An almost certain winner in AT&T Wireless's choice of W-C.D.M.A. is NTT DoCoMo, which can now be assured that its choices of present and future wireless technologies will be widely implemented outside Japan.
"We have completed our expansion in the U.S. and Europe," Keiji Tachikawa, chief executive of NTT DoCoMo, told reporters in Tokyo. "We are still seeking partners in Asia, though, as we only have alliances in Hong Kong and Taiwan."
DoCoMo could benefit from economies of scale that allow it to purchase equipment at lower prices. And the Japanese company, the world's second-largest wireless carrier after Vodafone P.L.C. of Britain, will gain an ally to help it sell its i-mode service in the United States.
DoCoMo also announced yesterday that it planned to buy a 20 percent stake in KG Telecom, Taiwan's third-largest wireless carrier, for about $540 million.
Late last year, NTT DoCoMo acquired a 19 percent stake in Hutchison Telecom, the communications division of Hutchison Whampoa of Hong Kong. And in May, the Japanese company bought 15 percent of KPN Mobile, a large Dutch wireless carrier.
NTT DoCoMo has also been reported to have considered acquiring minority interests in SK Telecom of South Korea, Telesystem International Wireless of Canada and Telekom Malaysia.
By seeking minority instead of controlling stakes, NTT DoCoMo expects greater ease in receiving a green light from regulators and legislators in various countries, who might be concerned about the possibility of foreign telecommunications companies gaining control of domestic companies that hold radio-spectrum licenses.
The Japanese company had considered making a bid for VoiceStream Wireless of Bellevue, Wash., earlier this year, only to abandon the effort. Deutsche Telekom of Germany later agreed to acquire VoiceStream, in a deal that has met resistance from some legislators because Deutsche Telekom's initial stake would exceed the 25 percent threshold at which America regulators have tradtionally drawn the foreign-ownership line.
In the United States, one of the biggest challenges for NTT DoCoMo and AT&T Wireless may be deciding how to transfer the success of an overseas business model to a country where wireless Internet services have been slow to catch on. AT&T Wireless will be the sole licensee of DoCoMo's i-mode technology in North America.
"The doubt that remains is how this will affect the user response to the wireless Internet in this country and elsewhere," said Sajai Krishnan, vice president in the communications group at Booz-Allen & Hamilton.

HEADLINE: An Orderly Anniversary for a Great Global Trade Protest

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 30

 BODY:
For the people in sea turtle costumes, for the masked anarchists, for the protesters on stilts who took a rubber bullet with pride, the Battle of Seattle one year ago today has become the Alamo in their fight against corporate globalization.
But as they gathered today on the anniversary of the ruckus that led to more than 600 arrests, and nearly shut down the World Trade Organization's ministerial meetings in Seattle, protesters could do little more than recall the near-legendary days of tear gas and smashed windows, and shout at Christmas shoppers to holster their credit cards. 
 A small group of pickets who were trying, abstractly, to poke fun at global consumerism, chanted: "What do we want? Jelly doughnuts. When do we want them? Now."
They were among several hundred demonstrators who paraded through downtown Seattle today and gathered at a heavily guarded holiday carousel in Westlake Park to raise concerns about the negative effects of world trade.
But all around the demonstrators, shoppers scurried in an out of the very stores that were vandalized in last year's mayhem -- the busy Gap, the crowded McDonald's, the packed Old Navy outlet.
Nostalgia was in the air, and so was a sense of diminishment among some, one year after nearly 50,000 people marched through the city to protest the regular meeting of 139 nations that try to set the rules of global commerce.
While most of the demonstrators last year were peaceful, organized by major labor and environmental organizations, a handful of self-described anarchists and others went on a looting and window-smashing spree that became some of the lasting images of the world trade conference.
And while the police and demonstrators seemed to go to great lengths to keep things peaceful today, several arrests had been made by early evening and the police had brought in a handful of officers in riot gear.
For the police, who lobbed tear gas, fired rubber bullets and wielded batons in several nights of skirmishes with protesters last year, this year's anniversary is a chance to try to do things differently. Norm Stamper, the Seattle police chief in 1999, took early retirement after he faced a volley of criticisms for being both too strong-armed and too weak.
The Battle of Seattle has morphed into metaphor. It has been evoked by trade ministers and people who oppose their organizations at trade meetings in Prague, Washington and Thailand over the last year as a source of both horror and honor. But none of the subsequent demonstrations has come close to the mass gathering of the one here last year, in turnout or publicity.
"There is a very odd sort of affection for the events of last year," said Walt Crowley, a Seattle historian who runs a public affairs site on the Web, Historylink.org, that has had a camera on the events of last year and this year.
"A lot of people got some satisfaction out of what happened," Mr. Crowley said. "They were noticed. And you have to give them some credit for making a household issue out of something so large and abstract as the global economy."
Today -- called N30, for the Nov. 30 date of last year's clashes -- every protester had a war story to tell. And the police, who were in black armor resembling Ninja outfits last year, came today in their uniform blue and went out of their way to be polite, even friendly with the demonstrators.
The protesters had been told that if they took to the streets without parade permits they would face arrest. But when they took to the streets, they were greeted by a police escort.
"It was really cool, the chief gave us an escort for our giant W.T.O. birthday cake," said John Foss, a fisherman who led one of the small rallies this year, and was in the streets last year as well. "There's a fair amount of nostalgia for last year, but in many ways we accomplished our goal. N30 means something all around the world today."
Even the anarchists, clad in black hoods and scarves as usual, were polite and showed organizational discipline in staging street theater that featured recreations of window-breaking. People, playing the role of shoppers, were invited to come forward and smash windows held by anarchists on a blue tarp. When the glass shattered, it was quickly cleaned up.
"Now it cannot be said that on this anniversary there were no broken windows in downtown Seattle," said a man with bullhorn, officiating over the street stagings of the anarchists.
Afterward, several of the young men in black could be seen riding the carousel, surrounded by police.
The events of last year may still cost Mayor Paul Schell of Seattle, who is up for re-election next year, his job. He was accused of failing to protect the meetings and merchants, and for letting the police use force that was deemed excessive by many.
Mr. Schell has spent months preparing for today's anniversary. He said the city would not tolerate any violence, and his police department seemed far more prepared this year.
The police even charmed the jelly doughnut protesters. "The chief of police bought me a Danish and a cup of coffee -- what more could I ask for?" said Frost Thompson, in blue hair, wearing a sandwich board that read "We Want Jelly Donuts."
Other protesters said it did not matter that only about 500 people showed up for the anniversary, despite months of Internet organizing. They had their victory of last year, which, in the minds of many, has become truly historic.
"Last year was a wake-up call for the whole world," said Dale Hodges, a tofu salesman who helped organize this year's protest. "It will go down as the single most important event in American history -- more so than dropping the bomb, even."
When asked about the specific target of the demonstration, given that the World Trade Organization has long since left Seattle, Mr. Hodges said, "Please, people, just stop shopping."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Mussina's Top Attribute Is His Head, Not His Arm

BYLINE: By BUSTER OLNEY 

 BODY:
Every pitcher is a code to be deciphered, but the central problem that Mike Mussina presents for hitters is that they cannot find patterns in what he does, no clues to the code. They anticipate a fastball, and he buckles their knees with a knuckle-curve. They look for a split-finger fastball low, and he fools them with a high fastball.
Mussina, who signed a six-year deal with the Yankees yesterday, does not throw as hard as Boston's Pedro Martinez. He might not have the precision of Atlanta's Greg Maddux, or the ability to dominate with one pitch, as the Yankees' Mariano Rivera does with his cut fastball. But colleagues, opponents and scouts rave about his intelligence, his control, his wide range of pitching weapons and his athleticism. 
 "He's one of the best pitchers I've ever seen," said Jim Palmer, the Hall of Fame pitcher who works as a broadcaster for the Baltimore Orioles, Mussina's former team. "To me, the Yankees are getting an ace-type of pitcher for the next three or four years."
Brad Ausmus, Detroit's All-Star catcher, said, "He's not going to overpower you, but he's going to out-think and out-pitch hitters."
While Mussina was growing up in Montoursville, Pa., he threw against a wall in his basement and would mimic the pitching motions of stars he watched on a television mounted in the room -- Tom Seaver, Nolan Ryan, Palmer. With some basic tips from his father, he essentially taught himself mechanics that are considered by scouts to be extraordinarily sound. Mike Flanagan, the former Orioles' left-hander who spent two years as Mussina's pitching coach, believes that Mussina understands and corrects his mechanics, from pitch to pitch, better than any pitcher he has ever seen.
From this foundation, Mussina learned to throw strikes with ease, and he broke into the majors in 1991 as a three-pitch pitcher: fastball, curveball and changeup. Since then he has added a splitter, which dives downward, and a cut fastball that breaks away from right-handed batters and into left-handed batters. Mussina has averaged only two walks for every nine innings in his career, and he is, by all accounts, one of the few pitchers who is capable of pitching to all four borders of the strike zone.
"He moves the ball around," Derek Jeter said yesterday. "He hits his spots. He'll go in and out, up and down, he'll challenge you. He's not one of those pitchers who can be predictable: He'll keep you guessing."
Jeter will rush to watch videotape between at-bats and usually looks for a trend: He'll watch to see if a pitcher is throwing a particular pitch in a particular area of the plate for a strike -- a fastball on the outside corner, for example, so he will know to look for that pitch.
But when Mussina has pitched against the Yankees, Jeter has looked at videotape merely to eliminate one of many possibilities. If Mussina was not throwing his curveball for strikes early, Jeter might hazard a guess that he would not see that pitch in a critical situation.
But rarely do hitters pin him down in this way; rarely do they break the code, because he's too consistent and throws too many types of pitches. Ausmus remembered a game this season in which Mussina came out throwing very hard early and challenged the first two hitters with first-pitch fastballs. Because it was early in the game, Ausmus went to the plate looking for a fastball on the first pitch. "And he threw me a slider," Ausmus recalled, referring to Mussina's cut fastball, "and I rolled over the top of it and hit a ground ball to second base.
"He won't use the same pattern. He'll do something different every time. He won't start you off with the same pitch, and he'll remember what you hit the last time he faced you. He assesses every situation, and he can throw any one of his pitches for strikes, especially the fastball, curveball and slider."
Mussina graduated from Stanford in three years with a degree in economics, and his intelligence seems to translate into his pitching. "He's a very smart guy," Palmer said. "He really notices a lot of little things; he picks up on a lot of stuff."
That is part of the reason Palmer believes that Mussina -- who will be 37 in the last year of the contract he signed yesterday -- will age well, and continue to be effective as he loses velocity and the sharpness off his breaking pitches. "And he has a great history with his health," said Palmer, mentioning that the two periods Mussina was on the disabled list were related to freakish injuries. "He's very durable."
Some of Mussina's former managers and pitching coaches complain privately that the right-hander is too concerned with his pitch count, that he often insists on being replaced once he gets into the range of 110 to 120 pitches, regardless of the circumstances.
Their inference is that he is selfish, more concerned with his own condition than he is with helping the team. But others within the Orioles' organization note that because the team has had a high turnover of managers and pitching coaches, Mussina is wary of being overused -- his arm overtaxed -- by short-timers who are trying to save their jobs.
Mussina joins a rotation that includes Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte and Orlando Hernandez, and Palmer compared it with when he pitched for the Orioles, along with the likes of Flanagan, Dave McNally and others. The presence of each pitcher took pressure off the other.
"He makes Clemens better, he makes Pettitte better, and he makes El Duque better," Palmer said.
"I have mixed emotions, because even though I played with the Orioles my whole career, I have always loved the Yankees," Palmer said. "I have tremendous respect for Joe Torre and that group and what they've been able to do. In my opinion, they got the best pitcher available."

HEADLINE: Selling Cheap 'Generic' Drugs, India's Copycats Irk Industry

SERIES: MEDICINE MERCHANTS: Beyond Patents

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: BOMBAY

 BODY:
To anyone else, the room looks like the unprepossessing office of a college science teacher. But to the multinational pharmaceutical giants, it is the lair of a pirate king.
Grinning proudly, he brandishes his trustiest weapon, the scribbled notebooks he has kept since his days as a chemistry student at Cambridge in the 1950's. Page upon page is filled with dainty hand-sketched lattices representing carbon rings: new molecules being tested in the West. They are the blueprints for plunder that the pirate has gleaned from his magazine subscriptions; his budget for pharmaceutical and medical journals is $150,000 a year. 
 And just downstairs in the conference room is his treasure hoard, glittering with the pinks and greens of tiny pills, the sheen of gelatin capsules, the sharp glint of injection ampuls. In the room's glass cabinets are the 400 drugs made by his company, Cipla Ltd. They include Erecto, the company's knockoff of Viagra; Nuzac, its knockoff of Prozac; Forcan, its knockoff of the antifungal drug Diflucan; Lomac, its knockoff of the ulcer drug Prilosec; Amlopres, its knockoff of the hypertension drug Norvasc.
Some of these compounds make $1 billion or more a year for the Western companies that hold the patents on them. But not here. They are sold by Cipla at one-twentieth to one-fiftieth of the price paid in the United States.
And they are all perfectly legal, at least under Indian law.
"We did a little study," Yusuf K. Hamied, Cipla's managing director and India's most outspoken buccaneer, said during a tour of his headquarters. "Our turnover is $200 million. If we sold our products at the American-originator prices, our turnover would be $4 billion."
To pharmaceutical giants like Pfizer, Glaxo Wellcome and Aventis, which invest billions of dollars in research, Dr. Hamied embodies the enemy.
Under Indian law, only manufacturing processes, not the products themselves, are covered by patents. So Indian drug companies can boldly reverse-engineer best-selling drugs and sell copies cheaply. "I make every Pfizer product," Mr. Hamied boasted.
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA, which represents the United States industry, says Indian patent law is "designed to punish importers of patented technology into India and to coerce local production."
It calls India's licensing practices "infamous" and says the experience of some American drug makers "has been so negative that most companies have abandoned efforts to obtain or enforce patents in India."
Exactly how much money Western pharmaceutical manufacturers lose in India and other countries like Brazil, Argentina, Thailand, Egypt and China that fly the Jolly Roger of drug piracy is in dispute. Annual world sales of drugs amount to about $400 billion, and some executives claim that a tenth of that, $40 billion, is lost.
But it is also true that Western drug companies would sell very little in the developing world at the prices they charge Americans and Europeans. Harvey E. Bale Jr., director general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations, a Geneva-based industry trade group, put the total of lost sales at about $3 billion.
A PhRMA study released in February found that losses in India were $69 million a year, but it covered just 20 common knockoff drugs. Mr. Bale said the total loss figure for India was probably $100 million a year.
 
Semantics and Ethics
Iain Cockburn, a professor of management at Boston University who has studied the issue, says there are serious problems with pirates, because some make weak or even toxic counterfeits. Also, some powerful compounds, anti-AIDS drugs for example, must be taken on a rigorous schedule under careful monitoring, yet knockoff drugs may be shipped to impoverished countries where a steady supply and satisfactory medical supervision cannot be assured.
But apart from those concerns, he said, Western drug companies "just don't like the idea that their proprietary rights can be got around via the back door."
"That's the bottom line," Professor Cockburn continued. "It's a threat to the business model."
He noted that even if "the generic companies" were selling in markets that did not attract the Western drug giants, "the world supply of each molecule increases, so the world average price has got to come down."
When Professor Cockburn called them "the generic companies" instead of "pirates," he was underscoring an essential aspect of the knockoff drug industry. Some producers are fly-by-night operations making dangerous counterfeits, but others, like Cipla and its chief rival, Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd., are reputable companies that make much of their money manufacturing ingredients for American and European companies; 70 percent to 80 percent of the key ingredients in American-made generic drugs come from foreign suppliers, as do about 60 percent of those in brand-name drugs.
It is only when the newest molecules, often made in the same factories, are sold in countries where a patent has not yet expired, that a "generics manufacturer" becomes a "pirate counterfeiter."
"It's a marvelous piece of P.R. to get these companies called pirates," said Frederick M. Scherer, an emeritus professor of public policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. "What they're doing is perfectly legitimate, until 2005, under the Paris convention and the Uruguay Round of trade talks."
Under those talks, which set up the World Trade Organization and forged a treaty on intellectual property, India has until 2005 to bring its laws into accordance with the treaty, which recognizes 20-year patents on most inventions. Without patents, which ensure a period in which to profit by being the sole legal seller of an invention, no one would invest in finding new medicines.
India's current drug laws ignore that reasoning, on the ground that saving Indian lives is more important than profits to inventors. And Parliament, with the country's drug industry lobbying hard to protect its ability to copy molecules, is taking its time on compliance legislation.
"We don't need to be apologetic about it," said Dr. Javid A. Chowdhury, the Indian minister of health. "We're a self-contained, developing economy. We live on little, but we survive. Outside of the third world, there's very little realization of how little money the poor live on. The per-capita health expenditure in India is $10 a year."
Noting that some Western drug companies have discounted their prices of AIDS drugs to Africa by 80 percent, he added, "If they can offer an 80 percent discount, there was something wrong with the price they started off with."
The American pharmaceutical industry -- often ranked as the country's most profitable -- disputes the view that its profits are unconscionably high. One PhRMA statement argues that they are "only slightly above the average for all industries" and blames the higher valuations on the way accountants write off research expenses. But it also argues that "we need to be profitable in order to attract the capital to sustain innovation."
 
The Mechanics of Profit
Mr. Bale of the Geneva-based trade group says pharmaceutical companies operate in a world in which most new drugs are either costly duds or blockbusters. To stay competitive -- and to stay alive in an era of mergers and increasing competition -- they rely on profits from their most successful products. "One or two products make or break the company," Mr. Bale said. "They drive those blockbusters to maximize revenues."
Shannon Herzfeld, a PhRMA spokeswoman, took particular issue with India's rationale. "We object to their premise that intellectual property rights are a barrier to access to good medicine," she said. "Anyone who says, 'We have to steal' is wrong. Stealing ideas is not how one provides good health care."
In fact, India recognizes Western-style intellectual property rights on most products, including computer software, in which it has a thriving industry. But it does not recognize them on chemicals for medicine or agriculture, a position that dates back to its Patents Act of 1970, for which Mr. Hamied heavily lobbied Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The law, conceived in postcolonial days when India still suffered famines and the average Indian man could expect to live only about 40 years, was intended to encourage the founding of local industries to break the choke hold of foreign chemical companies.
At the time, India's drug prices were among the highest in the world. Now they are among the lowest. Access to drugs is one reason that average life expectancy has risen to 64 today, just as cheap pesticides based on foreign formulas are part of the reason India now feeds itself.
An important provision in the 1970 law recognized "process patents" rather than "product patents." That is, an inventor patents the multistep recipe for making the drug, not the molecule itself. If a rival can tweak the recipe slightly but end up with the same molecule, he may patent that and sell the result.
As Indian drug makers point out, many countries have used process patents to develop new industries, as Japan did in the 1950's. And during the 19th-century Industrial Revolution, Americans freely copied European inventions.
Asked how he feels about being called a pirate, Mr. Hamied tells an anecdote about an American friend who visited India and paid for his trip by buying 1,000 Voltaren tablets, made by Ciba-Geigy, for his mother's arthritis. The price in America was $2,000. In India, because of stiff competition from imitators, Ciba-Geigy sold the same product for 5 cents a tablet, so he paid $50.
"Somebody had been pirated," Mr. Hamied said. "And in this case, it wasn't by the Indian."
 
The Economics of AIDS
Jag M. Khanna, president of research for Ranbaxy, an Indian company that is Cipla's biggest rival, was indignant at the suggestion that he was engaging in piracy. "I have the right to follow the law of my land, and the law says I can reverse-engineer what I like," he said. "They call us pirates, but we're developing our country."
Mr. Khanna's company makes generic Zantac, the Glaxo Wellcome ulcer drug, in bulk for $50 a kilogram. "When it was on patent," he said, "the company charged $9,000 per kilo."
Mr. Hamied makes sildenafil citrate, the active ingredient in Viagra, for 2 cents a pill. He exports it to Yemen and Sudan, where it sells under the Erecto name. Assuming he gets government approval next month, he will sell it for 10 cents in India under the name Eviva or Tarzia.
He also makes fluconazole, an antifungal drug, for an American generic drug company that is testing it for sale in 2002, when Pfizer's patent on the drug, which it sells as Diflucan, runs out.
Meanwhile, though, Mr. Hamied is making it in bulk for $900 a pound, and selling it in India for 50 cents a pill. He could make a safe, full-strength version for $135 a pound, and sell it for as little as 5 cents a pill, he said. But since he exports to America, the United States Food and Drug Administration imposes stringent cleanliness and safety standards on his factory -- small batches, constant testing, sanitized vessels, pressurized air locks, voluminous record-keeping -- that drive costs up.
In the United States, name-brand Diflucan is sold to treat toenail fungus, yeast infections including thrush, and other conditions. Pfizer makes about $1 billion a year on it, at a wholesale price of about $10 a pill. At retail, it can sell for $25 or even $40.
But a daily fluconazole tablet is also the only way to save an AIDS patient with cryptococcal meningitis, a lethal brain inflammation.
In Africa, where millions have AIDS and about 10 percent develop the meningitis, Pfizer's patents keep the price at about $18 a pill -- a death sentence for most infected Africans. In April, the company said it would eventually give the drug away free in South Africa, but it has yet to do so.
Cipla makes 4 of the 14 drugs commonly used in AIDS "cocktail" therapy: zidovudine, lamivudine, stavudine and nevirapine. Depending on how it is formulated, Cipla's cocktail costs as little as $83 a month, versus $1,000 or more in the West. But Cipla cannot legally sell the drug in many African countries, which have Western-style patent laws.
The big pharmaceutical companies defend their monopolies in even the poorest markets. When Cipla tried to give away some Duovir, its knockoff of Glaxo Wellcome's Combivir, in Ghana, British-based Glaxo said it would not take action against modest donations but added that it would "reserve the right to enforce our patent rights against any further acts of infringement."
Dr. Hamied began reverse-engineering AIDS drugs in 1992 because, he said, he realized the epidemic would hit India hard. "Lamivudine took four years of my life," he said.
Cipla keeps lowering the prices of these drugs "for social reasons," he said, and the company runs television ads with public health messages.
In part, it can charge less because it keeps overhead low; its headquarters here in Bombay are in a nondescript 35-year-old building behind a church and an apartment house.
Mr. Hamied said he could charge more for his drugs, but then fewer people would be able to afford them. "If you want to have granite rooms and marble floors, O.K., but it's not my style," Mr. Hamied said. "I can't eat better than I do."
That said, he does have homes in London and Mauritius.
His chemists with Ph.D.'s make about $10,000 a year, a good salary in India. The lowest-paid of his 3,500 employees make about $2,400 a year, he said.
 
Indian Success Story
Mr. Hamied comes by this mix of motivations -- profit, social conscience and nationalism -- by birthright. His father was a follower of Mahatma Gandhi's brand of Indian nationalism whose family chipped in to send him to study chemistry in England, India's colonial master, in 1924. Instead, he changed ships and went to Germany, then the world's leader in chemicals. On a Berlin lake, he met a Lithuanian Jewish socialist -- Mr. Hamied's mother. They fled as Germany was shifting into Nazi hands, and the Chemical, Industrial and Pharmaceutical Laboratories, later known as Cipla, was founded in 1935.
The company still keeps a sort of shrine to the day in 1939 that Gandhi visited, writing in the guest book, "I was delighted to visit this Indian enterprise."
But, like all Indian companies, Cipla suffers from what is sometimes called "the liability of Indianness" -- a sense in the West that its products are somehow substandard.
To be sure, India has a serious counterfeiting problem. It has more than 20,000 drug companies, and many make poor-quality fakes. But 70 percent of the domestic market is controlled by 20 companies. Some are subsidiaries of multinationals; the biggest, Glaxo India, is part of Glaxo Wellcome. The large independents, like Cipla, Ranbaxy, Dr. Reddy's, Wockhardt and Sun Pharma, already produce many generic drugs for export to America, Europe and Japan, so they pass regular inspections by visiting regulators from the United States, Britain, Germany and elsewhere.
"They have a better record than some American manufacturers," said Vihari Purushothaman, an analyst of health care stocks for Chase JF in Bombay. They have to wait so long for Food and Drug Administration inspectors to fly in, he said, "that they make sure they don't leave anything to chance."
Ranbaxy has F.D.A. approval for 20 of its generic products, Mr. Khanna said, and it even owns a factory in New Brunswick, N.J.
Outside the Indian city of Pune (often spelled Poona), Cipla has a brand-new factory where employees in spotless scrub suits cross pressurized air locks to tend expensive drug-making machinery. The factory is on a rural campus whose lawns are watered with the purified output of the effluent plant.
Dr. Hamied says his factories have passed 22 separate Food and Drug Administration inspections.
Even though multinational drug executives know there are reputable Indian companies, they often tar them all by "confusing the issues by mixing 'counterfeit,' 'bad quality' and 'India' in the same heap," said Ellen 't Hoen, a drug policy consultant to Doctors Without Borders, which pushes for cheaper drugs in the developing world.
Acknowledging the phenomenon, Mr. Purushothaman said there was "a sort of racism inherent in this."
Ms. Herzfeld, the PhRMA spokeswoman, denied that such scare tactics were used. "I don't know a single executive who'd do that," she said. "That's not based on fact; it's sort of an urban myth."
If India abided by Western patent laws, more Western companies would sell there and would price drugs so Indian consumers could afford them, she said.
"We won't spend $500 million and 17 years to come up with a product that no one will buy," she said. "I don't see why anyone would neglect the Indian market. Our members have been in Africa for decades too. We sell lots of medicine in Africa, for Parkinson's and heart disease, for example. Our members are dedicated to getting our medicines to people who are sick."
She also suggested that the Indian government ought to look harder at its budgets, and consider whether it ought to pay more for health rather than for "submarines or fighter planes." Since life expectancy is part of development, she said, "maybe they might put more money in health care than in 10-lane highways or in steel mills."
Indian drug executives, of course, scoff at the notion that Western companies would price drugs for Indian pockets without being forced to by local competition.
 
Getting in Line
Whether they like it or not, however, some Indian companies are beginning to conduct original research. To be accepted into the World Trade Organization, India signed the 1994 Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and has promised to bring its laws into compliance by 2005.
Some Indians, like Amit Sen Gupta, head of the Delhi Science Forum, a scientists' group, worry that product patents will turn the clock back to the 1960's, when Western drug companies dominated India, set high prices and conducted little research on tropical diseases that, like leprosy and malaria, do not affect Americans or Europeans.
India's Parliament, however, is well behind its own 2005 legislation schedule, and the nation's industry is lobbying hard to be sure the new laws do not hamstring its ability to copy molecules.
The 1994 agreement recognizes that there are circumstances under which product patents can be voided. These might include war, epidemics or antitrust violations by patent holders. One easily exploitable provision is "failure to work the patent." Under it, a patent can be voided if the patent holder fails to make or import the product, or even fails to sell it at prices affordable to average citizens. Since the average Indian now spends $3.50 a year on drugs, affordability could be a low threshold.
Mr. Hamied wants the new law to recognize "licensing of right," which could allow him to copy any drug he wanted as long as he paid a royalty to the patent holder. He conceded, though, that setting royalties would probably cause constant legal disputes.
Virtually all Indian lawmakers would agree that patents on crucial drugs should be voided if people were dying for lack of them, he said. But what is a lifesaving drug?
"To an asthmatic, an inhaler is lifesaving," he said. "Everything that improves your quality of life -- Viagra, drugs for Alzheimer's, mood elevators, tranquilizers -- can be lifesaving. You must give people a chance."
C. Visalakshi, an analyst of health stocks for Kotak Securities in Bombay, said she doubted any new law will go that far. She predicted that the right to copy, under carefully defined circumstances, would still "definitely apply to AIDS drugs, cancer drugs and lifesaving drugs." She continued: "Maybe not for antibiotics. And probably not for lifestyle drugs like Viagra or Rogaine."
Mr. Hamied is not waiting for a new law. Back at his desk after a tour of his headquarters laboratories, which bristle with expensive equipment from Hewlett-Packard and Perkins-Elmer, he picks up his latest notebook.
"I think this will be a blockbuster drug," he said, displaying his sketch of Ariflo, an anti-asthma drug that SmithKline Beecham has not started selling yet. "And this." He shows an unreleased anti-AIDS drug called calanolide-A.
He is already breaking them down and working on new formulations. "This is what gives me pleasure in life," he said with a satisfied grin. "And it's my venture capital."

HEADLINE: Entrepreneurs' 'Golden Age' Is Fading in Economic Boom

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The idea that the United States is increasingly a nation of entrepreneurs and self-starters has become accepted wisdom.
"Welcome to the free-agent nation," declares Tom Peters, one of the world's best-known management gurus. 
 Thirty million Americans -- and counting -- are now some form of freelancer, recent articles in business magazines have proclaimed. This is the era of "the e-lance economy," experts say, with the Internet allowing millions of people to bid goodbye to corporate life and become their own bosses.
There is a problem, however, with this futuristic vision: it does not appear to jibe with reality. Rather than booming in recent years, self-employment has declined both in numbers and as a share of the work force. In the strong economy, it seems, large companies desperate for additional workers have managed to lure employees from all over, in part by offering some of the benefits of self-employment. At the same time, the difficulties of entrepreneurship have become less tolerable.
Since 1994, the number of self-employed Americans outside agriculture has fallen by 146,000, to 12.9 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The period between 1994 and 1999, hailed as a golden age for entrepreneurs, is the first five-year span since the 1960's in which the number of self-employed fell.
By contrast, for most of the last three decades, self-employment grew slightly faster than the overall labor force.
But in recent years, as the economy has added millions of jobs, the portion of Americans who say that they work for themselves -- whether on their own or with dozens of employees they have hired -- has dropped by almost one-tenth, according to the bureau's survey of 50,000 households.
In 1994, 10.9 percent of the nonagricultural work force was self-employed; in 1999, it fell to 9.9 percent.
"It's a surprise," said David G. Blanchflower, an economics professor at Dartmouth, who writes about entrepreneurship. "We don't really understand it."
What is clear, economists say, is that much of the widely believed hyperbole surrounding the Internet and the new economy has exaggerated the ease with which people can hang out their own shingle.
"We have this idea that everyone's out there working for themselves," said Robert W. Fairlie, an assistant professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz, who studies the history of self-employment. Instead, he said, millions of Americans have joined the working economy during the 90's boom and almost all were employed by existing businesses.
And contrary to earlier trends, most have taken jobs with big companies. Businesses with at least 1,000 employees have grown the fastest since 1994, while the percentage of people working for businesses with fewer than 25 workers has slipped to 29 percent from 30.1 percent.
In fact in many ways, running a small business or acting as an independent consultant has become harder than it once was, analysts say. Health care costs have grown faster for self-employed people than for big companies, and the increase in families with two working parents has made the demands of running a business all the more difficult.
To listen to formerly self-employed workers, there also seem to be reasons to move to an established company that have nothing to do with economics. At a time when people have less time to spend with their neighbors or in civic and recreational groups, these workers say that a traditional office -- despite all of its problems -- has become one of the few places to find a community.
"There was something exhilarating about being out on my own," said Alan Halpern, who ran a one-person consulting business until last year. "But I realized that the frustration of never being on a team, never being a part of the decision-making process, was a feeling I was going to have over and over and over again."
"My sense is that outside of work, we feel more isolated than we did in the past," said Mr. Halpern, 39, and now marketing director at an educational publisher in Dayton, Ohio. "If I didn't belong to something at work, it'd be hard to belong to something anywhere."
Karl A. Welch, who in May joined Excite@Home, an Internet service provider in Redwood City, Calif., after almost 20 years as a concert promoter, said he had similar feelings. "I really wanted to find some stability in my life," Mr. Welch, 37, said. "I wanted to work for a company where there was a group of people trying to create something."
The decline in self-employment has accelerated since 1997, and it has occurred in most industries, including construction, finance, retailing and services. The drop has also taken place in every region of the country, with the greatest falloff in Western states that still have higher self-employment rates than other areas, said Steve Hipple, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Workers younger than 35, those logging less than a full-time schedule and those without a college degree were also more likely to have abandoned self-employment than others. Meantime, the average income of the self-employed climbed by about a third in the second half of the 1990's, according to the Census Bureau.
Together, these trends suggest that technological changes and venture capital have opened new opportunities for the best-educated and most highly skilled entrepreneurs at the same time a strong economy has made self-employment less attractive for most workers.
The lowest unemployment rate since 1970 -- now 3.9 percent -- has forced companies, even relatively new ones, to sweeten their hiring offers. Two-thirds of companies with fewer than 200 workers now offer health insurance, compared with less than three out of five in 1996, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. (Nearly all big companies offer health care plans.) Other employers have raised pay or dangled new perks like training programs.
Still, the advocates of a "free-agent nation" say the dip in self-employment does not disprove their point. They note that other forms of nontraditional employment, like temporary help and telecommuting, have gained ground, causing some analysts to say that 30 million people are indeed some form of free agent.
"Part of what we're suggesting is a change in mind-set," said Thomas W. Malone, an M.I.T. professor who wrote "The Dawn of the E-Lance Economy" with Robert J. Laubacher in the September 1998 issue of The Harvard Business Review.
Self-employment will grow in the coming years, as the Internet further decentralizes the workplace, he predicts. "I'm somewhat relaxed about what the statistics show this year," Professor Malone said.
Other experts, however, note that some are returning to the workplace precisely because corporate America now matches some of the benefits of self-employment.
"There's a finer line between self-employment and regular employment," said Scott P. Kurnit, the chief executive of About.com, an Internet company in New York that has hired 20 or so formerly self-employed people since April.
Suzanne Gibbons-Neff is one of them. She decided to return to company life after a stint as Elizabeth Taylor's publicist, and then a dozen years on her own, largely because she thought she could have some of the flexibility that self-employment offers without the isolation it brings. She works at home in Connecticut every Friday and, like other employees, can send her boss a simple e-mail with "WAH" -- working at home -- in the subject line on other days she wants to avoid the office.
"I was going to work for a company," Ms. Gibbons-Neff said, "but not one with a corporate sensibility."
Others said the traditional benefits of working for a company had grown more appealing. Thomas B. Cox accepted a job in the Portland office of PricewaterhouseCoopers' consulting arm because he worried that he was falling behind after eight years as an independent technology consultant. "It's really easy to get sloppy when you're on your own," said Mr. Cox, who hopes to open a bed-and-breakfast with his wife one day. "I needed some coaching and higher expectations."
And after eight years of starting new companies, Kevin J. Seifert said he just wanted to see his family more. "The ability to have any balance in life -- whether it's hobbies, or spending time with your children before they're gone -- is very hard in the start-up environment," said Mr. Seifert, 39, a vice president at Becton, Dickinson, a medical-device maker in Franklin Lakes, N.J.
In fact, for much of the 20th century, self-employment in the United States was in decline, impelled in large part by the move from farm to factory. As recently as the years just before World War II, with an economy that included many more independent farmers than today's, about one in five workers had no boss.
That share continued to drop steadily until the 1970's, when it essentially stabilized at roughly one in eight, as the growth of service industries like consulting and finance provided new chances for self-employment. Widespread layoffs among white-collar workers in the late 80's and early 90's also caused some people to set up their own businesses.
That new generation of the self-employed offset the continued decline in small farming and seemed to mark the beginning of an age of entrepreneurship. With the recent decrease in self-employment, however, those entrepreneurs could turn out to be an exception to a century-long trend.

HEADLINE: A Historic Transition in Mexico

 BODY:
The inauguration of Vicente Fox Quesada as Mexico's president today is a hopeful watershed in that nation's history, one that may someday be deemed as significant as Mexico's early-19th-century independence from Spain or its early-20th-century revolution. It marks the first peaceful transfer of power from one political faction to another in modern Mexican history, as the Institutional Revolutionary Party ends its 71-year rule. Mexico's 100 million people have reclaimed their government, and now look to Mr. Fox to consolidate their democracy.
Strengthening the rule of law is the most daunting challenge and greatest opportunity facing the Fox administration. Mexican society mobilized to end the PRI's capricious rule partly out of a sense of disgust with widespread corruption. Mr. Fox has appointed a tough law-and-order team and has pledged to respect the judiciary's independence. The new government will audit public accounts and may appoint a transparency commission to investigate possible crimes committed by past administrations. Such moves will send a proper message of zero tolerance for corruption. 
 But Mr. Fox's ability to inquire into past wrongdoing will be complicated by his need to work with opposition parties to advance his agenda. The PRI still commands a plurality of votes in both chambers of Congress, and governs two-thirds of the states. Mr. Fox will have to woo centrist PRI legislators to support his free-market economic initiatives and leftist Revolutionary Democratic Party legislators to support democratic reforms the PRI may oppose. He will have to resist the social conservatism of his own National Action Party's base, lest he help bring about an alliance between the PRI and the P.R.D.
The imperial presidency was the omnipotent epicenter of PRI rule for decades. Mr. Fox will have to accept the downsizing of his own office to strengthen Mexico's democracy. He must bolster the independence of the long-subservient legislative and judicial branches of government.
The departing president, Ernesto Zedillo, deserves credit for enabling the democratic transition and for handing his successor a strong economy. He wisely granted the central bank autonomy and secured robust but disciplined growth in the last few years. The economy is expected to grow 7 percent in 2000, the rate Mr. Fox believes necessary over the long term to raise the living standards of most Mexicans. But he will be hard pressed to match that rate next year. Inefficient state-owned electricity and oil monopolies are in dire need of billions of dollars of investment to expand capacity, but privatizing them is not politically feasible.
The Fox administration will present special challenges for Washington, long accustomed to dealing with an authoritarian government in Mexico. Mexican public opinion is likely to loom larger in the bilateral relationship. Mr. Fox will press his vision of a more ambitious North American Free Trade Agreement along the lines of the European Union. He is also likely to be a forceful advocate for democracy and human rights in the hemisphere. If President Fox's six-year term lives up to its promise, Mexicans can start taking pride in their nation's present reality, instead of having to seek comfort in its future potential.

HEADLINE: Looking at Higher Education, Report Finds Vast Differences Among States

BYLINE: By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
High school students in Nebraska are twice as likely as those in Alabama to take mathematics courses designed to prepare them for college. Young people in North Dakota are twice as likely as those in Nevada to enroll in college. And because of differences in state tuition, Vermont families must spend nearly 40 percent of their annual income to send a child to a state university, compared with families in Utah, where the figure is 17 percent.
A new survey packed with statistics like these has found wide disparities in how states prepare students for a college education, help them pay for tuition and ensure that they graduate. 
 "Your chances of getting to college are enormously dependent on where you live," said Patrick M. Callan, president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, the nonpartisan organization that released its findings yesterday.
The report pointed to factors that have long been known to cause discrepancies in access and achievement, including students' race, family income and a state's relative wealth.
In Illinois, for example, which sends a higher percentage of its students to college than most other states, 41 percent of white residents 18 to 24 are enrolled in college, as compared with 24 percent of young people of all other races, the survey said.
The report also suggested that the federal government has done little to ensure that a student in one part of the country receives the same educational opportunities as a student in another.
Indeed, the report made clear, the states that bear the primary responsibility for higher education, with 78 percent of American college students enrolled in state colleges and universities. And those states differ greatly in how much they help their residents pay for higher education.
"While higher education is so good for so many people, an awful lot of people aren't getting to it," said James B. Hunt Jr., the departing governor of North Carolina and the chairman of the organization that released the survey yesterday.
"My own state," said Mr. Hunt, who is completing his fourth term, "gets a very poor grade on college participation."
The survey found that only 34 percent of North Carolina high school freshmen went on to apply to college after four years, one of the lowest rankings in the country. That compares with New York and Connecticut, where the figure is 44 percent, and New Jersey, where it is 54 percent, the best in the nation.
"I'm not really certain why," Mr. Hunt said of the disparity. "I think it has a lot to do with the fact that we have been historically poor, we have a high number of minority citizens who have not been given good opportunities, and I don't think a lot of our people have valued higher education."
Still, those students who do attend colleges in North Carolina, both public and private, are more likely than those in many other states to graduate, with 56 percent completing a bachelor's degree in five years, the survey said.
Drawing on figures from throughout the 1990's, the survey found that the highest percentage of students in any state who take at least one college-preparatory mathematics course was in Nebraska (61 percent), while the lowest was in Alabama (27 percent).
A spokesman for the Alabama Department of Education, Tom Salter, disputed Alabama's ranking, saying, "it may have been true 10 years ago, but it's not true now."
Mr. Salter said that beginning with the class that graduated from high school last spring, all Alabama students must take geometry to graduate, a subject that is considered upper level, or college preparatory, by the authors of the survey. Mr. Salter acknowledged, however, that Alabama spent less per student in kindergarten through 12th grade than almost any other state.
The survey found that the state with the highest percentage of residents who graduate from high school was North Dakota, with 95 percent.
Gaylynn Becker, the assistant director of approval and accreditation for the North Dakota Department of Public Instruction, attributed the state's success to many factors, most notably "the expectation of parents here that you will graduate from high school and you will go on to college."
Moreover, Mr. Becker said, the percentage of students in the state who have at least one parent who graduated from college is among the highest in the country. He also cited the sparseness of the state's population -- at about 600,000, among the smallest in the nation -- and the relatively high number of public and private colleges that serves it, at least 10.
Evaluating how well states make it possible for students to afford college, the survey gave its highest grade to Utah, where 17 percent of a family's annual income is required, on average, to pay for tuition at a public university. That compares with Vermont, where the average portion of family income required to pay the average tuition at a state university or college was 39 percent. The figures do not include financial aid.
In explaining those differences, Joni Finney, the vice president of the organization that produced the survey, cited the relatively low average tuition at four-year state universities in Utah -- $2,100 -- and the relatively high average cost in Vermont, $6,479.
Ms. Finney also said that far more students in Utah than in Vermont attend public colleges, as opposed to private colleges, allowing the Utah to achieve economies of scale that drive down the cost of tuition.

HEADLINE: Is It the 2000 Bug? Year of the Dragon? It's a Baby Boomlet

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Having a baby at NYU Downtown Hospital? Take a good pillow; you may be stuck laboring in the hallway. Delivering at Lenox Hill Hospital this month and hoping for a private room? Keep dreaming.
Birthrates have soared at many hospitals in the New York region in the last year, especially in recent months. From New York Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn, where deliveries are up 15 percent over last year, to Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, where births climbed 9 percent, to New York University Medical Center, where deliveries are calculated to jump 17.5 percent by year's end. 
 And many hospitals, even those where birthrates were relatively flat for most of the year, report that October and November were especially busy. Why did so many people get pregnant last January and February? A collective celebration of David Letterman's successful open heart surgery? Inability to get to work because of a broken pipeline at Pennsylvania Station? Perhaps it was a millennium thing.
"I guess everyone was just happy that the world didn't blow up," said Michael Hinck, a spokesman for Flushing Hospital Medical Center in Queens. Delivery volume there rose only modestly this year until October -- which was off the map. The 191 babies born that month totaled 15 percent higher than in October 1999.
Other hospitals report similar October gains. Lenox Hill Hospital, on the Upper East Side, saw a 25 percent rise in births over last October, when the rate was flat over 1998.
Perhaps Mr. Hinck's explanation is striking in its lack of scientific basis. But many directors of obstetrics departments are also puzzled. While most of them like to think 2000 has been a good year because women have suddenly discovered their hospitals are wonderful, a few other explanations seem more plausible.
The Year of the Dragon, which began in February, is considered a great one in which to have a baby among many Chinese and Korean immigrants. Centers that serve a large Chinese population have gained from such lunar luck.
And while the October boomlet certainly suggests millennial madness, Dr. Michael Divon, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Lenox Hill, posits that more people with money who would have left the city in other eras are now sticking around and having children. "It's the economy, stupid," Dr. Divon said.
A week ago, the waiting list for a private room was 20 people long, he said, while normally there are 6 people on the list. Women are not yet laboring in the hallways at that hospital, which can happen when too many women show up at once. "We are O.K. for now," Dr. Divon said. "But an increase from now will require more resources."
In 1999, there were 123,739 live births in New York City, a tiny decrease over 1998; no 2000 data is available yet from the city's Department of Health to verify if a true yearlong boom took over the city.
It is not quite clear whether the apparent mini-boom has extended to the suburbs; some hospitals in New Jersey, Connecticut and Long Island say yes, others no. Nationally, the picture is equally murky, since the National Center for Health Statistics does not have any 2000 data yet.
At Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, for instance, the number of births rose 7 percent this year so far over the same period in 1999. At Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, the biggest birthing center in the Midwest, the rate rose only 4 percent, and executives there say they believe that is high for Chicago.
Dr. Iffath Hoskins, chairwoman of obstetrics and gynecology at NYU Downtown Hospital, could not care less about what is going on -- or not going on -- in the Midwest. All she can say is that there have been plenty of nights in the last year during which she ran to check on a woman in one room who was in labor, zipped off to deliver a baby in the next room, then checked on patient No. 1 again on her way to a Caesarean section.
Dr. Hoskins traces her hospital's boom directly to the Year of the Dragon, celebrated by many of her Chinese patients, who make up about 65 percent of obstetric clients. "Our Chinese patients tell us they planned it this way," she said.
(There is some evidence of a dragon effect in Hong Kong, where 38,134 babies were born between this January and September, up from 37,270 in the same period in 1999. But then again, in 1998, the Year of the Tiger, there were 39,043 births in that period. So who knows?)
NYU Downtown Hospital has had to add 10 postpartum beds in the last year to keep up with the frenzy. "We are happy with these kind of logistical problems," Dr. Hoskins said. Her staff at times disagrees. August was their busiest month -- they had 272 deliveries in a space intended for about 150 -- and they had to call in extra nurses, parking attendants, lactation consultants, housekeeping and neonatal security guards.
One night they had 14 deliveries. "It was horrible," she said. "I was the only one working with a smile. Moms are supposed to get a candlelight supper the day after they deliver. They ran out of china, and I suspect they ran out of the good shrimp and wine. I really have to believe that some of the patients got a sandwich and were told to be happy."
So what does it all mean? Who knows. But hospital executives love the volume. While delivering babies is not a terribly profitable business, the maternity ward is considered an excellent place to recruit patients.
"We are grateful for the increase in volume and hope that it continues," said Dr. Gary Eglinton, the chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens in Flushing, where births have increased 12 percent so far this year.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 30

 BODY:
The California Supreme Court today unanimously upheld a lower court decision that overturned a San Jose ordinance requiring government contractors to solicit bids from companies owned by women and members of minorities.
The court said the ordinance was unconstitutional because it violated the state's Proposition 209. 
 That initiative, approved by voters in 1996, amended California's Constitution to prohibit preferences for women and minorities in state and local contracting, employment and education.
San Jose's ordinance requires city construction contractors, on contracts exceeding $50,000, to contact at least four companies owned by women or members of minorities, negotiate with them and accept their bids or state legitimate reasons for rejection.

Stock Sell-Off Accelerates And Broadens

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Selling on Wall Street moved into high gear yesterday as investors received another dose of technology earnings disappointments and were left wondering how much more the American economy and corporate earnings will slow.
Hardest hit was the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which fell as much as 6.8 percent before cutting its losses to 4 percent. The index, which plunged 22.9 percent in November, finished its worst month since the crash in October 1987. The index is down 48.5 percent from its record reached in March, its second-worst decline from a high ever. And it is at its lowest level since Aug. 12, 1999, wiping out all of the 97 percent rally to its March high. 
 But the sell-off, which had been contained recently to the Nasdaq and the technology sector, also spread to other sectors that will suffer with slower economic growth.
"The collateral damage from the tech implosion has taken down many nontech areas as well," said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
But the damage was not as great as it might have been. By late afternoon, investors apparently saw a lot of bargains, both in technology and other hard-hit stocks, and the three main gauges managed to pare their losses.
The Nasdaq tumbled as low as 2,523, reaching a milestone of sorts, down 50 percent from its March record. The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 3.2 percent and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped as much as 3.5 percent before bargain hunters trimmed the losses for both gauges back to 2 percent.
But the declines in the Dow and S.& P. 500 showed how the selling has extended to economically sensitive stocks like International Paper, Dow Chemical, Union Carbide, Sears, Roebuck and Gap. Gap and Limited, two big specialty retailers, announced disappointing November sales on Wednesday. Gap's sales were down 1 percent, while the Limited's sales were up just 3 percent. Gap fell 88 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $24.94, while Limited fell 94 cents, or 4.6 percent, to $19.44.
Even with the late afternoon rally, the stock market's main gauges, as they begin the last month of the year, are heading toward their worst annual returns in more than 20 years. In other words, the stock market could give millions of investors the worst news they have ever heard.
"The concerns about the economy have reached such a level that we are reducing equity exposure," said Douglas R. Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities. "We have shifted out of a rotational market in which we were running out of tech and into other areas.
"What remains to be seen," he added, "is how weak does earnings growth get? Does it go to zero? How weak does the economy get?"
Like many of the recent Nasdaq sell-offs, this one was touched off by more bad news as companies disclosed the effect a slowing American economy is having on their sales and earnings. Gateway, the nation's second-largest direct seller of computers behind Dell Computer, reported after the close of the market on Wednesday that its Thanksgiving weekend sales came in 30 percent below those in the same period a year earlier. The company said it would probably miss current earnings and revenue forecasts by a wide margin, and its shares fell $10.50, or 35.6 percent, to $19.
The Altera Corporation, a manufacturer of programmable computer chips used in cellular phones, said late Wednesday that its first-quarter sales next year would rise less than 5 percent. Its stock dropped $2, or 7.7 percent, to $23.94.
The continued decline in stocks is going to heighten the focus on Federal Reserve policy makers, who will meet on Dec. 19 to consider the direction of interest rates. At their November meeting, they indicated that no rate cut was in the offing soon. A repeat of such a hard line at the December meeting would probably heighten fears of a recession and send stocks lower.
One recent signal of investor concern comes in the flows of money in and out of domestic stock mutual funds. According to AMG Data Services, which tracks these flows, investors took $7.3 billion out of stock mutual funds investing in domestic and foreign stocks in the four weeks ended Wednesday. But in just the last week, there was a net inflow of $1.5 billion, showing that some investors were seeking to take advantage of bargains.
Abby Joseph Cohen, the market strategist at Goldman, Sachs who has become identified with the bull market of the 1990's, released an optimistic comment before the stock market opened.
"Indications that cash is building in portfolios, and that valuations are the most appealing they have been all year, support the forecast of rising stock prices," she said in a note to clients.
And while agreeing that the announcements from technology companies have been especially negative recently, she said that Goldman analysts were not as worried. "They do not see evidence of particularly weak conditions," she wrote. "Indeed, demand appears to be solid in several categories, including enterprise hardware and software, and across several markets, including those in Europe and Asia."
At the end of the day, the Nasdaq was down 109.00 points, to 2,597.93. The S.& P. 500 fell 26.96 points, to 1,314.95. The Dow dropped 214.62 points, to 10,414.49. Trading volume was near a record level on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1.498 billion shares trading hands. The record of 1.512 billion was set on April 4.
For the year, the Dow is down 9.4 percent, which, if the year were over, would be its worst year since 1977, when it fell 17.3 percent. (It dropped 9.2 percent in 1981.) The S.& P. 500 is off 10.5 percent for the year, also possibly its worst performance since 1977, when it dropped 11.5 percent. The Nasdaq, which is down 32.6 percent for this year, is heading for its worst year ever. It plunged 35.1 percent in 1974.
The sell-off in stocks sent many investors to the bond market for safety, pushing interest rates to their lowest levels since the spring of 1999.
In the Treasury market, the yield on the 10-year note fell to 5.47 percent, from 5.52 percent on Wednesday, as the price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 12/32, to 102 3/32. The yield on the 30-year bond dropped to 5.61 percent, from 5.64 percent.

CHRYSLER EXPECTED TO CLOSE MORE PLANTS TEMPORARILY

BYLINE: By Keith Bradsher 

 BODY:
The Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler A.G. is expected to announce this morning the temporary closing of a series of factories, some for more than a week. As the economy slows, Chrysler has huge inventories of unsold Jeeps and minivans, and the unit's new German management has been reluctant to continue offering costly rebates to increase sales and keep factories operating. DaimlerChrysler plants in Detroit; Brampton, Ontario; and Toledo, Ohio, are already closed this week, affecting about 13,600 workers. Keith Bradsher

LENDING PROGRAM EXPANDS

BYLINE: By Joseph P. Fried 

 BODY:
Four community development credit unions have joined three commercial banks as lenders in the New York City Capital Access Program, which provides loans and credit lines of $1,500 to $1 million to small businesses that may not meet the criteria for conventional bank loans. The seven-year-old program has granted more than 350 loans totaling more than $18 million to companies with about 4,000 employees, according to the city's Economic Development Corporation, the program's sponsor. The credit unions -- Bethex in the Bronx and Homesteaders, Lower East Side People's and Union Settlement in Manhattan -- join the three banks in the program: Chase Manhattan, EAB and Sterling National.

HEADLINE: Council Readies Unique Sex Bias Measure

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
New York City would become the first jurisdiction in the country to grant victims of rape, domestic violence and other crimes "motivated by gender" a broad civil right to sue their attackers under a bill unanimously passed by a City Council committee yesterday.
The measure, which Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is expected to sign into law, seizes the opportunity left open six months ago when the United States Supreme Court struck down a similar provision in a 1994 federal law known as the Violence Against Women Act, ruling 5 to 4 that the general power to regulate crime resides with states and localities, not with Congress. The bill was co-sponsored by at least 33 Council members, giving it more than enough votes to pass when the full Council considers the measure on Tuesday. 
 The local measure goes further than current state laws by allowing victims of such violence up to seven years to bring suit, rather than one to two years, and permitting them to seek lawyers' fees and punitive damages as well as compensation.
"Examples of the way gender bias infuses crimes such as domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking abound," Julie Goldscheid, acting legal director of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, told members of the Council's General Welfare Committee, which passed the bill onto the full Council. "Who can forget the horrific images of women being assaulted by gangs of cheering men displayed continuously on the news after the Puerto Rican Day parade in this city?"
Privately, some Republican Council members were critical of the proposed law, because they see it as treating some victims of crime better than others, or as benefiting lawyers more than victims. "But nobody wants to be caught voting against this one," a Republican Council member said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "It'll come back to haunt you that you opposed a law protecting women from crime."
The text of the proposed law states that Congress and the United States Department of Justice concluded after many hearings and studies that "victims of gender-motivated violence frequently face a climate of condescension, indifference and hostility in the court system." By establishing a private, civil right of action, the law tries to provide "an officially sanctioned and legitimate cause of action for seeking redress for injuries resulting from gender-motivated violence," regardless of sex or sexual orientation, the text says.
Unlike overall crime in the city, domestic-violence incidents have not dropped. According to the Mayor's Management Report, the Police Department made 23,935 family-related arrests in the fiscal year that ended in June and 4,012 arrests for violations of orders of protection. Domestic-incident reports totaled 252,902. In 1999, the police reported 87 homicides related to domestic violence.
Advocates of the proposed law said that while state law already allowed battered women, like any other injured party, to sue for damages, the courts had often not been sympathetic in domestic-violence cases, and that a long history of bias against women in case law and a one-year statute of limitations on civil suits involving assault made it exceedingly difficult to pursue relief that way.
Dorchen A. Leidholt, director of the Sanctuary for Families Center for Battered Women, said that domestic-violence felonies were typically reduced to misdemeanors, and misdemeanors to violations, and that though restitution was always a sentencing option, it was rarely used. In divorces, judges are often hostile to women who seek economic redress for injuries from abusive husbands, she said.
Ms. Leidholt cited the case of "the unfortunate Elmhurst woman who in 1998 was fined $5,000 by an irate Supreme Court justice for filing a personal injury suit against her husband for beating her with a broom" when she was unable to prove conclusively that the beating was the cause of her herniated disk.
Under the proposed law, plaintiffs must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the acts involved were not random acts of violence but were motivated by gender. In about 60 cases handled by federal courts around the country before the Supreme Court ruling, that burden was typically met through what one federal judge listed as "gender-specific epithets; acts that perpetuated stereotypes of women's submissive role; attacks during pregnancy and at times when plaintiff asserted her independence."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Lower-Rate Mortgage Is Returning to the Market

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
A mortgage type that offers borrowers lower rates in return for sharing any profits with the lender on the eventual sale of the home is reappearing around the country.
The loan type has been all but unavailable for 20 years except in scattered areas, but now it is being offered nationwide at interest rates one to two percentage points below prevailing market rates. 
 The saving on a $260,000 fixed-rate 30-year mortgage at 7 percent, for example, compared with a 30-year traditional $260,000 fixed-rate 30-year loan at 8.5 percent, would amount to $269.39 a month.
In return for the lower rates, borrowers are required to pay the lender 30 to 60 percent of the home's future appreciation. If the property does not appreciate during the 15- or 30-year term of the loan, borrowers need repay only the balance of the loan, plus interest.
Known by the acronym SAM, for "shared appreciation mortgage," the loan can also be used to refinance borrowers' current homes or to move up to a more expensive home. It can be used by purchasers of houses or condominiums, but not co-ops.
The last time such loans were available, they were offered mostly by local lenders and so there was a patchwork of terms and interest rates, but this time around they are available at uniform rates nationwide through about 1,500 banks, mortgage companies and other financial institutions.
Moreover, the loans are backed by the combined strength of several big financial institutions. These include Bear, Stearns & Company and National Commerce Bank Services, the retail consulting affiliate of the National Commerce Bancorporation of Memphis.
Applicants with good credit ratings can borrow as much as $650,000, with the interest rate on the loan depending on the percentage of the future appreciation that the borrower agrees to pay the lender. The higher that percentage, the lower the interest rate is likely to be.
As for how the $650,000 loan limit was determined, the president of the correspondent lending group at National Commerce Bank Services, Scott Stafford, said: "We wanted to be in the jumbo market, and we thought that was the limit before we would get to super jumbo. If the limit were $250,000, imagine how hard it would be to find a home at that price in New York or San Francisco."
Neil Bader, chief executive of ISI Skyscraper, a mortgage company based in New York, said, "To the extent you have less than 15 percent appreciation over five years, which many neighborhoods do once you're out of Manhattan, it's a great deal."
Of course, the trouble with such loans is that the borrower could end up surrendering a substantial part of any profit if the home appreciates markedly, as has been the case with many New York properties in recent years.
ISI Skyscraper expects to begin offering the shared appreciation loan next week in the New York area, Mr. Bader said, while the president of Madison Home Equities in Carle Place, N.Y., Nadine Maloney, said her firm was offering them now. Allied Mortgage Capital Corporation, based in Houston, expects to begin offering the loan next week at its 570 branches. (It has no branches in New York but does in every other state, including New Jersey and Connecticut. Allied's president and founder, Jim Hodge, said its application for a license to do business in New York was pending.)
National Commerce will buy the loans from the individual lenders and sell them to Bear Stearns. In turn, Bear Stearns will create bonds to sell to such institutional investors as insurance companies and pension funds.
The weakness of the earlier shared appreciation mortgages, according to Mr. Stafford, was that "there was no investment bank behind the mortgage program."
But with an investment bank behind them in Britain, shared appreciation loans succeeded handsomely in England, Scotland and Wales, according to Sam Masucci, who managed global residential property markets for Warburg Dillon Read, an investment banking division of UBS, the large Swiss investment bank. Warburg Dillon bought the SAM loans from the Bank of Scotland and created the bonds for investors.
"The SAM's were so successful," said Mr. Masucci, now the managing director of Bear Stearns's mortgage group, "that they accounted for one of every three of the Bank of Scotland's first mortgage loans."
As do other types of loans, SAM's come with conditions.
For example, borrowers must occupy their home as their primary residence within 60 days after receiving the loan, and must continue to do so throughout the term of the loan. They can move out for up to 12 months, but if they sell or rent their property they will have to pay the outstanding loan balance immediately, as well as the interest from the shared appreciation, if any.
Borrowers need not share the increased value of their home for any improvements that cost over $10,000 (or 6 percent of the value of the home before the improvement, whichever is greater) as determined by appraisals made before and after the improvements are made. But fences, pools and sheds, whatever their cost, are not considered qualified home improvements.

To the Editor:
The establishment of the New York City Board of Education's office for corporate partnerships is an important development for the future of our city (Education page, Nov. 29). 
 What the business community can offer students is real-world access, where the important theories and other lessons learned in the classroom can be brought to life. Seven years ago, our company formed a partnership with Morris High School in the Bronx. Early familiarity with the culture and expectations of the workplace is an advantage for students and should be widely available.
Simply stated, workplace-preparedness programs in the schools are essential for continued economic growth.

HEADLINE: William B. Furlong, Sports Columnist And Author, 73

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY 

 BODY:
William Barry Furlong, a widely read sports columnist, magazine writer and author, died last Saturday in Silver Spring, Md. He was 73.
The cause was complications from leukemia, his family said. 
 Mr. Furlong wrote for The Chicago Daily News and The New York Times Magazine, and from 1974 to 1979 he was a sports columnist for The Washington Post. He also contributed to Sports Illustrated, Newsweek and The Saturday Evening Post. After leaving newspaper work, he was a management consultant in Washington, often writing on economic affairs.
He wrote three books: "Go for Broke," with the golfer Arnold Palmer; "Season With Solti," a year with the Chicago Symphony and its conductor, Sir Georg Solti; and "More Than Two Aspirin," about the causes and treatments for migraine headaches.
As a high school senior, he started writing professionally, first for The Southtown Economist in Chicago. He received a bachelor's degree in aeronautical engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology.
Mr. Furlong, who lived in Washington, is survived by his wife of 37 years, Isabel; a son, William B. Furlong Jr. of Seattle; and a sister, Elizabeth J. Furlong of Chicago.
He was known for intriguing first paragraphs of articles.
*On the young Jack Nicklaus: "Of all the rich, old malevolent illusions assaulted by Jack Nicklaus in his first 20 months as a professional golfer, the one that old-timers on the circuit were most disturbed to see shattered -- or at least cracked -- was the notion that golf is an impossibly difficult game to master."
*On Gordie Howe: "Nowhere are the dark forces that impel a man toward athletic self-destruction more clearly definable than in a hockey player -- indeed, the hockey player -- named Gordon Howe."
*On Smoky Burgess, one of baseball's best pinch-hitters: "Forrest Harrill (Smoky) Burgess is a short, round, mildly ulcerous man whose job in baseball is to demonstrate that they also serve who mostly sit and wait."
 *On Al Lopez: "The mystique of the positive-thinking Al Lopez, who manages the Chicago White Sox, an occasional baseball team that has astonished the sports world, is a rich enigma based largely, he claims, on a policy of doing nothing and doing it well."

Taking Stock: More Lawyers and Engineers, Fewer Inventors

 BODY:
In 1869, before James A. Garfield took over the presidency, he observed that "the developments of statistics are causing history to be rewritten." Garfield's prescient statement is quoted in a new book, "The First Measured Century: An Illustrated Guide to Trends in America, 1900-2000," by Theodore Caplow, Louis Hicks, and Ben J. Wattenberg (A.E.I. Press). As the authors note, Americans "pioneered the measurement of facets of American life that had never been systematically counted before such as crime, love, food, fun, religion and work. . . . The numbers that fill the news -- the Gross National Product, the Consumer Price Index, the unemployment rate, the teenage pregnancy rate, the poverty rate and so forth were inventions of the American 20th century."
The collection of charts and thumbnail essays, which is the companion volume to a PBS documentary to be broadcast on Dec. 20, are based on census data, government statistics and surveys by the National Opinion Research Center, among other sources. Together, they offer snapshots of social change in the United States. 
 Below are some excerpts.
Patents allow their owners to prohibit others from making, using or selling the invention for a period of 20 years from the date of application for the patent. About 95 percent of all patents are issued for inventions, as distinct from the small number of patents issued for designs and botanical plants. Prior to 1986, the charts show only patents for inventions; starting in 1986 patents of all types are included.
The lone inventor whose Yankee ingenuity enables him to build and patent a better mousetrap is a stock American hero. In 1901 four out of five United States patents were issued to individuals. In 1999 more than four out of five were issued to corporations. Some of this change occurred as individuals incorporated their business, but the trend toward larger-scale organization of technological innovation is clear. As the patent archives grew, the process of searching and validating a patent claim became the domain of experts whose services could be formidably expensive.
Furthermore, nearly all corporate organizations, including universities and research centers, reserve the right to patent any invention made by an employee, often, but not always, with some financial reward for the inventor.
In the first half of the century, large year-to-year fluctuations in the real G.D.P. the chart at top of the next column indicated severe swings in the business cycle between expansion and contraction of the economy.
In the second half of the century, as the chart shows, these fluctuations became much more moderate, while the economy continued to expand.
The moderation of the business cycle after midcentury has often been attributed to improved monetary policy and the effects of government programs. Better monetary policy prevented rapid, "unsustainable" expansion of the economy and also arrested contrations of the economy.
Some government spending programs, such as unemployment insurance and farm subsidies, were deliberately designed to counterbalance economic swings.
Federal insurance of bank deposits prevented economic contrations from causing liquidity rises. Government spending, which tends to be independent of the business cycle, represented a larger part of the economy in the second half of the century.
Government transfer programs such as Social Security were also insulated from the business cycle.
 The supply of engineers per thousand population the chart at top of the next column increased in every decade, driven by technological progress and increasingly complex production processes. Most engineers were middle-level employees of large enterprises. At the end of the century, a bachelor's degree was still sufficient for licensing in many engineering specialties.
The relative supply of lawyers was more responsive to trends in social policy than to technological progress. Because requirements for entry were raised during the first half of the century and the size of law schools was effectively restricted, the ratio of lawyers to population was slightly lower in 1970 than 1900. The number of lawyers per thousand population nearly tripled between 1970 and 1998, largely in response to the widening role of governments and a boom in litigation.
The relative supply of physicians declined early in the century, primarily as a consequence of the 1910 Flexner Report, which brought reform to the standards and curricula of United States medical schools and closed marginal schools. The restriction of supply in the face of increasing demand gave physicians the highest average incomes of any occupational group.
Such restrictive policies were largely abandoned after 1970 in response to public pressure, as well as massive new funding from Medicare and Medicaid.

HEADLINE: Automakers Are Facing a Sales Slowdown

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Through most of the 1990's, automakers avoided building new assembly plants, convinced that the good times would not last. They have finally committed themselves in the last two years to a string of new factories, only to find their timing is as poor as ever: sales have begun to slow, particularly for Detroit's manufacturers.
The combined sales of Detroit-based automakers fell 3.5 percent last month, compared with November of last year. While sales are still at a level that would have been considered very strong until the last two years, they have now lagged last year's pace in six of the last seven months -- and much more production capacity is becoming available. 
 General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler have already responded by eliminating overtime and briefly closing a few factories; Ford and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler both announced further temporary closings today. Ford also said its per-share earnings in the fourth quarter would fall 10 cents short of analysts' consensus forecast of 85 cents.
Asian and European automakers are also starting to encounter trouble, with their sales barely rising this autumn, including last month; earlier in the year, their monthly sales were leaping by 20 and 25 percent compared with the corresponding months a year earlier. Foreign automakers have benefited from their recent entry into the markets for large minivans and pickup trucks, with vehicles like the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Tundra.
Honda's 3.5 percent increase in sales last month "was more an indication of strong demand for some hot products that we're fortunate to have than the overall strength of the market," said Dick Colliver, the executive vice president of Honda's North American operations. "The overall market has slipped into neutral and there is not a lot of forward motion right now."
The slowdown, however, has done nothing so far to stop the binge of auto factory construction. Toyota opened a factory in Princeton, Ind., last year and DaimlerChrysler is about to open one in Toledo, Ohio. Honda and Mercedes recently announced the construction of new factories in Alabama while Nissan said last month that it would erect an assembly plant in Mississippi. All of these factories will build sport utility vehicles, pickups or minivans, which will probably result in surplus production in market segments that had been the industry's most profitable.
Diane C. Swonk, the chief economist and senior vice president at the Bank One Corporation in Chicago, predicted that the slowing would result in the closing of older factories. The blow to the Midwest will be cushioned because tens of thousands of unionized auto workers are now retiring each year, making layoffs unlikely.
Sales next year, though weaker than in the last two years, are still likely to be strong by historical standards, she added. "We're slowing down to sales nobody thought were attainable a few years ago," Ms. Swonk said.
Auto executives and dealers attribute the slowdown to the fairly high interest rates and the steep descent of the Nasdaq composite index. "The stock market has got people worried," said Alan Helfman, a Chrysler and Jeep dealer in Houston.
Sales weakened last month for cars, minivans and pickups, while growth in sport utility sales slowed despite an abundance of new, car-based models. G.M.'s sales fell 8.4 percent last month compared with the period a year earlier. Ford's sales dropped 7.9 percent excluding Land Rover, the luxury sport utility vehicle maker that it acquired last summer, while Chrysler's sales dipped 5.5 percent.
Honda's sales climbed 3.5 percent last month, and Nissan's rose 4.3 percent. Toyota's gained 4.6 percent.
The seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales was 16.6 million vehicles last month, much slower than the average pace of 17.6 million so far this year. But until sales reached the 17 million range last year and this year, most auto executives thought that annual sales of 15 million represented a good year.
Economists are watching the faltering pace of auto production because the industry still plays an enormous role in the American economy, and any slowdown could cause ripples across the nation if auto workers cut back on spending.
The auto sector makes up 4 percent of the nation's economic output, and the Federal Reserve estimated a few years ago that the industry accounted for a quarter of the total economic output of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana. G.M., Ford and DaimlerChrysler each have at least eight times the annual sales of the Microsoft Corporation.
Chrysler today said that among its 12 assembly plants in the United States and Canada, 2 would not operate next week, one would not operate the following week and 5 would not operate during the week before Christmas.
Sales last month weakened the most for cars and minivans, and lagged somewhat for pickup trucks as well. Sales were stronger for sport utility vehicles, especially for the new breed of so-called crossover utility vehicles like the Ford Escape and Chrysler PT Cruiser. These are built like cars but have features that led regulators to classify them as sport utility vehicles, so they qualify for more lenient fuel-economy and safety regulations than cars do.
Luxury cars and luxury sport utility vehicles, like Jaguars and Land Rovers, also did well, as well-heeled buyers continued to throng showrooms even as middle-income buyers became more scarce. "When sales moderate, the premium brand sales hold up somewhat better," said George Pipas, a Ford market analyst.
Automakers tried earlier this autumn to maintain high levels of sales by offering extremely deep discounts. These discounts have proved inadequate to offset the effects of a falling stock market and less-vibrant growth in the overall economy. Automakers are now reducing production, possibly enough to avoid even deeper incentives later this winter.
A big problem with incentives is that they often cause loyal consumers to buy sooner than they otherwise might, so that sales in future months are penalized. Paul Ballew, G.M.'s general director of industry and market analysis, acknowledged this today in saying that G.M.'s sales lagged in November partly because the company had offered so many large rebates and zero-interest loans a month earlier.
"We did have some payback from the strength of some of our marketing initiatives in the month of October," Mr. Ballew said.

Failed Rally Ends a Week Of Stock Pain

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
A failed rally yesterday ended another grim week for investors, as worries about slowing economic growth and the unresolved presidential election continued to plague Wall Street.
After rising more than 1 percent in morning trading, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 10,373.54, a drop of 40.95 points, or 0.4 percent. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index, which has recently been pummeled, also could not hold its gains. After rising almost 6 percent by early afternoon, the Nasdaq closed at 2,645.29, a gain of 47.36 points, or 1.8 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was flat, rising 0.28 point, to 1,315.23. 
 Despite its gains yesterday, the Nasdaq closed the week down 9 percent. The Nasdaq has now fallen in 10 of the last 12 weeks, giving up 38 percent of its value since Sept. 1. For the year, the Nasdaq is off 35 percent, putting it on track for its worst performance since the bear market of 1974.
The Nasdaq's collapse has left investors and strategists sharply divided. Bulls note that the last major pullback in technology stocks, which came in the fall of 1998 on worries of a slowdown in worldwide economic growth and a credit crisis, proved to be a great opportunity for aggressive investors. Wall Street's fears turned out to be misplaced, and the Nasdaq more than tripled between October 1998 and March of this year. Even at its current levels, the Nasdaq has almost doubled from those 1998 lows.
Now, Wall Street is once again panicking needlessly, said Stephen Slifer, chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers. Mr. Slifer said he expected the economy to grow about 3.5 percent next year and inflation to remain low at 2.5 percent. Given that outlook, corporate profits should continue to grow solidly next year, he said.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond, meanwhile, has fallen to 5.51 percent, its lowest level since April. Lower interest rates are another positive for stocks, because they make bonds less attractive as an alternative investment.
"I think this is a pretty good time to be buying stocks, quite frankly," Mr. Slifer said.
But Mr. Slifer is in the minority these days. Many strategists and investors are concerned that the United States economy is headed for much slower growth, or even a recession. General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler reported sharply lower sales for November yesterday, and the National Association of Purchasing Management's factory index fell to its lowest level since December 1998.
"There will probably be a recession next year," said Ralph Wanger, chief investment officer for the $8 billion Acorn mutual fund. "The economic indicators are rolling over, it looks like."
The slowdown has already affected some economically sensitive industries, from machine tool manufacturers, which are hurt if companies cut capital spending, to casinos, which suffer as consumers cut their disposable spending, Mr. Wanger said.
Richard Bernstein, director of quantitative research for Merrill Lynch, said the slowdown in corporate profit growth was unlikely to reverse quickly. "Since 1970, the shortest period of profit deceleration was six quarters; so far we've had two," he said.
Mr. Bernstein also warned investors against expecting the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates quickly to help stocks. Although profit growth is slowing, the economy continues to grow, and oil prices remain above $30 a barrel, so the Fed will be reluctant to lower rates, he said. In addition, many stocks remain expensive by historical standards despite their declines this year. "Our feeling is the Fed is going to be very, very reluctant to play the role of the cavalry," Mr. Bernstein said.
Technology stocks will be especially vulnerable if the economy slows, Mr. Bernstein said, because venture capitalists and public investors have created too many companies over the last several years, and the sector is ripe for a shake-out.
"Everybody who had an idea got funded, and a lot of these companies should not be companies," he said. "Our fear for 2001 is that there is tremendous overcapacity in the technology sector."

HEADLINE: An Economy in Transition

 BODY:
The party may be over. It is not yet clear whether the present economic slowdown will ultimately lead to a recession or is simply the "soft landing" Alan Greenspan has been plotting so carefully. But either way, it spells the end of the economic nirvana of recent years -- that potent concoction of extremely robust growth, accelerating productivity gains, low inflation and low unemployment. The universal sense of awe at the magical "new economy" is giving way to a sense of unease.
One of Mr. Greenspan's predecessors famously said that the role of the Federal Reserve chairman is to remove the punch bowl when the party gets going. That is precisely what the Fed has done by raising interest rates six times in the past 18 months. Now Mr. Greenspan, the fabled helmsman of the economy viewed by many Americans as the one indispensable public servant in Washington, is being pressed to reverse course and stop fretting about inflation. 
 Evidence of a slowdown keeps mounting, and Mr. Greenspan will have to weigh it all against the persistence of low unemployment and high energy costs, traditional inflationary signals. The economy grew at a 2.4 percent annual rate in the third quarter, compared with 5.6 percent in the second quarter. Corporations are finding it harder to increase their profits or borrow money and are consequently spending less. Consumer confidence, that mushy measure of the nation's psyche, is falling. Retailers, expecting a modest Christmas, are offering unusually hefty discounts at the outset of the holiday shopping season.
Santa's sense of disquiet may become a political liability for the next president. Bill Clinton owed much of his second-term political buoyancy to the same economic euphoria that turned Americans, at least in Mr. Greenspan's view, into a nation of irrationally exuberant investors. Millions piled into the stock market to profit from the tech-driven revolution, and at times seemed to turn the hope that the new economy had transcended the restraints of the business cycle into a self-fulfilling prophesy. But that euphoria has chilled greatly.
Alan Greenspan may yet pull off a "soft landing" for the economy, as he did in the mid-1990's, ensuring continued though less robust growth. But things have been hard for stock market investors, particularly those who had grown accustomed to the idea that it pays to speculate. After surging 40 percent in 1998 and 86 percent in 1999, the seemingly unstoppable Nasdaq composite index, dominated by tech issues, is down 35 percent for the year and almost 50 percent from its March highs. Day traders have been forced to get day jobs.
Economists have long debated the extent to which wild swings in the stock market affect the real economy. When markets soared, Mr. Greenspan worried that consumers feeling inordinately wealthy because of their paper gains in the market would overheat the economy. Now the opposite question becomes an issue. Even long-term investors are likely to react to plummeting stock prices. Seeing your 401(k) fund shrink has a way of dampening your appetite for luxury items and lavish gifts.

A Lesser-Known Successor Is Making His Voice Heard

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THREE months ago, South Africa's Anglican bishops decided that they should take the blood test for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and that they should be public about it. Among the first to go was the church's head, Archbishop Njongonkulu Ndungane of Cape Town, who had his blood drawn before a crowd of journalists.
The publicity, of course, was the church's way of encouraging others to be tested in a nation where more people may be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus than anywhere else in the world. "The whole purpose was to break the silence," the archbishop said in an interview, "and take away the stigma by having bishops and archbishops going to tests on AIDS." 
 Archbishop Ndungane, 59, came to Washington to speak at a White House conference this week on what religious groups, especially in developing nations, can do to fight AIDS. A well-traveled prelate educated in South Africa and England, he is a man of many distinctions. Head of the Anglican Church Province of South Africa (one of the Episcopal Church's sister communions), he has been prominent among religious leaders in calling for cancellation of the foreign debts of impoverished nations.
As a young man, he served time on Robben Island, the notorious prison run by South Africa's former white minority government, which enforced a system of apartheid, strict racial separation. (For years, its most famous inmate was Nelson Mandela, later released and elected South Africa's first black president, after apartheid's end.)
Yet it is fair to say that Archbishop Ndungane is not as well known, certainly outside his country, as his predecessor, Desmond Tutu, a fierce critic of apartheid who won the Nobel Peace Prize.
Such outspoken stands as Archbishop Tutu and some other religious leaders took during the apartheid era left the Anglican Church and other churches with much moral capital on which to draw. "There's a high regard for the church, because of the role it has taken in justice issues," said Archbishop Ndungane (pronounced en-dun-GON-ay). "We are still looked on as the voice of moral conscience."
What religious leaders say about AIDS is important in South Africa today, because the government has sent mixed signals to citizens about the disease's cause. Earlier this year, Mr. Mandela's successor, President Thabo Mbeki, drew widespread criticism when he expressed interest in a theory that poverty and malnutrition caused AIDS, rather than H.I.V. Health care workers expressed fear that his comments had harmed efforts to discourage people from risky sexual behavior.
ARCHBISHOP NDUNGANE said he believed that Mr. Mbeki had moved away from the position. The archbishop said his own concern was that the government and the churches join forces in fighting the disease.
As he spoke, he pointed to a newspaper article, faxed to him at his hotel, about the crushing impact AIDS was likely to have on South Africa's population and economy. From his advocacy on the foreign debt issue, the archbishop is well-versed in issues of economic development and international lending.
In a speech last year, he warned that the foreign debts of African nations were forcing them to pay more in interest than they received in aid. "Contrary to general assumptions, therefore, the rich are not paying the poor," he said then. "The poor end up paying the rich."
When he was young, Archbishop Ndungane contemplated a lucrative career in commercial law. But as with many other South Africans, the anti-apartheid struggle changed his life.
In 1960, he took part in protests organized by the Pan Africanist Congress against the pass laws, the rule that black citizens carry passports inside the country. After the Congress was outlawed, he was arrested for belonging to a "banned" organization.
Sent to Robben Island a few years before Mr. Mandela, he spent 18 months quarrying stone and mixing cement with other inmates to build the prison. "My claim to fame is I built the jail for Mandela," he said.
"Robben Island in those days was hell on earth," he said. "We were made to suffer there. We were forced to feel a need to abandon ideology and hope. The fact that I am here is testimony to the resiliency of the human spirit."
He also underwent a conversion experience, brought on by wrestling with an old question: How could a good God permit such suffering? Amid the turmoil, he experienced an inner peace. "It was at that moment that I felt touched by the hand of God," Archbishop Ndungane said. He committed himself to a ministry of reconciliation.
He has served as a parish priest, head of a seminary, the church's chief executive officer and as a bishop. A widower, he remarried, to a businesswoman who was herself a widow.
In 1996, he was elected Cape Town's archbishop, in a process that required a two-thirds vote by clergy and lay representatives, then confirmation by the church's bishops. He regards Archbishop Tutu as a friend and father figure. "I used to say, 'I pity the person who succeeds Desmond Tutu,' " Archbishop Ndungane said. "Little did I know that the good Lord would point at me."
The archbishop said he did not worry about people drawing comparisons. "It never concerns me," he said. "My philosophy is, it's God who calls and God who equips. It is God who gives us gifts which he wants us to use at a particular time."

HEADLINE: Verizon New Jersey Withdraws Request for Basic Rate Increase

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Citing overwhelming public opposition and pending state hearings, Verizon New Jersey withdrew a proposal to double its basic telephone rates yesterday. But in Connecticut, Southern New England Telecommunications told state regulators that it needed an unspecified increase on local phone rates.
The president of Verizon New Jersey, Dennis Bone, said the company had withdrawn its rate request for business reasons, not legal ones. 
 The proposal "has been controversial to say the least," Mr. Bone said. He said the company planned to submit a simpler proposal to the Board of Public Utilities after Jan. 1.
Anthony Wright, program director of New Jersey Citizen Action, which organized opposition to the proposal, said he was appalled at Mr. Bone's characterization of the decision.
"It had nothing to do with soul searching, and everything to do with avoiding the B.P.U. outright rejecting their plan," he said. "It was shocking that he thought the problem with the proposal was about public relations, rather than about substance."
Verizon, which provides about 98 percent of the local telephone service in New Jersey, had also asked the B.P.U. to declare the state a competitive market so it could charge deregulated rates. The company recommended raising the state's basic telephone rate of $8.19 a month to a choice of plans priced at $15, $16 or $17.50 a month. Each package automatically included premium services for customers, like caller ID and call waiting, but did not give customers the option of refusing the services.
Meanwhile, Southern New England Telephone, a subsidiary of SBC Communications Inc., said higher prices were essential to spur competition in the market for residential telephone services. S.N.E.T. serves more than 90 percent of the estimated 1.4 million residential phone lines in Connecticut.
S.N.E.T. has not said what kind of price increases it would seek, but is asking permission for annual increases at or below inflation rates.

HEADLINE: Recount Seals Senate Race In Washington For Democrat

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: OLYMPIA, Wash., Dec. 1

 BODY:
Maria Cantwell, who made a fortune with a high-tech company and financed her own United States Senate campaign, narrowly defeated Senator Slade Gorton, the state's Republican incumbent, results of a recount confirmed today.
Her victory creates the possibility of a 50-50 tie in the new Senate. 
 Ms. Cantwell, a former one-term member of United States House in her first statewide campaign, defeated Mr. Gorton by 2,229 votes out of nearly 2.5 million cast. The last of Washington's 39 counties reported recount results today. The unofficial count, reported last week, had given her a margin of 1,953 votes.
"I am honored to have won such a close election," Ms. Cantwell said in a victory speech tonight, minutes after Mr. Gorton sent her a handwritten concession letter. The senator's campaign said he would not seek further recounts.
"It's over," said Cynthia Bergman, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gorton.
The recount resolved the election's last unsettled Senate race.
Mr. Gorton, who has been mentioned for a cabinet position if Gov. George W. Bush wins the presidency, has no immediate plans other than attending a lame-duck session of Congress next week, Ms. Bergman said.
King County, which is heavily Democratic and includes Seattle, won the race for Ms. Cantwell. She had a margin of more than 150,000 votes there. The county was the last to report results of the automatic recount, which state law required because of the close race.
Ms. Cantwell carried only five counties, but Mr. Gorton's big lead in the less populous areas could not overcome her advantage in Seattle.
The victory of Ms. Cantwell, 42, could divide the Senate's 100 seats evenly between Democrats and Republicans if Mr. Bush wins the White House. But Republicans would maintain nominal control of the Senate because Dick Cheney, as a Republican vice president, would cast any vote needed to break a tie.
If Vice President Al Gore were to become president, Connecticut's Republican governor, John G. Rowland, would probably appoint a Republican to the seat vacated by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Mr. Gore's running mate, putting the Republicans back into a 51-49 advantage.
Washington, for the first time, joins California and Maine in having two women in the Senate. Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat, is in her second term.
Mr. Gorton had won six statewide races, three terms as attorney general and three as senator. His only previous loss was his first Senate re-election bid, to Brock Adams, a Democrat, in 1986. He came back with a victory two years later and was re-elected easily in 1994.
But Mr. Gorton failed to persuade voters that his clout was too important to give up. The same state dumped a sitting speaker of the House, Tom Foley, in 1994.
During the campaign, Ms. Cantwell called Mr. Gorton a man who offered "19th-century solutions to 21st-century problems." She ran as someone who understood the high-tech industry and the new economy from the inside out.
She also benefited from Mr. Gorton's long list of enemies, including American Indian tribes, environmentalists, trial lawyers and abortion-rights activists, all of whom campaigned against him.

HEADLINE: Columbia Revels in Success Of Fund-Raising Campaign

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Nearing the end of a decadelong fund-raising campaign, Columbia University announced yesterday that it had raised $2.74 billion -- more than double the initial goal in 1990.
The sum is one of the largest ever raised by a university. Last year, Harvard announced that it had raised a record $2.6 billion in a five-and-a-half-year campaign. 
 "We are closing off a very important chapter in Columbia's history," said Columbia's president, George Rupp, yesterday, calling the campaign not only an important tool in competing for top students and teachers, but a symbol of the university's "forward momentum" as well.
Columbia's campaign is also one of the longest by a higher education institution. Started in 1990, when Michael I. Sovern was president, it spanned the tenures of two presidents, two development officers and two alumni chairmen.
The original intention was to raise $1.15 billion over five years, but the campaign, aided by a strong economy and booming financial markets, went so well that the university decided to extend it for five years and to double the goal.
Of the money raised so far, about $800 million has gone into Columbia's endowment, with $250 million dedicated to financial aid, $275 million to new endowed professorships, and $275 million to research and other programs.
Columbia has also used $370 million for new buildings including a student center, a dormitory and a business and law building -- and for the refurbishment of others, including the library.
The campaign has helped Columbia ratchet up its annual fund-raising to more than $300 million a year, which the university says has moved it to about 5th place from 11th among universities.
Columbia has received about 300,000 donations, some from repeat contributors. But the bulk of the money came from fewer than 400 gifts of $1 million or more, which accounted for $1.6 billion, or about two-thirds of the total.
There were two gifts of more than $50 million: $85 million in two parts from the businessman and philanthropist John W. Kluge ($60 million for minority scholarships and $25 million to subsidize junior faculty salaries) and $50 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the School of Public Health.
Six of the gifts were between $25 million and $50 million, and 29 gifts between $10 million and $25 million.
"It's a fairly typical pyramid for a large, private research university," said Richard K. Naum, Columbia's vice president for development and alumni relations.
The numbers announced yesterday represent totals collected through Sept. 30, although the "Campaign for Columbia," as it is called, does not officially end until Dec. 31.
"We're not out of the ballgame yet," Mr. Naum said.
Since Sept. 30, the university has received a pledge of $10 million for graduate fellowships and a $12 million pledge for the law school, which did not appear in the tabulated figures.
The university has already collected most of the $2.7 billion, but about $350 million of the total includes pledges for gifts that will come in over the next five years.
Stephen Friedman, the chairman of Columbia's board and a graduate of its law school, said that the campaign had been helped by the strong economy and financial markets and also by New York City's new vitality.
Dr. Rupp said he had no plans to extend the campaign, but added: "I actually find asking for gifts enjoyable. People with substantial assets are, for the most part, very interesting people. It is not painful to spend time with them."
Mr. Friedman, Columbia's chairman, noted that Columbia could use more fund-raising, because its endowment per student is still below that of Harvard, Princeton, Yale and Stanford.
"We would like to narrow the gap," he said. "We were under no illusion that you can eliminate it overnight. But as long as you have substantial opportunities, there are people out there who will get caught up in a fund-raising campaign and enthused about it and excited. The money-raising clock never stops."
And, he added, "The needs never end."

HEADLINE: A Sampling Of Works In Progress;
Silver and World Trade

BYLINE: By JOYCE JENSEN 

 BODY:
From the most raked-over history to the latest technology, scholars continually manage to ask new questions, rethink old verities and produce fresh insights. Arts & Ideas takes an occasional look at what some of today's thinkers -- the established as well as those who yearn to be -- are working on. Some ideas may turn into breakthroughs and others may turn out to be dead ends, but the journey is rarely boring. Here are three works in progress.
 Silver has been a source of wealth and power ever since the Sumerians in the Tigris and Euphrates valley mined it for themselves 5,000 years ago. But for Dennis O. Flynn and Arturo Giraldez, silver can yield riches of a different sort. 
 "A history of silver reveals a great deal about global trade networks and patterns," said Mr. Giraldez, a historian who is on the faculty of the Pacific World History Institute in Stockton, Calif. He and Mr. Flynn, an economics professor and the director of the institute, are collaborating on a history of silver.
Since the 16th century, silver has fascinated scholars and philosophers. Yet Mr. Flynn and Mr. Giraldez say that more recently, this precious metal has been forcing historians to adopt a less conventional and more global perspective on the history of trade.
Indeed, following silver's global production and trade patterns is precisely what the two professors say led them to reassess their own approach. "Studying monetary history from a global view takes on a life of its own," Mr. Giraldez said. "It spun our thinking in directions which we did not intend." They turned their attention away from Europe, and in the process became converts to the increasingly popular field of world history.
Mr. Flynn said that conflicts between the historical evidence and conventional ideas about silver and trade ultimatley forced them "to formulate a better theory." Now, he said, they believe "a highly integrated global economy has existed since the 16th century."
At the moment, the professors are researching two cycles in the evolution of the global silver market. The first phase, known as the Potosi-Japan cycle, lasted from 1540's to the 1640's. They name 1571 -- the year the city of Manila was founded -- as the moment when global trade was born. For anyone trading around the world, Manila was a link between Asia and the American continents; the stopping point for the first substantial and continuous trade across the Pacific Ocean. Silver, primarily produced in Japan, Mexico and Potosi (what is now Bolivia) and then sold in China, was no exception. After China's paper money system collapsed in the middle of the 15th century, the country gradually began to use silver instead. By the 1600's, silver had become more valuable than ever, worth twice as much in China as anywhere else in the world.
A second phase, known as the Mexican cycle, covered the first half of the 18th century. A large population surge in China engendered a huge increase in demand for silver there at the same time that silver production boomed in Mexico, spurred by tax breaks, government support for mining and some technological changes that reduced production costs.
Despite the current vogue for globalization, Mr. Flynn and Mr. Giraldez argue, these two silver cycles show that powerful economic, demographic and ecological forces linked the world long before the 20th century.

HEADLINE: At a Crucial Juncture, Iraqi Officials Cut Off Oil Exports

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE with NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 1

 BODY:
Picking an opportune moment, Iraq has abruptly stopped exporting oil, officials here said today.
It is not the first time this year that Iraq has disrupted its oil supply, which provides 4 percent of world consumption, to protest United Nations sanctions. Oil markets were calm in response to the shutdown, which took place late Thursday; the price of crude oil fell $1.80 a barrel in New York, to $32.02. 
 Still, some market experts said Saddam Hussein might achieve significant effects. "Whatever leverage he has is maximized now," said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. "Saddam Hussein has been pushing, and the world has been giving way on sanctions."
The Iraqis are testing the resolve of the United States and the Security Council just before an important series of debates on Iraq begins next week, diplomats said, and soon after failing to divert some oil revenues to accounts not controlled by the United Nations.
Baghdad is acting while Americans are preoccupied by the dispute over the presidential election. Some American diplomats said Iraq would make a mistake if it tried to take advantage of the situation.
"If anybody has the impression that the administration isn't paying attention or is losing interest in this complex of issues, they're quite wrong," said James B. Cunningham, deputy American representative at the United Nations, who works on Iraq in the Security Council.
Iraq is pressing ahead to loosen the straitjacket that it has been in for the 10 years since it invaded Kuwait. A resurfacing of divisions among Security Council members and the high oil prices are giving Mr. Hussein an opportunity he has seized.
Iraq has more or less succeeded in opening the skies over Baghdad to renewed air traffic after a disputed but nonetheless observed 10-year ban, and after weeks of discussion, Council members cannot agree how to regulate flights. On Thursday, a plane carrying paying passengers flew from Jordan to Baghdad.
Baghdad also prevailed in its drive to cut the percentage of oil profits, to 25 from 30, that is paid to a fund to compensate victims of the Kuwait invasion, though there is a dispute over how to spend the savings.
Iraq has been cultivating friends around the Middle East and among developing nations, prominently offering help to Palestinians involved in the new violence in Israel. Iraq has been signing trade agreements, entertaining heads of state like President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and sending high-level officials abroad.
Council members most sympathetic to Iraq, particularly China, France and Russia, are renewing efforts to reopen a discussion on a new system to inspect arms put forward a year ago that the Iraqis have repeatedly rejected.
The Council resolution to set up the system considerably broadened the range of purchases Iraq could make without Security Council approval and held out the hope of a suspension of sanctions if the Iraqis cooperated. But Iraq insists that the sanctions end before it lets inspectors return.
Backed by France and Russia, Iraq wants to know exactly at what point sanctions would be suspended if it decided to accept the new plan. Baghdad also wants less United Nations control over money, the issue that led to stopping the oil exports.
Efforts to adapt the inspection plan in ways that could hasten Iraqi cooperation may run into problems with the man in charge of running the inspections. Hans Blix, the Swedish lawyer and arms control expert who is executive chairman of the new inspection body, has repeatedly said that he cannot talk about timetables and lists of important Iraqi tasks until he can put inspectors back on the ground to study what has changed in the two years since the last United Nations inspections. Independent arms experts say Iraq should be given a list of what is required, because that would let them do the minimal accounting of biological, chemical, nuclear and missile programs.
Dr. Blix met his commissioners this week and reported to the Council today that he had 72 inspectors and other experts ready to work in Iraq.
Russia, the nation closest to Iraq, will hold the Council presidency this month, and diplomats said that gave the Russians advantages in setting the agenda.
Iraq also appears to be trying to rekindle interest in Secretary General Kofi Annan's office for more direct contacts between Mr. Annan and Mr. Hussein or his closest aides.
This week in Moscow, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz repeated Iraq's public rejection of the new system. But he pointedly added that an Iraqi delegation due to visit New York in January would hold talks with the secretary general on how to improve ties with the United Nations. That revives an Iraqi tactic of trying to circumvent the Security Council by dealing directly with Mr. Annan.
Two previous chief arms inspectors, Rolf Ekeus and his successor, Richard Butler, warn against letting the Iraqis bypass inspectors and the Council in the hope of obtaining a better deal from Secretariat officials. It has been two years since any arms inspections in Iraq, except for a routine check by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
In recent weeks, Iraq has been focused most intently on oil sales and how to turn the market to its advantage. The Iraqis have said they will open a pipeline to Syria and have not asked for permission to do so. Two export points are allowed now, in Turkey and at the Persian Gulf. Oil leaves Iraq unsupervised over land to Jordan and Turkey. The Security Council has not tried to stop that flow.
Last month, Iraq was given the right to deal in euros, not dollars, when it sells oil. Baghdad moved to add the equivalent of a 50-cent surcharge to its price, to be deposited in bank accounts not controlled by the United Nations. Oil buyers have refused, and the United Nations has objected to a price cut that could hide the special payment. With the standoff, United Nations officials said, the pipelines dried up on Thursday night.
Today, Mr. Annan sent a report to the Security Council that showed significant advances in the health and living conditions of Iraqis, who are supposed to benefit from the oil sales, though the report found much suffering.
Several times in recent months, Iraq has slashed its exports for short periods, willing to give up some income in a strong market. "We've been down this road before," said John Kilduff, senior vice president at Fimat, the commodities trading arm of Societe Generale.
In the oil marketplace, prices remain strong. Inventories of heating oil are tight ahead of the winter. And few exporting nations have much capacity to replace the Iraqi oil. If Iraq continues to shut down its output, that could affect prices. "The window of opportunity for him is 60 to 90 days," Mr. Goldstein said.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 6, 2000, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about Iraq's suspension of oil exports omitted a word in summarizing a view of independent arms experts on terms for getting weapons inspectors back into Iraq. They said that to avoid letting Iraq do only the minimal accounting required, international authorities should "not" give the country a list of tasks that must be done to close the book on its biological, chemical, nuclear and missile programs.

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY

BYLINE: By Andy Grundberg; Andy Grundberg, the author of "Crisis of the Real," is an art critic and curator in Washington.

 BODY:
If economists ever need a new measure to judge the health of the economy, I would propose a revamped G.N.P. -- the new abbreviation standing for Gross Number of Photography books published per year. By this yardstick the economy must be in fine fettle, because publishers here and abroad have put into print a vast array of books of photographs this season. Quality has not always kept pace with quantity (some new volumes seem to have no discernible audience except the author's immediate family), but the market suggests that photographs are an inexhaustible source of curiosity and pleasure in today's opticentric world.
The publishing gates have widened to include all manner of pictures, including innocuous amateur snapshots and horrific scenes of lynchings (for instance, "Other Pictures" and "Without Sanctuary" from Twin Palms) and genuine pornography ("Peek: Photographs From the Kinsey Institute" from Arena Editions). Whatever else their merits, these collections, as well as Deborah Willis's panoramic historical survey of images by African-American photographers, "Reflections in Black" (Norton), serve to widen our sense of how the camera has both echoed and shaped American society at a grass-roots level. 
 Historically speaking, the 1960's are the decade du jour, and one can sample (or possibly relive) the period through books devoted to fashion, celebrity and photojournalism. Images of the civil rights movement and of Marilyn Monroe mark the current poles of 60's mania, with Bert Stern's "Marilyn Monroe" (te Neues) winning gold in the heavyweight division. The 70's are revived in a more useful sense, with the republication of several classic photography titles from the time: "The New West," by Robert Adams (from the German publisher Walther KRated PG-13nig); Lewis Baltz's "New Industrial Parks Near Irvine, California" (RAM); and Eugene Richards's "Dorchester Days" (Phaidon). Another reprise is "The Idea of Louis Sullivan," by John Szarkowski (Bulfinch), originally published in 1956, a book of architectural photographs that constitutes the claim of the well-known curator and writer to fame as a photographer.
ATGET. By John Szarkowski. (Museum of Modern Art/Callaway, $60.) EUGNE ATGET: Paris, 1857-1927. Essay by Andreas Krase. Edited by Hans Christian Adam. (Taschen, $39.99.) Szarkowski's book on the work of Eugene Atget, published this year, is one of the best new books to advance the notion that photographs we think of as works of art are satisfying not only on their own terms but also because they engage the world of ideas. In the case of Atget, the early-20th-century documentarian of Paris and its environs, the pictures are so vividly direct that they invite ruminations of the sort Szarkowski is well equipped to deliver. "Atget" beautifully reproduces 100 pictures from the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, each paired with a commentary by the author. The format is much the same as that of Szarkowski's classic text "Looking at Photographs" (1973), but concentrated on a single artistic sensibility.
Luckily, Atget's sensibility and Szarkowski's are entirely consonant, and the intellectual meanders of the author prove to be of the same order as the perambulations of the photographer. Who else could begin a commentary about a picture of a cottage cistern by noting, "We now have pumps so deep-reaching and powerful that we can draw down even the Oglala aquifer, the ocean of fresh water underneath the Great Plains, which once seemed inexhaustible"? Or conclude, in writing about a picture of an apple tree in bloom, "If the tree grew in the right part of Normandy the distillate could be called Calvados, but it was doubtless also good in other neighborhoods"? True, Szarkowski's prose style has become increasingly mandarin since "Looking at Photographs," but it remains mesmerizing -- and his insights into Atget's world are, as he says of the photographs themselves, "as plain and as nourishing as good bread."
Szarkowski's "Atget" is not to be confused with another volume, "Eugene Atget," edited by Hans Christian Adam, which is less faithful in its reproductions but equally edifying. Part of an impressive photography series from the Taschen publishing house that includes books on Karl Blossfeldt, Edward S. Curtis, Man Ray and others, it delivers a great deal of information at a budget price. There are more than 250 reproductions, a succinct introductory text that incorporates the latest Atget scholarship, and biographical and bibliographical entries. The pictures come from a variety of museum collections, most of them in France, and the texts are printed in German, French and English, making this an international enterprise. Taschen's series seems particularly aimed at students, but in a way that should not exclude anyone.
THE PHOTOGRAPHIC ART OF WILLIAM HENRY FOX TALBOT. By Larry J. Schaaf. (Princeton University, $75.) As spectacular a homage to an inventor of photography as one could imagine, this exquisitely designed and produced volume is ostensibly occasioned by the 200th anniversary of William Henry Fox Talbot's birth. In truth, however, it represents the fruits of the author's long labors to identify and comprehend Talbot's photographs, the earliest of which predate Louis Jacques Mande Daguerre's public announcement of photography in January 1839. Schaaf, an independent scholar who lives in Baltimore, has studied Talbot's prints at Lacock Abbey, the inventor's family estate near Bath, England, as well as his unpublished correspondence, thereby becoming a leading expert on photogenic drawing, the first form of positive-negative photography Talbot devised, and his subsequent calotype. Here Schaaf's knowledge is put to good use in an extensive introduction, in the selection of 100 plates and in the descriptions that accompany them.
As beautiful and informative as this book is, it is slightly short of definitive: Schaaf plans on producing a catalogue raisonne of Talbot's complete works sometime in the future. (Curators take note: all the pictures here bear "Schaaf numbers" in anticipation of this event.) Also, one can argue with the author's sometimes speculative views of Talbot and his work. For example, the very first plate, of a window at Lacock Abbey, is identified as "probably summer 1835" -- which would make it one of the earliest surviving photographs of any kind. But after discussing similar pictures taken later, Schaaf hedges his bet on the image by conceding, in his concluding sentence, that it might also be dated 1839. More fundamental, in terms of our understanding of Talbot, is the scholar's ex cathedra insistence that the inventor was a "little artist," an amateur scientist who, through practice, developed the aesthetic seeds of what we now think of as "camera vision." This effort to claim Talbot as a modern artist is a red herring; the fragile, often faded images are sufficiently engaging that we can see them as art without further instruction.
SITES & STRUCTURES: The Architectural Photographs of Edward S. Curtis. Edited by Dan Solomon and Mary Solomon. Essay by Rod Slemmons. (Chronicle, $65.) Edward S. Curtis's images of Native Americans -- people he saw as "the vanishing race" -- have been so well deconstructed of late that their status as documents of anything other than the photographer's nostalgia is highly debatable. Lost in this academic reshuffle is the fact that Curtis, even at his most sentimental moments, was a fine photographer. His skill at composing an image so that it looks inevitable (and therefore factual) is most easily seen in pictures that have no human subjects, which is exactly what the more than 100 photographs in "Sites & Structures" deliver. Ranging from mud and grass huts to elaborate cedar-log foundations, the structures include homes and ceremonial houses that bear signs of recent habitation. As Rod Slemmons notes in his essay, many of these building styles now exist only in Curtis's photographs, so despite their straightforward appearance the pictures have taken on an elegiac air. All the images come from a single private collection, but they were culled from photogravures originally published in Curtis's 20-volume treatise, "The North American Indian."
THE SKY BOOK. Photographs by Richard Misrach. Text by Rebecca Solnit. (Arena Editions, $65.) Not since Alfred Stieglitz photographed clouds in the 1920's has a photographer made so much of the earth's atmosphere and precious little else. Richard Misrach, who is known for his series of "Cantos" on the landscape of the Southwest, dares to pare his large-format color pictures down to swaths of tone occasionally broken by scratchy lines supplied by stars. The results are as emotionally evocative as Stieglitz wanted his cloud "Equivalents" to be, and as purified of quotidian reality as any painting by Mark Rothko or Robert Motherwell. Still, because they are photographs, Misrach's pictures let the mind wander only so far; by design they make us pinch ourselves to remember that this is the glow after a sunset on the desert, or a stratocumulus cloud on the horizon, or the parallel arched tracks of Betelgeuse and Sirius made mobile by the earth's rotation. A reverie this self-conscious is as rare as a solar eclipse.
CHINA: The Photographs of Lois Conner. Foreword by Jonathan Spence. Essays by Geremie R. Barme and Lois Conner. (Callaway, $100.) For more than 15 years Lois Conner has carried an antique, panorama-format camera on journeys throughout China, making black-and-white photographs that describe a country poised between an agrarian past and an industrial, urban future. As collected in this great oblong of a book, at 16 inches more than half again as long as it is high, her landscapes move from an early fascination with the scenic splendors of Guangxi Province's "flowerpot" mountains to a focus on new construction in the cities of Shanghai and Beijing. This is not to say that the pictures are dialectical; among the most interesting views are wide-screen group portraits of country peasants, Beijing tourists and residents of provincial capitals such as Chengdu in Sichuan. Conner's stance as a detached observer gives her work a 19th-century feel; some pictures recall Carleton Watkins's images of San Francisco, taken when the city was being transformed from a colonial outpost to a major cosmopolis.
WENDY EWALD: SECRET GAMES. Collaborative Works With Children 1969-1999. Preface by Adam D. Weinberg and Urs Stahel. (Scalo, $49.95.) Wendy Ewald has had a photographic career like no one else, teaching photography to children as a means of building literacy and self-esteem. Starting with Native Americans in Canada, she has concentrated on working with those who live in poverty, cultural isolation or both, in places like Appalachia, South Africa, Saudi Arabia and the state of Chiapas in Mexico. "Wendy Ewald: Secret Games" reproduces hundreds of pictures produced by children under Ewald's tutelage, many of which show a sophisticated sense of composition and lighting. But what ultimately makes this book so interesting is not the pictures per se but what those pictures indicate about the human spirit. Ewald's project is wonderful because it lets kids speak for themselves; instead of being passive subjects for the lens, they eagerly harness it to the engine of their imaginations.
PAUL HIMMEL: PHOTOGRAPHS. Introduction by Martin Harrison. (Assouline, $75.) Of all the photography books related to fashion released this year -- and there are many -- Paul Himmel's is the most satisfying. Partly this is because the book has more to do with photographic style than with clothing, but also because the era it represents -- the glory years of Harper's Bazaar in the 1950's and 60's -- seems so fresh to present-day students of design. Himmel studied with Alexey Brodovitch, the magazine's great art director, and learned the lessons of immediacy, sense of movement and disregard for convention that characterized his mentor's work. In addition to fashion, Himmel assayed experimental, grainy pictures of New York street life, male and female nudes and casual portraits of his wife and children. He even had the temerity to undertake a series of blurred ballet pictures, a subject Brodovitch had photographed in the early 40's.
CHRIS VERENE. (Twin Palms, $60.) Chris Verene is this year's most appealing newcomer, a diamond in the rough whose square color pictures record his family and friends in candid, unvarnished fashion. The book gets its gritty grip on reality by sticking to place, which happens to be Galesburg, Ill. The tacky interiors, worn clothes and forlorn expressions in the pictures suggest that all is not well in Galesburg, but Verene adds a commentary that tries its best to be upbeat and compassionate. The effect is reminiscent of Mark Goodman's visual diary of life in Millerton, N.Y., "A Kind of History," which was published without fanfare a year ago. But the larger shadow hanging over Verene's work belongs to Diane Arbus, which is not a bad thing.
THE ARCHITECT'S BROTHER. By Robert ParkeHarrison. (Twin Palms, $60.) Robert ParkeHarrison constructs post-apocalyptic landscapes in which a lone figure (himself) contests the forces of desolation that surround him. The fabrication is extremely clever and blessedly nondigital, giving the impression of being both old and futuristic in the manner of a Mad Max movie. Much is left to the imagination, including whether ParkeHarrison is a serious eco-artist or a humorist parodying our fears about nuclear winter. In either case, there is much to enjoy in these dreamlike black-and-white images.

The books are arranged alphabetically under genre headings. The complete reviews of these books may be found at The New York Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com/books.
 
FICTION & POETRY
ABE. By Richard Slotkin. (Holt, $27.50.) A nervy historical novel about the first 23 years of Abraham Lincoln's life; it concentrates on the riverboat voyaging that gave Lincoln his first real contact with slavery and conveys the hardships of frontier life in early-19th-century America. 
 ABYSSINIAN CHRONICLES. By Moses Isegawa. (Knopf, $26.) This panoramic first novel about the stormy postcolonial history of Uganda covers 30 years of baleful activity as experienced by three generations of a single family.
AFTERBURN. By Colin Harrison. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25.) Elegant prose and exact description keep this thriller flying with an overload of unlikely characters (the heroine is a mathematical genius jailed for hijacking trucks).
AFTER THE WAR. By Alice Adams. (Knopf, $25.) Adams's final, alas, gossipy novel, finished before her death last year, pursues the Baird family in the Southern college town to which they have fled from the Depression; the style is as blithe and contagious as ever, and important truths transpire indirectly, if at all.
THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER & CLAY. By Michael Chabon. (Random House, $26.95.) A generous, optimistic, inventive and ambitious comic novel, set in the golden age of comic books (late 1930's to early 50's) and thematically permeated by two ideas: escape (from Nazism, from Brooklyn) and the mystery of the golem of Prague.
THE ANGEL ON THE ROOF: The Stories of Russell Banks. (HarperCollins, $27.50.) An outstanding regional realist's relentless anatomy, in 31 stories, of contemporary life, chiefly in bleak sections of the northeastern United States.
ANIL'S GHOST. By Michael Ondaatje. (Knopf, $25.) The author of "The English Patient" sets his new novel amid the ravages of the civil war in Sri Lanka.
THE BEAST GOD FORGOT TO INVENT. By Jim Harrison. (Atlantic Monthly, $24.) Three novellas, inhabited by the tough guys Harrison's readers have learned to love and dread; but now they are older and more ruminative, aware of their mortality and half supposing that the right woman might save them.
BEE SEASON. By Myla Goldberg. (Doubleday, $22.95.) An intelligent, dispassionate first novel that constructs and deconstructs a somewhat off-center Jewish family whose lives change when a hitherto ordinary fifth-grade daughter turns out to be an all-American spelling champ.
BEN, IN THE WORLD: The Sequel to "The Fifth Child." By Doris Lessing. (HarperCollins, $23.) This spectacularly disturbing story, about a monster born to a determinedly happy, determinedly middle-class family in England, adopts the monster's point of view; 18 and looking 40, he becomes a drug courier, an experimental subject in a nasty research institute and a very disturbing relative of human beings who read books.
THE BLACKWATER LIGHTSHIP. By Colm Toibin. (Scribner, $24.) Three generations of an Irish family are summoned to a clash of old views with new in this novel whose immediate crisis concerns a gay man's death from AIDS but which looks back to some earlier Ireland in which gay consciousness and central heating were equally unknown.
BLONDE. By Joyce Carol Oates. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $27.50.) A fat, messy, fierce and audacious novel that ventures to propose a plausible interior world for Marilyn Monroe; like the original, Oates's Monroe fascinates above all because of her perpetual victimhood.
BLUE ANGEL. By Francine Prose. (HarperCollins, $25.) The sexes and the generations no longer speak in this high comic novel in which a middle-aged professor is the target of the student he supposes he is exploiting.
THE BLUE BEDSPREAD. By Raj Kamal Jha. (Random House, $21.95.) A first novel whose narrator lives a barren existence among the 12 million strangers in Calcutta, writing down (and cleaning up) the family past for the sake of his conscience and his dead sister's baby.
BLUE RIDGE. By T. R. Pearson. (Viking, $24.95.) A literary novelist turns his hand to crime in a novel that alternates between a lawman's exegesis of a pile of bones on the Appalachian Trail and the concerns of his cousin, an alienated actuary whose son (whom he barely remembers) has come to grief.
THE BOYS AT TWILIGHT: Poems, 1990-1995. By Glyn Maxwell. (Houghton Mifflin, paper, $14.) A selection of poems from Maxwell's earlier verse that deals with a central theme of modern English poetry: that life is being missed.
THE BRIDEGROOM: Stories. By Ha Jin. (Pantheon, $22.) Twelve stories set, like the author's novel "Waiting," in provincial (but, for American readers, exotic) Muji City, where as China approaches capitalism all kinds of tyrannies, personal and institutional, beset inoffensive people who just want permission to get by.
THE COLLECTED POEMS. By Stanley Kunitz. (Norton, $27.95.) The life's work of the new poet laureate of the United States, now 95; much of it thematically and structurally interconnected, bold and generous in its statements about birth, death, the cosmos.
COLLECTED POEMS IN ENGLISH. By Joseph Brodsky. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $30.) All the poems that appeared in English while Brodsky (1940-96), Nobel laureate, scourge of liberal pieties and embattled proponent of a formal poetics, was still alive to supervise their appearance.
A CONSPIRACY OF PAPER. By David Liss. (Random House, $25.) This engaging first novel traps a mixed bag of characters in the collapse of the South Sea Bubble in 1720, the first stock-market crash in the English-speaking world.
THE DANISH GIRL. By David Ebershoff. (Viking, $24.95.) An arresting first novel whose hero, a landscape painter, discovers the woman within him one day in 1925; the six-year journey toward surgical and psychological transformation (with the help of his wife) dramatizes and affirms the endless adaptability of love.
THE DIAGNOSIS. By Alan Lightman. (Pantheon, $25.) A highly original novel by a lecturer in physics and professor of humanities at M.I.T.; its hero, immersed in an environment of cell phones, pagers and the Internet, suffers an illness both caused and made undiagnosable by excess information.
DIAMOND DUST: Stories. By Anita Desai. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, paper, $12.) A rewarding collection by an Indian writer who uses food as a metaphor for the offering or withholding of emotion.
DISOBEDIENCE. By Jane Hamilton. (Doubleday, $24.95.) This story about a son who learns about his mother's extramarital affair is also a warm, humane examination of the privileges and pitfalls of family life.
DON'T TELL ANYONE. By Frederick Busch. (Norton, $25.95.) Short stories by a master, many of them credibly told by a variety of first-person narrators looking back on choices now irrevocable, often dealing with infidelity and the bitterness of failed marriage.
DREAM STUFF: Stories. By David Malouf. (Pantheon, $22.) Australia, in the short fiction of this collection, is a place of surprises and changing potential, where history itself is sometimes in question and characters protest against loss, though the author seems to assure us that nothing is lost forever.
THE DRESS LODGER. By Sheri Holman. (Atlantic Monthly, $24.) This historical novel, deep in its research and vivid in its imagination, links a 15-year-old prostitute, a surgeon and a journalist in the darker byways of the Industrial Revolution in provincial England in 1831.
ENGLISH PASSENGERS. By Matthew Kneale. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $25.) A grim but hilarious historical novel involving the extinction of the Tasmanians, a search for the Garden of Eden and a Manx contrabandist who conceals his smuggling from the passengers on his ship.
EQUAL LOVE: STORIES. By Peter Ho Davies. (Houghton Mifflin, paper, $12.) Short fiction that regards with a kind of awe the comforts and constrictions of family ties as manifest in everyday events like lust, divorce and the sighting of U.F.O.'s.
THE FEAST OF LOVE. By Charles Baxter. (Pantheon, $24.) A luminous he-said-she-said of a novel, in which He (a handsome toadlike man) and She (Ex-Wife No. 1) unspool contrary narratives of their life together, with cameos by Ex-Wife No. 2 and a pair of love-drunk slackers.
FLUDD. By Hilary Mantel. (Owl/ Holt, paper, $13.) First published in Britain in 1989, this novel of clerical life, suitably adjusted to modern times, concerns a Roman Catholic parish in a grim industrial town where things are so far gone that supernatural intervention is no surprise; the intervener, however, is no angel.
FREUD'S "MEGALOMANIA." By Israel Rosenfield. (Norton, $21.95.) The author provides a fictional past and a fictional last book for Freud in this wonderfully contrived novel that evokes Freud's ambition as well as his self-deception.
THE GATES OF THE ALAMO. By Stephen Harrigan. (Knopf, $25.) A comprehensive historical novel that uses its space to tell the story from both the Mexican and Texan sides through a rotating cast of mainly fictional characters.
THE GOLDEN AGE. By Gore Vidal. (Doubleday, $27.50.) A historical novel that gives the author's characteristically idiosyncratic perspective on American history from World War II to the Korean War.
THE GOODLIFE. By Keith Scribner. (Riverhead, $23.95.) A novel that ponders why crime stories so fascinate us while telling a hair-raising tale of a kidnapping gone wrong, using five narrative points of view without ever getting confused.
THE GRAVITY OF SUNLIGHT. By Rosa Shand. (Soho, $24.) An acutely sensuous first novel whose deft plotting follows the precarious marriage of two Americans living in Uganda toward 1971 and the seizure of power by the terrifying Idi Amin; their real love affair is with the country itself.
HALF A HEART. By Rosellen Brown. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.) Civil rights activist in the 1960's, prosperous householder in the 80's, this novel's white heroine, longing for wholeness, seeks out the black daughter she once ran out on.
HARRY GOLD. By Millicent Dillon. (Overlook, $26.95.) The biographer turns novelist to tell the story of a nondescript man who was convicted of atomic espionage.
THE HILL BACHELORS. By William Trevor. (Viking, $22.95.) Short stories, generous and exploratory rather than clinical or satirical, though corrupted or depraved characters are most vivid; often animated and provoked by reflections on the Troubles in Ireland, where Trevor was born, though he has lived in England for decades.
A HOLE IN THE EARTH. By Robert Bausch. (Harcourt, $24.) Bausch's fourth novel concerns Henry Porter, 39, the sole flop in a family of successes, whose fixation in preternatural adolescence is mitigated by his own humiliations and the kindness of others.
HORSE HEAVEN. By Jane Smiley. (Knopf, $26.) The racing horses in this spirited novel, which is thoroughly immersed in the anecdotes and arcana of the track, are every bit as involved in self-discovery as their human companions.
HOUSE OF LEAVES. By Mark Z. Danielewski. (Pantheon, cloth, $40; paper, $19.95.) A funny, moving, elaborate first novel in which a common dream becomes the medium of a peculiarly moral confrontation with fear and trembling.
HUNTS IN DREAMS. By Tom Drury. (Houghton Mifflin, $22.) A sequel to "The End of Vandalism," set in the same bleak farm community, this novel centers on the ex-vandal, now a plumber (gone straight more from detachment than maturity), as he confronts the breakup of his marriage.
I LOVED YOU ALL. By Paula Sharp. (Hyperion, $23.95.) An old-fashioned storytelling novel about the escalating defiance of hard-line anti-abortionists in the 1970's; the leading character (on the side that is clearly not the author's) has the depth and energy to become indispensable to people whose lives or children are out of control.
IN AMERICA. By Susan Sontag. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $26.) A daring novel, the winner of the National Book Award this year, in which, off and on, narrator merges with author and history with imagination in the career of a grand 19th-century Polish actress who knocks 'em dead in California.
IN THE FALL. By Jeffrey Lent. (Atlantic Monthly, $25.) Yes, a wounded soldier walks home from the Civil War, but this novel emerges from the shadow of "Cold Mountain" to tell of the hero's marriage to a runaway slave and a family's disturbing legacy.
IN THE GLOAMING: Stories. By Alice Elliott Dark. (Simon & Schuster, $23.) The tone in these stories is muted, mannerly, controlled -- and so are the people in them, until traditional habits intersect with unpredictable contemporary life, leaving the characters in seas they can't navigate.
JERSEY RAIN. By Robert Pinsky. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $21.) A sensitive, inquisitive mind, uninjured by belonging to the former poet laureate, works in discursive modes in poems that ruminate on the virtues of public and private life.
JIM THE BOY. By Tony Earley. (Little, Brown, $23.95.) A first novel, a coming-of-age novel, a Southern novel -- and yet no monsters, no parental abuse, erotic turmoil or domestic dysfunction! This clear, balanced, understated book makes growing up seem somehow possible.
JOE COLLEGE. By Tom Perrotta. (St. Martin's, $23.95.) Perrotta's fourth book of fiction somewhat cheerfully explores the social shuffling of the meritocracy by casting a working-class student from New Jersey into Yale, where aspirations to assimilation try to prevail over a lot of baggage brought along from his father's lunch truck.
THE LAST DANCE: A Novel of the 87th Precinct. By Ed McBain. (Simon & Schuster, $25.) The 50th installment in this celebrated series of police procedurals shows that McBain remains at the top of his form.
THE LAW OF AVERAGES: New & Selected Stories. By Frederick Barthelme. (Counterpoint, $25.) Work by a writer whose best characters, brilliant with the delight of buying things, can skirt the edge of derangement to reach an anguished, compassionate comedy.
LEARNING HUMAN: Selected Poems. By Les Murray. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $27.) A cosmopolitan temperament sharpens nativisms and traditional forms in the expansive, energetic work of the closest thing Australia can offer just now to a truly national poet.
LICKS OF LOVE: Short Stories and a Sequel. By John Updike. (Knopf, $25.) Short stories sharing a theme of retrospect and a tone of forgiveness, and a 182-page novella, "Rabbit Remembered," in which a contentious Thanksgiving dinner brings Rabbit Angstrom's survivors together to clash and to form new alliances.
LIGHTNING ON THE SUN. By Robert Bingham. (Doubleday, $23.95.) A pair of privileged young Americans take on a hopeless caper, intending to outsmart some Cambodian drug lords; the author, dead last year at 33 of what looked like a heroin overdose, had a satirical talent that will be missed.
THE LILY THEATER: A Novel of Modern China. By Lulu Wang. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $25.) A sprawling, fictionalized account of the author's own childhood during China's Cultural Revolution; a daughter of professionals sent to be re-educated in a Maoist camp, she acquired an honest schooling from other learned inmates.
LIVING TO TELL. By Antonya Nelson. (Scribner, $24.) A whole family -- the Mabies of Wichita, Kan. -- is the protagonist of this novel of wry, obsessive self-observation, beginning with the return of a son from a prison sentence for killing his grandmother in a drunken car crash.
LONGING. By J. D. Landis. (Harcourt, $26.) A penetrating fictional biography of Robert Schumann, the Romantic composer who died in a madhouse in 1856 after a life of sometimes violent obsession with music and with the piano teacher's daughter he married.
THE LONG HOME. By William Gay. (MacMurray & Beck, $24.95.) This first novelist fears no theme, however large; it's good versus evil in Faulkner territory, and good succeeds only when it's better armed than evil and willing to exert violence.
THE LOST LEGENDS OF NEW JERSEY. By Frederick Reiken. (Harcourt, $24.) The drama of sheer ordinariness receives its celebration in this novel set in northern New Jersey about 1980; the Jewish and Italian families who inhabit it struggle (especially the teenagers) for both stability and poetry.
LOVING GRAHAM GREENE. By Gloria Emerson. (Random House, $22.95.) A beguiling first novel in which a rich, eccentric American woman with an idolatrous crush on Greene sets out to do good in this world by saving Algerian journalists from hit squads, an effort that fails so flatly and awfully she loses all hope in life.
LYING AWAKE. By Mark Salzman. (Knopf, $21.) A novel about a cloistered nun in Los Angeles, agonized by the discovery that her visions of God's love seem biologically based; by a writer skilled in the lucid presentation of spiritual states.
MAKE BELIEVE. By Joanna Scott. (Little, Brown, $23.95.) Scott's fifth novel, full of admirable narrative tricks, centers on a 3-year-old boy for whom the author miraculously finds an appropriate voice to register the custody fight conducted over him by his dead parents' parents.
THE MAN WHO WROTE THE BOOK. By Erik Tarloff. (Crown, $23.) Dead-ended at a jerkwater college, the scholar hero of this riotous novel strikes pseudonymous pay dirt as a pornographer: his magnum opus, "Every Inch a Lady," out-Potters Potter.
THE MANY ASPECTS OF MOBILE HOME LIVING. By Martin Clark. (Knopf, $24.) This first novel by a Southern judge features a Southern judge, who logs overtime as cuckold, bribe taker, treasure hunter and devoted tester of controlled substances but by the end has become a guy worth knowing.
THE MAP OF LOVE. By Ahdaf Soueif. (Anchor, paper, $14.) Three women in nearly two centuries intersect in this novel as an American and an Egyptian make the loves and the politics of the past transpire from a trunk left by a late Victorian Englishwoman.
LE MARIAGE. By Diane Johnson. (Dutton, $23.95.) A highly entertaining novel whose European-American couples misread each other not just as individuals but as cultural products; a manuscript is involved, also a murder, maybe a kidnapping.
THE MARRIAGE AT ANTIBES. By Carol Azadeh. (Carroll & Graf, $22.95.) Five restless long stories by a Belfast writer who sends her protagonists, mostly female, to keenly evoked destinations that often confound the travelers when they get there.
THE MARRIED MAN. By Edmund White. (Knopf, $25.) Mortality and forgiveness are still White's indispensable themes in this spare, resonant novel about a gay union that works both with and against the cliches of marriage.
MARTHA PEAKE: A Novel of the Revolution. By Patrick McGrath. (Random House, $24.95.) Through layers of narration two centuries and several literary styles thick, McGrath pursues the physical and mental deformity of a dank denizen of London's docklands in the 1760's, and his daughter's emigration and martyrdom in the American Revolution.
MASTER OF THE CROSSROADS. By Madison Smartt Bell. (Pantheon, $30.) The author continues the story of his own "All Souls' Rising," energetically pursuing historical characters through the complexities of the Haitian slave revolt, particularly the great born general Toussaint L'Ouverture.
THE MEANS OF ESCAPE. By Penelope Fitzgerald. (Houghton Mifflin, $18.) Eight short stories form this posthumous collection, full of struggle, stoic, comic, sometimes frightening; some are exercises in a sort of self-subversion, where a protagonist's narrative is assaulted from some unexpectable direction.
men in the off hours. By Anne Carson. (Knopf, $24.) There is a startling freshness deep down in these poems, the work of a writer for whom the ever-sharp world exerts attractive and repulsive forces in equal measure.
THE MISSING WORLD. By Margot Livesey. (Knopf, $23.) This vigorous, intelligent novel (the author's third) pits a woman with amnesia against a lover eager to exploit the handicap; she doesn't remember rejecting him or the reasons she did it, but she figures him out again.
MODERN ART. By Evelyn Toynton. (Delphinium, $22.) An admirably brisk first novel by a gifted writer that is also a roman clef about the life and death of Jackson Pollock.
MOTHERHOOD MADE A MAN OUT OF ME. By Karen Karbo. (Bloomsbury, $23.95.) Motherhood is the lead character in this peevishly hilarious novel that contains two plots about two women, close friends but in circumstances very unlike, except both are having babies, or have had or will.
MOTH SMOKE. By Mohsin Hamid. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $23.) The rich live at the expense of the poor in the Pakistan of this first novel, whose hero mocks the vulgarity and decadence of the top crust while desperately yearning to join it.
MR. PHILLIPS. By John Lanchester. (Marian Wood/Putnam, $24.95.) When the accountant at the center of this novel is fired, he begins a curious new life, involving a bungee jumper, performance art and a blue movie (these are three separate things).
MRS. HOLLINGSWORTH'S MEN. By Padgett Powell. (Houghton Mifflin, $20.) A mirthful, wicked little novel whose protagonist, a Southern woman of a certain age and of a mind mostly unreconstructed, contemplates the men in her mind's life, notably the Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest.
THE NAME OF THE WORLD. By Denis Johnson. (HarperCollins, $22.) A sparely realized worldscape, from the Midwest to Iraq, zips by the protagonist of this novel, an academic who has lost his wife and child in a road accident and whose job prospects aren't so hot either.
NEW ADDRESSES: Poems. By Kenneth Koch. (Knopf, $23.) Fifty poems, each an ode to a different subject ("To Psychoanalysis," "To My Father's Business," "To 'Yes' "), by a poet with plenty of affirmation and no fear of apostrophe.
THE NIGHT LISTENER. By Armistead Maupin. (HarperCollins, $26.) The conversations between a 13-year-old boy who is dying of AIDS and the gay host of a radio show form the centerpiece of a novel that explores the boundary between truth and self-delusion.
NO GREAT MISCHIEF. By Alistair MacLeod. (Norton, $23.95.) A Canadian orthodontist is this novel's narrator; he is also the current focus of a tumult of memory and longing generated by a Scottish family that settled on Cape Breton Island in 1779.
AN OBEDIENT FATHER. By Akhil Sharma. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $23.) The main narrator in this novel by a New York investment banker is a low, corrupt functionary in the Delhi school system. It's easy to brand him despicable because he is, but his power is limited, his personality complex and his author compassionate.
THE OBITUARY WRITER. By Porter Shreve. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, paper, $12.) A lean, noirish first novel about a very junior journalist who comes to know a widow whose male associates seem to keep disappearing.
ODYSSEY. By Homer. Translated by Stanley Lombardo. (Hackett, cloth, $34.95; paper, $9.95.) The translator of the "Iliad" brings his laconic wit, love of the ribald and clever use of American slang to a new translation of the story of Odysseus' journey home from the Trojan War.
OFF KECK ROAD. By Mona Simpson. (Knopf, $19.) A novel smaller and more delicate than is the author's wont, concerning three characters, all unmarried women in Green Bay, Wis., all living lives in which events are rare, emotion is slender and conclusions are inconclusive.
PASTORALIA: Stories. By George Saunders. (Riverhead, $22.95.) The author's second story collection focuses on the American urge for self-improvement, the fear of failure and the need to be accepted. Generally speaking, his characters don't stand a ghost of a chance.
PILGRIM. By Timothy Findley. (HarperCollins, $25.) This dense, ambitious novel mingles religion, history, psychology and mystery in a hero who may have committed suicide repeatedly for centuries and undergoes therapy with Carl Jung.
THE PLATO PAPERS: A Prophecy. By Peter Ackroyd. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $21.95.) An unusual exercise, akin to an exposition of the English author's poetics, this book is composed of long Socratic essays set in a far future that oddly resembles the ancient past.
PLOWING THE DARK. By Richard Powers. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25.) An awfully smart novel of brute juxtaposition that crosscuts between two screening rooms of the mind: a cell in Beirut where an American hostage is held and a virtual-reality lab in Seattle.
POBBY AND DINGAN. By Ben Rice. (Knopf, $16.) A slender, touching, imaginative first novel set in Australia; its title characters are the invisible friends of an opal miner's daughter, and things go wrong from the moment the miner, drunk, loses Pobby and Dingan.
PROPERTIES OF LIGHT: A Novel of Love, Betrayal and Quantum Physics. By Rebecca Goldstein. (Houghton Mifflin, $23.) The author of "The Mind-Body Problem" explores the darker side of the conflict of ideas in physics between relativity and quantum mechanics, both of which find expression in the structure of the novel.
PURGATORIO. By Dante Alighieri. Translated by W. S. Merwin. (Knopf, $30.) A new translation, along with the Italian, of the middle part of "The Divine Comedy."
THE QUESTION OF BRUNO. By Aleksandar Hemon. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday, $22.95.) Mostly fictional (but who can say for sure?) stories and a novella, invoking both the terrible facts of Bosnia and Yugoslavia and the years of the author's childhood, when there was yet hope for both countries.
THE QUICK AND THE DEAD. By Joy Williams. (Knopf, $25.) An intelligent, unsettling, audacious, virtuosic, improbable novel that may not want the reader's affection; the protagonist, a motherless girl of 15 in the desert Southwest and an absolutist animal lover, certainly doesn't.
RAILS UNDER MY BACK. By Jeffery Renard Allen. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $26.) This restless, sprawling first novel, the story of two brothers married to two sisters, is ultimately a survey of the varieties of African-American
experience.
RAVELSTEIN. By Saul Bellow. (Viking, $24.95.) A lively, haunting novel that explores American male friendship as it pursues in parallel the last days and death of Bellow's friend Allan Bloom, author of "The Closing of the American Mind."
THE RIVER KING. By Alice Hoffman. (Putnam, $23.95.) Hoffman's 14th novel concerns the death by drowning of Gus Pierce, a freshman at the haughty Haddan School, and the efforts of a Haddan police officer to solve what appears to be a murder, with the convenient assistance of the deceased's ghost (the River King of the book's title).
THE ROMANTICS. By Pankaj Mishra. (Random House, $23.95.) A spare, reflective novel, free of magic realism, about a young Indian man who goes to Benares to be idle and read; instead, he follows a cross-cultural itinerary of encounters with himself, the West and his own country.
ROPE BURNS: Stories From the Corner. By F. X. Toole. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $23.) Stories about boxing and boxers, mainly elegiac, mostly told with cool narrative and wild sentimentalism; the author is a 70-year-old former boxer, trainer and corner man who knows whereof.
THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT. By Catherine Bush. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $24.) A novel with the nerve to use war as a metaphor for the travails of love; its protagonist, a graduate in war studies, has fled Canada after two men fought a duel over her.
SAM THE CAT: And Other Stories. By Matthew Klam. (Random House, $22.95.) A smart, absorbing story collection (the author's first) in which young men discover that the world is an impossible place, at least right now: "Sex is never normal with anyone," as one of them puts it. "It's bizarre. It's wiggly meats."
SCANDALMONGER. By William Safire. (Simon & Schuster, $27.) The title character of this skillful, solidly grounded historical novel is an odious journalist who gets the sexual goods on both Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson.
SCAR VEGAS: And Other Stories. By Tom Paine. (Harcourt, $22.) A first collection of refreshingly adventure-filled short stories, all concerned with the way huge geopolitical forces can change the texture of small individual lives in distant places.
SIAM: Or, The Woman Who Shot a Man. By Lily Tuck. (Sewanee Writers' Series/Overlook, $23.95.) An intelligent, sparely written, politically preoccupied novel in which a young American wife in Thailand during the Vietnam War suffers first confusion, then obsession, then tragedy.
SICK PUPPY. By Carl Hiaasen. (Knopf, $25.) Hiaasen's latest comic novel, concerning mostly depraved characters criminally engaged in Florida politics, takes his programmatic blackguarding of the state wherein he resides to new heights.
SIMPLE STORIES. By Ingo Schulze. (Knopf, $25.) A baroquely expansive comic novel, the author's first, that deals with stodgy, provincial East Germans challenged to reinvent themselves by the collapse of civilization as they knew it.
SIX FIGURES. By Fred G. Leebron. (Knopf, $22.) The yuppie couple in this novel, no strangers to anger, covetousness and envy, now confront great violence -- and the suspicion that it is home-grown.
THE SLEEP-OVER ARTIST. By Thomas Beller. (Norton, $23.95.) Not a novel so much as a set of interconnected short stories, this second collection by the author of "Seduction Theory" follows its hero, the narcissistic Alex Fader, from the age of 6, when he throws water on people from Upper West Side windows, to about 25, when he returns to the neighborhood having matured through exposure to pot, girls and a few grown-up complications.
SO I AM GLAD. By A. L. Kennedy. (Knopf, $23.) An oddly engaging novel, earnest and ironic, by a young star of Scottish fiction, in which Jennifer, a 35-year-old sadist, finds a new kind of May-December romance with Martin, about 40, who was Cyrano de Bergerac in a former life.

HEADLINE: Hawaii Cruises: Growth Ahead

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
WHEN Norwegian Cruise Line's 1,960-passenger ship, Superstar Leo, moves to Honolulu from Singapore at the end of next year, to begin weekly year-round cruises, it will become the only foreign-registered cruise ship to make its year-round home in Hawaii. And soon to begin year-round cruises around Hawaii is the 1,214-passenger Patriot, formerly Holland America Line's Nieuw Amsterdam, recently bought by United States Lines and scheduled to enter service on Saturday. The two ships are expected to help boost the number of cruise passengers in Hawaii from this year's estimated 200,000 to about 400,000 in 2005, according to a report prepared for the state's Department of Transportation.
Cruising and Hawaii are closely linked in the public imagination, largely because of old movies showing ships arriving in the islands to the accompaniment of hula dancers and welcoming leis. But Hawaii has never been a huge cruise destination, largely because of its distance from the mainland and the cost of getting there. Scheduled airline service to Hawaii beginning in the 1950's put a major crimp into what was left of the Hawaiian cruise industry. Even with a 12.1 percent increase in cruise visitors to Hawaii last year, from 1998, that amounts to only a minuscule 46,000 of the islands' overall 6.85 million visitors in 1999. 
 The 81 Hawaii cruises this year are two fewer than last year, according to the Cruise Lines International Association. But because the ships are bigger, there will have been almost 900 more berths this year than last, and almost 12,000 more than in 1998.
Next April, Celebrity Cruises will enter the Hawaii market for the first time, when its 1,950-passenger Infinity begins the first of two 11-night cruises between Ensenada, Mexico, and Honolulu, with stops at four other Hawaiian ports.
American Classic Voyages, the parent of the United States Lines and American Hawaii Cruises, has two 1,900-passenger ships on order for delivery by 2004. Princess Cruises's Regal Princess and Sea Princess will each make two voyages to Hawaii next year, increasing the cruise line's berths in Hawaii by 720.
Cruise passengers contributed $58.9 million to the Hawaiian economy in 1998, and the amount is projected to rise to $675 million in 2004. Meanwhile, a lot of Hawaiian hotels are attracting visitors who stay a few days before or after their cruises, according to Darlene Morikawa, a spokeswoman for the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau: "It's a win-win situation for industries that are normally competitive."
Island tourism and cruise officials agree that the cruise industry could be stymied if Hawaii's antiquated ports and passenger terminals are not upgraded soon. And a century-old law still bars foreign ships from boarding passengers at one American port and discharging them at another before stopping at a foreign port. Ships of United States Lines and American Hawaii Cruises are exempt because they are American-owned and registered. The SuperStar Leo will be exempt because its seven-day Hawaiian cruises will stop at Kiribati, a tiny central Pacific Ocean nation.

HEADLINE: HOTEL CHECK-IN: T-1 LINES AND BATH BALMS;
Laptops by the Pool in Silicon Valley

BYLINE: By John Markoff 

 BODY:
In the past two years the W hotel chain has become synonymous with the ultrahip of the New Economy, the perfect place to make the scene -- whether in New York, San Francisco or Los Angeles. But the newest California property in the chain -- a five-story stucco and tile building with a mansard roof -- sits next to a huge Sun Micro systems campus in Newark. The hotel is 10 minutes (when it's not rush hour) from downtown Palo Alto, the heart of Silicon Valley. Its presence is proof that Silicon Valley spills over its borders, north to San Francisco and east across the bay into both East Bay cities, Newark and Fremont.
This W Suites is the first of several planned by Starwood, which owns the W hotels. It has 174 large rooms with king-size beds overflowing with down pillows and comforters, deep purple sofas, mustard Ultrasuede side chairs and lavender Ultrasuede desk chairs. Black and white photographs decorate the walls. Each room comes with a microwave, a high-speed network connection and an Etch-a-Sketch. Bathrooms are sleek with simple, elegant fixtures. 
 Night life ends early here. The bar is set off from a cozy living-room-style lobby at one end, with a fireplace topped by a stainless-steel mantel. Coffee-table books and plush sofas and chairs add to the ambience. A 22-table dining room features a menu ranging from Japanese satay to roast chicken and mashed potatoes, at prices from $6 to $25. But the crowd is an after-work bunch, mostly 30-somethings who stop in for a drink and possibly dinner before heading home by 9 p.m.
The "whatever, whenever" amenities are clearly tailored to the techie crowd that is more interested in the fact that the lobby and restaurant have a high-bandwidth wireless connection for visitors' laptops, which allows them to surf the Internet from the bar to the enclosed pool area.
Although there is no formal room service menu, anything is available from the restaurant and it will be taken upstairs to guests -- usually business travelers. For latecomers there are specially prepared meals for the microwave.
The suites are normally priced at $289, well within the price range of Silicon Valley's overcrowded hotel scene.
W Suites, 8200 Gateway Boulevard, Newark, Calif. 94560; (510) 494-8800, (877) 946-8357, fax (510) 494-8809; www.whotels.com. JOHN MARKOFF

HEADLINE: What Secrets Tell

BYLINE: By Luc Sante; Luc Sante is a frequent contributor to The Times Magazine.

 BODY:
Once, it was believed that a wholesale revelation of secrets would not occur until the Day of Judgment, when graves would be opened and the tongues of the dead at last loosened. Nowadays you might almost get the impression that the time had arrived, so profuse has been the unsealing of lips, the unlocking of vaults, the uncovering of caches. Secrets, some of them moss-covered with age, have one after another been stripped naked in public. There are two major catalysts for this phenomenon. The dissolution of the Soviet empire, first of all, opened a tremendous number of lead-lined rooms. We now know where various bodies are buried, who spied and for whom and what they transmitted. Because to Westerners the U.S.S.R. was for more than 70 years the No. 1 sphinx, the serial release of K.G.B. documents over the past decade has solved whole shelves' worth of longstanding mysteries and promoted an atmosphere of real or imaginary worldwide openness.
And then there is the Internet, which has proved a nemesis to secrecy official and unofficial at home. Nothing of major importance, it would seem, can remain hidden for long before someone in on the deal feels the urge to post the details online. The Web is the universal souk, where fans, zealots, voyeurs, lonely crusaders, congenital meddlers, dirt brokers, disgruntled ex-employees and the idly curious can trade facts, as well as rumors and fantasies posing as facts, in relative safety and anonymity. A secret posted on the Web can reach an astonishing number of eyes in no time at all; deniability doesn't count for much when you've got a few million eager witnesses. The secret, once an important, gold-backed currency, appears in danger of rapid devaluation as the screens of the world are flooded with industrial quantities of the skinny. 
 A third factor, meanwhile, has been coursing through American culture since before either of the other two became relevant. The urge to confess one's hidden transgressions before an audience of strangers, a peculiar phenomenon that came to our attention in the 1980's, has wildly miscellaneous roots: revival-tent epiphanies, Alcoholics Anonymous, psychotherapy and its many cousins, televised trials and certain odd game shows of the past, the poetry of Robert Lowell and Sylvia Plath, the memoirs of Mafiosi and Hollywood lechers and Watergate spear-carriers. Baring all in public attracts attention and at least used to assure forgiveness. Today it's all about entertainment value, with maybe some cathartic relief thrown in, and the secrets revealed have become more inconsequential even as they have become more sordid. The taboo-busting memoir, which was the intellectuals' outlet, seems to have dried up recently, but the TV confession shows are still strong after more than a decade -- television thrives on repetition. Anyway, the phenomenon builds momentum, and the measure of normality is subject to continual revision: the more rubber fetishists reveal all before a live studio audience, the more additional rubber fetishists will feel impelled to do the same. At this rate, the last living American with a hidden vice will surrender to Jerry Springer in about eight years.
So are we in the midst of a new era of candor? Not likely. We need secrets far too much to jettison them. Just as it is possible that today secrets are being manufactured for the express purpose of revealing them amid trumpet flourishes, so it has happened and will happen again that secrets are constructed simply to answer a pressing need for secrets. Secrets are a permanent feature of the human condition. We need secrets the way we need black holes, for their mystery; the way we need land-speed records, for their enlargement of scale; the way we need sexy models in advertisements, for their seductively false promises; the way we need lotteries, for their vague possibility. We also need them the way we need bank vaults and sock drawers and glove compartments. Anybody who doesn't carry around one or two secrets probably has all the depth of a place mat.
But then the word "secret" conceals under its mantle a teeming and motley population of types. Secrets cater to the entire range of human susceptibilities, from the laughably trivial to the terrifyingly fundamental. Principal landmarks along the way include:
Personal Secrets. In other words, those secrets that are chiefly of interest to the persons who carry them around. You know the sort: you pick your nose when no one's looking; your real first name is Eustace; you wear a truss for nonmedical reasons. If such things were revealed, your ego might take a beating and your intimates could gain a weapon for use in squabbles or extortions, but the foundations of your house would not be shaken.
Romantic Secrets. They run the gamut. That interval of passion you once shared with your dentist when the two of you were stuck in an elevator with a bottle of Cherry Kijafa may remain swathed in gauze for all eternity, although your partner might eventually demand to know the identity of this "Shirley" whose name you utter in your sleep. That you enjoy above all the erotic sensation of being pinched with tweezers until you bleed might not matter a whole lot to anyone, unless you decide to run for office, and then you will find yourself sending discreet sums of money to people you haven't thought of in years. Couples often tacitly erect a whole edifice of secrets, based on real or imagined causes for jealousy. This can be relatively harmless, or it can be a symptom of the relationship's becoming a regime.
Secrets in Gossip. That is, the wheat left over when gossip's chaff is sifted out. Secrets that surface as gossip are usually of the mildest sort, personal eccentricities and romantic peccadilloes not of much interest outside a closed circle. (It is understood that there is a direct correlation between the degree of triviality of the secret transmitted as gossip and the rank of the gossip's subject within that circle.) Gossip, though, demonstrates how secrets can become currency, as the teller invests the hearer with power in exchange for esteem. The possession of a secret concerning another is, like all forms of power, something of a burden, a weight pressing one's lips together, which can be relieved only by telling someone else. This, added to a hunger for knowledge on the part of all within the gossip circle, keeps the wheel of the secret-fueled gossip economy turning.
Trade Secrets. The monetary economy, meanwhile, revolves around a wide and diverse range of secrets. A business strategy is a secret until it becomes a fait accompli. The details of the financial health of a company are kept as secret as the law allows. Anyone with a degree of power in the market is continually keeping secrets -- from competitors, from the press, from anyone who is an outsider, including friends and family, but sometimes from colleagues and office mates. The reasons are obvious: everyone is naked in a cutthroat world, and secrets are clothing. It goes without saying that secrets protect innovations and that they also hide various extralegal undertakings -- the ostensibly respectable bank that takes in laundry on the side, for example. Business also employs secrets strategically, as secrets qua secrets, usually painting the word "secret" in letters 10-stories tall. Naturally the new car model will differ little from the previous year's, but a bit of cloak-and-dagger about it will increase public interest. The "secret recipe" is on a par with "new and improved" as a carny barker's hook. The cake mix or soft drink or laundry soap may, of course, actually include a secret ingredient, known only to staff chemists and highly placed executives, but very often a "secret ingredient" is rumored or bruited about primarily as a lure to the gulls of the public.
Secret Formulas. The public hunger for secrets is primordial. It is first and foremost a matter of curiosity, but it also springs from a painful awareness of rank and a belief that things are different upstairs, with a more or less fanciful idea of the specifics. These days, with fortune-building running at a pitch not seen since the 1920's, there is widespread demand for financial folklore. You can make a lot of money catering to the suspicion that there exist shortcuts known only to a few. That some people are richer, thinner, more charismatic or whiter of teeth may be a result of a variety of imponderable factors, but for everyone who in moments of desperation has imagined that there must be some simple trick, some formula or high sign or investment routine or hidden spa, there is an author with a book aimed at the exact combination of vulnerability and prurient imagination. Such publications run along the entire span of implied legitimacy based upon demographics, from the crudities aimed at the supermarket-tabloid constituency (diets centered on junk food named in the Bible, for instance) to the overpriced hardcover pamphlets catering to the anxieties of the managerial class by dressing up received ideas with slogans and numbered lists. For centuries, the secret has been a sure-fire sales gimmick. All you have to do is combine the banal and the esoteric.
Secret Societies. There are probably a lot fewer than there once were, but somewhere in America, no doubt, insurance adjusters and trophy engravers still gather once a month in acrylic gowns and button-flap underwear to exchange phrases in pseudobiblical Double Dutch and then get down to the business of drinking beer. It helps them feel special to be the only ones in town who know the three-finger handshake. The setup descends from the heresies of the Middle Ages by way of the pecking order of the playground. We can laugh at them, now that they are so enfeebled, but there was a time not long ago when they dominated the social life of male middle-class America, and in many ways their pretensions are not so far removed from those of the Mafia or the C.I.A.
Mystical Secrets. The secret is bait. The secret leads votaries by the nose through a maze of connected chambers, in each of which they must ante up. Only when they have finally tumbled to there being no secret (and they have run through the better part of their inheritances) can they truly be counted as initiates. But few have the stamina to get that far, and most instead spend their spare afternoons consuming one tome after another promoting the secrets of, variously, the pyramids, the Templars, the ascended masters, the elders of Mu, the Essene scrolls and so on through greater and lesser degrees of perceived legitimacy, all of which flutter around the edges of the secret, none of which make so bold as to suggest what it might consist of.
State Secrets. "Our laws are not generally known; they are kept secret by the small group of nobles who rule us," wrote Kafka in one of his miniature stories. "We are convinced that these ancient laws are scrupulously administered; nevertheless it is an extremely painful thing to be ruled by laws that one does not know." This is the essence of state secrets. A government does not have to be totalitarian, particularly, to possess a stratum of laws whose existence cannot be generally known because they describe the limits of the knowable. It is forbidden for unauthorized persons to possess certain kinds of information. What kinds of information? Well, that's the trouble; if you knew that, you would already know too much. State secrets range all the way from banal prohibitions on photographing customs booths and power plants to the highest levels of technical esoterica.
Atomic Secrets. "Stop me if you've heard this atomic secret," cracked William Burroughs in "Naked Lunch." Atomic secrets may be the world's most famous class of secret, an oxymoron, surely, but for the fact that few enough people would recognize or understand an atomic secret if it landed in their mailboxes. The workaday state secret may be a matter of mere protocol or protection of resources, not unlike industries safeguarding the peculiarities of their production methods. The atomic secret, however, ascends to the level of the sacred because it manifests in concrete form the terror that mystics can only suggest: the end of the world. The secret of life may be an empty proposition, but the secret of death is actually legible to those who possess the language and the tools.
The existence of the internet, too, has increased the fluidity of secrets. Suddenly no one knows the difference between fact and folklore. Maybe secrets are posted all the time on fixed or fleeting sites, or maybe those are just clever counterfeits of secrets. Maybe the real deal is available on some site no one has thought to access yet. The Web, after all, offers the possibility that every iota of information in the world will sooner or later appear, but it may be that, like Jorge Luis Borges's library of Babel, the Web will eventually serve up every possible combination of words, so that finally no one at all will be able to tell a secret from its chance approximation.
Confessional culture further devalues the secret. It may be a big deal to the one making a clean breast of things, but to the audience it's Grand Guignol, rated on its novelty quotient or on how much carnage it inspires on the set. Secrets are loose change -- celebrities keep bagfuls in the storm cellar for when they need to score some publicity by leaking a few to the tabs. The daytime-TV guests each have one, but each greatly resembles others previously broadcast by other guests, and there is a limitless supply of new guests eating doughnuts in the greenroom. Anyway, whole classes of lifestyle deviations that used to be secret are now strictly ho-hum, will inspire yawns, have support groups devoted to them right down the street. That truly private shame of yours, meanwhile, probably requires too much context to be particularly negotiable, and the only three people who will care enough are not very likely to derive much entertainment from it. And what good is a secret then? That kind of secret will remain impervious to trends.
There is a deep human need for secrets that transcends all rational explanations. The revelation of a secret can be liberating, even intoxicating, at least at first, but to those on the receiving end, it is finally disappointing. This is in part because few secrets can live up to their packaging. Secrets need to mature some to be truly effective -- a point too often missed in today's climate -- but secrets known of long before they are divulged are especially susceptible to anticlimax. Witness the recent publication by the Catholic Church of the final prophecy of Fatima. It fell with a thud, especially because its revelation was way ex post facto -- the papal assassination attempt, nearly 20 years stone cold! Holy secrets have an obligation to lie beyond human understanding and, if unveiled, to produce a physically overwhelming effect.
People need secrets because they need the assurance that there is something left to discover, that they have not exhausted the limits of their environment, that a prize might lie in wait like money in the pocket of an old jacket, that the existence of things beyond their ken might propose as a corollary that their own minds contain unsuspected corridors. People need uncertainty and destabilization the way they need comfort and security. It's not that secrets make them feel small but that they make the world seem bigger -- a major necessity these days, when sensations need to be extreme to register at all. Secrets reawaken that feeling from childhood that the ways of the world were infinitely mysterious, unpredictable and densely packed, and that someday you might come to know and master them. Secrets purvey affordable glamour, suggest danger without presenting an actual threat. If there were no more secrets, an important motor of life would be stopped, and the days would merge into a continuous blur. Secrets hold out the promise, false but necessary, that death will be deferred until their unveiling.

HEADLINE: Corporate Spies;
The Pizza Plot

BYLINE: By Adam L. Penenberg and Marc Barry; Adam L. Penenberg lives in New York. Marc Barry is founder of C3I Analytics, a corporate intelligence company in New York. This article is adapted from "Spooked: Espionage in Corporate America," by Adam L. Penenberg and Marc Barry, to be published by Perseus Publishing later this month.

 BODY:
Almost every Fortune 500 company these days has a "competitive intelligence" (or C.I.) unit or farms out its spy activities. Coca-Cola, 3M, Dow Chemical, General Electric and Intel all maintain a staff dedicated to uncovering what business rivals are up to. Motorola hired away a star from the Central Intelligence Agency to create its corporate intelligence division. Ernst & Young, the accounting firm, boasts a 25-member competitive intelligence arm.
Although the word "espionage" conjures images of shady characters in overcoats who are hired to steal nuclear secrets, today's corporate spies are decidedly less glamorous. For one, they are hired to find out prosaic things like a company's marketing plan, the state of its R. and D. or a factory's production capacity. (Valuable, yes, but not sexy.) And instead of fancy gizmos like exploding pens and secret decoder rings, often all they need to get the job done is a telephone. 
 When companies don't have in-house C.I. units, they often turn to independent consultants, most of whom received their training from the Department of Defense, the C.I.A. or the F.B.I. Three years ago, Schwan's Sales Enterprises, a food company based in Marshall, Minn., hired a consultant who runs his own firm. Schwan's wanted to find out about a new product that promised to revolutionize frozen pizza. The target was Kraft, the largest packaged-food company in the country. It already sold pizza under the brands Tombstone and Jack's and had perfected a new type of "rising crust" pizza it had been test-marketing under the name DiGiorno. It was the winter of 1997, and up to then it was often hard to taste the difference between a frozen pizza and the cardboard box it came in.
Schwan's, which marketed store-bought pizza under the brand name Tony's, already knew the secret behind DiGiorno: pumping yeast into the raw crust, which Schwan's was also working on with its rising-crust pizza offering, Freschetta. If Schwan's was to have any chance against its hulking rival, however, it would have to know how fast Kraft planned to roll out DiGiorno nationwide, so that it could create a counterstrategy. To do this, the company had to learn the production capacity of a plant it knew Kraft had constructed somewhere in Sussex, Wis. Specifically, Schwan's needed to know the type of equipment the plant housed, the number of production lines, what types and sizes of pizzas were being produced there and, most important, how many pies were coming off the assembly line each day.
Schwan's needed the information fast, but the consultant knew it would be nearly impossible for him to get it without resorting to subterfuge. As a member of the Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals, or SCIP, the C.I. industry's governing body, the consultant knew he was supposed to abide by rules that prohibit misrepresentation or deception when interviewing a target on behalf of a client. SCIP stresses the "ethical" acquisition of information "from publicly available" or "open source" materials like published documents, public filings, patents and annual reports. The purpose of SCIP's spin control is to make industrial spying more palatable to P.R.-conscious corporations. It also makes spying more difficult.
This doesn't mean that breaking SCIP rules is against the law. The Economic Espionage Act of 1996 was passed to deal with foreign agents stealing trade secrets from American companies. But "to prove trade secrecy theft, you first have to prove there is a trade secret," says Mark Halligan, a Chicago lawyer and author of "Trade Secrets Case Digest." The formula for Coca-Cola and the source code for Microsoft Windows are trade secrets. Factory production, the information Schwan's wanted, isn't, and this loophole allowed the consultant, and the 7,000 other members of SCIP, to earn a living.
The consultant decided to subcontract the work to a "kite" or "go-to guy," who, in addition to being able to get the information the job required, would provide the consultant with plausible deniability. The consultant could fly the kite out there and let him do whatever needed doing to get the information, but if he got caught, the consultant could claim he had no idea what his subcontractor was up to. With Schwan's eagerly awaiting the information, the consultant hired one of us, Marc Barry, founder of the corporate intelligence firm C3I Analytics of New York, who had gotten the job done for the consultant half a dozen times in the past.
Barry, an Irish, streetwise redhead in his early 30's, had made a name for himself as an expert "humint" (human intelligence) man. Working undercover for years at a time, he had infiltrated Asian organized crime networks that controlled the distribution of counterfeit goods in the United States, as well as tracked phony pharmaceuticals and airplane parts. To Barry, collecting intelligence on companies was a snap compared with gathering information on violent gangs.
After doing some initial Internet research, Barry bought a $10 prepaid phone card from a nearby grocery so his calls couldn't be traced. He set up bogus voice-mail and fax-forwarding lines with a company called American Voice Mail. Both accounts were created under the 414 area code, which covered Sussex, Wisc. This way, Barry could collect his messages and faxes from his office in New York, yet his targets would be under the impression he was local.
Barry figured someone in the Sussex town government would know details about the plant. "Politicians are easily manipulated because they are usually eager to take credit for things," Barry says. He phoned the Sussex Chamber of Commerce and posed as a reporter from The Wall Street Journal. It took him one minute to get the address of the Tombstone pizza plant, located on Sussex Road. Then he dialed the Sussex town assessor's office, where he learned from an employee that Kraft was being assessed taxes for a new 143,914-foot plant.
Barry knew that, America being America, Kraft wouldn't be able to begin construction of its plant without permits, so he created a persona, an environmentalist he called Curtis Walton. He wrote it down because often at the end of a phone conversation a person will ask, "What was your name again?" and he didn't want to forget. (It had happened before.) Barry dialed the fire department and town building inspectors, since both usually have blueprints for local manufacturing plants. He claimed he was calling on behalf of an environmental advocacy nonprofit organization called EcoNet and was researching an article about excessive floral hydrocarbons being emitted from the Sussex plant for The EcoNews. The fire department didn't bite, and the building inspectors weren't in. After several calls, Barry managed to get a secretary at the building inspector's office on the line, who told him there was nothing she could do until her boss returned.
"But I'm on deadline," Barry cum Walton said. "Isn't there anything you can do?"
"My boss is so much better at reading these plans than I am," she said. "I'm afraid I'd miss something."
"Any help you could give would be greatly appreciated."
"I really should wait for my boss."
"But it will be too late by then," Barry said, letting a tinge of desperation color his voice. "And I just don't have the time to drive out to you and pull the plans myself. You know how deadlines are." Eventually Barry wore her down. As she read off the contents of the plans, even though he was recording the conversation, Barry scrawled notes just in case there was a glitch with the tape recorder. "This was not a new plant, but rather additions are being added onto an existing plant," the secretary informed him. This made sense. To keep transportation costs down, Kraft would want to keep its pizza production in a centralized location, and close to key ingredients. "The 143,914-square-foot addition was designed by Stahlman Engineering of New London, New Hampshire-"
"Stallman? How do you spell that?" Barry asked.
"S-t-a-h-l-m-a-n."
She recited the details the expansion permit covered: additional warehousing, more bakery space, a new recycling building. When she got into the nitty-gritty of what equipment was going to be housed in the new facility, Barry peppered her with questions and began to draw a map.
"Three compressor rooms," she said, "a 10-below-zero freezer and high-rise freezers -"
"How many?"
"Two. A label paste room, meat cooler and cheese coolers, a chemical storage room, something called a vestibule conveyor belt system, bakery waterfall oiler, several sauce and topping lines -"
"How many sauce and topping lines?"
"It doesn't say."
"O.K., go on."
"A Grotter PepperMatic, four spiral freezers -"
"How far from the conveyor belt are the freezers?"
"Around the corner, about eight feet away, a wheat dock, a loading dock -"
"How big is the loading dock?"
"Um, 1,906 square feet."
"Where is it?"
"It's been relocated between the bakery and the recycling room."
Delighted by his score, Barry thanked the secretary and hung up. Four spiral and two high-rise freezers? A 2,000-square-foot loading dock? A bakery waterfall oiler? Although Barry didn't know anything about pizza production, Schwan's certainly did and would be able to make good use of this information.
But Barry wasn't done. Now came the tricky part: how would he be able to measure how many pizzas the plant was producing daily? He mulled over a strategy. What, he wondered, do all frozen pizzas require? Labels. How would he track labels though? Besides, there were at least three different styles of pizza. Cheese? No way. Too complicated. Kraft used tons of it, and didn't it manufacture a four-cheese pie? Besides, cheese could be stored for a while, so it wouldn't be much use in trying to figure out how many pizzas came off those conveyor belts. Wheat? Yeast? Oil? Nah, those wouldn't do it. The cardboard boxes? Maybe, except that Tombstone pizzas were packaged in shrink-wrapped plastic, not in a box. Then it came to him: diskettes. Every pizza, whether it came in a box or in shrink-wrapped plastic, sat on a round, cardboard diskette. This was the one constant.
Barry picked up the receiver and dialed the Sussex plant. He asked for "accounts payable" and got a voice-mail line. Immediately he punched zero, and when an operator picked up he requested "accounts receivable." After another voice mail he ordered the operator to hook him up with the "purchasing department," where an older woman picked up. "Hi, this is Bobby Royce," Barry said, looking at the name he had just scrawled in his notebook, alongside a fictitious company. "I'm president of Presidential Corrugated Box."
"What can I do for you, Mr. Royce?" the woman asked cheerfully.
Good, Barry thought. "Well, you see, I own a cardboard manufacturing plant, nothing too big, mind you. A local family business. And I figured since I was a local business and you're a local business, well, maybe we could do business together."
"I dunno, sir," she said. "We use an awful lot of cardboard."
"Hmm, I see. What do you think you'd need. Ten, 20 thousand units a month?"
"Oh, no, we'd need more than that."
"How much more?"
"A lot more. We go through hundreds of thousands of units a day. We use Weyerhaeuser. They're the largest."
Barry tried to sound disappointed. "Weyerhaeuser, huh? That's way too much output for our plant. But in case you get any spillover and need more, I'll send over some literature."
He got off the phone and logged on to the Internet, where he plugged Weyerhaeuser into Yahoo's search engine to locate its corporate Web site. One call to Weyerhaeuser's corporate headquarters and he was given the number of the White Bear Lake facility near Minneapolis, the plant that serviced Wisconsin. He posed as an employee of the purchasing department of Kraft's Tombstone pizza plant who had just taken over the account and claimed there was a discrepancy on some paperwork. He asked how many boxes and disks Weyerhaeuser had shipped to the plant in the last month. But the number the accounts payable department gave him -- the equivalent of a few hundred thousand a day -- was too low when compared with what the woman from the purchasing department had told him. It didn't make sense. Barry dialed the Kraft Tombstone loading dock.
After a few rings, someone picked up, and Barry could hear heavy machinery grinding in the background. Reprising his role as Bobby Royce, Barry and the Tombstone worker fell into small talk. Barry figured the guy must be a Green Bay Packers fan, so he pretended the Minnesota Vikings, whom the Packers were scheduled to play that week, were his favorite team. The conversation shifted from the Packer legend Vince Lombardi to the right kind of thermos for Wisconsin winters to who manufactures the best work boot. Barry, who had worked as an undercover agent on dozens of loading docks for cargo theft investigations, said he liked Timberlands, but his new friend wore Wolverines.
Finally, Barry started asking questions about cardboard, specifically how much of it was handled by the loading dock. But the dock worker gave him a number even lower than the one Weyerhaeuser had supplied. Now Barry was really confused.
"They come in only once or twice a week," the guy said, trying to be helpful.
"What do you mean?" Barry asked.
"We recycle the boxes."
"I don't get it. You sell your pizzas in the box, right?"
"These are different boxes. These ones get used four times each. We use them to ship the crusts up from Little Chute."
"What the hell is Little Chute?"
"Our crust-manufacturing plant. But we're not going to be using cardboard for much longer. We've started moving to plastic for interplant shipping, which doesn't have to be recycled." He told Barry the Little Chute factory made most of the crusts, although some came from the Sussex plant, which is where Kraft manufactured the pizzas.
"So," Barry asked gently, but taking a more direct approach, "how many pizzas are we talking about here?"
"Since September, about 300,000 pizzas per day at the Sussex plant," the man said, blithely unaware of the value of the information he was giving up. "That includes the 12-inch Jack's Pizza, as well as 8- and 12-inch DiGiorno."
This was the number Barry had been looking for. Without letting on to his target that he'd been taken, Barry calmly continued with small talk, thanked his new friend and got off the phone. Then he lit up a macanudo and fired up his espresso maker, pondering what this information meant, and what his next step would be.
He realized that knowing the number of pizzas the Sussex plant was producing right now -- its operating capacity -- wasn't enough. He needed to find out its full production capacity. This would tell his client how many rising-crust pizzas Kraft could potentially make at any given time.
Barry donned his next phone disguise -- that of a graduate student working on a research paper on food production -- and dialed the Sussex plant's production lines manager. After making his pitch for academic assistance, Barry said: "I know you are cranking out 300,000 pizzas a day. How many production lines is that?"
The answer was five, but only three ran at any one time. Barry did some quick number-crunching in his head and calculated that Kraft's Sussex plant was operating at 60 percent of capacity, and that Kraft could increase pizza production to 500,000 pizzas a day. The manager also told Barry that DiGiorno wasn't the only rising-crust pizza Kraft planned to market. It had subcontracted the manufacture of rising crusts to Nation Pizza in Chicago for Tombstone, another hot-selling line.
Now this was big, Barry realized. The potential production numbers, coupled with its plan to market rising-crust pizzas under two brands, indicated that Kraft hoped to flood the market and establish itself as the primo player in rising-crust frozen pizza. If the information that Barry sucked up showed that Kraft was taking its time in bringing rising-crust pizzas to market, Schwan's could afford to move slowly. But since Kraft was diving headlong into the rising-crust market, Schwan's had no choice but to be aggressive.
Though Schwan's entry, Freschetta, was a new brand, the company decided to take a chance and plow resources into production and marketing. The information that Barry provided turned out to be key to Freschetta's ultimate success. Although DiGiorno was the first of the rising-crust pizzas, Freschetta became an immediate contender, spurred on by an intensive media campaign. Rising-crust pizzas became the fastest-growing food category and now account for more than 30 percent of frozen-pizza sales in the United States -- about $2.3 billion. DiGiorno quickly became the No. 1 selling pizza in the nation, but the covert information helped Freschetta rise from No. 6 to No. 2 by the end of 1999. And all it took was a day and a half worth of phone work by Marc Barry.

HEADLINE: This Train Beats Walking (Sometimes)

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD; WAYNE ARNOLD contributes to The Times from Singapore.

 BODY:
EXPERIENCED rail travelers recognize it is an almost certain sign of delay when fellow passengers abandon the train and strike off into the surrounding mountains on foot. This may not be very practical wisdom for the average Amtrak passenger, but it could be good to know if, like me, you find yourself riding to meetings in Hanoi through Yunnan Province in China during the summer rainy season.
Maybe I had been too gullible when I read in my guidebook that there was a regular train from Kunming, the capital of the province, to Hanoi. I had been planning to vacation in Yunnan Province and needed to do some reporting in Vietnam. What better way to study the relative benefits of globalization, I thought, than to ride a train across the border from China, newly converted capitalist libertine and aspiring World Trade Organization member, to Vietnam, petulant socialist wallflower? 
 China had certainly let its hair down in the nine years since my last visit. Kunming, once a proudly dour Communist city, had swapped its olive drab for planters of zinnias. Chengdu, the leafy metropolis with the fiery cuisine in Sichuan Province, to the north of Yunnan, had transformed itself into an explosion of department stores, cellular phones and dot-com ads.
The trains also had undergone a makeover of sorts during that time. The bituminous stench of water boiling for tea endures, but loudspeakers blare the theme of "Titanic" instead of old patriotic marches. Gone are the sullen women, pushing dirty mops, who were the conductors. They have been replaced by perky women with pageboy haircuts and dirty mops.
The narrow-gauge railway up the Red River was built by France in 1910 after the country persuaded China to give it mining concessions in Yunnan. China and Vietnam have managed to preserve the same 473-mile railway despite war with the Japanese, Chinese Nationalists, the French, the Americans, and then, deprived of common foes, each other. Now the line accommodates a twice-weekly train with first-class berths for the equivalent of $37.
My ticket read like a Warsaw Pact VCR instruction manual, printed in every language but English -- Chinese, Vietnamese, Russian and German. It came as little surprise that almost no one on the train spoke English, not even the tour group of language teachers from Vietnam sharing the ride. But I was fortunate to be sharing a cabin with a British couple for whom this 18-hour journey was a footnote. They had just survived a week aboard the Trans-Siberian railway, a moving bazaar in which bunks make way for car parts and other assorted goods traversing the global economy.
Our jaunt through the mountains held its own in the misery category. Narrow gauge is railway jargon for tightrope, and the train careered drunkenly through the night. The engineer indulged his fear of head-on collisions with frequent blasts of an earsplitting horn. With the cabin window closed, the sound was just painful, but the heat was unbearable.
Deciding that hearing loss was preferable to suffocation, we voted to open the window, only to be vetoed by our fourth inmate, an antique Vietnamese man. We deferred to the man's age; the window stayed shut.
We turned our efforts instead to persuading a conductor to turn on the air-conditioning. But the railway's frugality dictated that it not be turned on during cool weather, regardless of the temperature inside. After fuming at his console for 10 minutes, the conductor relented by setting the temperature to "arctic."
Morning found us semifrozen, our train stalled along a swollen Red River about 25 miles from the border at a muddy village called Lao Fan Zhai. Jungle-covered mountains rose steeply around us. The rains had sent a landslide down over the tracks up ahead. For four hours, we waited, watching the rain clouds play among the lush peaks as tribesmen in colorful attire drifted through the station to gawk at the massive diesel engine.
It was around this time that the local passengers decided to take their chances on foot. To say I wondered if I shouldn't follow them, the cognoscenti, is putting it too mildly. Hoofing it through the frontier appealed to my sense of adventure. But a modern instinct overcame me: I was a paying passenger and the railway had contracted to deliver me, I reasoned. Though the arrival time on my ticket was a joke, I clung to my faith in the agreement's spirit and sated my taste for adventure with a bowl of spicy noodles from the station canteen.
My inertia was rewarded when, through a series of interpreters, we were told that workers were trying to clear the route. Indeed, it wasn't long before men with picks and shovels appeared, having liberated the tracks ahead. We pulled into Hekou, across the border from Lao Cai in Vietnam, at about noon -- nearly two hours after the schedule in Kunming said we were to arrive in Hanoi.
The guidebooks say the Kunming-Hanoi train has been in service for the past seven years, enough time certainly for the Vietnamese and Chinese railway employees to have made clockwork out of the crossing. Those employees apparently were not on duty this particular day.
After our arrival, employees from both countries gathered on the platform to solve the twice-a-week riddle of how to carry passengers from China to Vietnam without letting a Chinese train pass into Vietnam. To accomplish this, our train was stripped to a single car to accommodate those of us continuing to Hanoi. A dilapidated Vietnamese car appeared on the rear to create what appeared to be bilateral travel, but then the Chinese engine rolled away and a Vietnamese engine, toylike by comparison, attached itself to the front.

JUST as the quiz-team leaders were nearing a solution, the extra-credit problem arrived in the form of four Bangladeshi students from Hanoi. Having made a day trip across the border, they now wanted to return. Problem: their visas to re-enter Vietnam weren't in order, but their Chinese visas didn't allow them to stay. China said they had to go back; Vietnam wouldn't take them.
Compounding the confusion, someone realized that there was now a Chinese car sandwiched in the middle of a Vietnamese train. A conductor boarded to shoo us all into the Vietnamese car while a clutch of railway workers on the platform yelled at one another in their respective languages.
By 4 p.m., the two sides had worn themselves into agreement. The Vietnamese engine lugged the Chinese car onto the next track and then returned. A grubby Vietnamese kitchen car was tacked onto the rear and, Bangladeshis on board, we eased across the border.
Immigration officials board the train in Lao Cai to check passports and glance into luggage, so after a brief encounter we were hurtling through the night along the Red River. We adjourned to the kitchen car to celebrate our arrival in Vietnam over tepid beers.
A drenched Hanoi station materialized outside our window at 1 a.m. -- 15 hours behind schedule. It was dark and quiet, and the gates were padlocked. So convincingly had the station shut for the night that we had to persuade the few remaining station employees that we had the right to be released.
Though it lacked the towering department stores of Kunming and Chengdu, Hanoi was in full capitalist embrace just the same. Vietnam had signed a trade pact with the United States while I was in Yunnan. Already, Hanoi's shelves were stocked with Gillette shaving cream, Head & Shoulders shampoo and Colgate toothpaste.
While both China and Vietnam appear open to trade from the rest of the world, the border they share is only semi-permeable, it seems. For no matter how comradely these Communist neighbors may say they are, they still won't accept each other's currency. Neither the hotel, nor the foreign-bank branches -- not even the government-run banks -- would trade Vietnamese dong for my Chinese renminbi. Vietnam and China may be fellow travelers on the road to globalization, but if the crossing at Lao Cai is any indication, they won't be bunking together.

HEADLINE: HOTEL CHECK-IN: T-1 LINES AND BATH BALMS;
Woodinville, Wash.: A rustic lodge with bath oils, granola and digital toys

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK; SAM HOWE VERHOVEK is a correspondent for The Times based in Seattle.

 BODY:
Given the fluctuating trajectories of Microsoft stock and the local dot-com economy, the new Willows Lodge may ultimately prove to be an idea whose time comes and goes and comes again.
A luxurious lodge-style resort, the Willows is in Woodinville, Wash., a town at the eastern edge of the Seattle suburbs near the software giant in Redmond and the hundreds of other high-tech companies that have congregated on the other side of Lake Washington. In fact, Microsoft was playing host to something called a "Leading Your Business" meeting at the 88-room lodge when my wife, Lisa, and I spent the night recently. The next morning, a casually dressed crowd of apparent conferees could be found huddled around a laptop in the lodge library. 
 Woodinville has a rustic charm, including wineries and lots of antiques shops. We were suitably impressed by the Willows, which opened in September, from the moment we stepped into the magnificent lobby, meticulously crafted from stone and several kinds of wood, including Douglas fir that was reclaimed from a 100-year-old building at the Port of Portland, in Oregon, then pleasingly sanded and waxed.
Given our getaway mood, the state-of-the-art digital technology at the Willows Lodge -- high-speed Internet connections, dual-line cordless phones and the like -- was hardly a principal source of appeal, though such features would obviously be important for a business traveler. And, come to think of it, the digital temperature control on the shower was fun to fool around with, as were the 27-inch stereo television and the CD player.
Still, all that high-tech stuff seems to mesh seamlessly into the more dominant lodge-style atmosphere of the place. When we checked in, the friendly clerk at the desk offered us a glass of sparkling water, then took us right up to our room.
It was a good thing he came with us, for we needed a bit of help figuring out all the futuristic dimmers and other controls, not to mention the button that controlled the gas jet in the large stone fireplace. There was a lot of reclaimed wood -- in the headboard, side tables, fireplace mantle and high rafter beams -- and stone as well, including a wonderful marble Mexican bowl that served as the basin for the sink. The walls were painted in hushed, earthy tones of olive, yellow and brown, perhaps a bit like the colors Starbucks might choose if it ever decides to go into the hotel business. The linens were Italian, the lamb's-wool pads under the sheets Australian, the coffee French-press.
After freshening up and having a drink from the honor bar in the room, which also offered herbal candles and bath balms, we explored the Northwest coast native paintings and sculptures that were placed throughout the lodge; the lighting, screens and pale-blond wood also reflect an Oriental aesthetic.
Just across the driveway from the lobby is the Barking Frog, a bistro-style restaurant that has an extensive selection of Northwest wines, including some made at the Chateau Ste. Michelle and Columbia wineries right there in Woodinville. Scheduled to join it sometime early next year is the Herbfarm, a wildly popular restaurant renowned for its four-star multicourse tasting meals featuring the freshest of Northwest ingredients. The Herbfarm, whose original home in Fall City burned down in 1997, and which has been in nearby Issaquah since then, may well, in time, become the Willows' prime drawing card.
The Barking Frog has a striking communal table set around a large fire, perfect for a rainy winter evening, though we opted for an even cozier table for two. The menu included an autumn salad of mixed greens with crispy blue cheese, Belgian endive and sauteed apples, as well as Chilean sea bass, pepper-seared ahi tuna, lacquered Alaskan halibut and lamb chops drizzled with pesto essence -- all very good though not outstanding. We passed on desserts, but they looked good, especially the chestnut tiramisu and the gratin of pineapple with tropical fruit. The tab came to $140 with wine and tip.
The Northwest wine list (in categories such as "loud and woolly," "lush and jammy," "round and woody," and "tart and lucid") is extensive.
Early the next morning, after a Continental breakfast of coffee, juice, fruit and granola (included in the room rate), we had a bit of time to explore the gardens, with a lot of Asian-themed art, rock displays and bonsai, as well as four fountains placed in such a way that one seems to hear water anywhere one strolls.
The lodge is also near the 29-mile Sammamish River Trail, which winds through the surrounding countryside and connects with other trails that lead all the way back to Seattle; a waiter at the Barking Frog said bicyclists sometimes made it out there from the city for weekend brunch.
Sadly, we had to head back to work, so, at least on this stay, we had time neither for a bike ride nor for an excursion to the impressive spa, which includes a workout room and outdoor hot tub. But we hope to return, perhaps even for work; if Microsoft ever invites your company to a "Leading Your Business" conference at the Willows, tell the boss it sounds like a demanding assignment, but you're willing to go.
The Willows Lodge, 14580 Northeast 145th Street, Woodinville, Wash. 98072, (425) 424-3900, (877) 424-3930; www.willowslodge .com. Rooms from $220 to $290; suites, $350 to $750.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE;
In a Leftist's Lens, The 'Common Man' Of a Dark Decade

BYLINE: By VICKI GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
THERE is a photograph of a despairing man, his face buried in his hands, sitting beside a poster for Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times." There is another of a woman standing glumly beside the empty window of a kosher poultry shop. Others: a man talks to a woman who has nervously raised the gloves in her hand to her mouth. Artists march with placards. Men sit around on benches, next to one another but effectively alone. A heavy woman and a thin one seriously, worriedly, study the signs in a travel bureau. This is how the streets of New York looked to Ben Shahn in the 1930's.
Around 1932, Shahn (1898-1969), a painter, acquired a Leica. Walker Evans taught him how to print and, as Shahn recalled it, gave him laconic instructions on exposure: "F/9 on the sunny side of the street, F/4.5 on the shady side of the street. For one-twentieth of a second, hold your camera steady." 
 Shahn was never much more technically competent than that, and he didn't much care. He said photography was "a mind, an eye, but not an art." He said he took pictures solely for his own use, meaning as references for his paintings, yet during the 1930's he was eager to have his photographs published as widely as possible. Not a professional photographer, he nonetheless photographed for the Farm Security Administration from 1935, the year it began, until 1938. Not an expert technician, he had an expert eye and, unfettered by the standard rules, took some daring license with the camera.
"Ben Shahn's New York: The Photography of Modern Times," more than 150 photographs, drawings, paintings and mural studies, is at New York University's Grey Art Gallery through Jan. 27. The exhibition was organized by Deborah Martin Kao, Laura Katzman and Jenna Webster, who are also responsible for an impressive scholarly catalog with the same title (Yale University Press). Ms. Kao and Ms. Webster are on the staff of the Fogg Art Museum, which owns Shahn's photography collection.
The D. C. Moore Gallery on Fifth Avenue has a show of Shahn's drawings through Dec. 29, and the Howard Greenberg Gallery in SoHo is to exhibit a selection of his photographs, different in many respects from the Grey Art Gallery's, from Friday to Jan. 20.
Shahn's artistic reputation was established by 1932 by a group of paintings titled "The Passion of Sacco and Vanzetti." Both style and subject announced his commitment to social realism and leftist causes. When he started these paintings, he was not working with a camera but was already heavily involved with photography, for he depended heavily on newspaper photographs for "Sacco and Vanzetti." Throughout his career, Shahn extensively collected and diligently filed newspaper and magazine photographs.
His frequent dependence on photographs for his art has been pointed out before, but one of the strong points of this strong show is how extensive the comparative material is.l Newspaper photographs that Shahn collected and used as models for other works are on view: see the painting "Girl Skipping Rope" and the newspaper photo on which Shahn based the girl's figure. More often, Shahn's paintings and prints are teamed with photographs he took himself; "Seurat's Lunch," for instance, a painting of a man sitting outside a store with a facade lovingly painted all over with spots, is placed next to a photograph of just such a man and just such a store.
His photographs are intimate views of street life, close-ups of subjects unaware their pictures are being taken. He used a right-angle viewfinder and depicted himself using it; the device itself can be seen on two of his cameras in "Ben Shahn's New York." With his eye to the viewfinder, he would face north, say, while his lens pointed west, and the view west was what he saw. Subjects looking at him saw him staring in another direction and apparently had no idea that the perfectly visible lens was staring directly at them. Odd as that seems, it must indicate that street photography was not yet so common and that "the common man" did not yet assume he was an object worth studying.
The subterfuge was not new. Paul Strand employed it in the 1910's, Walker Evans in the 1930's. Photographers were already uneasy about the ability of small cameras to commit image theft in various ways.Shahn was blithely free of guilt.
His far-left politics meant that he identified with the people he was photographing rather than with isolated bohemians intent on creating art for the intelligentsia and art for art's sake. This was an approved leftist position. Stuart Davis in 1935 declared that the artist "participates in a world crisis" and "recognizes his alignment . . . with the workers."
Shahn was engaged in reform but against sentiment, against idealizing the poor; he said it was "alright to have a soft heart, so long as you have a hard eye." He sought a public art -- he painted several public murals -- that would serve revolutionary and reform causes and move people to action. Photography was the exemplary medium in this program, a new combination of art and document that could be seen, understood and even made by the proletariat. Shahn saw it as a step on the road to creating a revolutionary public art.
An era gets the technology that suits its needs or finds a way to wrap its aspirations around what it gets. The later 1920's and 1930's got the 35-millimeter camera, a recording instrument of, by and for the people, a means of registering the life of the masses in mass-produced publications. Coinciding historical, political, economic and technological events had turned a spotlight on those masses.
The Russian Revolution, the abrupt collapse of boom times that had been built on American technological prowess, the New Deal programs that made the federal government the guarantor of sustenance for large segments of the populace: all focused attention on the omnipresent "common man" (and woman). In 1937, Robert and Helen Lynd wrote "Middletown," a widely read sociological report on an "average" American city, and Life published a photo essay on the town that reached far greater numbers than the book did.
At the moment this "common man" became crucially important, the engines of production and developments in the media -- cinema, radio, tabloids, photo magazines -- had raised mass consumption and the mass audience to extraordinary levels. The camera, already implicated in the creation of the audience, became that audience's ideal reporter, revered as the most representative and truthful documentary form in a time with the utmost respect for documentary. The 35-millimeter camera -- unobtrusive, fast, able to take pictures without flash -- took to the streets, where the mass of people (especially if they were unemployed) milled about and could be caught in the very act of living their lives.
Europeans had had a vital street life since shortly after the middle of the 19th century, when Paris boulevards were built with sidewalks, but sidewalk life in American cities, except for tenement areas, did not become so important until the 1930's. In New York in that decade, a lot of photographers trained their eyes on street life, some of them associated with the Photo League, some with the Works Progress Administration, some with the Farm Security Administration and some on their own.
The idea that quick takes on ordinary life would reveal something factually or even politically important was implicit in the earliest hand-camera photographs of the late 19th century. But outside of news photography, pictures like these did not have a major place in photography until the 1920's in Europe and the 1930's in America. Newsreels, which Shahn watched avidly and which he said influenced him, had something to do with the upgraded importance of fast snaps of minor occasions. So did photographically illustrated magazines and newspapers that needed human-interest stories to fill space.
Feature films made a difference, too. Silent film and the close-up had enlarged the belief that emotions and information could be read instantly in the slightest lift of an eyebrow, and popular psychology hammered home the notion that gesture and facial expression revealed more than was intended. The quickening tempo of life and the sense that information had to be abbreviated because time was shrinking fast had been underscored in the 1920's by the founding of Time magazine and Reader's Digest.
The stolen, candid photograph, an instant slice of life, stepped onto this track as if by personal invitation. Shahn came fresh to the form, and to the camera itself, and never intended to make his living from photography. Yet he made some images that were radical in style as well as intent, taking advantage of the medium's special properties. A few of his close-up pictures, with people ranged horizontally across the picture plane, suddenly open up to deep or sharply angled perspectives. A few cut off foreground figures so abruptly that they are indecipherable. He invited disjunctions, not of a surrealist kind but of every other. Three men of different classes and ethnic backgrounds, all looking in different directions, are contained within one frame but separated from one another by architectural elements and shadows. Single figures appear at odd points in a composition or are entirely left out of groups they appear to belong to, and every person in a group may seem oddly or unhappily isolated.
Shahn welcomed chance into his photographs more willingly than most of his peers. He photographed modern times: hard pressed, anxious, half lived on the streets. He also employed the photography of the modern time he lived in: rapid, spontaneous, open to accident, even courting the kind of accident that only happens in photographs. His instrument and images fit the era they were trying to convert. In Shahn's hands and many others, the camera was politically motivated, with images that began in public and reached as large a public as possible: an art that would eventually change public perception even as it aimed to change public life.

HEADLINE: Q. Gift for the Teacher?

BYLINE: By DEBRA NUSSBAUM 

 BODY:
FOR teachers at Brayton Elementary in Summit, the holidays had become too much of a good thing.
Gone were the days of handmade cards and "I Love You" coffee mugs. Students at the neighborhood school -- and in this case a very comfortable neighborhood -- were bringing teachers expensive perfumes, generous gift certificates and tote bags full of costly goodies.
"New Jersey has some very wealthy communities," said Michael Yaple, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association. "For some parents, giving a $200 gift certificate is like others giving a sundae coupon to Dairy Queen." 
 Indeed, in school districts all around the state, tickets to Broadway shows, designer handbags, monogrammed stationery and little blue boxes from Tiffany were making their way onto teachers' desks.
Finally Summit, one of the wealthier towns in New Jersey, put its foot down. "Appreciative parents were giving wonderful gifts, but the teachers were feeling uncomfortable," said Cheryl Moretz, the principal at Brayton. "We wanted to get back to what the season was all about."
Three years ago, after a meeting with the teachers, Dr. Moretz began sending letters home encouraging parents and students to show their appreciation with small handmade gifts or letters and to give to the community during the holiday season. She also talked to Parent Teacher Association representatives and asked them to spread the word that less was better.
The children were asked to bring in a wrapped gift for a needy child and place it in the holiday house outside the school office and to donate canned goods for a community food drive. "It's been very well received," said Dr. Moretz. "It has taken some of the pressure off the holiday season."
Today, Summit is only one of a number school districts in the state with policies intended to discourage the giving of expensive gifts, instead suggesting homemade tokens or notes of appreciation. In other districts, policies go so far as to state that the cost of a gift must not exceed a certain amount.
The New Jersey School Boards Association, an 80-year-old organization that represents more than 600 boards, does not have an established gift policy, but according to Mr. Yaple, the association has recommended that boards address the issue of gifts with teachers and staff.
Many boards have policies, in part because districts do not want to give the appearance of favoritism, he said, nor do they want children of less-affluent families to feel bad.
"It can give the appearance of currying favor," Mr. Yaple said. "It might be more difficult to suspend Johnny if his parents just gave a $200 gift certificate to the nicest restaurant in town. It's not really a case of parents trying to buy a favor. They truly care about the teacher and they want to give a nice gift."
Rosemary Yates, who has taught kindergarten in Cherry Hill for 31 years, said: "I appreciate that families want to say thank you. "I don't look at it as a bribe. But if the district discontinued it, that would be O.K. too."
Most of the gifts Ms. Yates has received have been small tokens -- homemade baked goods and knickknacks. Occasionally, she said, she received a gift certificate, the largest one for $25, which she said she felt was more than one family would usually spend on a gift.
In some instances, however, teachers had few qualms about accepting lavish presents.
In 1977, a case even went to the state commissioner of education over a $350 cash gift that a group of high school students in Hillside had given to a teacher. When the school board issued a letter of reprimand to the teacher, the case ended up before Commissioner Fred G. Burke. Ultimately, the commissioner ordered that the letter be removed from the teacher's file because the board did not have a clear gift policy. As for the $350, it had to be used for "general pupil activities."
But the commissioner made clear the state's disapproval of excessive gifts. While teachers could certainly accept flowers or tokens, the ruling stated that larger gifts should not be permitted.
"Any policy in the public schools which would sanction such gifts is one which would invite abuse and promote undesirable competition," the ruling stated.
In the last 20 years, several boards -- including Ramapo Indian Hills Regional, Matawan-Aberdeen Regional, River Vale, Bloomingdale, Freehold Borough, Marlboro Township, Pennsgrove-Carneys Point, Princeton Regional, Glen Ridge and West Windsor-Plainsboro, have enacted policies discouraging gifts that are more than tokens.
The Hopewell Valley Board of Education is also considering a policy that would allow only modest gifts.
In addition, a number of private schools have gift policies. While Moorestown Friends School does not have a formal policy, expensive gifts are strongly discouraged.
But these are not easy policies to enforce, and not all districts publicize their policies on a regular basis.
The public schools in Montclair have a policy that discourage the giving of gifts to school employees, suggesting instead that the "more appropriate" way to show appreciation would be writing a letter.
"I find that parents don't adhere to it," said Kathy Lindsay, assistant principal of Nishuane Elementary School in Montclair, which has 620 pupils in kindergarten through second grade. Ms. Lindsaysaid she also understands that children and parents wanted to give gifts during the holidays and at the end of the year.
"There are two sides to this," she said. "I still have ornaments children gave me 20 years ago. I think of them every year when I take them out. The other side is that not every child can bring something in. There's some poor little soul saying, 'I didn't bring anything for you.' "
Instead, Ms. Lindsay has encouraged parents to make donations to the Montclair Fund for Excellence, which provides grants and scholarships, or to buy a book for the school library in a teacher's name.
She is not the only teacher who is sensitive to the economic differences among the pupils in her class, and to those situations in which holiday giving can make a child feel left out. For instance, in the early 1980's, administrators at the Princeton Regional School District adopted a gift policy prohibiting its staff from accepting anything other than small tokens from students and their parents.
"One kid comes in with a cut-crystal vase and the kid next to her comes in with nothing," said William Cirullo, the principal of Riverside Elementary School in Princeton. "Think how uncomfortable it is for the teacher. It has to be a level playing field. That's critical in the culture of our school. You don't want to put any child in an embarrassing, competitive position. You have to take money out of the picture."
Likewise, the West Windsor-Plainsboro District has also adopted a policy that discourages gift giving and encourages exchanging handmade items or notes.
And in Mercer and Middlesex Counties, according to Gerri Hutner, the spokeswoman for the district, parents sponsor breakfasts and write notes and cards to the teachers during Teacher Appreciation Week.
"The motive behind it is wonderful," Ms. Hutner said. "The lesson is to try to take away from material goods, but it's hard in our society."
The National Parent Teacher Association does not have a policy regarding gift giving, though several local organizations have taken on the issue because members felt that some guidelines were needed. Sometimes teachers initiated the discussion; in other instances, it was the parents.
Last year, when Robin Schlager became co-president of the Nishuane School PTA in Montclair, she and other board members decided to end a program in which $3,000 in PTA funds were spent on gifts for teachers -- each of the 120 employees, teachers and support staff, received a $25 cash bonus before the holiday break.
"I was a little disturbed by this," Ms. Schlager said. "It was nice and generous, but was it appropriate?"
Instead, the organization voted to have a catered holiday luncheon -- which costs from $800 to $1,000 -- in the library. In addition, parents donate homemade desserts, and each staff member receives a roll of gift wrap from the school's fund-raising sale.
Nonetheless, Mrs. Schlager said that gift giving could still get out of hand, even when parents had the best of intentions. In some cases, she said, teachers have received tickets to Broadway shows and gift certificates from department stores.
"The competition is a little over the top, especially in a town like Montclair, where some people have a lot and some don't."
To put a stop to situations like that, the PTA at the Elizabeth Haddon School in Haddonfield adopted a policy two years ago allowing class parents to collect no more than $5 a family once a year for a teacher's gift. In addition, the card must be signed by all the children -- whether or not their families contributed. And money was not to be collected at holiday time.
"Students and teachers alike celebrate different kinds of holidays in different ways," said Jennifer O'Neill, who was president of the group when the policy was voted on. Some classes were collecting at holidays, at the time of teachers' birthdays and at the end of the year, she said, and some collections were ranging from $10 to $14 from each child.
"There are people in our community who don't make whatever that magic number is," Ms. O'Neill said, "and it was a stretch for them."
At the Central Elementary School in the same district in Haddonfield, teachers told parents and the principal that the money being spent on gifts for them could be used to benefit the school.
"They felt the money would be used more productively for classroom enrichment," said Linda Tuno, a former president of the PTA at Central. "It was really teacher-driven."
Four years ago, the PTA at Central agreed to run the Holiday Gift Fund, which is billed as "an alternative way to show appreciation to Central School teachers." Parents send in a donation for any amount and the money is evenly divided among the teachers to be used for classroom enrichment and supplies.
"We had to make clear that it was voluntary, and that this idea did come from the teachers," Mrs. Tuno said. Teachers receive a gift card saying that the family made a contribution, but no amount is listed.
"It takes out 'What do I give, what do I give?' " said Mrs. Tuno.
In Cherry Hill, parents do not even collect money for winter holiday gifts, said Maggie Suender, PTA president at the Russell Knight Elementary School.
"Not everybody celebrates gift-giving holidays," Ms. Suender said. "Our community is becoming more and more diverse. We don't want to put anyone is an uncomfortable position."
And at the Liberty Corner School in the Bernards Township Public School District, Dr. Kathy Pecoraro, the principal, sends notes through the parent teacher organization discouraging gift giving.
"Teachers did feel uncomfortable very often," Dr. Pecoraro said. But it is not a policy that is easily enforced. "Can we stop parents?" she asked. "Probably not. When parents come to me expounding on the excellent quality of teaching, I say, 'Write a letter. Those notes are so precious. They are more powerful than gift giving.' "
Yet some educators feel that limiting or prohibiting the giving of gifts at holiday time can rob the child of the joy of giving -- particularly those who want to surprise the teacher with a holiday package.
In 14 years of teaching elementary school, said Claudia Raffa, a third-grade teacher at the Glenwood School in Short Hills, part of the Millburn Township School District, she has received many beautiful gifts that parents and children used to show their appreciation. She has received 500 pieces of monogrammed stationery, a Dooney & Bourke purse, which sells for about $200, and many gift certificates.
"They are very thoughtful," Ms. Raffa said. "The gifts come from the heart. Teaching where I teach, I know they are doing it because they want to."
She has also received several books for the classroom, and parents have also donated books and magazines to inner-city schools in her name, she said.
"The nicest part," Ms. Raffa said, "is that they are always accompanied by touching notes."
Lois Infanger, who has taught in the Millburn schools for 14 years said, "I've never wished Millburn had a policy." She does not recall receiving gifts that were excessive. "I'm very appreciative, and I don't keep track by any means."
In the past few years, most of the gifts have been store certificates given from the entire class -- usually for under $100, said Ms. Infanger, who currently teaches fifth grade at the South Mountain School.
And at the Friends School of Mullica Hill, "our kids are free to do whatever moves them," said Paula Cera, a parent who works in the school office. Middle school students usually collect money, and teachers receive a cash gift of $75 to $100, she said. "Our teachers are pretty well loved."
Indeed, Sandy Finio, who has taught kindergarten for 14 years at the Mark Newbie Elementary School in Collingswood, a working-class community in South Jersey, said she thought that taking away the practice of gift giving denied a small child the chance to enjoy being the giver.
On the day before the holiday break, she fills the table at the back of the room with craft material. If children come in without a gift, they can go to the table and make something.
"It's the worst feeling when you're 5 years old and you don't have a gift for your teacher," she said. "They are all thrilled to give you something. They will rush back and make a gift. I make a big deal about everything. That's essential. If you could see how much they love it. It has nothing to do with the cost."
An expensive gift would be "inappropriate," Ms. Finio said. But the gifts she has received over the years -- including many that fill the shelves in her classroom -- are mugs, candles, knickknacks and wooden apples. One mother painted the school building on slate and put Mrs. Finio's name on it.
"I've never gotten a Gucci bag," she said. "We're not that close to the Short Hills Mall."
She would rather have the small gift picked out by a child than money collected by a class parent and put into a gift certificate. "The kids have nothing to do with that gift," she said. "Would you give a 5-year-old money for their birthday?"
Because of that, Nancy Connell, whose two daughters go to school in Collingswood, said she had always let the children decide what would be the best way to show appreciation to the teacher. They usually pick a gift, sometimes something edible -- and under $10.
"You don't want to do too much," Ms. Connell said. "There is a fine line you don't want to cross. The kids really want to do it, and that's why we do it. They love their teachers."

Conflicting Rulings On Co-ops

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
A NEW YORK appeals court issued a ruling last month that complicated an already confusing legal situation regarding the rights of tenants who rent vacant co-op or condominium apartments from an original sponsor after the conversion.
In a case entitled Park West Village Associates v. Nishoika, a three-judge appellate court in Manhattan unanimously affirmed a trial court judge's determination that a tenant who rents a vacant co-op or condominium apartment from the building's original sponsor has no right to a renewal lease on the expiration of the existing lease. And while that decision conforms with the opinions of experts in co-op and condominium law, it is directly at odds with a decision rendered in October 1999 by a Brooklyn court of equal standing. 
 In that case, Paikoff v. Harris, a Brooklyn appeals panel ruled that tenants who rent vacant apartments from a sponsor -- even those who rent years after the conversion -- have the right to remain in their apartments indefinitely, provided they are willing to pay market rent. One practical effect of this would be that sponsors would be blocked from selling an apartment that had tenants, since they could not be evicted at the end of their lease.
Lawyers say that the conflicting decisions essentially afford different sets of rights and protections to tenants depending on where they happen to live. "Confusion now reigns," said Arthur I. Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer who is also vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums.
Mr. Weinstein said that the widely held and generally accepted belief among real estate lawyers was that tenants who occupied co-op or condominium apartments in New York City before conversion are protected by Section 352eeee of the General Business law -- also known as the Martin Act -- the state law governing noneviction conversions. Generally speaking, he said, the Martin Act provides that nonpurchasing rent-regulated tenants are entitled to keep their regulated status for as long as they occupy their apartments. Non-rent-regulated tenants who took occupancy of their apartments before the conversion, Mr. Weinstein said, are protected by the Martin Act against increases to more than market rent and cannot be evicted except for cause -- such as nonpayment of rent or illegal use of the apartment.
At the same time, he said, the common understanding among co-op and condominium lawyers had always been that tenants who rented their apartments from the sponsor after the date of the conversion would have no such protection against eviction. As a result, Mr. Weinstein said, sponsors were legally permitted to decline to renew the lease of such a tenant -- and evict the tenant -- when the existing lease expired.
That, however, changed somewhat with the ruling in the Paikoff case in Brooklyn. That ruling, Mr. Weinstein said, essentially created a new class of protected tenants.
"The court in the Paikoff case completely misread the intent of the Legislature," he said. "The Legislature clearly did not intend to create a new class of protected tenants."
The position taken by Mr. Weinstein -- and the many lawyers who agree with him -- was upheld last month in the Manhattan appellate court's ruling. But while that ruling sets forth the law that must now be followed by trial judges in the First Department -- the judicial district that covers Manhattan -- it does not change the law resulting from the Paikoff decision in the Second Department, the judicial district that covers Brooklyn.
In fact, the geography of judicial districts is itself a potential cause of further confusion about which interpretation of the law applies in a given area.
Joel E. Miller, a Queens real estate lawyer, said that since the Paikoff case was decided in the Second Department, which has jurisdiction over Queens and Staten Island as well as Brooklyn, the trial courts in those boroughs will probably feel compelled to follow the Paikoff court's interpretation.
At the same time, he said, it is likely that trial courts in the First Department -- which covers the Bronx in addition to Manhattan -- will apply the interpretation of the ruling reached last month in the Park West case. "In a sense, you could say that the law will be applied in different ways in different places," Mr. Miller said.
Moreover, he said, as a practical matter, the conflicting appellate rulings may not be reconciled anytime soon. That, he said, is because it is unlikely that a sponsor will find it economically feasible to take a nonrenewal eviction case far enough through the trial and appeal process to get the Paikoff decision overturned.
"What's more likely to happen is the sponsor will say, 'If the guy is willing to pay a market-rate rent, why not just let him stay until he's ready to leave on his own?' " Mr. Miller said. He added, however, that a resolution could occur somewhat more quickly if sale prices of apartments in Brooklyn and Queens rise to the point at which it becomes more profitable to sell than to rent.
Marc Luxemburg, a Manhattan co-op lawyer who is president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said that any continuation of the current state of affairs would be problematic for co-ops and condominiums.
"From our perspective, the Paikoff ruling is not a good thing," Mr. Luxemburg said. "What we are most interested in is completing the conversion. And the only way to complete the conversion is to get the building 100 percent owner-occupied."
Colleen McGuire, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer, sees the conflict as a good thing -- at least for tenants in the districts covered by the Second Department.
"At the very least we can keep tenants in their apartments for as long as they are willing to pay market rents," she said. "And at worst, we can use the Paikoff case as a bargaining lever to buy more time in cases where it looks like a sponsor might be willing to take the case all the way up to the Court of Appeals," the state's highest court.

427 Rental Units for Active-Adult Retirement Market

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: WOODBRIDGE, N.J.

 BODY:
A DEVELOPER known for rental properties has broadened his offerings in the active-adult retirement market with a 427-apartment development that will differ from most such communities by allowing residents to lease, rather than purchase, their apartments. The development, Woodbridge Hills, will offer people 55 and over housing as well as social and recreational activities.
Woodbridge Hills is to be made up of 14 low-rise buildings with 23 to 32 apartments each spread over 21.7 acres just off the intersection of Green Street and Route 1. It will also have a 5,000-square-foot clubhouse with, among other things, an exercise room, a business center, an outdoor swimming pool and walking trails, according to Mark Fisch, president of Continental Properties of Woodbridge. It is developing the $45 million project using its own money and bank financing over the next three years. 
 New Jersey, especially Ocean County, has long been a hub for active-adult residences. But they have usually been built as condominium apartments and town houses or as single-family detached homes for residents to buy, not rent.
While new rental projects for those 62 and over are being built in the state, they generally do not offer such social and recreational amenities as clubhouses, which are common in active-adult developments, as well as in apartment complexes without age restrictions. Many rental apartment projects for older people are also restricted to those with low and moderate incomes.
Continental Properties has fused the rental and the active-adult ideas in Woodbridge Hills, which Howard S. Rappaport, a company vice president, described as a hybrid. "It will provide an alternative housing option and fill an underserved niche in the active-adult market," Mr. Rappaport said. "What we will be selling here is lifestyle."
Continental owns or manages more than 10,000 rental units in the state. It has also recently been involved with building active-adult, for-sale, single-family-home communities and has five such projects under way or planned in the state, totaling 973 units.
With the graying of New Jersey, and the nation, demographics continue to fuel the demand for all kinds of housing for older people, including active-adult residences. Of the state's estimated population of 8.1 million last year, 22.5 percent, or 1.83 million, were 55 or over, according to the latest census figures. That number, up from 1.7 million in 1990, is expected to grow to 2.23 million in 2010.
In Middlesex County, 21.5 percent of the 717,949 residents are 55 and over, and in Woodbridge, 20 percent of 97,000 residents are.
While the production of active-adult housing for sale continues at a brisk pace, there are several reasons why a rental alternative has been slow to catch on, industry professionals said. Among them is the difficulty of finding sites that local communities are likely to approve for rentals. Sites also must be able to accommodate a high enough density for such projects to make economic sense given their requisite recreational components, said James Robbins, who heads a housing consulting concern bearing his name in Fairfield.
William Becker, a consultant in Teaneck who specializes in active-adult housing, added that despite the hurdles there was a market for such rentals. There are, he said, "people who don't want to pay the average $150,000 it costs today to buy a home in a for-sale active-adult community," or "don't want to be tied to the house with a mortgage."
Mr. Becker said a rental alternative would be particularly appealing to single professionals, people who have lost a spouse and those who live in another part of the country for part of the year.
Agreeing with that assessment is Nathan Slovin, executive vice president of New Jersey Apartment Association, a trade group in East Brunswick. The idea of active-adult rentals, Mr. Slovin said, is sound because such projects will offer people the flexibility now enjoyed in developments with no age restrictions. "Not everyone in their retirement or preretirement years wants to buy or is ready to relocate to Arizona or Florida," he said.
That the state's overall rental market is strong is also on the side of such a trend. According to the apartment association, the rental vacancy rate dropped by one to two percentage points in the last year to less than 5 percent in north Jersey, excluding urban centers like Newark. The rate is slightly higher in central New Jersey and under 10 percent in South Jersey
IN turn, developers continue to build. Some 7,500 new rental apartments are on the market or will come onto the market in six months, Mr. Slovin said. With active-adult rentals, he said, Continental has found "a different approach to and niche within the industry."
Other developers may follow. Mr. Becker said that builders of the 6,000 active-adult residences under construction or planned in the state had indicated that as many as 1,000 units potentially could become rentals.
Continental Properties got involved two and a half years ago with Woodbridge Hills. Though the project is the company's first development in Woodbridge, it has built rental apartment properties in nearby Edison, Mr. Rappaport said, adding, "We know the area so we pursued the seller of the land."
The seller, Elizabethtown Gas, was winding down its maintenance, distribution and trucking operations on the site, which Continental agreed to buy in 1997. Mr. Rappaport said the property "lends itself more to a rental than a for-sale project" because at 21.7 acres it is too small to accommodate the number of single-family homes necessary for his company's more traditional active-adult projects to work. In addition, it is off Route 1 and not far from both the Woodbridge Center Mall and the Menlo Park Mall, he added.
The company took title to the property in September. It spent the intervening years getting the site rezoned from commercial to residential use and securing the needed state and local approvals.
Woodbridge Hills is supported by the community. It is, James E. McGreevey, the mayor of Woodbridge, said, "a thoughtful project, which largely responds to the need for increased market-rate senior housing in Woodbridge and Middlesex County." He pointed out that there was a two-year waiting list for the income-restricted rental housing run by the Woodbridge Housing Authority.
The project, he added, will offer "an attractive opportunity to help seniors remain in Woodbridge in a more manageable and affordable way" than living in large single-family detached homes and without making, "a complicated investment in real estate." At the same time, Mr. McGreevey said, the project "will not have a deleterious impact" on municipal services like schools or local roads.
The 427 apartments at Woodbridge Hills, designed by Roth Architects of Voorhees, will be in three-story, stone and wood-sided elevator buildings. All the one- and two-bedroom units, with 800 to 1,100 square feet, will be equipped with washers and dryers and wired for advanced telecommunications, including high-speed Internet access. Those on the ground floor will have patios, while upper-level units will have balconies.
The project is expected to attract residents mainly between 55 and 62 and from Woodbridge and Middlesex County, Mr. Rappaport said, adding, however, that it will also draw people from across the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in Staten Island.
Monthly rents are expected to be $950 to $1,100, which will be competitive to rentals not restricted by age in the area, he said. He added that the rents would include the use of the project's recreational amenities, which will be built at the same time as the housing. Initial occupancy will begin by late next spring.
Mr. Robbins, the consultant, said that, while the project's amenities were not grand, the project still "will serve as a litmus test" of what people will be willing to pay in rent for an active-adult style of living.

Ground Is Broken for UConn Football Stadium

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

DATELINE: EAST HARTFORD, Conn.

 BODY:
LESS than a year after the United Technologies Corporation announced that it would donate a 75-acre site here for a new football stadium for the University of Connecticut, bulldozers and backhoes are busy doing site preparation. The the first game is to be played at the stadium on Aug. 30, 2003, against Rutgers.
Construction of the $90 million, 600,000-square-foot, 40,000-seat stadium at 615 Silver Lane began in October on a crisp fall day as the earth-moving equipment waited in the background. 
 "It was a great football day, actually," said Thomas W. Andrea, a spokesman for United Technologies. "I think it made a lot of people realize this is really going to happen."
Matt J. Fleury, a spokesman for the Capital City Economic Development Authority, said, "This stadium is going to elevate the University of Connecticut football program to national prominence." The development authority was formed to oversee development of the stadium and the proposed $771 million Adriaen's Landing mixed-use development project less than two miles away on the Connecticut River in Hartford. "That stadium will be a linchpin to the future economic development in the vicinity," Mr. Fleury added.
Indeed, United Technologies is already considering uses for the rest of Rentschler Field, a 680-acre property that a subsidiary, Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, used as a private airport until six years ago.
Town officials say they have been told that the development will have a mix of housing, stores and possibly a research park, though Mr. Andrea said it is too soon to say.
"We're in the middle of a planning process so it's too early to talk about any definite proposals," Mr. Andrea said. "We don't want to create any expectations until we know exactly what's going in there." But the stadium will be integral to any development, he said.
Town officials said they were hopeful that the stadium, the rest of the Rentschler Field development and the Adriaen's Landing project will help to revitalize the entire capital area.
"We've got a huge parcel down there that's just crying for development and we hope that the stadium is going to be the catalyst that kicks it all off," said Anthony F. Kayser, chairman of the East Hartford Planning and Zoning Commission.
"If anybody had told me five years ago that football would have such a huge impact on my life, I wouldn't have believed it," said State Representative Melody A. Currey, a Democrat of East Hartford. "I never was a terribly big football fan, but I'm learning to like it.
"And when UConn puts a winning team in the stadium, it's going to put East Hartford on the map. Look at what's happened to UConn basketball -- who would have ever thought it would grow to what it is today?"
The only opposition has come from environmentalists who say that the former airfield represents one of the last large grassland habitats in the state. Nine birds on the state's endangered or threatened list were spotted during surveys last summer, and several dozen different species were making it their home.
Patty Pendergast, vice chairwoman of the Connecticut Ornithological Association and an active member of other environmental groups, said that while the birds might survive the stadium construction, further development of the site would push grasshopper sparrows, upland sandpipers and bobolinks off the property.
"East Hartford has some wonderful neighborhoods, almost like a Norman Rockwell painting, and they deserve a big, undeveloped field like that," Ms. Pendergast said. "It's always easier to build in a grassland, in a flat plain like this. Doing the right thing is hard, and the right thing in this case would be to redevelop the blighted areas in town first."
Rentschler Field is named for Fred Rentschler, who founded Pratt & Whitney in 1929. Amelia Earhart and Charles A. Lindbergh, the aviation pioneers,used the airstrip in its early years.
UCONN'S football team now plays in the 16,000-seat Memorial Stadium in Storrs on the school's main campus. It made the jump from Division I-AA ball to the top-level Division I-A this year, which requires a stadium of at least 35,000 seats. The school has obtained a waiver on the seating requirement since the stadium is under construction.
Mr. Andrea of United Technologies said that the company's president, George David, proposed the use of the property last November, after a deal to bring the New England Patriots to Connecticut fell apart. The state had proposed building a football stadium as part of Hartford's Adriaen's Landing project, which UConn would have used, but when the Patriots backed out, the stadium was dropped.
"We're Connecticut's largest private employer, and I think helping the state's largest public university kind of goes hand in hand with that," Mr. Andrea said. The stadium will be known as Rentschler Field for at least 15 years.
Madison Square Garden Inc., which manages the Hartford Civic Center, has been hired to manage the stadium as well, said Mr. Fleury of the Capital City Economic Development Authority.
"Certainly, their experience in the area is a plus, and we think that will create some synergies," Mr. Fleury said. "And their scale and experience as a manager of major venues was very attractive."
The stadium will cost the state almost $70 million, a consultant estimates. He adds that, with attendance averaging 18,000 per game in the first year and growing to 25,000 per game by the fifth year, revenue from ticket sales and concessions will cover the operating cost of the stadium and generate a small operating surplus over the life of the stadium.
Mr. Fleury said the stadium would generate a lot of money in taxes on the meals, lodging and other things people buy when they attend the games.
Mr. Fleury said the state would create an advisory board for the stadium that would include managers as well as town officials and area residents and businesses, to make sure any local issues are promptly addressed. In addition, the stadium will pay $1 million to $1.2 million a year to East Hartford in lieu of taxes, considerably more than the $40,000 the town now gets on the undeveloped land.
Mr. Andrea said United Technologies has retained Urban Strategies, a Toronto concern that has done several planning projects in the Hartford area, to prepare a development plan for the more than 600 acres left at the field. In addition, it has hired the Boston-based Spaulding & Slye for marketing and development work. United States Representative John B. Larson, Democrat of East Hartford, has been advocating a technology park for the site, town officials say, and United Technologies is said to be giving it serious consideration.
Michael P. Kirk, a spokesman for Mr. Larson, said the congressman had brought NASA officials on a tour of the property and was working with other government agencies to promote interest in the project. The proximity to a number of the nation's top universities as well as to the Pratt & Whitney engineering and research operation should be key draws, he said.
"His goal is to develop something that would bring a lot of education, a lot of science and a lot of research dollars into the state," Mr. Kirk said. In addition, the congressman is investigating what federal funds might be available to help in the construction of a research park.
Mr. Kayser, the zoning chairman, said that athough the state project did not need local approvals, that area was already zoned for mixed-use development, so that it was consistent with the town plan. The chief concern is traffic, he said, athough there are plans to eventually tie the site directly into Interstate 84 and Route 2, both major highways nearby, if the development of the property warrants it.
Noise from the site was also an issue, but the stadium will be gouged out of the former airfield, with the playing field 26 feet below grade, so the noise and the aesthetic impact should be minimized.
"They've been very accommodating to the town," Mr. Kayser said. "I think we were generally pleased with the plans."
Craig R. Stevenson, chairman of the town's Economic Development Commission, said the town was hopeful that the development would spark interest in an area that has been bypassed somewhat by Connecticut's economic boom.
"The Silver Lane area, in part, used to be a retail center, but with the opening of some of the suburban shopping malls it's fallen on hard times," Mr. Stevenson said.
The town has just completed a strategic plan that calls for a focus on entertainment-related businesses in the area around the stadium, which could include everything from restaurants to sports centers or an Imax theater, he said. There are about 100 undeveloped acres in the area in addition to the United Technologies land, he said, as well as a number of underused commercial buildings that have potential for reuse.
"The key is going to be to bring in uses that will make it a destination," Mr. Stevenson said. "They're only talking about having 6 football games and perhaps 20 major events a year there, but we want things that will bring people to town 365 days a year. We need people coming back week after week even if there's not a game."

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVE;
At Cooper Square, a New Player Takes the Stage

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
TWENTY years ago -- or 30 or 40 for that matter -- the Cooper Square Committee would have scorned the redevelopment plan for three acres of urban renewal land off East Houston Street that a community task force worked out with the Giuliani administration a year ago. The committee is a nonprofit community development organization that formed four decades ago to resist the redevelopment plans of Robert Moses in the neighborhood.
But the other day Steve Herrick, the executive director of the Cooper Square Committee, said, "It's a good plan" -- not so much a ringing endorsement as a commentary on the impact of Manhattan's real estate market on the attitudes of a group that has been one of the city's leading community advocates for subsidized low-income, as opposed to market-rate, housing. In the years since the city-owned land has been ready for new construction, one problem or another has impeded it. 
 Now, without any additional public subsidies, a plan is moving forward that will produce 700,000 square feet of residential, commercial and community-facility space on this land. It has yet to enter the hearings stage of the land-use review process, but the wide support it has drawn augurs well for its prospects. This support has come despite the fact that in many respects it resembles a plan adopted almost 10 years ago that faltered over community wrangling.
There are to be about 600 new housing units, with 25 percent of them reserved for low-income tenants, plus a substantial 160,000 square feet of retail space and a community center of 30,000 square feet. And the developer is to pay the city $40.5 million for the land.
What might also surprise Mr. Herrick's predecessors as much as the plan itself is that the developer -- or more properly the managing member of the development partnership, formally known as Chrystie Venture Partners -- is new to the New York City scene. AvalonBay Communities, based in Alexandria, Va., is undertaking the Cooper Square project in partnership with Williams Jackson Ewing, a national retail developer based in Baltimore, and Blackacre Capital, a private investment firm in New York City. Phipps Houses, the New York-based nonprofit housing company, will participate as the developer and owner of a portion of the low-income apartments.
AvalonBay Communities is a real estate investment trust that owns 39,600 apartments in 136 developments nationwide. It has developed or redeveloped 23,000 of those apartments only within the last five years. The Cooper Square venture is its second foray into residential construction in the city. The first is the recently started Avalon Riverview, the second phase of development at Queens West on the East River in Long Island City.
Avalon Riverview will be a 32-story rental building with 372 market-rate apartments, a 130-car garage at the base, and 10,000 square feet of shops. Adjoining it will be an eight-story element with 80 apartments for the elderly, built with federal subsidies.
It is unusual for a national real estate company to undertake residential development in New York City, and even more unusual for it to take the path of bidding for a city-sponsored proposal. For most such companies, the major capital investment required at the beginning of a process of uncertain duration and outcome seems daunting. Companies experienced in the vagaries of New York City development are normally the only participants.
But the attraction is the chance to own new rental property in a market that is unlikely to become oversupplied with it. "Our strategy is to focus on the strongest markets," said Bryce Blair, president of AvalonBay. "The markets with the strongest constraints on supply over the long term will be the healthiest."
The phrase "constraints on supply" alludes to the difficulty of winning full site control and public approvals, and in multifamily development already completed or put into construction in the metropolitan area AvalonBay has had its share of these difficulties. It has completed projects within the last two years in Bronxville and Mamaroneck in Westchester County; in Nanuet in Rockland County; in Fort Lee, Jersey City and Florham Park, N.J.; in Melville on Long Island; and in Danbury and Stamford in Fairfield County, Conn. Currently in construction are a 412-unit 25-story building across the street from the Metro-North railroad station in downtown New Rochelle and a 408-apartment four-story complex on the Hudson River in Edgewater, N.J.
The approach it takes is to hire local figures to head its regional offices. The man chosen to head the New York office is Frederick S. Harris, 49. Mr. Harris is the former vice president of the Trottwood Corporation, which was the managing partner of M. O. Associates, the development entity that built Citylights, the co-op that was the first building in Queens West.
THROUGH the acquisition of the Dreyfus Corporation, the mutual fund company, and the outright purchase of other partnership interests, the Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh came to be the principal partner in M. O. Associates. After Mellon decided in 1998 to withdraw from the Queens West project, the state's Empire State Development Corporation chose AvalonBay to build out the unbuilt site that Trottwood had already been awarded as well as two additional sites. And Mr. Harris went to work for AvalonBay.
"In the higher-income Connecticut towns Avalon even had to litigate to get the right to build its sites because there was so much local opposition," Mr. Harris said. "Here in the city the barriers to entry are different. It's all about capital and evaluating neighborhoods and the sheer stamina it takes to get big projects done."
At Cooper Square it seemed 10 years ago that a mixed-income project might go forward, with the support of the Cooper Square Committee. But local controversy over certain aspects blocked it, and eventually the city's financial support was withdrawn. But now the increased rents obtainable for market-rate apartments, and particularly the greatly strengthened rents obtainable for commercial space, have come to the rescue.
Following the guidelines in the Department of Housing Preservation and Development's public bidding process for the land, AvalonBay will preserve the two community gardens that have been long-term fixtures on the north side of East Houston Street east of Bowery. The city's requirements also included the 30,000-square-foot community center and the preservation of a former church on East First Street as a cultural facility.
Twenty-five percent of the apartments -- 155 out of the 618 total -- will be chosen by lottery from applicants earning no more than 60 percent of median income in New York City, which on the basis of current federal statistics of median income would mean that a family of four could have an annual income no higher than $34,000. Phipps Houses is likely to hold the lottery in early 2002, and occupancy is likely in the latter part of that year.
For its market-rate apartments, AvalonBay expects rents upward of $2,400 a month for a one-bedroom and $3,600 for a two-bedroom.
The design and architectural plan is the work of the New York office of Arquitectonica, an international firm that was founded in Florida in 1977 and became known in its early days for a flamboyant condominium in Miami called the Atlantis, in which a 37-square-foot cube was cut to create a 10-story interior skycourt. Bernardo Fort-Brescia, a founder of the firm, is the chief architect for Cooper Square.
"It's a true in-fill site," Mr. Fort-Brescia said. Its four irregular parcels stretch from the midblock between Bowery and Second Avenue south of East Second Street across East Houston Street to the midblock between Bowery and Chrystie Street. The plan calls for integrating the four new structures by extending a mapped but undeveloped street called Extra Place, now little more than an alley on the north side of East First Street. Extra Place will serve as north-south pedestrians-only spine for the four sites, providing shopping in a variety of retail stores.
The housing will be built to comply with the height and bulk standards called for in the citywide unified-bulk zoning plan that the Department of City Planning has drafted. Although the proposed changes are not final and neither Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani nor the City Council has embraced them, Cooper Square may serve as something of a showcase for the planners' intent.
South of Houston Street on 60,000 square feet of land there is to be a mixed-use building, no portion of which will be higher than 14 stories. It will have more than 100,000 square feet of retail space along Houston Street, plus the community center, with a full-sized basketball court and a swimming pool, at the lower levels.
On the 36,000 square feet behind the community gardens north of Houston Street there is to be a structure with six-story and nine-story elements on either side of Extra Place. And north of East First Street, two smaller buildings will provide the rest of the apartments.
"Everybody is basically pushing for this plan," said Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, who served on the task force that worked it out with the housing agency. "It answered our concerns. Everybody gets something out of it if it goes forward essentially as the task force suggested."

HEADLINE: As Cable Rates Rise, So Do Complaints

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN 

 BODY:
FOR almost 20 years, Allen Fritz of Dix Hills has watched in frustration as his Cablevision bill has increased. He has toyed with the idea of switching to a satellite television system before, but on Nov. 21, when Cablevision announced that it would raise its rates again in January, he decided to consider such a move more seriously.
"I'm paying $95.64 a month now, and I know I can save about $50 a month by going to a satellite dish," said Mr. Fritz, who sells watches. "With the rate increase, I'll be paying more than $100, so I'm going to switch or at least check it out. Satellite TV gives you receivers for two sets, and you pay extra for additional sets. But I'm paying extra now for additional cable boxes." 
 Besides, he said, of the 84 channels he gets from Cablevision, "I watch maybe 10 of them."
"Satellite gives you a wider selection," he added. In fact, the number can run into the hundreds of channels, depending on the plan and the provider.
Bill Powers, a spokesman for Cablevision, the Island's only cable provider, said that the January rate increases would average 6.6 percent. But about a third of Cablevision's 788,000 customers on Long Island -- those who subscribe to its most popular package -- will see their rates jump 12.6 percent, from $35.71 a month to $40.21. Those affected subscribe to what Cablevision calls its family or expanded basic service, which offers some 60 channels.
Subscribers to Cablevision's basic service, about 5 percent of its customers. will see rates go up even more -- 13 percent, Mr. Powers said. The new charges will be $9 to $11.92, depending on location.
On the other hand, the rate for the most expensive Cablevision package will decrease slightly, from $79.95 to $78.05 or $79.05, depending on location. The price of the Optimum Preferred package will remain the same, and so will the charge for Cablevision's broadband Internet connection.
In the last few years Cablevision, which is based in Bethpage, has raised its rates steadily. In 1998, the average increase was 7.5 percent; in 1999, 4.58 percent; and in 2000, 5.16 percent. In comparison, the Consumer Price Index for the New York City area increased by 4.2 percent in the same period.
Mr. Powers gave several reasons for the latest Cablevision increase. "The rate adjustment is primarily due to large increases in programming costs, about 15 percent this year," he said. "In addition, fuel costs for our large fleet of vehicles, as well as repairs, is up by about 50 percent. And manpower costs in a very tight labor market are also up."
He also cited "increases in operating costs, investments for customer service and network improvements to enhance system reliability," along with new channels added in 2000, including Animal Planet, Speedvision and Soap Net.
Mr. Powers said that Cablevision subscribers would be notified of rate increases for their individual plans within the next month.
Mark Cooper, the director of research at the Consumer Federation of America in Washington, took issue with the increases.
"This is what unregulated monopolists do," he said. "There is nothing out there to discipline their pricing, and so they figure that price increases that are two or two and a half times inflation are what they can get away with."
Others argue that cable television services are not monopolies because satellite systems provide an alternative.
Frank Petrone, the Huntington Town supervisor, said that his office had already received many calls protesting the Cablevision rate increase. He did not estimate how many complaints had been received. One resident complained that his Cablevision bill would be "higher than his town tax bill," Mr. Petrone said. "People are very unhappy, and we're going to forward their complaints to Cablevision," he added. "I have seen more of an outcry over this increase than I have in prior years."
A spokeswoman for the Town of Hempstead said that there had been two complaints so far but that more were expected as Cablevision subscribers received their notices.
A spokesman for the Town of Oyster Bay said that the town had received a "couple of complaints" and that callers had been asked to call the Public Service Commission, which can order adjustments.
In Huntington, Mr. Petrone said that he had asked the town attorney to look into the matter. "The early indication is that we don't have any regulatory authority over this," he added. "Cablevision has a 10-year franchise with the town that was renewed four or five years ago. We give them the right to come in and operate. We are concerned with the service they provide. We want to see that we have state-of-the-art equipment and service that is no less than any other town. We also deal with problems associated with cable to see if it is continually out."
These days, governments have limited oversight of the cable television industry. In 1984, Congress pre-empted local communities in the regulation of cable rates, and last year it deregulated the entire industry, said Mr. Cooper of the consumer federation, a nonprofit umbrella group for some 260 consumer organizations.
The spokeswoman for Hempstead said that the town was considering whether to ask the Public Service Commission to conduct a rate review.
Edward Collins, a spokesman for the commission, said that it had a say-so only on rates for basic cable service, not for premium packages. And he added that the agency would be reviewing Cablevision's new rate.
Edward Siegmann of Mattituck, the vice president of the Southold TaxPac, a private lobbying group, and a longtime Cablevision critic, said that when Cablevision announced rate increases in November 1999, he and others met with company executives to protest the $4 increase in basic service.
"They listened to our argument and took it off," said Mr. Siegmann, a retired brewer. "But a short time later, they added it to the cost of family service. If they don't get it one way, they get it another."
He said that he and others had also complained that Cablevision's local news channel, Channel 12, was not available on the basic plan. He said subscribers must sign up for the next tier of service to get it.
"They have us in a corner because there is no competition," he said. "We thought there might be competition from the telephone company, but it hasn't happened."
But there are two major satellite TV systems competing on Long Island, DirecTV and EchoStar Communications, whose service is known as the Dish Network. In both cases, subscribers have to buy or rent a small satellite dish, 18 or 20 inches in diameter. The companies handle the installation.
DirecTV, with headquarters in Hawthorne, Calif., charges $21.99 a month for basic service with some 45 channels. Gina Magee, a spokeswoman, said the most popular plan costs $31.99 a month and gives subscribers about 100 channels and access to 50 pay-per-view and audio channels.
With EchoStar, based in Littleton, Colo., monthly charges begin at $29.99 for 70 video channels and 30 audio channels. Subscribers who want to see local television stations pay another $4.99 a month.
Ms. Magee said she did not know how many subscribers DirecTV had on Long Island, and neither did an EchoStar spokeswoman. SkyTrends in Golden, Colo., a market research, data collection and reporting service for the home satellite industry, said that New York State had 737,951 direct-to-home satellite subscribers on Oct. 1, but it did not have separate figures for Long Island.
Maureen J. Hirsch of Bay Shore had both DirecTV and Cablevision for two years. When she moved recently to East Patchogue, she decided to subscribe to Cablevision exclusively.
Mrs. Hirsch said she initially wanted DirecTV because of the extensive sports coverage it offered. Her husband signed up for two sports packages, she said, and the premium package she bought gave her about 700 channels, including "every movie channel imaginable."
"I got a lot of channels, but unless you sit in front of the TV 24 hours a day, it's not cost-effective," she said. "My bills were $200 a month, but I was not watching any more TV. It was not worth it."
"Picture quality on DirecTV was better," she added, "but the weather kept interfering with it. On days when it was raining hard or if there was a lot of ice outside, it went out."
But Mr. Siegmann of Southold TaxPac said he would switch to satellite TV if he could. The reason he doesn't, he said, is that the tall oak trees that surround his house would interfere with the signal.

If Walls Could Talk, Here's What They'd Say

BYLINE: By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
ONE afternoon last week Randy O'Neill, the customer-service director for Lancer Insurance in Long Beach, was getting ready to drive out to Farmingdale to visit Paul Gatto's studio. Mr. Gatto was putting the finishing touches on an oil painting that Lancer had commissioned of an antique Mack bus. Mr. O'Neill wanted to take a look, because if the painting passed muster (and it did), Mr. Gatto would strike a limited series of 2,000 lithographs for Lancer.
"It's all got to be in our customers' hands by mid-December at the latest," Mr. O'Neill said a little nervously. 
 The customers Mr. O'Neill was talking about are some 1,500 owners and operators of small bus fleets across the country, and if the past five Lancer commissions are any indication, the lithographs will end up hanging on the walls of the customers' offices.
This year, Mr. Gatto painted a 1909 Mack bus against the backdrop of Jackson Square in New Orleans. Mr. Gatto works in a style that might be called "bus terminal semi-realism," evoking the slice-of-life paintings Norman Rockwell once produced for The Saturday Evening Post.
This year's painting will take its place on the wall of the insurance company's second-floor lobby and work area, joining a growing corporate art gallery. Most of the 13 canvasses already displayed are renderings of vintage buses, the predecessors of the 30,000 vehicles Lancer insures today. Some of the paintings, especially those done in the early 1990's by the late Mort Rosenfeld focus more on the passengers, mechanics and drivers, all depicted in a style reminiscent of Edward Hopper.
Last year Mr. Gallo painted a Greyhound Sceni-Cruiser pulling ahead of a Tucker sedan in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco. Clients receive not only the lithographs but a written description chock-full with vehicular details.
The Medici behind this artistic renaissance is Lancer's president, Dave Delaney.
As Mr. Delaney sees it, the substantial expense involved in the paintings and lithographs -- an estimated $250,000 so far, not counting staff time -- serves a distinctive marketing purpose. "It isn't cheap, you know, but it shows our commitment to the industry," he said. "We stand out more than if we just send calendars every year like everybody else. It's become a tradition."
The company strives to ensure every historical detail is accurate when commissioning the painting. A small team -- Mr. Delaney, Mr. O'Neill and several other executives -- debate each year's proposed subject, and once the subject is decided, then they collect old photographs to provide historical detail. Sometimes the team hires a freelance photographer to make additional photographs; sometimes they pay for the artist to go out and see the bus first-hand.
Two years ago, the collection came down from Lancer's walls and was shipped to Houston.
"We have a booth at the annual United Motor Coach Association trade show, and instead of giving out the usual brochures, we created an art gallery on the show floor," Mr. O'Neill said. "It was very popular. We got quite a few leads out of it."
A growing number of businesses are now aware of the impact that their decor has on both visitors and employees, and they are working with designers and architects to maximize that impact, said Michael Mannetta, the director of design at the Spector Group, an architectural firm in North Hills.
"The moment someone walks into your lobby, they get a message about your company based on a variety of factors," said Mr. Mannetta, a partner in the firm. "On a subconscious level, you're communicating what kind of experience someone can expect from your company, and that expectation is going to shape whatever business relationship you go on to have."
The designer's job is to work with the client in refining the message the client wants to communicate and then to translate that message into design, layout and furnishings. Lighting, color, materials and decorations are major components in the message, Mr. Mannetta said.
Bright lighting, light colors, a sense of space and natural plantings connote creativity, openness and a sense that the company's sensibility is progressive, Mr. Mannetta said. The use of wood, especially dark wood, and darker colors tend to convey the image of stability, reliability and trustworthiness, he added.
"Advertising firms are likely to emphasize the creative end of the spectrum, the desire to appear cutting-edge," Mr. Mannetta said. "A law firm tends to prefer the darker colors that convey solidity and suggest 'We've been around a long time, and you can expect us to be around for a long time.' "
Office decor also sends a message about the company's attitudes and expectations. "You walk into an office that's really cutting-edge in terms of design, where it's clear that much time and money have gone into the design and construction, and that tells you quite a bit about the company," Mr. Mannetta continued. "If you're a prospective client, you get the sense right away that you would be dealing with a business that spends what it takes to accomplish its goals. That sends a message about what kind of fee structure will be in place; they probably will charge on the high end of the market.
"Similarly, if you're a prospective employee, you get the sense -- without a word being said -- that this is a company that appreciates the finer things. You sense that you will be asked to contribute accordingly and to be paid accordingly."
At Harbor Industrial Park in Port Washington, Sam Kliger has come up with an innovative solution to the "how do I decorate my office" problem: he covered the walls with framed shopping bags from his clients. As the president of Kliger Weiss Infosystems, Mr. Kliger sells data-processing services that help retailers track sales and inventory. Every time he gets a new customer, Mr. Kliger asks for a shopping bag. They are framed against a matte black background and displayed at eye level.
Currently, about 100 bags festoon the walls, including those from Kenneth Cole, Montblanc, Panasonic and the World Wrestling Federation.
"When a prospect comes into my office, or a client, they look at the wall, and right away they know who I do business with," Mr. Kliger said. "It makes quite a statement."
The art gallery also serves a second purpose: to motivate employees and to promote customer service.
"I want to remind my employees that without those companies up there on the wall, you're nothing," Mr. Kliger said. "We're in a professional service business. Everything we do is for the clients. The bags keep the clients' names in front of them all day long."
But not all the bags show the client off to best advantage. The reason, Mr. Kliger said, is not aesthetics but economics. "Look," he explained. "It's price-sensitive. You go to Armani, you get a beautiful bag. You go to Wal-Mart, you get a junky bag."

HEADLINE: Reading, Writing and . . . Work? Not Always

BYLINE: By ADAM BOWLES 

 BODY:
CAROLINE BENNETT of New London, an 18-year-old student at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, is unabashed about the reason why she does not have a job despite annual expenses of more than $10,000 in tuition, fees and room and board. "I'm lazy," she said.
But she offered a better excuse for many of her friends from her dormitory who are spending the semester without campus jobs: they don't need the money and would rather study to get better grades. 
 "A lot of people don't have jobs, and it's not because there are not jobs to be had, but because they don't need to," she said. "If people can afford to not work during the actual school year, then they are not going to. I think people are getting paid more during the summer. And their parents have good jobs."
The state's lowest unemployment rate since the mid-80's -- 2.4 percent -- has not only made it difficult for many businesses to fill openings. Colleges, which rely on student labor for many jobs, are also having a hard time. UConn has had to scale back its shuttle bus service because it can't find enough student drivers. The checkout lines at the Wesleyan University library in Middletown are longer because fewer students have applied to work there. And Albertus Magnus College in New Haven has turned to temporary employment agencies to fill clerical jobs traditionally held by students.
"We've offered cash and other incentives," said Janet Freniere, manager of transportation services at UConn. "We've been to every job fair. But the kids don't want to work. With the supposed wonderful economy that we have, I can imagine that a lot of the parents are saying: 'Go to college. Concentrate on your academics. Don't worry about it, we'll take care of you.' "
Education officials said that wealthier parents and lazier students were only part of the problem. The tight labor market has also forced many companies to increase benefits and wages, so students can find higher paying jobs off campus.
"I would assume many students are getting jobs off campus for more than minimum wage," said John Tirinzonie, director of job development for the Connecticut Department of Labor (minimum wage in Connecticut is $6.15 per hour). "Companies in private sectors have the opportunity to offer more money to students than what many of the colleges and universities can afford to pay."
One example is Stop and Shop in Middletown. Clinton Mattis, a customer service manager at the grocery store, says whenever he gets desperate for workers he takes a five-minute drive to Wesleyan and posts job notices inviting students to come work for him.
Many of them do, and lately word of mouth has been all the advertising he needs. Most student jobs at the university pay minimum wage, so with a starting salary of $6.45, some limited health benefits and flexible work schedules, Mr. Mattis does not have many problems attracting students.
Neither does Cynthia Galle, owner of Neon Deli just outside campus, who employs 25 Wesleyan students. She says they like working for her because she offers a flexible schedule, she takes them out to dinner for the holidays and gives them birthday money. Her starting wages are $6.25 an hour and she pays up to $8. "They get to eat free, and that's big for the guys," she added.
Sarah Kozinn, 21, a senior at Wesleyan, works the cash register and makes sandwiches at the deli. She said her parents and grandparents were paying her college expenses (tuition alone is more than $25,000 a year) and she needed extra cash only for things like movie tickets.
"It's not a matter of survival," she said. "It's more a matter of pleasure. I've worked on campus before, at a lab, but here you can create your own schedule, and that's kind of convenient."
Nowhere does the struggle to find student workers appear to be greater than at UConn.
Ms. Freniere, the manager of transportation services, says she desperately needs nearly 30 student bus drivers to add to her 55-person work force to keep up with additional routes created by recent campus expansion.
The labor squeeze has forced Ms. Freniere to shut down several routes and to reduce the number of campus shuttles to just one on some routes, a major inconvenience with many of the parking lots far from the campus center. So she did what a lot of colleges have had to do: she raised salaries.
Last year, Ms. Freniere bumped entry-level wages up to $7.15 an hour from $6.45, to give her a $1 cushion above minimum wage. Once a student receives a commercial driver's license, the salary increases to $8 an hour. Student assistant managers can earn as much as $12 an hour, but even that will increase next year to at least $13.
Gerald Weller, director of dining services at UConn, is also feeling the need for student workers. If all 13 dining halls on campus were fully staffed, he said, there would be 500 part-time student workers. This year there are about 350.
"We're competing against this robust economy," he said. "I think everybody assumes that. It puts a burden on the full-time staff."
Mr. Weller says problems from the labor shortage aren't significant, though he says that earlier in the year some dining halls closed an hour earlier for lack of staff and a small food store at one dormitory has not opened because it doesn't have the help it needs. While he typically struggles for the first six weeks of the fall semester to fill student positions because students are still living off their summer savings, this year the "six-week rule" grew by a few weeks.
Yale University in New Haven is also having a problem. Thomas Conroy, deputy director of public affairs at the university, said it had job shortages in library services, dining halls and the student employment office.
"Sometimes it's not an issue of fewer students who want to work, but students who are working fewer hours," Mr. Conroy said. "For some of them, they don't need the money."
At Trinity College in Hartford, Carolyn LeGeyt, the assistant director of financial aid, said that total student earnings through a federal work-study program on campus are 48 percent lower than what they were last year, something that hass been happening for three year The program links financial aid students to jobs on campus.
"Students are either working half the time they did last year or half the students are working," Ms. LeGeyt said. "In some cases they may have worked really hard over the summer and have enough to carry them over, or in some cases they are being supplemented by their parents."
Ms. LeGeyt said some departments on campus had voiced frustration over the lack of student response to their job postings.
Rachel Cheng, associate university librarian at Wesleyan, said competition among campus departments for student workers had intensified in the last couple of years.
"Everybody wants to get good students," Ms. Cheng said, adding that openings at the library means it takes students longer to check out books.
Michael Serpe, director of communications at Albertus Magnus, mentioned several offices that were resorting to temporary agencies for workers.
"If we try to find a student to do work part time in our administrative offices it's substantially more difficult than five years ago," Mr. Serpe said. "Students aren't sitting around anymore. They're working at Circuit City or somewhere."
To be sure, some colleges in Connecticut report the opposite problem: they have more student applicants than they do have jobs.
Dean Golembeski, communications director for the Connecticut State University System, which includes Eastern, Western, Central and Southern, said none of the system's campuses were having difficulty filling student jobs this year.
Patricia Nielson, director of career services at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, said the majority of jobs awarded on campus were part of the federal work-study program. Ms. Nielson said students found it convenient to stay on campus and work and that flexible work schedules gave them more time to study and socialize.
Mike Yagid, a 19-year-old Quinnipiac student, works in the career services department. Mr. Yagid said he could easily earn $10 an hour with a job off campus, which would be $2 more than what he earns now.
"Most of my friends work on campus," he said. "The ones who do work off campus complain about it because it's so hectic and because of the commute. For my needs, working on campus is perfect."
At Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Julie Savino, dean of financial aid, said there were 600 work-study jobs on campus and more than enough students to fill them. She has to turn students away. Ms. Savino added that other private sector services on campus, like dining services, also reported no hiring difficulties.
William Alpert, an economics professor at UConn, says it is all a matter of need. "Students from lower income parents are going to have lower wage expectations and probably have higher revenue needs," he said. "They are going to take jobs whether they are on campus or off campus."
At colleges where the labor crunch has hit the hardest, officials are developing strategies like higher salaries, cash bonuses and free meals to food-service employees to attract students to job openings.
At UConn, Dolan Evanovich, associate provost for enrollment management, said the university had lifted the wage cap for student workers, mostly managers, from $10 to $20 an hour in the last year. There are 5,000 students on the university payroll.
Mr. Evanovich says it is difficult to entice students because many want jobs that are directly related to their career goals and shun service jobs like washing dishes.
At St. Joseph College in Hartford, Phil Malinoski, director of financial aid, said starting wages for work-study jobs on campus had increased from minimum wage to $7 to be competitive with off-campus jobs. Five years ago, the college had a waiting list of students looking for jobs. This year some departments have had to do without the office help. "Certainly we benefit from student help," he said. "But we don't want to be in a position where we couldn't survive without students."
Mr. Alpert, the UConn economics professor, said students may soon be heading back to work.
"You have had higher incomes for most of the 90's and parents are now footing the bill," he said. "But have no fear -- the economy is turning down and student labor will be back. This is a transitory problem."

Aquarium On Verge Of Change

BYLINE: By BILL KENT 

DATELINE: CAMDEN

 BODY:
Strictly speaking, the $59 million New Jersey State Aquarium, a state-financed tourist attraction on the waterfront that draws about 500,000 visitors a year, is not for sale.
That said, someone might soon acquire everything in the aquarium but its name, as well as six acres of waterfront real estate, public financing and a loan if an agreement to build an entertainment complex next door is reached. 
 This seems to be where the bargaining chips are falling as as very closely held meetings continue between Coopers Ferry Development Association, a nonprofit agency overseeing Camden's waterfront development, and Steiner & Associates of Ohio.
Tom Corcoran, the president of Cooper's Ferry, said in an interview that although negotiations began in April, shortly before the expiration of an exclusive development option granted by Cooper's Ferry to Kravco, a Pennsylvania shopping mall developer, there was still no signed agreement.
Mr. Corcoran said he anticipated a formal announcement of Steiner's plans for the Camden waterfront by February. Officials from Steiner declined to discuss its plans.
The deal is part of a 20-year plan by Cooper's Ferry that will pump about $500 million in new development in and around the Camden waterfront by 2010. The organization has been responsible for the construction of the aquarium, the One Port Center office building, which houses the Delaware River Port Authority, directly east of the aquarium, as well as the E-Center entertainment arena, Wiggins Park, the Camden Children's Garden and docking and visitor facilities for the battleship New Jersey.
In addition, Cooper's Ferry expects to announce within the next several months that it has reached an agreement with a Philadelphia developer for a $50 million residential conversion of the RCA Nipper Building by 2003.
In November, the Delaware River Port Authority released $320,000 to Cooper's Ferry to cover Steiner's costs in developing site plans.
Mr. Corcoran said that Steiner's plans for the waterfront featured a $50 million to $60 million addition to the northern side of aquarium with four or five exhibits, an IMAX theater and a mix of restaurant and retail shops. The addition would be paid for "mostly by Steiner, though some public funding may be used," he said.
The addition would occupy six acres of state-owned waterfront land extending north from the aquarium to Market Street, where a $26 million aerial tram would link the site to a retail and restaurant complex on the west bank of the Delaware River at Philadelphia's Penns Landing, scheduled to begin operation in 2003.
"This is not a privatization by any means," Mr. Corcoran insisted, though he said that Steiner would get a "management presence" at the aquarium "over all phases of the operation."
"If you're going to ask someone to spend that much money to improve a facility, you have to give them a voice," he said.
He declined to say if Steiner would retain the aquarium's current executive director, Brian Duvall, or any of the aquarium's 100 full-time employees in Camden as well as at the Ocean Life Center in Atlantic City.
The aquarium sits on land owned by the state, and is managed by the New Jersey Academy for Aquatic Sciences, a nonprofit organization that includes representatives from the governor's office and the city.
Under the current proposal, Steiner would also be able to raise the aquarium's admission fees.
"Given the size of this facility, and increase in time that visitors will spend in it," Mr. Corcoran said, "it's likely that there will be an increase in admission fees."
He said Cooper's Ferry decided to negotiate with Steiner because of its success with entertainment complexes in Florida, Ohio and Kentucky, where it had built a waterfront aquarium that was an anchor for additional commercial development.
"It's a good quality aquarium," said Brian Duvall, executive director of the aquarium. "They've done a good job out there."
Mr. Duvall, the aquarium's third executive director since its opening in 1992, added that he was not opposed to sharing control with a retail entertainment developer.
"We've worked very hard to act as an anchor for development," Mr. Duvall said. "There is no way we'd be looking at significant and positive development opportunities on the waterfront if this aquarium had not been as successful as it is. An outside developer would have funds to build exhibits using new technologies that were not available when the aquarium opened. The whole idea that you're going to bring someone in to takeover an operation for money-making possibilities is ridiculous."
Still, not everyone shares Mr. Duvall's optimism. Mike Devlin, executive director of the Camden Children's Garden, the four-acre, $8 million outdoor garden and amusement area that opened on the aquarium's southern side in July 1999, said he was "extremely concerned that we haven't been included in any of these negotiations."
"I've been hearing almost since we opened that the state wants to privatize the aquarium," Mr. Devlin said, "and it's got me worried because the future of the garden is eminently connected to the future of the aquarium."
Under a five-year agreement with the Camden City Garden Club, the Children's Garden's nonprofit sponsoring organization, a single ticket provides admission to both the aquarium and the children's garden. The institutions share receipts from tickets sales, though the aquarium determines how the receipts are divided.
Mr. Devlin said that visitors had been complaining about ticket prices since they were raised a dollar in July to $12.95 for adults and $9.95 for children under 12. In addition, when the aquarium raised its ticket prices, the proceeds to the garden were also reduced, to $499,000 from $624,000 for fiscal year 2000, ending June 2001.
"Right now we're drawing on some of our other dollars to keep going," Mr. Devlin said. "It is causing a financial hardship."
Moreover, he added that security provided by the aquarium had become lax. "There have been examples of vandalism and theft, more than we'd like to have seen."
As for the aquarium itself, though the price of admission was raised and a submarine simulator exhibition -- supposed to open at that time -- is still under construction, the facility is having a comparatively good year. In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2000, it attracted 527,777 visitors, up about 10 percent from the previous year. The aquarium drew the fewest visitors in 1995 (446,315), and the most in its first year, when 831,793 people toured the complex.
About a third of the aquarium's $11.9 million operating budget comes from admissions ($3.7 million in the last fiscal year). Another third comes from the state ($3.2 million). The rest is made up from sponsorships, food sales, facility rentals, private grants and educational programs.
Stephen Schilling, a developer who is building a $24.5 million minor league baseball stadium on the waterfront across from the site, said he shared Mr. Devlin's concern over being excluded from the negotiations.
"But I am absolutely in favor of anything that will bring more people and new business to Camden," Mr. Schilling said. "I hope Steiner goes go forward with what they've planned. The fact that a credible developer looked at Camden means that other credible developers will also look at Camden. Myself, I'm not done looking at Camden."

MORE MILLIONAIRES

BYLINE: By Karen DeMasters 

 BODY:
The number of millionaires in New Jersey nearly tripled between 1993 and 1998, rising from 3,000 to 8,310, according to the Statistics of Income report issued by the state Division of Taxation last week. Based on a review of 1998 income tax filings, the report found that incomes in the state's wealthiest counties, Morris, Hunterdon and Somerset, grew by about 60 percent over that period, while incomes in the poorest counties, Hudson, Cumberland and Atlantic, grew by 30 percent. The number of people or families making less than $10,000 a year decreased from 1,020,964 to 718,748. The millionaires make up 0.2 percent of the population and account for nearly 12 percent of the state's income, while the bottom 10 percent of earners make 1.7 percent of the income. Karen DeMasters

Illuminating Christmas
 
Q.: I understand that electric Christmas tree lights were introduced in New York City. When?
 
A.: Historians generally credit Edward H. Johnson, the vice president of Thomas A. Edison's electric company, with the introduction of the lights, in the rear parlor of his New York home, in 1882.
The 80 hand-wired, hand-blown glass bulbs were wrapped in red, white and blue crepe paper, and twinkled and blinked as the tree twirled around. A reporter from a Detroit newspaper described the tree as "most picturesque and uncanny . . . it was brilliantly lighted with many colored globes about the size of an English walnut and was turning some six times a minute in a little pine box." 
 It was only three years after Edison produced his incandescent bulb, and mere weeks after his Illuminating Company of New York City, the nation's first commercial power station, opened at 257 Pearl Street.
Victorian consumers were as mistrustful of electric lights as they had been of candles; for years they remained costly, hazardous and bothersome. General Electric acquired Edison's light bulb business in 1890 and began selling tree lights in the 1900's, $12 for a box of 28.
In 1903, the Ever-Ready Company of New York began mass-producing strings of lights. Prices for the electric lights soon dropped markedly, and by 1920 candles were fading from use. The first electric menorahs appeared after World War I.
 
5-Plus Avenue
 
Q.: An additional boulevard, between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, was once mapped out for Manhattan. What became of the plan?
 
A.: Since it was first approved in 1811, Manhattan's grid plan has proven impervious to all but a few attempts to improve on it. One occurred in 1910, when Mayor William J. Gaynor, astounded by the automobile traffic he saw snarling Fifth Avenue, called for a broad new thoroughfare to be carved out of Midtown, just west of Fifth Avenue.
The new avenue, which was to stretch from Eighth Street to Central Park, would be 100 feet wide, and would cost, by the mayor's calculations, $40 million. Though the street would require the demolition of hundreds of buildings, Mayor Gaynor was convinced that property owners would willingly finance the scheme, since their back lots would be transformed overnight into high-priced real estate on a principal avenue.
Many motorists preferred Fifth Avenue because it was free of street railways and freight traffic from the waterfront. Traffic on the street increased eightfold between 1885 and 1913, while that on Broadway only doubled. A study found that rush-hour pedestrians on the avenue traveled at approximately the same speed as cars.
While the public considered the proposal, newspapers printed cartoons depicting the mayor scooping up buildings with a shovel. The plan was mostly ignored after he was wounded by an unemployed dock worker in summer 1910, and when the mayor died three years later it was completely forgotten. In 1911, the architect Henry Rutgers Marshall suggested a broad, gently curved boulevard linking the old Pennsylvania Station with Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street. It, too, was quickly forgotten.
 
Lincoln in Brooklyn
 
Q.: There is a log-cabin-like structure at East 93rd Street and Flatlands Avenue in Canarsie. Is it real?
 
A.: Yes, according to Marty Cohen, a manager at Fillmore Real Estate, whose offices are in the little cabin. The log house is "at least 100 years old," he said, and was an ice cream parlor in the 1940's and 50's. DANIEL B. SCHNEIDER

HEADLINE: Millburn Should Develop Businesses Suited to It

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Regarding "Been Up so Long It Looks Like Down" (Nov. 19), about empty stores in downtown Millburn, it would be easy to assume that the presence of an upscale mall in Short Hills or the many discount stores along Route 22 have caused commercial property to go unoccupied in Millburn. But a more thorough analysis would lead one to conclude that it is a lack of vision on the part of downtown landlords and merchants and of the municipal government that are the real problems. 
 Millburn is now involved in an effort to reinvent itself. The cries most often heard are "Why can't we be like Maplewood Village or Madison?" or "Why can't we get a big box store in here to draw people to the downtown?"
The only chance for progress is for the various parties to acknowledge the downtown infrastructure with all its limitations. This certainly did not happen under the last Downtown Alliance study proposal that actually wanted the city government to condemn certain parcels to add more commercial space. What Millburn can do is build upon the assets it does have, like brokerage operations and financial institutions. Perhaps we cannot get college students from a nearby campus to stroll in without cars, as Madison and South Orange have done, or create the downtown ambience of Maplewood Village, but if various parties would look to make buildings "smart" buildings, then perhaps we can attract more of the type of businesses that would compliment what is already downtown. This may regenerate downtown, or at the least bring us a cybercafe. As for the abandoned Saks site, it would be terrific if the use could be redirected to a residential one, or perhaps a satellite campus for a higher learning institution, but that may be
hoping for too much.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK PARKS;
On the West Side, Who Will Pay to Make Room for Green?

BYLINE: By KELLY CROW 

 BODY:
Efforts to create a park out of a parking lot on the Hudson River have hit rough waters, and the problem, as usual, is money.
In one corner is Circle Line, the cruise company, which has 17 years left on a lease to park cars on Pier 84 at 44th Street and on land to the south. In the other corner are backers of the Hudson River Park, a five-mile swath of green from Battery Park City to West 59th Street. 
 Circle Line left the Pier 84 lot in June and has agreed to give up its lease on the other lot so long as parking is provided nearby. After much haggling, the company and Community Board 4 came up with an idea: build a deck for cars on top of the World Yacht offices at Pier 81. (Circle Line owns World Yacht.)
"It was definitely a trade-off," said Pam Frederick, co-chairwoman of the board's Waterfront and Parks Committee. "But if we hadn't compromised, that section would have been a big parking lot while the rest became a park."
It may still, though, because the board thinks Circle Line should pay for part of the $3.5 million deck, said John Doswell, the committee co-chairman. The deck would, after all, provide 136 spots at $15 a day, primarily to the one million tourists who ride the Circle Line each year.
But Tom Fox, a Circle Line consultant, said the company never agreed to pay, because the pier and parking lot are city-owned. he said the bill could go to the Hudson River Park Trust, the government agency building the park. Or use federal highway money or the Economic Development Corporation, he said.
"The park is already short-funded," said Mr. Fox, who once oversaw the trust. "Let's be creative here."
Connie Fishman, the trust's vice president, said she liked the deck idea but couldn't spend park money on a parking lot. "The most important thing," she said, "is that we're not going to wait 17 years to design this part of the park."
On Thursday, the trust selected Richard Dattner & Partners as architects and Miceli Kulik Williams & Associates as the landscaper. The two companies will design the park from 25th to 59th Streets. That choice renewed the community board's hopes, and at its Wednesday meeting members plan to again ask the trust to help negotiate a deal.
For now, their paradise remains a parking lot. KELLY CROW

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BENDING ELBOWS;
An Actor Awash in Ambition and Merlot

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LEDUFF 

 BODY:
He stood in the portico awash in light cast by a flickering gas lamp. It was raining, and his jacket did not quite fit. He had come from an audition. He had already had a few glasses of wine and apologized for it.
"There's nothing more important than Europe," he said for the first time that evening. He would say it many more times before the night was over. He would say it for the last time when the club closed, and the doorman asked him to go out, into the rain. 
 The meaning of this opaque phrase would grow murkier over the course of many drinks, but one must make allowances. George Demas is an actor, a man whose motivations and appetites lie at the bottom of a dark well.
He has appeared in the short-lived "Escape Artist" by Michael Lawrence and "Master of Monstrosities" by Edgar Oliver, the East Village Poe. He is considered more than respectable at his craft, but acting has yet to pay his rent.
What his years in alternative theater have earned him is a candidacy at Players, a club in Gramercy Park that was founded in 1888 by Edwin Booth, the brother of Lincoln's assassin, for men of the stage, the letters and the arts. Its hallowed halls have been graced by the presence of notables like Mark Twain, Lauren Bacall and Paul Huber, a character actor and great-uncle of Mr. Demas.
He is hoping that along with admission to the club will come all its privileges, hobnobbing with directors and producers who might change his business address from Off Off Broadway to On.
But there is a predicament here. The greatest role played by Mr. Demas is that of a lover of wine and song. And in the stodgy environs of the Players Club, allowances are few and respectability is paramount, and Mr. Demas finds his candidacy under subtle scrutiny.
The good pledge does make an effort at decorum. The other evening, he spent his more sober moments in the downstairs parlor expounding on the greatness of ancient Greece, the philosophy of psychosis and this canned peach, "Theater is infinitely more powerful than film."
But soon the ghosts stole up on Mr. Demas and he found himself standing in the drizzle of the second-floor balcony, a glass of merlot in hand. His father, it seems, was a top midshipman at the Naval Academy who, as a young man, shook the hand of President John F. Kennedy. After a term in the Navy, the father went to Harvard, and then became a successful economist, businessman, inventor and husband.
The genius the son pursues is much less measurable.
"I would just for once like to make my father proud," Mr. Demas said into the long cold evening. "If I ever win the Oscar."
And then it was back to the parlor for a game of billiards, another glass of wine and a splintering rendition of "I've Got to Be Me," which is an honorable sentiment for an actor but possibly a questionable one for an aspirant to the Players Club. CHARLIE LEDUFF

I'll Tell You My Sins, but Not My Salary

BYLINE: By DANIEL AKST; Daniel Akst's column tilts at conventional business wisdom and appears the first Sunday of each month. E-mail: culmoney@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THERE was a time in the distant past when topics like cancer and pregnancy were taboo in polite company. Thankfully, those days are long gone. So isn't it time to break one of the last and most unwarranted conversational taboos of all?
I mean the one about money. Oh, people talk endlessly about investing and so forth, but they are truly tight-lipped about how much money they have and how much they earn. The durability of this taboo is remarkable, given the readiness of so many Americans to talk about their sex lives, substance abuse, tortured upbringings and so forth -- and not only to their friends and acquaintances, but also on television and radio. 
 Economists might say that people talk openly about these formerly private matters because they derive utility from doing so. It raises their status in the social marketplace, and sometimes even raises cash. Tell-all memoirs are a staple of best-seller lists.
Unfortunately, in this paradise of openness, people have yet to realize how much it is costing them not to talk about how much they earn. And their silence creates market inefficiencies that benefit only one set of people -- their employers.
The lopsided distribution of knowledge in favor of those who buy labor puts the sellers of that labor (read: working stiffs) in a poor position to obtain the highest prices for their services. A company, after all, knows what it pays all its workers, and probably has a better idea of what people elsewhere are making, too. (The human resources department, whatever else its failings, is a valuable source of market data in this regard.)
As workers, however, you and your colleagues are locked into the same code of silence, so you really have no idea.
Many people think that keeping quiet about their pay lets employers pay them more for good performance without fanning the resentment of jealous colleagues. In fact, it is just the opposite: keeping one's pay a secret makes it easier for the company not to adequately reward superior performance. Clever employers make sure that each worker thinks that he is making more than everyone else -- a notion that is difficult to disprove without a free discussion of pay.
A contrasting situation is seen in Major League Baseball, where compensation is highly correlated to a player's perceived value. Team owners bid feverishly for free agents, and there is surprising openness about the pay that players ultimately receive. When Paul O'Neill, the Yankees' talented but aging right fielder, recently signed a one-year deal for $6.5 million, the terms were published in the sports sections of newspapers.
Nobody is embarrassed by this kind of openness, and it doesn't cost the players money. On the contrary, it probably leads to higher overall salaries, even if to greater differences between the salaries of superstars and journeymen. But even the second group is probably better off.
In the average workplace, however, it should not be surprising that the employer is the main beneficiary of the code of silence, because it is the kind of social rule that makes sense only for the rich. It is a handy way to exclude not only those who aren't rich (you know the old saw -- if you have to ask, you can't afford it), but also those who have grown rich by dint of their own efforts.
But the persistence of this taboo is bizarre, given that financial information in general has become so widely known. Consumers routinely disclose their earnings in credit applications, and modern databases make it possible for various strangers to find out all about your finances. The only people from whom such information seems to be a secret are your friends, co-workers and, often, family members.
EVEN they may have it soon enough, however, because obtaining such information gets easier all the time. Web sites like www.domania.com, for example, will tell you what you or your neighbor paid for a house. You can estimate your date's earnings at www.salary.com, by entering an occupation and ZIP code. So what's the big secret?
For many people, the reason is embarrassment; they may feel guilty about making so much by doing so little. Others feel badly about making so little, compared with what they think their friends and former schoolmates are making. Some people even fear abduction, even though ransom kidnapping is extremely rare in this country and almost never successful.
But if you fear that you may become prey for bloodthirsty telemarketers, relax. Those people already know all about you.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK UP CLOSE;
The Business Class of 2000 Decides It's a Lucky Number

BYLINE: By SETH KUGEL 

 BODY:
There's Gallery 2000, a jewelry store on Fordham Road in the Bronx, which opened in 1990. Within just a few blocks are Mirage 2000, Gold City 2000 and Diamond District 2000, all jewelry stores that have opened in the last decade.
Elsewhere in the city there is Design 2000, Destination 2000, Digital 2000, Pediatrics 2000 and 2000 Auto Electric Company. There is even Class 2000, an escort service that urges Yellow Pages readers, "Let us take you to the next millennium!" 
 These New York businesses, and hundreds of others have hit on the once-clever gimmick of tacking millennial cachet to an otherwise ordinary name. But now that the millennial year has come and is going, will they change their names?
The question startled Jose Guzman, an owner of Salon 2000 on St. Nicholas Avenue in Manhattan, not to be confused with Salon 2000 on Nereid Avenue in the Bronx.
"I'm thinking of getting rid of the name," Mr. Guzman said. "The name I'm considering is . . . ." He paused, pointing to the worn orange facade that displays the current name in purple lettering, Salon 2000 de las Estrellas, meaning Salon 2000 of the Stars.
Edward Chen, a Taiwanese immigrant who owns Cafe 2000 on the Upper West Side, said he chose the name in 1994 because he "wanted to have my store go to the millennium." He plans to keep the name.
"The year 2000 is not the last year of the 20th century," he explained. "It's the first year of the 21st century."
But Joe Amrhein, founder of Pierogi 2000, an art gallery in Williamsburg, has already printed a 2000-less sign to reflect the new name for his business: Pierogi.
In 1983, David Zelman named his SoHo home furnishings business Prologue 2000. "We chose the name," he recalled, "because we were doing things that I hoped would be an introduction to the way people viewed the world in the year 2000."
For corporate purposes, the business kept its original name, but for the consumer the future is Prologue. Since last year, the store has used the one-word name for the public.
On Fordham Road, the jewelry business is so good that no one thinks a change is needed. An employee of Mirage 2000, who identified himself only as Mohammed, said he was saving to start his own jewelry business, which he planned to call Millennium 2000. Is he afraid its name will be outdated before it opens? "No," he said. "Everyone that has a 2000 name does good business." SETH KUGEL

HEADLINE: TALKING MONEY WITH SEBASTIAN JUNGER;
From 'The Perfect Storm,' A Passage to Financial Freedom

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

DATELINE: TRURO, Mass.

 BODY:
THE winters of 1992, '93 and '94 here on Cape Cod were some of the coldest on record. Temperatures hovered in the 20's and low 30's, winds cut to the bone and local residents bundled in.
But Sebastian Junger, who was hard at work writing "The Perfect Storm," often let the temperature in his parents' modest summer house here drop into the shiver zone. 
 "The deal I made with myself is that if you are at the desk working, you can turn the heat on," said Mr. Junger, sitting again in the spartan bedroom where he had written the book, the true story of six fishermen who lose their lives battling a ferocious storm. Published in 1997, "The Perfect Storm" was an overnight sensation.
His mother worried about those living conditions. And a girlfriend who came to visit turned on every baseboard heater in the house, an act that Mr. Junger said was "for revenge."
"The house was just steaming," he recalled.
But Mr. Junger pressed ahead with his arrangement, which both encouraged him to work and kept him from wasting energy. "It was some kind of New England Calvinist thing," he said in a recent interview. "It kept me working a lot. The rest of the house was freezing. If I wasn't working, the heat went off.
"Most of the time, I wore a big overcoat. I wore a hat in bed. It was very cold. If I tracked snow into the kitchen, it would be there for weeks."
Mr. Junger, quite well off today, was not broke then, either. "I wanted a really focused and solitary life for a couple of years," he said, dressed in jeans and a slightly ratty wool sweater. When he needed money, he added, he returned to a job he had held occasionally in the past -- the dangerous but lucrative work of cutting down trees that hang over people's homes. The job, which involved climbing trees perhaps 90 feet tall, tying down the limbs and then chopping them off, paid well: $200 to $1,000 a day.
These days, Mr. Junger chops trees only when he wants to. "The Perfect Storm," whose paperback version is still on the New York Times best-seller list after 129 weeks, brought him a bonanza.
Although Mr. Junger would not say specifically, sales of the book and the film rights have generated around $4 million before taxes, according to his agent, Stuart Kriechevsky. Mr. Junger's advance was $35,000 for the hardcover, but sales of the book reaped close to $2 million in royalties in the United States alone. He split a $1.2 million fee for the paperback rights with his hardcover publisher, W. W. Norton. He received $500,000 for the film rights -- though the movie, by Warner Brothers, also became a blockbuster; it has grossed $323 million worldwide.
Mr. Junger puts his net worth at about $1.5 million. That sum has prompted him to invest for the first time and to change just a few spending patterns -- his biggest indulgences being an investment in a Manhattan bar and a home here on Cape Cod.
These days, Mr. Junger makes his living as a journalist, earning as much as $20,000 for a magazine article. And there are occasional speaking engagements, although he donates most of the honorariums to a charitable foundation that provides educational opportunities to children of workers in the maritime trades.
MR. JUNGER'S financial windfall sounds magical, but it was a long time coming. "I have been working since I was 20, and I'm 38," he said. "I actually once averaged out what I had made over my professional life. I think I could have made that much as a waiter or an insurance salesman. You know, I spent so many years in my 20's making $10,000 a year. When I realized that, it put this whole thing in a sort of different perspective."
Although his handsome, angular face, his intense blue eyes and his mystique as an adventurer (an articulate one, at that) have won him various marriage proposals on his book tours, he has remained single, without many obligations.
Yet he has clung to some puritanism. If anything, he is less interested in his finances than he was before becoming a best-selling author. As a journalist, he accepts only the assignments he wants. That has led him to cover human rights issues in places like Bosnia, Sierra Leone and Afghanistan, where he recently worked on an article for National Geographic Adventure about Ahmad Shah Massoud, the military commander who opposes the Taliban, the Muslim group that controls Afghanistan.
"It's fun to have money, but the more money I get, the less interesting it becomes," he said. "If you don't have very much, you have to think about it. If you are starving, you become interested in food. If you are struggling to pay the bills, money becomes tragically important. I don't have to worry about money again. The idea of putting five minutes into it is not appealing."
Well, maybe just five minutes. "It is not under a rock somewhere," he said of his financial bounty. "I have a financial adviser."
Through his accountant, Mr. Junger met Richard Wald, a financial consultant at Merrill Lynch who now manages his portfolio.
Mr. Junger's mandate was simple. "I told my broker: 'Just don't lose it. Keep up with inflation,' " he said. "But even if I lost it, I could just write another book."
Staying within those constraints, Mr. Wald said he had invested 35 percent of Mr. Junger's portfolio in tax-free municipal bonds. The balance is in equities, weighted heavily toward brand-name stocks like Cisco Systems, Merck, Citigroup and America Online, he added.
Like many other people, Mr. Junger finds finance numbingly dull. He said he did not know how he had done as an investor. "There is a graph, and it has gone up," he said nonchalantly. But this year, Mr. Wald says his client is down 3.4 percent, after gaining 27 percent last year.
Mr. Junger does not read the financial pages and says he has no desire to educate himself about the market. Asked what stocks he owned, he thought for a moment. "I don't think I know a single one," he answered.
"The stock market goes up or down, whatever," he said. "It will all come back around. If there were some horrendous crash, it would make me notice, but I don't need the money, so I could ride out a 20-year cycle. It's not like I am about to send a kid to college and I need $10,000."
ALTHOUGH "The Perfect Storm" did not deal with large social causes, that is where his interests are now. He wants to write about themes related to the environment or human rights, because "they affect the human race," he said. "The others are just human drama," he added. "That's why I don't write about mountaineering. It just doesn't matter if anyone climbs another mountain."
His journalistic priorities, however, have not led him to set strictures on the kinds of investments that Merrill Lynch can make. "I don't mean to sound idealistic, because it is not," Mr. Junger said. "It is just deeply uninteresting to me."
But his penchant for risky assignments has had at least one impact on financial planning. He has a new will. "I forced him to update his will," Mr. Wald said. "He seems to love going to these faraway places. He's not a guy who goes to the Caribbean."
Still, Mr. Junger's newfound wealth has turned him into something of a foodie -- he often goes out to restaurants. While writing "The Perfect Storm," he said, he shopped for groceries and ate at home. But he said he had not been to a grocery store since he moved to New York in 1995, after completing the book.
And he has twice spent bundles of money for personal reasons -- moves that may ultimately prove smart financially. In October, he closed on the $470,000 purchase of a 1780's farmhouse on nine acres here in Truro, adjacent to a national preserve and near his parents' summer house. "It met my criteria," he said. "It had to be old and isolated."
Through Mr. Wald, Merrill Lynch helped him to arrange a mortgage that covered the entire purchase price and was collateralized against his assets. "That way, he didn't have to sell stocks and trigger capital gains taxes," Mr. Wald said.
Earlier this year, Mr. Junger and three friends from the New York media industry put up about $360,000 to start the Half King, a bar on West 23rd Street in Manhattan that is a gathering spot for journalists and other writers. Mr. Junger contributed one-third of the investment. Though the project was overseen by one partner who had already owned a bar, Mr. Junger and his friends helped, too, particularly in the weeks before the Half King opened in July; the work included menial tasks like carting debris to the dump. Because of Mr. Junger's involvement, the bar has garnered plenty of publicity.
For Mr. Junger, the Half King was "a place to hang out socially."
"The thing about the bar is that in some very crude sense, there is a community, and this is the place where it happens," he said. But he is also proud of its financial success. "It's doing very well," he said. "We are making a profit, and we will pay back the initial investment early next year," which is on target.
TODAY, Mr. Junger is a bit less puritanical in his home life in New York, too. Last year, he moved from a two-room rental on East 3rd Street to a three-room apartment further south, on Rivington Street, that rents for $2,500 a month. Still, the place has the simplicity of a college dormitory. There is a mattress on the floor, a makeshift desk, a kitchen in chaos, no television set and a William Butler Yeats poem pinned on the wall. That is about as luxurious as his life gets.
The best place to find testimony to Mr. Junger's fame may be in the barrage of e-mail and phone messages that clog his computer and flood his answering service daily. Many are from television and radio programs, asking him to be a guest, particularly to discuss human rights issues. Recently, he was on ABC's "Nightline" to talk about civil-war violence in Sierra Leone, the subject of one of his articles in Vanity Fair.
As Mr. Junger tells his life story, he has never shared middle-class goals. As a child, he was fascinated by Indians, and his room in Belmont, a Boston suburb where his parents still live, remains filled with bows and arrows he made. He would often slip down a rope from his second-floor bedroom to spend the night in the woods. "If it was a cold night, I wanted to see whether I could keep myself warm," he said. "I wanted to test myself."
As a teenager, Mr. Junger said, he never measured himself by the girlfriends and fast cars that were the hallmarks of his peers' efforts to show that they were adults. "The problem with that is it doesn't prove anything," he said.
At Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., where his major was cultural anthropology, Mr. Junger had two roommates who planned to go into finance. They would ask him what he expected to do when he graduated, but he said he could not remember his response. An early resume included construction work, waiting tables and even cleaning beauty parlors. "That paid pretty well," he said, "about $20 an hour."
At the time, he had a contempt for business -- and still takes a somewhat dismissive view of it. "There are these people who work in the corporate mill," he complained. "They hate it, but they say to themselves, 'I can work very hard so I can retire at 40 and play golf.' "
He acknowledged some exceptions to his description of business as a grind. "Rich really seems to like what he does," he said of his broker, sounding somewhat skeptical.
Still quizzical, he added: "Who wants a life of ease? And who wants a life in the office that you hate, and who wants to play golf?"
Of the tame challenges that Mr. Junger despises, golf is the epitome. To him, it represents the antithesis of the personal risks faced by the fishermen in Gloucester -- or even by tree cutters. "One of the reasons I picked golf was the clothing and those words -- 'birdie' and 'bogey,' " he said, examining the roots of his distaste. "How can a grown man play a game with those words?
"I met a man who had been a sword-boat captain and had had an incredible career," he recalled. "He was in his late 40's, had a house in the suburbs and a wife and two kids. He said, 'I'm really looking forward to my golf game.' I couldn't understand how the two things could co-exist in one person -- a guy who had loved the sea life for 10, 20, 30 years. Golf is so tame."
MR. JUNGER'S parents never pressed him to become more mainstream. His father, Miguel, received a doctorate in applied physics at Harvard but turned down an offer to teach there. Instead, he started a consulting firm in applied physics, doing extensive research for the Navy.
Sebastian's mother, Ellen Sinclair, is an artist. Her work, mostly landscapes, hangs both in Mr. Junger's New York apartment and in the house on Cape Cod.
As Sebastian, ever the grand romantic, looked for the ultimate challenge after college, he found that writing appealed to him. So he roamed around the country, writing about things that caught his fancy. He once went with a friend to Presidio, Tex., a small town on the Mexican border.
"The border area is dicey," he remembered. "It was full of illegal aliens and drugs. I had a station wagon and slept out in the desert with an ax, just in case." He turned the experience into a 1991 article he sold to The Gamut, a literary journal.
In his late 20's, unable to support himself writing, he met a man in a bar who offered him a job chopping down trees. "It fulfilled all the criteria for a rite of passage," he said, "in terms of doing something that frightened me, that I was then proud of."
At a tree cutter, he showed some financial skills. "I would bid for a job, say $3,000 for three days," he explained. Then he would hire a carting company to clear the debris he left behind; he paid it $600 and kept the difference. That way, he never had to pay for insurance, which was expensive. "I was covered because the other company was on the property," he said with glee.
The experience generated his idea to write about people who risked their lives to earn a living. Mr. Kriechevsky, his agent, said he took him on because "Sebastian was writing about working people in a way that I didn't see other writers doing."
"He wrote about them with a real respect for physical work," Mr. Kriechevsky added, "and an interest in it."
After a newspaper article about the disappearance of a fishing boat off Gloucester piqued his interest, Mr. Junger submitted an outline for a book in 1992 to his agent, then went to Bosnia to work as a freelance radio journalist. Soon, he received word of a $35,000 advance from Norton and returned to work on the book.
Its eventual success, while letting Mr. Junger choose his assignments, has not led him to risky choices in investments. "In part," Mr. Wald said, "the portfolio is conservatively allocated because Mr. Junger doesn't need to take enormous risk to increase his capital."
Mr. Kriechevsky said Mr. Junger would probably receive royalties from "The Perfect Storm" for the rest of his life. The book has been published in 22 languages and 24 countries.
AS Mr. Wald recalls his first meetings with Mr. Junger, "I tried to teach the basics of Investing 101, like, 'Don't put all your eggs in one basket.'
"We opened a pension plan, because he had nothing in terms of retirement money," he added. "And each year we put in the maximum."
Each quarter, he and Mr. Junger review projected income, part of it from a contract with Vanity Fair for two articles a year. "We have a gentlemen's agreement," Mr. Junger said. "It is nonexclusive, but I offer them the ideas first."
Because Mr. Junger's income from writing and royalties is more than he needs to live on, Mr. Wald has money to invest, including gains from his client's investment portfolio.
Of course, if Mr. Junger marries, his lifestyle and spending habits will change. "We never speak of it," Mrs. Junger said, sounding like most mothers. Then she paused and said, "But I have a friend who is a psychic who told me that he will fall in love when he is 40 and get married immediately."
Mr. Junger appeared quite startled by that news, which seemed to amuse him. "I hope I get married one day," he said.
Maybe Mr. Wald should start buying the zero-coupon bonds that parents often use to pay for their children's education.

HEADLINE: STRATEGIES;
Two Paths to Profit From the January Effect

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT; Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a newsletter based in Annandale, Va. His column on investment strategies appears every other week. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
BELEAGUERED technology-stock investors are consoling themselves that the January Effect -- the celebrated tendency of all stocks, especially small-capitalization ones, to perform well as the year begins -- should be particularly good to them next year. After all, popular wisdom holds that the previous year's biggest losers should be among the biggest January gainers.
Until recently, market scholars questioned that popular wisdom, but new research suggests that the technology investors are on solid ground in expecting a January bounce. The reason is tax-loss selling. At year-end, as investors look for losses they can use to reduce their tax bills come April 15, they sell their losers. Because those sales must be completed by the end of December to have the intended effect, there is abnormal selling pressure on such stocks. 
 That selling, of course, comes to a halt by Jan. 1. The January bounce is largest for stocks with small market valuations, because they are most likely to be held by individuals rather than institutions, which have fewer tax-related incentives to take year-end losses.
Until this new research, many scholars had dismissed tax-loss selling as a cause of the January Effect, preferring various other explanations. They noted that the January Effect exists even in countries that have no capital gains tax, and therefore no tax incentive to sell losers before the end of the year. To be sure, that does not completely disprove the tax-loss selling theory, since the January Effect in such countries could come from year-end selling by foreigners who do pay capital gains taxes.
But the new study, which will appear in the February 2001 issue of The Journal of Finance, shows convincingly that even if tax-loss selling is not the sole reason for the January Effect, it must be counted as a prime cause. The authors -- James Poterba, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Scott Weisbenner, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign -- devised an ingenious way to make their point: They studied whether changes in American capital gains tax laws over the last four decades had any impact on the January Effect. The answer, they found, was yes -- offering clear evidence in favor of the tax-loss-selling theory.
Consider what happened in the late 1980's, after the holding period for long-term capital gains was increased from 6 to 12 months. Before that change, year-end selling pressure affected mostly stocks whose losses occurred after July 1; only for such stocks, of course, would selling to capture losses have the greatest tax benefits. In January, these stocks therefore rebounded the most.
After the lengthening of the holding period, investors could use year-end selling to capture losses that occurred at any point during the year. That explains how the January Effect became just about as pronounced for stocks whose losses occurred in the first half of the year. And all such stocks tended to rebound in January.
So it would appear that technology investors can reasonably expect their stocks to outperform the market next month. Unfortunately, if you are not already holding such stocks, it is difficult to devise a trading strategy to profit from the seasonal pattern. According to Richard Roll, a professor of finance at the Anderson School of the University of California at Los Angeles, the January Effect, on average, is smaller than the transaction costs of buying and selling the stocks. Mr. Roll reached that conclusion after measuring the January Effect for even the biggest losers over previous years; he found that that bid-asked spreads between buyers and sellers are just as large as the January Effect on such stocks.
NOT that knowledge of the January Effect is useless. If you are already planning to sell some stocks over the next month or two, incurring transaction costs anyway, you should consider selling only in late January --after the January Effect has given a boost to the market.
Similarly, if you are already planning to buy stocks over the next month or two, you should do so before the end of this month. And you might want to focus on stocks that have been among this year's biggest losers.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
Unfortunate Timing, No Matter Who Wins

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
IF a bad economy can break a president, then this is not the moment to become president of the United States. The economy is clearly faltering, on all fronts. What we are experiencing is no brief dip, to be followed soon by a fresh surge of activity. America faces a dry period -- long enough, perhaps, to taint the next chief of state, whether he is Al Gore or George W. Bush.
There is plenty of political baggage in a slowdown at this moment. Bill Clinton took office in 1993 just as the economy was finally growing stronger. If George Bush had been re-elected, the upturn probably would have happened anyway. Instead, he received the blame for the slow growth years that preceded the Clinton administration, and now his son vies for the presidency just as the economy slows again. 
 The Democrats, of course, had taken such pride in the booming expansion. They had counted on it to elect Mr. Gore. And now Mr. Clinton is leaving office just as the expansion may be unraveling. "There is no question that we are looking at moderate growth going forward," said Martin Baily, the chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers.
Nearly every statistic proclaims the slowdown. Autos, housing, computer sales, capital spending, corporate profits, consumer confidence, factory production, store sales, income, job creation, stock prices -- all have weakened in recent weeks. And merchandise has piled up, encouraging companies to cancel orders if sales do not revive soon.
Responding to the changing mood, forecasters are beginning to scale back their estimates of economic growth to less than 3 percent over the coming year. In doing so, they are bringing their estimates in line with the Commerce Department's latest, shrinking numbers. The gross domestic product, the standard measure of how much the nation is producing, expanded at an annual rate of only 2.4 percent in the third quarter, the department announced last Wednesday. That was the slowest quarterly growth in four years.
Suddenly, the debate has shifted from how rapidly the economy can expand without raising the inflation rate to whether a slowing economy will keel over into recession. Or whether the slow growth, like water torture, will persist for months, hurting the next president as unemployment gradually rises and wages stagnate. "The stock market is so bad," said Richard D. Rippe, chief economist at Prudential Securities, "that there is a tendency on Wall Street to assume there will be a hard landing, a recession."
That is not the sort of talk that the economists advising Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush care to engage in. Until the presidency is settled, they are not taking calls from reporters, thus avoiding the risk of saying something that might trip up their leaders. When the subject came up at a Dick Cheney news conference last week, he said, vaguely: "I am personally not an economist, but it is a subject, clearly, that's of interest to us."
The pitfalls that could tip the economy into recession are plain enough. During the good years, stock prices rose beyond reasonable measures of corporate value. Simultaneously, both companies and consumers piled up debt to pay for their spending. So far, neither the falling market nor the record debt levels seem to be turning off consumption or halting investment. Still, bad news, day after day, eventually takes its toll. Just as spending soared, a pullback could be equally excessive. History offers more than a few examples of irrational exuberance followed by irrational pessimism.
Prosperity is not the only thing at stake. Political reputations are also in play. Clinton administration officials insist that their policies turned a rising economy into a booming one. They argue that the 1993 tax increase, coupled with the president's decision to hold back on public spending, pleased bond traders -- holding out to them the prospect of a disappearing deficit and less inflationary pressure.
As the economy boomed, bond traders did not insist on pushing up interest rates in expectation of rising inflation. And Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, gambled successfully that the economy could expand more rapidly than in the past without more inflation. So he let the boom proceed without raising rates.
There is truth in these explanations. But if Mr. Clinton and Mr. Greenspan deserve some of the credit for the boom, they almost certainly will get some of the blame for allowing the excesses to develop that now threaten the economy.
Business cycles have a life of their own, of course, and a perverse sense of humor. A persistent slowdown, or a recession, during a Gore presidency would be hard for Mr. Gore to explain without tarnishing his old boss. And a similarly weak economy with Mr. Bush in office would visit on the son the same unhappy reputation that has saddled the father.

Practicing What Free Traders Preach

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THERE was something oddly symmetrical about the way the people on both sides of the barricades commemorated the first anniversary of the Battle of Seattle last week. Protesters who helped make the global trade summit a disaster hailed their triumph with a pep rally, where one street leader proclaimed that Seattle meant "no more business as usual" for trade ministers. They showed a feature film that eulogized the anti-globalization uprising.
But trade ministers are having their own bacchanal. The United States announced the opening of free trade negotiations with Chile, just a week after beginning talks with Singapore, a month after wrapping up a free trade agreement with Jordan and two months after signing a trade accord with Vietnam. And many analysts think the Clinton administration is lagging its foreign rivals. 
 The European Union just sealed a free-trade agreement with Mexico. European nations are also talking about eliminating tariffs and most trade barriers with Brazil and its neighbors, and they are considering the same arrangement with Central American nations -- a step ahead of Uncle Sam.
In the Pacific, there is a free-trade frenzy underway. Japan began bilateral free-trade talks with South Korea, Singapore and Mexico, the first time since World War II that Japan has tried to loosen restrictions on trade outside a global agreement. China, on ther verge of entry to the World Trade Organization after a long fight, one-upped Japan with a proposal that the entire East Asian region become the world's most populous free trade zone.
One reason for the rush: trade itself is having a banner year. John F. Kennedy was president the last time the flow of goods and services across borders increased as fast as it is set to grow this year -- a 12.5 percent rate, according to new World Bank projections. Every nation wants a bigger piece of the trade pie.
But if the momentum toward freer trade is clearly stronger than the backlash against it, there's also a sense in which the Seattle crowd can claim success.
The flurry of two-way and regional trade talks belies the failure to start a global round of negotiations to replace the one that collapsed in Seattle. The agenda is still in dispute, and there are practical concerns, like finding a venue willing to accommodate the expected demonstrations.
There's more at stake in global summits than when nations hand pick negotiating partners. Only the broader talks force all nations to address the most politically sensitive questions: subsidies for farmers (Europe, Japan), protections for textile workers (United States), standards for labor and the environment (developing world). The regional agreements are like warm-ups for the championship round.
But it is also notable that the events that were supposed to make people slow down and think twice about economic integration have done nothing of the sort. The Asian financial crisis, if anything, unleashed more trade and prompted greater harmonization of economies there. And the Seattle spectacle has simply prompted trade ministers to push tariff reductions in private talks.
Not unlike crisscrossing military alliances in the pre-World War I era, the proliferation of trade agreements is part of world diplomacy -- the way nations talk to each other. Europe uses trade to retain influence in Latin America, which Brussels feared would focus exclusively on Washington after Nafta. China's trade push reflects its ambition of becoming Asia's leading nation. Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Vietnam are wary of that trend.
"These free trade agreements are a question of how nations look at their strategic positioning," said Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative. "People don't want to be cut out, not just because of commercial disadvantage, but because these are spheres of influence."
That reality poses an acute challenge to Ms. Barshefsky's successor. The domestic politics of trade have become increasingly poisonous since Seattle, and the sharply divided Congress almost guarantees a fight over any trade accords. But the United States will also be under intense pressure to step up the pace of trade liberalization.
The Seattle coalition will be particularly chagrined if Gov. George W. Bush's current advantage in the Florida count secures him the White House. Unions, environmentalists and consumer groups overwhelmingly backed Vice President Al Gore, partly because he promised not to expand trade without establishing labor and environmental standards first. Mr. Bush is an old fashioned free trader. He wants to expand Nafta now.
"There's a question of how much political capital Bush will want to spend," said Robert D. Hormats, a Goldman Sachs executive who is thought of as possible economic official in a Bush administration. "But we can't just sit around while everyone does these deals."

HEADLINE: Brazil Miffed As Chile Shifts Trade Focus Toward U.S.

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec. 2

 BODY:
The future of the world's third-largest trade bloc, the Brazilian-led Mercosur group, has suddenly been thrown into doubt by Chile's surprise announcement this week that it will defer its request for membership and instead seek a free trade agreement with the United States.
By opting to revive its efforts to gain a bilateral accord with the United States, Chile, which already has the most open economy in Latin America, has given new momentum to a proposal made by President Clinton in 1994 to establish a Free Trade Area of the Americas by 2005. At the same time, South America's efforts to speak with a single voice in the slow-moving effort to negotiate such an accord with the United States may have been seriously, and perhaps fatally, undermined. 
 Valor, a business daily here, described Chile's decision, announced Wednesday by President Ricardo Lagos during a visit to the United States, as a "stab in the back" of the four Mercosur countries: Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Jornal do Brasil, another daily here, preferred a chess analogy, saying that the Chilean move "puts Mercosur in check."
"This is definitely a blow to any effort to present a united front in our negotiations with the incoming administration in the United States," a former Brazilian official said Friday. "We are all going to have to rethink things and try to regroup."
Chile, along with Bolivia, is an associate member of Mercosur, and when Mr. Lagos took office in March, he announced that one of his first objectives would be full membership in the group.
But talks quickly ran into trouble over the tricky question of achieving a common tariff policy.
Tariffs within the Mercosur group average about 14 percent, compared with the 6 percent that is Chile's goal for 2003, and Brazil argued that the Lagos government should be more accommodating to its neighbors.
"It is Chile that is seeking to join Mercosur, not Mercosur that is seeking to join Chile," the Brazilian foreign minister, Luiz Felipe Lampreia, said earlier this year.
In a recent interview, Mr. Lampreia said that "all four of us strongly desire" that Chile become a full member of the group, but he added that Mercosur nations would not fundamentally change their trade policy to eliminate the tariff problem with Chile.
During a recent regional summit meeting in Brasilia, Mr. Lagos showed some discomfort with that position, and two weeks ago said his country favored slowing the pace of negotiations with Mercosur.
Chile was an early and enthusiastic supporter of hemispheric free trade, having asked for a bilateral agreement with the United States when Mexico was granted that status in 1994.
But after Congress failed to give Mr. Clinton so-called "fast track" authority to negotiate such an accord, Chile's focus shifted to the South American group, which has a population of more than 200 million people and a combined gross national product of more than $1 trillion.
Efforts to reach the broader American-sponsored hemisphere-wide accord are continuing, with the United States and Brazil acting as joint chairmen. But Brazil has consistently expressed doubts about both the timetable and reach of the negotiations, leading to American complaints of foot-dragging or outright sabotage.
"I think the prospect of seeing a free trade area by 2005 is pretty unrealistic right now," William Daley, then the secretary of commerce, said in June at a conference in Madrid. "If Brazil doesn't become aggressive at some point, I don't think it's going to happen."
But with the Chilean shift, Brazil now faces the prospect that its South American partners may be tempted to defect. Jose Luis Machinea, Argentina's minister of the economy, said Thursday that "Chile should be congratulated" for its action and that his country now "should accelerate its integration" into the free trade area with the United States.
The Chilean decision also puts direct pressure on Brazil, as American officials are well aware. If talks between the United States and Chile, which are expected to start this month, lead quickly to an agreement, American and European investment could be drawn away from Brazil and toward Chile.
"A free trade agreement between Chile and the United States will be an important building block in the creation of an equitable and balanced Free Trade Area of the Americas," Anthony S. Harrington, the American ambassador to Brazil, said Thursday.
He added that he hoped that by 2005, "if not earlier," such a trade agreement might also include Brazil.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK UP CLOSE;
150 Years of Dining, Champagne to Chop Suey, in One Bite

BYLINE: By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
Terrapin soup? Calf's head with brain sauce? Foot-long oysters plucked from Manhattan Beach? City health inspectors may not approve, but adventurous eaters can still savor these restaurant classics.
At the New York Public Library, 150 years of the city's history can be traced through what diners ate. There, one can sample a testimonial dinner at the legendary Delmonico's in honor of Charles Dickens during a visit to New York in 1867. It is also possible to size up the crowd at Reisenweber's, a lobster-palace-turned-cabaret, or to scan the prices at the Essex House, three decades and two recessions before Alain Ducasse began charging $160 for a four-course fixed-price dinner. One menu, in the form of a teepee, lists the dishes at a 1902 dinner of the Society of Colonial Wars in the United States. 
 More than 25,000 menus dating back to 1843 are housed in an archive in the main library on Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street. Considered one of the world's largest such collections, the archive offers a singular entry into the city's dining and social habits, beginning with its early obsession with French cooking through the culinary malaise of the Prohibition era to the current fascination with rare ingredients. "It really does justice to the texture of New York life in all its diversity and ebullience," said Alison Ryley, a former curator of the collection.
The archive was started in 1899 by an eccentric volunteer named Miss Frank E. Buttolph. From 1901 until her death in 1924, she set out across the city gathering bills of fare, from the chandeliered halls of the Waldorf-Astoria to the 15-cent lunchrooms along the Bowery.
Early menus paint a city enjoying an embarrassment of riches. Establishments like Delmonico's churned out lavish 12-course meals at $200 a head in an age of $5-a-week wages. In one memorable evening, the New York Riding Club held a white-tie banquet at which guests dined on horseback and sipped champagne from their saddlebags. The event was held at Sherry's Restaurant, which had moved into opulent quarters designed by Stanford White at Fifth Avenue and 44th Street, just across the avenue from Delmonico's. Over the next two decades, the two restaurants were locked in a truffle-coated food fight that is deliciously recorded in the collection.
While menus from the city's top restaurants were written almost entirely in French, other documents from this period give added meaning to the proverbial melting pot. Chinese restaurants on Mott Street began offering chop suey and other Westernized dishes as early as the 1870's. Spaghetti and chow mein were served alongside schmaltz herring at some kosher restaurants in the Lower East Side.
Since the menus are housed in some 400 boxes that must be individually ordered, the process of looking through them seems as antiquated as some of the menus. For every item that captures the eye with inlaid gold or a pink tassel, there are dozens that simply lists the day's specials on plain paper. The only index is a card file that Miss Buttolph created herself, although library volunteers have begun keying in search terms, like "lady cake" and "Barbetta," into a computer database.
Yet, for all the endless variety of restaurants in the city, both present and past, the impulse for dining out appears to be timeless.
"People in New York go out to be seen and not necessarily for the food," said Michael Krondl, author of "Around the American Table" (Adams Media), a book of recipes drawn from the library's archives. "That's still true." DENNY LEE

HEADLINE: Tech's Down But He's Up, So What's His Secret?

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM 

 BODY:
YOU probably can't invest with Lawrence A. Bowman. The minimum investments for the funds he runs at Bowman Capital start at $1 million. But he recently offered thoughts about the market for smaller, individual investors. Following are excerpts from interviews. DANNY HAKIM
 
Q. Many middle-class Americans participate in the market only through mutual funds. Which fund managers do you respect? 

A. Bob Stansky of Fidelity Magellan is the best. Chip Morris of T. Rowe Price Science & Technology , Gerry Malone of Alliance Technology , Paul Wick of Seligman Communications and Information ; they are all very good, but they don't have the tools and the toolbox to do what we do. These guys are in Model T's and we're in race cars.
They're all very intelligent, and I'm glad I'm competing with them with their hands tied behind their backs, through no fault of their own.
 
Q. Since mutual funds don't use your hedging techniques to protect against bear markets, what would you do if you were an individual investor, now that the Nasdaq has fallen from over 4,000 to 2,600 since April? Is it time to buy a tech fund?
 
A. I wouldn't yet. People say if you have a long-term approach it always kind of works out, and it will, because tech will be up tenfold in the next, whatever, 10 years. They say it doesn't matter if you get in and the market declines.
The truth of the matter is, when you really run the numbers, what matters the most is what happens in the first year. If you're down 20 percent in your first year, you've got to get to 25 percent just to break even. You need a good start and I don't see the bottom yet. I really believe there could be another 20 to 30 percent down in the Nasdaq if demand continues to soften. So I wouldn't come in right now.
The purpose of bear markets is to wipe out excesses from the previous bull markets. The excess of the 90's has been the mantra of the bull market babies, which is to buy every dip. Until we've wiped that out, we haven't finished this bear market correction.
Now, what could make everything turn around is if you wake up tomorrow and the economy magically appears. It's hard to see that, though. The wealth effect will compound itself this quarter. Everyone I know feels more poor now than they did a month ago, or a month before that, in the strongest season of the year, so do not expect a strong holiday season.
Now if demand turns positively, then, you know what, call me up and I go, "Look, I was wrong, demand turned and we're long again."
 
Q. Are there any bright spots?
 
A. There are some areas that are still very strong. Without telling you if we own these stocks, I'll tell you areas where we see strength. In data storage, you see demand strong, so EMC and Veritas are strong. Surprisingly, there's strength in the Unix area, but specifically just with Sun. They're gaining share and they really have their act together. In networking you still see strength at companies like Cisco, which is hard to believe considering how large they are and how economically sensitive they are. There's still a ton of very robust demand at Cisco because they're such a high-quality company with the right products at the right time.
And then the optical switch companies' demand is so very strong, even with all the telecom blowups. Sycamore, ONI, Juniper on the router side, Avici. The problem with these companies is that the valuations are still high relative to the market environment we're in. But demand is still strong there.
These are companies I would look to own significantly if the economy turns. If a company's demand is this strong in a soft economic environment, imagine how strong it'll be when the economy recovers.

HEADLINE: Master of Universe (Updated Model)

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: SAN MATEO, Calif.

 BODY:
LAWRENCE A. BOWMAN employs a full-time staff of 10. For his cars. His 37 cars -- that's 3.7 vehicles per mechanic. There is the Cobra Daytona Coupe, the 1971 Barracuda, the 10 Corvettes. And, yes, there is a somewhat legendary red Ferrari in which he has been known to conduct job interviews.
"I love horsepower," says Mr. Bowman, who races Formula Fords for fun but promises that he has never driven over 180 miles an hour. Mr. Bowman, 42 and a chiseled 6-foot-3, pauses for a moment, thinking that he should perhaps throttle down. 
 "I've never gone over 174 on a public road," he adds, his face settling into a grimace with the faintest hint of a smile.
Mr. Bowman exudes confidence: he is one of today's masters of the universe, a private investment manager at the top of his game. He and his chief partner, John K. Hurley, both former star technology investors at Fidelity Investments, run the $5.5 billion Bowman Capital, a private technology investment firm that has been an oasis of positive returns this year in a land of losses. The firm -- part hedge fund, part venture capital fund -- caters to the elite of Silicon Valley. Michael Dell invests with it. So does Gregory B. Maffei, the former chief financial officer of Microsoft. And Avram Miller, a former top executive of Intel who is a director of CMGI. And so do scores of technology executives, venture capitalists and institutional investors like the MacArthur Foundation and the University of California at Berkeley.
In the last few years, the brand names of private money management -- Soros, Robertson, Meriwether -- were gathered up like twigs for kindling. As their complex bets on global macroeconomic trends, or on the convergence of currency, stock or bond prices, started losing tens of billions of dollars in the late 90's, they gave way to Silicon Valley's venture capitalists as the rock stars of money management. But now rising to prominence is a third group of money managers, like Bowman Capital, that make bets on both the winners and the losers in the valley.
The glad-handing days of 1998 and 1999 that made the venture capitalists and individual technology investors rich have ended. What becomes now of those technology investors in a world that has suddenly decided to heap scorn on their stocks?
In times like these, it helps to play with all the cards in the deck -- as Bowman has.
One should not be fooled by Mr. Bowman's California casual dress -- the slacks, the sweater, the bright orange watch -- or by the drab Silicon Valley office building across the street from a T. J. Maxx that is his headquarters. While he is a bona fide techie -- he worked as an engineer at Apple Computer and Texas Instruments in the 80's -- he is also an East Coast financial veteran, not only of Fidelity but also of Tiger Management when it was one of the world's largest hedge funds, the private investment pools for wealthy and institutional investors. Now, Mr. Bowman's firm, not quite six years old, ranks as one of the world's 10 largest hedge funds and is an emerging force in the world of venture capital.
What appeals to many Silicon Valley executives and other investors is that Bowman Capital knows when to bite the hand that has fed them all, hedging its bets by short-selling, or betting that some of its neighbors in the valley will decline. And decline they have.
"This quarter, it's 'run for the hills, be short and protect everything you can because the sky is falling,' " Mr. Bowman said in an interview last week. Yet after it started in February 1995, Bowman averaged annual gains of 62 percent through the end of last year, according to people close to the firm. More important, its funds gained 19 percent, on average, this year through November, compared with a 36.2 percent loss in the Nasdaq composite index, home to many technology stocks. Those returns take into account the firm's charges: a 1 percent or 2 percent annual management fee, as well as 20 percent of the profits. (Those fees are the norm in the world of private investment.)
DO I know as much about these tech companies?" said Mr. Maffei, an investor and now chief executive of 360networks, a telecommunications company based in Vancouver, British Columbia. "Yes, but they know more about trading stocks."
Jeffery J. Mora, who runs part of Northwestern University's $4 billion endowment, which invests some of its money with Bowman, said: "What we look for with Bowman is what they've delivered this year. In choppy markets, they can deliver attractive returns. These are guys that can profit both on the long and the short side. Larry has the skill to add value when markets go up or go down."
Indeed, as the gilded age turns leaden, the best money managers might turn out to be the ones that can profit on both sides of the fence, that can pick the good stocks in the valley and short the no-earnings dot-coms.
"We have the tools to do anything," Mr. Bowman explained. "The mutual funds can only go long. These guys are stuck. They can go 5 or 10 percent cash, then they have to just bleed every day.
"Same thing with venture capital funds," he added. "They go long and when the stock comes out of an I.P.O., they've got a stock they can't even sell." He was referring to the six-month lockup period that restricts insiders from selling stock right after an initial public offering.
Mr. Hurley, 36, said that last year, he had difficulty explaining to clients why their funds were "only up 100 percent because we're taking less risk."
"Reading about some of the great investors in history, the most important thing they do is preserve capital in bad markets," he said, adding that "a market like this makes it clearer to folks what we've been talking about."
The "nastiness" will continue, Mr. Bowman said, at least into the first quarter of next year. Indeed, the man to whom some of the valley's top venture capitalists turn for advice on the public markets has turned deeply bearish. In early November, his fund not only had as many short positions as it did long bets, it was more than half in cash, a very cautious stance.
"This year started out like a bottle rocket and it turned into a bomb," he said. "In the strongest seasonal quarter of the year, we're having demand disappointments everywhere," he said. "It's very, very scary."
MR. BOWMAN, a steelworker's son, graduated from Lehigh University and worked in Silicon Valley as an engineer until a few lucky bets on the market convinced him that he was as interested in trading his personal portfolio as he was in technology.
"I was clueless, but I felt like a genius," he said. "That got the passion going."
He then received an M.B.A. at the Stanford Business School, and moved to Boston, starting his new career at Fidelity.
"At 30, I was getting coffee for old-world bond traders and making copies," he said. But when he became a technology analyst, he learned the art of stock-picking from some of the industry's legends, like Peter Lynch, the revered former manager of the Fidelity Magellan fund, and Robert Stansky, Magellan's current manager. "Stansky, I'd put up there as the best growth investor I've ever met in my life," he said.
He also met Mr. Hurley, who also had a Stanford M.B.A. but had a much different background. Mr. Hurley had put off his enrollment at Stanford to serve with his Army unit in the Persian Gulf war, where he supervised battlefield computer and communications systems. At various times, each would run the portfolio that is now the $19 billion Fidelity Aggressive Growth fund.
Mr. Bowman and Mr. Hurley both heap praise on Fidelity, although working there was not without frustration. Mr. Bowman wanted to be a technology specialist but was working at a firm whose design was to train managers of diversified funds.
"Fidelity wouldn't open up an office in Silicon Valley," he said. "I begged them. You get paid at Fidelity to run diversified funds. That's why they've never had good specialists."
A spokeswoman for Fidelity, Anne Crowley, responded, "Historically, we have an excellent record on technology, and our record speaks for itself."
Still, the firm that Mr. Bowman and Mr. Hurley now run somewhat mimics Fidelity in miniature. One of the innovations of Edward C. Johnson III, Fidelity's chief executive, is that Fidelity's research analysts actually manage money; its Select funds, which focus on specific market sectors, are something of a farm team for its bread and butter, the huge diversified mutual funds like Magellan. Fidelity rotates its analysts from one Select fund to another to give them a breadth of knowledge.
Bowman's 25 analysts also manage pools of money, but they are all specialists in particular technology subsectors -- and they stay there. "All we want are specialized experts," Mr. Bowman said. "We don't want generalists."
In 1993, he left Fidelity, spent a year at Tiger Management learning the hedge fund business under another legendary investor, Julian H. Robertson Jr., and then went into business for himself by starting Bowman Capital. The firm was still relatively small, under $500 million in assets, when he decided to move from Stamford, Conn., to Silicon Valley in early 1997. His timing was propitious. Over the next three years, the world of money management divided in two: there were those who bet on technology and telecommunications stocks, and there were those who bet on everything else. The first group of investors were regarded as geniuses, and the second suffered mightily by comparison.
Then came the demise of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, which had two Nobel laureates among its partners in addition to John W. Meriwether, the storied bond trader from Salomon Brothers. In March of this year, Mr. Robertson closed his firm, Tiger Management, declaring, "We are in a market where reason does not prevail."
Weeks later, George Soros, who once unsettled nations with his currency trading, said he would scale back his operations and rename his main fund an "endowment." Many of his investors fled as he switched to a strategy more akin to Geritol than Viagra.
As the old titans faded, new ones like Mr. Bowman rose, but they do not much resemble Mr. Soros or Mr. Robertson. The new giants -- Bowman in Silicon Valley, Pequot Capital in Westport, Conn., Galleon in New York -- run private funds that specialize mainly in technology. Unlike the old group of titans, Bowman uses very little leverage, because technology stocks are volatile enough by themselves. And for the most part, the firm does not bet on global macroeconomic trends.
Instead, the firm is like a Silicon Valley research group -- a consulting firm that helps venture capitalists and private companies understand what the public market is thinking. There is a price for this, and it is not only in money. The valley, like other niches of the financial world, has an I'll-scratch-your-back-if-you'll-scratch-mine ethic. No one can just show up at the door, waving the $1 million to $5 million minimum investment, and get in. Mr. Bowman expects many of his investors to become "insight partners" who will feed ideas and information to the firm. To that end, in 1998, it started its Founders fund, which has captains of the valley as its investors.
"The fund was launched to improve relationships with technology executives and venture capitalists," Mr. Bowman said. "Money is easy, O.K.? The scarcest resource over the long run is performance; it's not money. We can raise all the money we want; I don't care about that. We need partners. We need relationships."
CONSIDER Accel Partners, a $3.2 billion venture capital firm that has an informal alliance with Bowman. While Bowman does late-stage venture capital investing, Accel invests in companies that are, in some cases, just ideas.
"Some of the best business plans we've ever backed are four or five bullet points on a napkin," said James W. Breyer, Accel's managing partner. As a member of Bowman's board of advisers, Mr. Breyer has has passed several deals along to Bowman. In return, Accel uses Bowman as a consulting firm for understanding the public markets.
"That's not an area where we spend a lot of time," Mr. Breyer said. "We don't pretend to understand what the Fidelitys of the world do. There's a very different set of skills needed that we don't have. What a Bowman brings is a very deep understanding of what the public market looks for."
And this year, understanding the public markets has become ever more important. Investors of all sizes who plowed more and more money into technology stocks and funds over the last few years are now awash in losses. For the retail investor looking for a gold strike, the money management industry spawned scores of mutual funds that invested only in Internet and technology stocks. This year, some of those funds have closed, some are down by more than 75 percent and some are even excising the word "Internet" from their titles.
"Shorting killed you last year," Mr. Bowman said. "God, I wish we were a long-only mutual fund last year. But this is the kind of year that a firm like ours is able to reach into the toolbox."
Not that optimism has fled Silicon Valley, or Bowman Capital. After all, it has a venture capital fund to run, and that means the funding tap for new companies is staying open.
Late one mid-November morning in San Jose, four Bowman analysts had their Research In Motion pagers laid out on the oval conference table at Jetstream Communications, one of their venture capital pet projects. The company makes equipment to aid the speed and quality of voice communications over Internet networks. John Niedermaier, the company's chief financial officer, started his status report.
There were slides. There were charts. There were exclamation points. "Market opportunity is HUGE!" read one bullet point. "VOICE IS THE KILLER APP!!!" read another. There were wacky acronym mix-ups. ("It's VoDSL, not VDSL," someone said.) There were no earnings, of course, but there were promising-looking revenue numbers.
"The innovative work is not being done by the big companies; their engineers are creating new versions of existing software," said Spencer Punter, a Bowman partner, giving his pitch for why venture capital remained a vital source of opportunity.
"That's what's created this continuing cycle in the valley," he added.
LIKE everyone else, Bowman has made its share of questionable bets, including a venture investment in Pets.com, an e-commerce site. Though the firm has had venture investments since its start, it opened a dedicated venture capital fund only last year; it now has about $1 billion in assets.
"Putting a billion dollars to work around here is not the easiest thing to do," said one rival Silicon Valley money manager, who insisted on anonymity. "You take a shotgun out and hit anything that moves, and that's what he did," he added, referring figuratively to Mr. Bowman.
But Mr. Bowman's venture team does boast its share of sizzle, including investments in companies like Sycamore Networks and ONI Systems that are still well regarded, even if beaten up this year. Between Bowman venture capital investments that have gone public or gone bust, the firm has returned 288 percent, before fees, over two years through the end of September. Since then, Pets.com has ceased operations.
"We've had some investments that have not been successful; that's part of being in the venture capital business," said Matthew T. Cowan, a general partner in Bowman's venture investment arm. "In the ideal, three are going to be great, three are going to break even and you might lose money on three."
Bowman also uses hedging techniques in its venture capital fund, an approach rare in the V.C. world.
Mr. Miller, the former Intel executive, likes the safety net. "They can protect good positions by hedging something else," he said. "Frankly, most venture capitalists don't understand financial technology."
On average, Bowman Capital is about 45 percent exposed to the market. That means that if it had, say, $1 million in assets, it might buy $725,000 worth of securities and sell short $275,000 of securities, leaving it with a net long exposure of $450,000, or 45 percent of its assets. But by early November, the firm had bought and sold short securities in roughly equal proportions.
What will it take to get Bowman to reverse course and start buying again?
"We need to see an uptick in demand, both in U.S. consumers and in Europe, and that is hard to see coming into the first quarter of the year, which is the seasonally softest quarter. March could be a disaster," Mr. Bowman said, predicting that the first three months of next year will be "an unmitigated disaster."
"On the bullish side, cash levels over all are higher than I can remember across mutual funds and hedge funds, and sentiment is quite negative," he continued. "It won't take much to fuel a rally. That said, it won't be a sustainable rally unless fundamentals improve. We are in an economic slowdown and we don't know where the bottom is."
Bowman's largest positions, according to the firm's regulatory filings at the end of September, are two data storage companies: one that makes software, Veritas, and one that makes hardware, EMC.
"We do like the storage sector and EMC and Veritas are two leaders," he said, adding that the firm had been invested in both companies for about two years. "Business and the technological outlook for both are quite strong."
If anything, size will be Bowman's biggest challenge now.
"A tech fund at $200 million is a much different animal when it reaches $2 billion," said Barry H. Colvin, chief operating officer of Tremont Advisors, a hedge fund industry consulting firm. "They might not be able to short as effectively. They may have once had 50 positions and now they'll have 70 to 100 and now they have to buy bigger companies.
"Any sector manager has some number at which they will be constrained under their current strategy," he added. "I would say that Bowman is at that point. Those types of changes make it harder to make money."
For his part, Mr. Bowman said he believes that his firm will distinguish itself in this year of treacherous markets.
"Most of the guys we're competing with are bull market babies," he said. "That's why we're washing them out and we'll continue to wash them out.
"I'm praying for a market crash," he added. "Find me someone else who's doing that. You make money betting against the crowd."
Mr. Bowman has been known to choreograph push-up contests among his traders -- for money, of course -- and has a wolverine hide draped across a partition between two desks on his trading floor. And he has hardly surrounded himself with yes men.
"The successful money managers on Wall Street are all megalomaniacs," he said. "What we have here are wolverines. Individuals that will not lose."
TERESA ROMANEK, 29, interviewed for a secretary's job at Tiger Management when she was in her early 20's. "Teresa walks in, a farm girl from Nebraska, and says she wants to pick stocks," Mr. Bowman recalled. "I have a secretary's job, but she wants to pick stocks."
She became one of Bowman's first partners. Ms. Romanek, for her part, has a unique view of Mr. Bowman's ascent. "I remember when he got his first Ferrari," she said. "He parks it in the fire zone, cruises into the office in Bermuda shorts -- no socks, no shoes."
"He's matured since then," she added. "Now he wears shoes."

Having A Banana?

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Back when Jimmy Carter was president, his anti-inflation czar, Alfred Kahn, was chastised for his excessive frankness when he spoke about a possible recession. So in subsequent speeches he referred to the threatened event as a "banana."
Well, some people are doing their best to turn us into a banana republic; are we also about to turn into a banana economy? The answer is a definite maybe. 
 The long boom of the 1990's made many people forget a fundamental truth: the course of economic expansion never did run smooth. Alan Greenspan and his colleagues try to keep the economy on a steady course. But the Fed can never be sure either how much effect a change in interest rates will have or how long it will take for that effect to occur. So managing the economy is like trying to drive a car whose brakes have an uncertain and delayed effect on its speed. You have to expect an occasional sudden slowdown.
For more than a year the Fed has been tapping on those brakes, trying to slow an economy that it thought was growing too fast. Until a few weeks ago the higher interest rates didn't seem to be having much effect. Now there are signs that consumers are feeling cautious, a state of mind that isn't helped by the plunge in tech stocks. Meanwhile, low stock prices and high interest rates on corporate bonds are cramping business investment. So now it seems that the Fed may have stayed on the brakes a little too long.
If the economy slows too much the Fed can, of course, push interest rates back down. But like the rate hikes, any rate cut will have an uncertain and delayed effect. So there's a pretty good chance that the months ahead will see a slowdown severe enough to cause a rise in the unemployment rate. Whether that slowdown will be sharp enough or sustained enough to meet the technical definition of a recession -- at least two quarters of actual economic decline -- is more doubtful, but it's certainly a possibility.
But even if we do have a recession, so what? A brief recession might come as a shock to those who thought the laws of economic gravity had been repealed, but it needn't do any lasting harm. In 1990-91 we had a recession that, like the possible recession in our future, was basically a fumble by the Fed -- in other words, it didn't reflect any fundamental problems in the economy. Recovery was unusually slow, in part because of the side-effects of the savings and loan crisis, but even so the recession left few lasting scars and barely registered on the long bull market.
Admittedly, the recession before that -- the double-dip slump from 1979-82 -- was a much more wrenching affair. But that recession took place in an environment of runaway inflation, where getting prices under control took priority over a quick recovery. It's hard to see any parallel in our current situation.
If you want a parallel to worry about, it comes not from our own experience but from that of Japan. The world's second-largest economy went into a recession at the beginning of the 1990's and has never really gotten out, despite a series of interest-rate reductions that eventually brought short-term rates down to zero. And Japan's crisis followed an era of irrational exuberance that in some ways resembles the late 1990's in the U.S.: a period of vigorous growth, overweening national self-confidence and extremely high stock prices.
While there are some disturbing parallels between America now and Japan a decade ago, there are also important differences. U.S. stock prices never got as high compared with earnings as those in Japan, and we haven't had anything like Japan's real estate bubble. Japan's problems in getting a recovery going have also been aggravated by special national issues, like extremely conservative consumers and a rapidly aging population.
But aren't plunging tech stocks in effect predicting a severe recession? Maybe so -- but why would you believe that prediction? If the wild tech optimism of last spring didn't herald an unprecedented economic boom, the market's new pessimism needn't herald a looming slump.
So will we have a recession? Maybe. If so, will it be severe and prolonged? Not likely. And the best news of all is that the Fed will be able and ready to react, whoever is or isn't president.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Altered States;
A Shift in the U.S.-Cuba Time Warp

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN an era when an American president beguiles crowds in Vietnam, and China is a key trading partner, U.S. policymakers still need to be reminded of their victory over communism when talk turns to Cuba.
Cuba's transition to a free-market democracy is inevitable, a bipartisan task force of the Council on Foreign Relations declared in a report issued Wednesday. The committee asserted that the United States should move faster to open and increase a variety of contacts. 
 Yet whenever Washington focuses on that island with 11 million people just 90 miles offshore, peculiar things happen. Reason slips, tempers flare. And the custodians of the current hard-line policy are out of sync with the general public, which increasingly favors a less hostile stance toward Havana.
In October, Republican leaders stymied votes in both houses to open Cuba to more trade and travel. The bill finally signed by the president legalized the sale of food but denied vital funding; rather than increase travel, it froze current restrictions by codifying them into law.
Representative Mark Sanford, a South Carolina Republican, got a taste of the Cuba warp last summer, when he had won broad support for a measure to let Americans visit the island freely. After the vote, he sought to clear the air with his long-time ally, Tom DeLay, the Republican whip, who remains an ardent foe of any softening toward Havana.
What he got was a nasty fight. The two men turned red in the face as they screamed at each other. The spectacle on the House floor left staffers awkwardly staring at their shoes. Later, in conference, Mr. DeLay helped kill the Sanford bill.
After four decades of seeking to topple, discredit and isolate the Cuban leader, Fidel Castro, the defense of the current American policy increasingly relies on strong-arm tactics and back-room deals.
Meanwhile, surveys show most Americans want a new approach. They want more interaction and trade. A recent poll by Florida International University found 80 percent of Americans would support a dialogue with the Cuban government. They favor the sale of food (86 percent) and medicine (90 percent). A key recommendation by the council task force urged opening Cuba to travel by all Americans.
Some people aren't waiting on Washington. Though officially barred from spending money in Cuba, an estimated 22,000 Americans illegally flew in as tourists from third countries last year. An additional 135,000 took part in authorized visits for academic, cultural and family exchanges.
The custody battle over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez forced Americans to focus on Cuba for the first time in years, and many came to question the tactics of Cuban exile leaders, who have long had great influence over U.S.-Cuban relations.
"The people are way ahead of the politicians on this issue," said Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat, who hopes to end the sanctions in the next Congress.
Two powerful lobbies, the American Farm Bureau and the United States Chamber of Commerce, are seeking to open up trade with Cuba. Leaders in both groups say they will press for what they say could represent a billion-dollar market for American food products alone.
EVEN some longtime supporters of sanctions see the change. "The consensus has moved on U.S. policy toward Cuba," said Dan Fisk, a former Senate aide who was instrumental in drafting the 1996 Helms-Burton Act, which tightened the embargo, but is now a signatory on the council report. The next president will witness the dismantling of efforts to isolate Mr. Castro, Mr. Fisk predicted.
Both Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore oppose eliminating all sanctions against Cuba while Mr. Castro is in power, leaving many analysts to foresee a piecemeal approach.
But economists in federal agencies like the Department of Agriculture and the International Trade Commission are now working on studies that forecast the economic impact of lifting sanctions.
Even among Cuban Americans, attitudes are changing. A majority favors selling food and medicine to Cuba, polls show, though most exiles voice support for the embargo. Elena Freyre, executive director of the Cuban Committee for Democracy, a liberal group, complained that exile lawmakers are out of step, catering only to the most intransigent, and best-financed, elements of the community. "The people who purport to represent that community are no longer doing so," she said.
But the battle must still be decided in Congress. In 1996, pro-embargo lawmakers -- nervous about President Bill Clinton's intentions -- stripped him of discretionary powers over the sanctions.
Some seasoned political fighters stand in the way. Among them is Mr. DeLay. His antipathy stems in part, aides say, from a jarring incident when he was a boy: gun-toting Cuban troops boarded his airliner during a stopover in Havana on a flight from Venezuela to the United States. And there are the two Cuban-American lawmakers from Miami, Representatives Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who seem unyielding when it comes to Mr. Castro. In a political system oiled by compromise, such fervor can bring the process to a halt.
"The leadership has made a mockery of the democratic process," said Wayne S. Smith, a former diplomat in Havana. "For so long we have allowed our policy to be dictated from Miami against the will of a majority of the American people and a majority in Congress."
Mr. Sanford said the Cuban exile lobby has kept lawmakers in line with generous campaign contributions. "The answer, in part, is money," he said. "I've had people tell me, 'Hey, just take a quick trip to Miami and you're home $10,000 richer, in time for lunch.' "
Pro-embargo Cuban exiles and their allies say they are taking a moral stand against a repressive regime. The Cuban American National Foundation, the leading exile lobby, asserts that Mr. Castro is working with American "apologists" and multinational firms to "place tainted profits before principle."
Yet with American business leaders vowing to revisit the policy, the deep-pocketed exile lobby may have met its match. Jack Laurie, vice president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, said his group will ultimately prevail. "We probably didn't realize the intensity of feelings of Cuban Americans," he said. "I'm sensitive to some of what they're saying. But by the same token, 40 years is a long time to harbor the same position."

Are Trees Good Places To Avoid Tech Shock?

BYLINE: By Joanne Legomsky 

 BODY:
Timmmberrr. That is not just the sound of your carefully built high-technology portfolio crashing. Investments in timberland are gaining currency as a way of earning good returns and adding a little stability to overall holdings.
"It makes it easier for investors to take on more risk with their other assets," said Eva Gregor, a managing director at Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Company, an institutional money management firm in Boston. 
 But isn't an investment in tracts of land and trees awfully cyclical?
"It is, and it isn't," Ms. Gregor said. As she explains it, while the price of lumber is very sensitive to the health of the economy, tree prices are much less so. "You have the choice of taking the trees to a pulp mill, a lumber mill, or not selling at all."
As an asset class, timberland falls into the category of alternative investments. But unlike, say, private equity investments or hedge funds, it is not a high-risk, high-return proposition. An investor with a relatively long time horizon can reasonably expect annual returns of 10 percent to 12 percent, after fees and any inflation, Ms. Gregor estimated.
Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo recently started a timber fund for individual investors willing to commit at least $1 million for 10 years.
Investors in timberland may be able to count on another benefit: Returns are not highly correlated with those of traditional investments. After all, trees grow, regardless of the markets. Joanne Legomsky

One Step Forward, After Four Steps Back

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
For the second consecutive Friday, investors hunting for bargains among technology stocks drove up the Nasdaq composite index after it had sunk all week.
But this Friday's rally, in which the Nasdaq rose as much as 5.8 percent, sputtered after the United States Supreme Court heard arguments on Florida's presidential vote, and the index gave back more than two-thirds of its gain. That left the Nasdaq 8.9 percent lower for the week and 35 percent lower for the year, at 2,645.29. At its worst, on Thursday, Nasdaq's second-busiest trading day ever, the index was down 50 percent from its March 10 peak. 
 More companies, including Gateway, warned of sales and profit shortfalls at a time when the economy might be slowing more sharply than the Federal Reserve wanted. "The market goes straight down whenever they talk about extending this legal battle," said Nicholas C. Haffenreffer, president of Resolute Capital Management in Washington.
 Other major gauges lost less. The Dow Jones industrial average eased 96.69 points, or 0.92 percent, to end the week at 10,373.54. The Standard & Poor's 500 shed 26.54 points, or 1.98 percent, to 1,315.23. ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

High and Low

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Everyone is counting on the Supreme Court to bring civility, integrity and sanity to our election collision.
Unfortunately, in the immortal words of the old Don, "Nah ga da it." (The court is not going to do it.) 
 For the Kennebunkport Corleones, the Supreme Court deliberation serves the same function as the dazzling cross-cut scene in "The Godfather," when Michael attends his godchild's christening while his capos fan out to ice his rivals.
The movie church and the real court offer pious recitations and reverent ceremony that distract from the less savory stuff being done to secure the Family's interests.
The Wasp Corleones think it would be nice if the highest court helped them rub out Al Gore. But should the justices fail them -- and the Bushes know where they live -- they are pursuing other angles, some in sunlight and some in shadow, to grind Gore into little bits of chad and sprinkle him in the Everglades.
The Supreme Court may know a lot. But the Family knows best.
Sonny dissolves on contact. But he will be president. Of course, the dream could quickly corrode. Bush II may suffer the same painful fate as Bush I, economic slump leading to one term. And what if in 2004 we have another Bush-Clinton race? Hilllary may want to avenge Bill, just as W. avenged his dad's loss to Bill.
The Family has already paid a high price. Jeb's future is jeopardized. Sonny's future is jeopardized. Dick Cheney's health is jeopardized.
But, with its back against the wall, the Family drops the New England niceties. Consider Willie Horton, Anita Hill and John McCain in South Carolina. It was only business.
The Bushes sense trouble in Seminole and Martin Counties with those G.O.P.-doctored absentee ballot applications and the chance that thousands of Sonny's votes might be thrown out. They despise Al Gore as a weasel, agitating for those votes to be thrown out (just like the military ballots) after all his talk about counting every vote.
Let the Supreme Court palaver with Bush lawyers about the statutory use of the words "shall," "may" and "must," in determining whether Katherine Harris had to consider hand counts before certification.
Crosscut: The Bushes "shall" demand help from Ms. Harris, they "may" have sent a mob of khaki-clad Hill aides to intimidate the Miami-Dade canvassing board, and they "must" hang on to the count favoring W., as opposed to risking a true count.
Let the Supreme Court dissect Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 about the State Legislature's authority to regulate electors.
Crosscut: Jeb's Legislature is primed to do the wet work in a special session, guaranteeing Sonny Florida's 25 electoral votes no matter what else happens. Hired legal experts backed up plans to ram Sonny through, putting the veneer of legitimacy on the power grab. And after all his tortured ambivalence, Jeb has come out and admitted he will do what it takes to put big brother in the White House.
"I can't recuse myself from my constitutional duties as governor of the state, and I can't recuse myself from being my brother's brother, either," Jeb says. "I know the Gore campaign would love for me to basically disown my family, but I'm going to do what's right." Right.
Let the Supreme Court examine page 37-A as it relates to Section 102.166, debating whether the manual recounts are "authorized" or "required."
Crosscut: The Bushes dumping a horse head in the bed of Alex Penelas, the Democratic mayor of Miami-Dade County. Mr. Penelas, after conferring with Republicans, mysteriously stopped supporting the vice president's effort to get a recount. The mayor's Cuban-American constituents never bought Mr. Gore's pandering on Elian. Democrats charge that Mr. Penelas pulled a Tessio and cut a deal with the other family. He is considering switching parties and running for Congress. In which case, the Bushes could return the great service he did them.
Let the Supreme Court hold a disquisition over whether Title 3, U.S. Code, Chapter 1, Section 5 is, as Laurence Tribe claims, "all carrot and no stick."
Crosscut: The Bushes prepare a last line of defense with Tom DeLay and Trent Lott, who are all stick and no carrot.

HEADLINE: Environment Groups' Ratings Rile Ski Industry

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: DENVER, Dec. 2

 BODY:
The mistrust between environmentalists and the ski resort industry, which is sometimes rancorous, grew substantially this week when a coalition of environmental groups issued a report that graded 51 resorts in 10 Western states for their environmental policies.
While the groups said the scorecard was designed to be an objective review of the policies of each resort, with a strong focus on the impact of expansion efforts, it was roundly criticized by resort officials as biased because at least one of the coalition groups, Colorado Wild, has been an aggressive antagonist of resort developments over environmental policy. 
 Resort officials also said that no development could occur without meeting rigorous state and federal environmental standards.
"Our hope is that the situation does not become more polarized than it already is," said Julie Mack, executive director of the North Fork Preservation Alliance, the environmental policy arm of the Sundance Ski Resort in Utah, which received an A. "We have a real opportunity here for environmental groups to work with the ski resorts, but it will take a willingness on both sides to sit down at the table again."
The scorecard, produced by a group called the Ski Area Citizen's Coalition, ranked resorts on 11 criteria that focus largely on issues like expansion and development through new housing, ski trails or ski operations. The results, which are available on the coalition's Web site (www.skiareacitizens.com), show that only 9 resorts received an A and 7 a B. The rest got a C (14), D (11) or F (10).
The scorecard recommends "that you choose a more environmentally friendly ski destination at this time" than a resort with less than a B.
Among the resorts that received a failing grade were four in Colorado -- Vail Mountain, Keystone, Breckenridge and Beaver Creek -- that are owned by the same company, Vail Mountain Resorts.
Vail recently opened a major expansion of 500 acres, which has been ardently opposed by Colorado Wild. The group's executive director, Jeff Berman, was one of seven people arrested 18 months ago protesting the expansion. In a separate incident, the authorities in Mineral County in southwest Colorado said other members of the group were being sought on suspicion of trespassing after a late-night confrontation in August 1999 when members of a family of six camping on private property said they were approached near a planned golf and ski resort in Pagosa Springs.
Shortly after the incident, Mr. Berman conceded that alcohol might have clouded the judgment of some members of the group.
Another Colorado resort, Telluride, received an F on the scorecard although Colorado Wild has signed off on a settlement of a lawsuit over Telluride's expansion plans.
Stacey L. Gardner, spokeswoman for the National Ski Areas Association, a trade group, said episodes like those demonstrate a bias, which led many resort operators to decline the coalition's request for information for the scorecard. Ms. Gardner called it an "ill-warranted publicity stunt." She said 160 ski areas in 31 states have endorsed a set of environmental principles, developed by industry officials with federal and state agencies as well as other environmental groups that did not endorse the coalition's scorecard.
She also predicted that the scorecard would have little economic impact on the resorts, an assessment shared by resorts at both ends of the grading system.
Ms. Mack said she doubted that Sundance would gain much business after receiving an A. Bill Jensen, chief operating officer of Vail Mountain, said any ranking had the potential to influence a traveler. "Will it cost us $1? I wouldn't argue with that," he said. "Will it cost us millions? I wouldn't anticipate it."
As a spokesman for the coalition, Mr. Berman dismissed the industry's standards as a case of the fox guarding the henhouse. He conceded that many of the coalition's concerns with resort environmental policies should also be directed at the state and federal agencies that set the standards. But he insisted that the criteria developed for the scorecard reflected an honest effort to show the public which resorts are demonstrating the most sensitivity to environmental issues.
"We feel this is an excellent tool to choose a ski vacation," he said. "It's not to punish anyone."

HEADLINE: Critics Calling U.S. Supplier In Nicaragua A 'Sweatshop'

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
An arm of the Pentagon has come under fire for procuring large quantities of apparel from a Nicaraguan factory that labor rights groups say is a sweatshop and that the United States trade representative has voiced serious concerns about.
Several members of Congress say it is wrong for the Pentagon agency, which runs 1,400 stores at military bases and made $7.3 billion in sales last year, to obtain apparel from the Chentex factory, which a Nicaraguan union has accused of firing more than 150 union supporters. 
 In an unusually stern letter, The United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, warned the Nicaraguan government in October that the United States might rescind some trade benefits unless it moved to ensure that Chentex complied with labor laws.
Labor rights groups in the United States have mounted an intense campaign against Chentex, a factory with 1,800 workers that is owned by the Nien Hsing Textile Company, after Nicaraguan workers accused the company of illegal firings. Many workers also complain about low pay, monitored bathroom visits, large amounts of mandatory overtime and being screamed at and occasionally hit by managers.
Cynthia A. McKinney, Democrat of Georgia, who sits on the procurement subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee, said it was wrong for one federal agency, the Pentagon, to buy large amounts of apparel from Chentex while another, the trade representative's office, had singled out the factory for criticism.
Representative McKinney and several other House members are working closely with a labor rights group that has obtained shipping documents showing that the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, a nonprofit Pentagon arm that runs the post exchanges, is one of the Chentex's largest customers. Other major customers have included the retailers Wal-Mart and Kohl's.
"The United States government is the last place that should be supporting and coddling sweatshop labor and the violation of human rights," Ms. McKinney said.
Labor rights groups and several House members say the Chentex battle is important because it seeks to upgrade wages and working conditions in poor nations at a time when the American economy is importing more goods than ever and American companies are relocating operations to low-wage countries.
Fred Bluhm, a spokesman for the Army and Air Force Exchange Service, said that in light of the many criticisms of Chentex the exchange service sent officials to Nicaragua to examine the Chentex operation. "Our representative who went there found no problems," he said.
Carlos Yin, the general manager of Chentex, said in a telephone interview that his company treats its workers well. He accused the union of exagerating problems and he insisted that only 12 union supporters had been fired, all of them union leaders. He said they were dismissed legally, asserting that it was the union leaders who had broken the law by calling a one-hour work stoppage and two-day strike without the workers' approval.
"We didn't do anything wrong," Mr. Yin said. "Nicaraguan law protects the workers very strong, and we can't go against the law."
But Charles Kernaghan, executive director of the National Labor Committee, a New York-based labor rights group, said the company dismissed far more than 100 union supporters after they went on strike demanding a 40 percent wage increase.
At a factory that sews 35,000 pair of jeans a day, employees earn about 20 cents for the work they put into a pair of jeans that often sell retail for $30 in the United States. The workers, in effect, demanded to be paid 8 cents more per pair.
Mr. Yin, the factory manager, said all of his workers earn at least the minimum wage, which union leaders say is set unrealistically low in developing countries in order to attract foreign investment.
Last summer, Representative Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, visited Nicaragua and met mother who worked at Chentex 60 hours a week, while her husband worked at another Nien Hsing factory for 70 hours a week, and yet they lived in a hut with a dirt floor. "The couple had a 3-year-old daughter with discolored tips of her hair, probably from a protein deficiency," he said. "These are people who work 60, 70 hours a week, and their standard of living is just abysmal."
Mr. Brown, who got 67 House members to sign a letter to President Clinton last July about conditions at Chentex and another Nicaraguan factory, Mil Colores, said he would hold a news conference this week criticizing the Army and Air Force Exchange Service.
"I'm outraged that American taxpayers are being made part of this sweatshop global economy in this way," he said.

HEADLINE: Washington Is Setting Its Sights on Downtown

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2

 BODY:
The city government here is embarking on a major effort to revitalize the downtown area, trying to draw people to the heart of the city with new housing, more shopping and a broader cultural life.
Officials hope to capitalize on an increase in the popularity of urban living, with people moving from the suburbs back to cities around the country, to inject some life into an area of the District of Columbia that for many years has seen little development other than office buildings. The area is east of the White House, west of Capitol Hill and north of the national Mall with its museums and monuments. 
 "Our vision for a vibrant downtown is one of a true neighborhood -- a place where thousands of residents live, work, shop, do business and bring vitality to our streets and our city," Mayor Anthony A. Williams said.
The mayor, a former chief financial officer for the city, said the plan would link downtown prosperity to other neighborhoods through housing initiatives and job development strategies.
Other cities, including Chicago, Denver and Baltimore, have made downtown housing a central factor in redevelopment strategies.
A report on the plan, known as the Downtown Action Agenda, was issued in mid-November.
"Downtown residential development is a big thrust of this plan," said Andrew Altman, the city planning director. Mr. Altman said that city planners wanted to act on momentum created by about $3.5 billion invested in new development in Washington in the last few years.
The agenda outlines 18 steps for the next 12 to 18 months.
The plan includes construction of houses on city-owned land downtown, streamlining zoning laws and proposing tax abatements and other financial incentives to attract private investors.
The agenda calls for reconnecting blocked streets, particularly Pennsylvania Avenue, which has been turned into a pedestrian thoroughfare in front of the White House for security reasons.
City planners also suggest the development of public space at the site of the Washington Convention Center, and the redesign of the Martin Luther King Jr. Library, which officials said could be a cultural anchor for the community.
The plan includes $3 million to $5 million for beautifying streets and paying for a trolley system that would transport people from the Mall to downtown sites.
The agenda, officials said, will not overburden city taxpayers. The private sector is investing more than $4 million in roughly 50 projects planned or under way. Tax abatements, financial incentives and small public works initiatives will help offset costs.
In addition, $6 million in federal highway money is to be used for improvements on or around city streets, Mr. Altman said.
The city has had some success recently that may bode well for the new strategy. The MCI Center, home to Washington's professional hockey and basketball teams, was completed in 1997. Since it opened, the annual number of visitors to downtown attractions has grown to eight million from three million, officials said, and 29 restaurants have opened. A new convention center is under construction and should be finished in 2003. And the Newseum, an interactive museum of news in suburban Virginia, plans to open a museum and educational center downtown.
John McKoy, president of DC Agenda, a civic organization in Washington, said the plan integrated old ideas and took advantage of the economic growth in the city.
But Mr. McKoy, who was the city planning director from 1979 to 1984, said traffic patterns would have to be watched carefully to avoid possible problems during development.
"Everything in the plan will not happen," Mr. McKoy said. "But there are cranes on every corner. This is very exciting."

Today's buzz is dizzying, barreling prosperity. Skyscrapers are sprouting like Christmas trees, hotels are full, tourists legion. The average price of a Manhattan apartment south of Harlem is $850,000, and buyers must strike like raptors to grab one.
Marc M. Goloven, senior regional economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, says that as employment has steadily grown since 1996, the city's economy has altered fundamentally, with the winnings spreading to neighborhoods and people never before included. 
 "Not only is the city doing well, the dimensions of the city's economy have expanded," he said.
There is no doubt that more people are working, as unemployment has plunged more than 16 percent in the city since last year. Moreover, indexes of poverty seem to show improvement. Welfare rolls have declined by half since 1995. Other aid to the poor -- food stamps, housing subsidies and medical assistance -- is also down sharply in inflation-adjusted terms.
From once-grimy Williamsburg in Brooklyn, to Astoria in Queens, to Harlem itself, what catches the eye are new windows on tens of thousands of apartments in once-marginal neighborhoods, the sprouting of information and technology industries, cleaner parks and brighter lights. Double-decker tour buses rumble down streets where fire engines raced two decades ago to douse the flames of arsonists, emblems of a city's despair.
But prosperity does not extend to everyone. For faceless thousands, homelessness can lurk just a paycheck away.
"More people are working, yet more people are struggling to make ends meet," said an October report by the Working Group on New York City's Low-Wage Labor Market, a panel organized by the Community Service Society of New York. The society is one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
And not all indicators point up. The poverty rate for families with children in the city jumped to 19.2 percent in the late 1990's, from 11 percent in the early 1980's, according to the working group's report. The lines at food pantries grow, as the United States Department of Agriculture says more than 36 million Americans are hungry or face the threat of hunger.
 
Falling Through the Cracks
If all New Yorkers' incomes are added up, the economic picture here is improving briskly. But this prosperity is spread unevenly. Median income, the midpoint of all incomes, provides a less encouraging view.
Rae Rosen, the senior economist of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said that New York State ranked 33rd in the nation by this measure. She said the figure for New York City was lower than that for the rest of the state, although she lacked statistics. By contrast New Jersey and Connecticut rank in the top five. "It's because there are a lot of single paychecks here," Ms. Rosen said. "The fastest ticket to poverty is to be a single mom with children."
Nowhere is the thin ice on which the poor skate more evident than in housing. The National Low Income Housing Coalition, a national advocacy group based in Washington, develops data to support its arguments for creation of more low-income housing and for other housing-related issues. It recently calculated that the fair market monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment in New York City was $834, while a household with an extremely low income should pay no more than $446, 30 percent of its income. Someone earning the minimum wage ($5.15 an hour) can afford no more than $268.
"Walk into any homeless shelter here in New York City, and you'll find men and women working at low-wage jobs, unable to afford rents in this booming economy," said Arnold S. Cohen, president of the Partnership for the Homeless, a New York advocacy group.
The Census Bureau estimates that one in four households spends more than half its income on rent. At the same time, the stock of rentals for less than $500 a month has shrunk by 55 percent in eight years, the bureau says, even with dwellings being carved out of attics, basements and garages.
And over the longer term, not enough housing is being built for the affluent, meaning they must compete with the poor for the same housing stock, pushing up prices. When the real estate industry was congratulating itself for building 10,000 units of new housing last year, Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, acknowledged that was only a third or a fourth of what was needed.
John Tynan, director of housing for Catholic Charities of Brooklyn and Queens, said, "We're in a bigger housing crisis than we were in the 80's." The agency is scrambling to create apartments in unused schools, monasteries and church-owned vacant lots.
"We need to develop more housing for people of limited incomes," Mr. Tynan said. "Without that, there really is no hope."
At Catholic Charities, Neediest Cases money has gone for a month's rent, utility bills, air-conditioners for asthmatic children, eyeglasses, heart medicine and many, many beds and cribs for families that had either none or too few.
And in almost all of these families, someone worked. "People are under the illusion that when people work hard, they make a lot of money," Mr. Tynan said. "The fact is that lots of people work very hard and don't make enough money."
A small kindness can mean everything.
 
A Spirit of Gratitude
"My spirit is really up there," said Lisa Speckman, who has five children, ages 6 to 13. Her husband was shot and killed on the street four days after her youngest child, Ciera, was born in 1994. Ms. Speckman was on welfare until Ciera went to school, and is now proud to work.
"Children need role models, and I'm their only one right now," she said. "Even if I'm making less than welfare, I'd rather work."
Ms. Speckman, 30, married her high school sweetheart, and did not graduate. She scrambled to get a high-school equivalency certificate the next year. Having held jobs from home health nurse to bingo-hall operator, she quit working to become a full-time mother after her third child, Christopher, was born.
"Even though life got hard, this was my life," she said. "I wanted a nice, big family."
After her husband, an architectural draftsman, was shot to death a few weeks after he dared to suggest a drug dealer leave his corner, she moved from an apartment in Bushwick, Brooklyn, to a house in Ridgewood, Queens. She could not pay the rent with her welfare check, even with help from her family, and was evicted.
She then spent a month in a rat-infested city assessment center in Brooklyn before being referred to a shelter in Forest Hills, Queens. It was not a nice place to spend Christmas, but she tried to keep her perspective.
"You really have to be very strong and mind-focused," she said. "This is a passing-through in your life."
Being in a shelter pushed her to the head of a list of applicants for a federally subsidized housing program, for which she had applied in 1991. She finally found a house in South Ozone Park, Queens.
The next step was to go back to work. She had already volunteered for workfare when her youngest daughter was 2 and old enough for day care. She also enrolled in a jobs program run by the Federation Employment and Guidance Service, or FEGS, which is supported by UJA-Federation of New York, another Neediest Cases beneficiary. There she learned skills, like resume writing, that are needed to apply for jobs. This led to a job as a dispatcher for a copier company, but she was laid off four months later when the company downsized.
Not to worry. She called FEGS and was invited to a group interview with another company the next week. She was late, but her sparkling, loquacious personality won the day, said Nancy De La Cruz, her jobs counselor. "She's somebody who will throw a joke, make you laugh," she said.
Her new job is with a company selling Broadway tickets in hotels. She has already received a $2 raise from her starting pay of $13 an hour. Her take-home pay of $950 every two weeks is almost enough to hold things together, except for clothes. The good news on that front is that she just discovered that a coat once worn by her oldest daughter fits her youngest.
"I wake up every morning and thank God for everything I have," she said.
 
A Journey Completed
A building at 918 Kent Avenue on the edges of Brooklyn's Fort Greene neighborhood was once a thriving parochial school before it closed. Now it has been revived by Catholic Charities as a home for New York's working poor.
The 47 apartments rent from $380 for a studio to $700 for a three-bedroom unit. Only low-income people are accepted.
One by one the Tavarez family came to the building, which is called St. Lucy/St. Patrick Family Housing. First there were Juan and Milena Tavarez, and their 3-year-old daughter, Jennifer. Another child is very visibly on the way.
Next came Juan's brother Jose, his wife Maria, and their 1 1/2-year-old son, Manuel. Finally, Juan's and Jose's parents, Jose and Maria, came to a third apartment in September. They were soon joined by a third sibling, Hilda, and her children, Jessica, 8, and Marcos, 4.
It is a long way from their home in the Dominican Republic, and perhaps longer still from the nearby, more expensive apartments they left, which had rats and falling ceilings.
Now they live in rooms with high ceilings and modern appliances, and celebrate holidays with rice and beans, roast pork and goat. Jose and Juan earn $8.15 an hour in a box-cutting factory, where each last year received a Christmas bonus of $54.15. The younger Maria works in a knitting factory, the older Maria in a doll factory. Hilda has a $5.50-an-hour job in a textile factory.
It still is not easy. Catholic Charities gave each brother a crib when he moved in. Their own budget couldn't stretch that far.
But there were laughter and hugs the other day as the older Jose, who used to work in a restaurant, celebrated his 70th birthday. "We are very happy here," his son Jose said. "This is a dream."
 
Some Timely Help
Angela C. Buie, 31, was caught in the housing trap. "The problem is that when a client is being evicted, she can't look for a job," said John Calhoun, one of the volunteers in RSVP/ACES, a program of the Community Service Society in which volunteer counselors help elderly and low-income clients obtain government benefits.
He and a team of colleagues saved Ms. Buie from eviction by putting together a package of welfare benefits that allowed her to pay her rent last March. A month later, she had a job in her field of representing child actors for commercials and was off public assistance.
She was born in Harlem and has lived in the Bronx ever since. She married a barber when she was 17 and gave birth to a daughter, Shanay, now 14. She worked as a home health aide and a dispatcher before finding her niche in booking children. Then she was laid off during a downturn. She collected unemployment, and worked part time selling women's clothes.
"I just could not sit down and wait," she said. Her unemployment was cut in half to $90 because she was working, but that was fine with her.
She desperately needed to be considered for a special assistance program for families on the verge of becoming homeless. Welfare workers had said she was not eligible, even as her back rent climbed past $2,000 and the landlord shut off her electricity. She came home to find an eviction notice.
The city officials she contacted said they could not help. Then, from Housing Court, she called the Community Service agency, which has developed expertise in helping to get the kind of housing assistance she needed. They talked to the right people in time.
"All I needed was a little help to get from Point A to Point B," she said with a smile.
 
A Lifetime in Brooklyn
 Anna Barry was born on March 6, 1919, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, when it was largely Irish. Her father was an ironworker. The family moved around and her landmarks, always, were the parishes of Brooklyn.
"I used to help the watchmaker, Mr. Jackson," she said. She started the job when she was 13, making 35 cents for two hours each weeknight and $1 for all day Saturday. When World War II came along, she found herself working as an inspector of 61-millimeter and 81-millimeter shells at Murray Manufacturing Company on Atlantic Avenue.
One day, for the fun of it, she threw a shell at her supervisor, a handsome chap named John J. Barry. She thinks he thought it was amusing. Not long after, he enlisted in the Marines.
When he returned from the Pacific with a Purple Heart, the couple married. They had three daughters, and moved around Brooklyn a bit too. He died in 1975.
The children were gone and the landlord raised the rent. Mrs. Barry, who worked at various bookkeeping jobs, moved to an apartment over a bakery in Dyker Heights. Owners changed, and over the years, her rent must have seemed paltry to her landlord. It took a long time to get broken windows repaired, and there were mice.
"He wasn't that bad," she said, "but at the same time he kept sending people to look at the apartment."
Mrs. Barry was in a common situation, said Margaret Keaveney, communications director for Catholic Charities. Old people across the city find themselves in the same apartments at the end of their working lives. New owners need more money to cover their mortgage. In the meantime, the steps to a walk-up have grown steeper by the year. It is easy to feel isolated, and that can lead to depression and sickness, Ms. Keaveney said. The drama is enacted daily all over New York City.
Mrs. Barry did not win the lottery, but she came close. Sometimes 3,000 elderly people apply for a single unit in a new Catholic Charities housing development. Winners are drawn from a barrel. But Mrs. Barry found her spot in the Holy Spirit Senior House after an opening developed, and word reached Catholic Charities housing administrators about her need.
She loves the one-bedroom apartment that has been home since June. There is a tree from her podiatrist that came with the $14.81 price tag attached, stuffed animals from her grandchildren, and myriad refrigerator ornaments including one that says, "Specialty of the House: Love." She has taught her new friends in the recreation room to play a card and dice game they love.
"God's been good to me," Mrs. Barry said. "I mean, sure, I've had problems all these years. I have arthritis in my knee, but I keep walking and everything."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK;
Steinbrenner's Quirks Worth the Wait

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The man who spends more money on players than anyone in baseball history has a quirky economic personality. George Steinbrenner finances the first payroll that soars beyond $100 million, but he holds the line at giving Mike Mussina $15 million a year, approving $14.75 million instead. He outspends every other team taking risks in signing Cuban defectors and other Latin players, but he doesn't sign Derek Jeter to a multiyear contract because he is waiting for some other team to establish a new salary plateau.
But most inexplicable of all, for years, has been the way Steinbrenner has squandered money, lots of money, by refusing to sign his good young players to multiyear contracts. 
 Taking note of the Yankees' $113 million payroll this year, an agent said: "This same team could be an 80 or 85 million-dollar payroll. The Yankees would be in the top 10, but they wouldn't be No. 1 and getting slammed all the time."
If Steinbrenner had adopted the successful practice of the Cleveland Indians, who signed many young prospects to long-term deals, the agent suggested, players like Jeter, Bernie Williams, Andy Pettitte, Mariano Rivera and Jorge Posada could have been signed early at a tremendous savings.
"They could have been locked up well under market value," he said. "The core of the team could have been signed."
Commissioner Bud Selig, who has to deal with the payroll disparity the Yankees help create, said he found the theory interesting but added, "It's also highly speculative in the case of some of the young players."
The Yankees signed Pettitte to a three-year contract last winter, but he was already only a year away from free agency. They offered Rivera a four-year, $36 million contract, but he was going into his sixth season (they recently offered him $27 million for three years). They came close to signing Jeter to a seven-year deal, but Steinbrenner threw up the stop sign before the money that the Yankees and Casey Close, Jeter's agent, were discussing -- about $118.5 million -- could be presented as a formal offer.
The Detroit Tigers, unconcerned about creating the highest-paid player, made Juan Gonzalez an offer whose average annual value would have been slightly higher than Jeter's, and Steinbrenner wanted to wait until that deal was done so he could say he wasn't establishing any standards with Jeter. But Gonzalez never accepted the offer, and the Yankees never made theirs to their shortstop.
Now, one year later, and with Jeter only a year from free agency, the cost will be greater. An official estimated that the Yankees would have to give Jeter more than seven years, perhaps eight or nine, and a higher annual average, $18.5 million or more. Instead of a $118.5 million commitment, it could be a minimum of $166.5 million. A contract delayed is a contract escalated. Two years ago the Yankees signed Williams, a free agent, to a seven-year, $87.5 million contract. If a few years earlier they had negotiated a long-term deal, instead of going year by year and fighting him in salary arbitration, they could have saved millions.
Consider the Indians' strategy with Jim Thome, whose career paralleled Williams's through their first six years. Signing Thome to a four-year contract before he had played a full major league season, the Indians paid him $9.8 million in the same five-year period the Yankees paid Williams $17,125,000.
Steinbrenner did not return a call seeking an explanation for his approach, but, asked once before, he said he might change his ways. Then, he added: "What happens if a pitcher you sign for $5 million tears his rotor cuff and never pitches again? That's an awful lot of money to be gambling."
He also lamented the change he said had occurred in negotiations for younger players. "The way it was originally, the teams had the advantage in the earlier years," he said. "Players had theirs in later years. Now what has happened is players and their agents are forgetting that the first years are to be for the benefit of ownership and the team. Then when they served some time it would be to their advantage. Unfortunately, they want to remember one-half of it. The whole thing has gotten askew."
Based on their signing of Mussina last week, some people have speculated that the Yankees' payroll will soar again to astronomical heights next season. However, the Yankees will pay Mussina $10 million next year, $2 million less than they paid David Cone this year.
Their biggest increases would come with the salaries of Jeter and Rivera, but the Yankees could keep their pay at a reasonable level next year if they sign them to multiyear deals and pay out most of the money in the latter years of the contracts. That is what they will do with Mussina, whose six-year contract calls for 62 percent of his salary to be paid in the final three years. By that time, they will be finished paying Roger Clemens the $30.9 million in his new contract.
 
A Raise for Middle Relievers
Talk of suspected collusion against free agents arose last month, but there is no evidence of it among the ranks of setup relief pitchers. Long one of the lowest-paid groups, the relievers have made a breakthrough this off-season.
The Philadelphia Phillies, who with the Anaheim Angels are the most glaring examples of big-market teams that have been operated as if they were low-revenue teams, triggered the salary escalation. First the Phillies signed Jose Mesa to a two-year, $6.8 million contract; then they added Rheal Cormier for three years at $8.75 million.
The Mets jumped in with both fists full of dollars, significantly raising their offers to John Franco and Turk Wendell when they were faced with the threat of losing them. They gave Franco $10.5 million and Wendell $9.4 million, each for three years.
The Seattle Mariners were on the verge of an agreement with Jeff Nelson on a three-year deal for $10.65 million after the Yankees refused to go higher than $9 million.
 
Rangers Go for Rodriguez
 
 It would probably be the least likely move of the off-season, but a baseball official said Alex Rodriguez could wind up signing with the Texas Rangers. The official said that Tom Hicks, the Rangers' owner, "fell in love" with Rodriguez when he had dinner with him last week, and he told Scott Boras, the shortstop's agent, that he was prepared to do whatever was necessary to sign him. Before the meeting, Rodriguez had never thought about going to Texas.
A frequently asked question last week in baseball circles: why would the Mets offer Mike Mussina $87.5 million for six years and indicate a willingness to go higher and not have made a similar offer to their own free-agent pitcher, Mike Hampton, when they still had exclusive rights to him?
 
Going the Distance, and Then Some
In the middle of the World Series, there appeared in a column on the Op-Ed page of this newspaper this statement: "Baseball is the only thing in the world that drags on longer than the presidential elections."
That World Series, the Subway Series between the Yankees and the Mets, has been long over. It lasted five games and six days. The presidential election, which began Nov. 7, is still going; and, like the Energizer Bunny, going and going and going. Today it is 27 days old. The Yankees were World Series champions for the third consecutive year for nearly six weeks, more than half of that time waiting, along with everyone else, to find out if a Democrat would win the presidency for the third consecutive term.
None of the 96 World Series lasted as long as this presidential election. Only five lasted longer than 10 days, the longest 15 days. The reasons they went even that long had nothing to do with an inability to determine which team scored more runs, which team might have been unfairly prevented from using a player, which team might have had runners reach home plate but maybe just missed touching home plate and weren't tagged either.
Those five World Series were extended beyond the maximum number of days (nine) that the maximum number of games (seven) should take because of natural forces. Now it's true that no presidential election has been postponed or delayed because of rain, cold weather or earthquakes, but no World Series has been delayed for days or weeks by the managers of the two teams arguing over the score.
This election controversy could have been avoided. Before he went into politics, when he was managing partner of the Texas Rangers, George W. Bush said he was interested in becoming baseball commissioner. He waited and waited and waited for a sign from Bud Selig, then the interim commissioner, who was saying twice a day that he did not want the job on a permanent basis. But the sign never came. So Bush ran for governor of Texas, and the rest is history.
 
From Agent to Executive
When Dennis Gilbert, a former player agent, was hired last week as a special assistant to Jerry Reinsdorf, the Chicago White Sox owner, he said he was unaware of another instance in which a prominent agent joined a team's front office. A remedial course in baseball history for Mr. Gilbert:
Jerry Kapstein, the star agent of the first free-agent class of 1976, left the business in 1989 about a year after he married Linda Smith, whose mother, Joan Kroc, owned the San Diego Padres. In November 1989, Kroc asked Kapstein to help in the sale of the club. The following February she named him chief executive of the Padres. Two months later, he resigned when Smith filed for divorce. Kapstein left baseball and worked with the homeless in San Diego. In 1997, he was named to the Padres' board, where he continues serving under his formal name, Jeremy.

HEADLINE: CONTESTING THE VOTE: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
Bush, Acting Presidential, Meets Leaders of Congress

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI with ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Dec. 2

 BODY:
Pressing forward with his planning for the presidency, Gov. George W. Bush met for more than three hours today with Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, to discuss a strategy for enacting tax cuts, education measures and other items on his legislative agenda.
The meeting at Mr. Bush's ranch near Waco, Tex., along with arrangements that his aides made for photographs and videotape of the participants, was the latest signal that despite continued legal wrangling over the election, the Texas governor was molding himself as the inevitable president-elect. 
 As Mr. Bush, his running mate, Dick Cheney, and the Republican Congressional leaders sat in casual clothing around a fireplace inside a house in the ranch, the scene provided a pointed -- and, no doubt, intentional -- contrast to the prolonged, tedious discussions under way in a Florida courtroom.
But the meeting also underscored Mr. Bush's concern, given the messy end of the election and a new Congress that will be narrowly divided along party lines, with being able to accomplish the legislative goals he outlined in his campaign, several Bush advisers said.
The brief comments that the quartet of leaders made before the meeting acknowledged that potentially daunting reality, and the men sought to separate themselves from the partisan free-for-all into which the presidential election has descended, stressing their desire to work across party lines.
Ticking off items on his agenda like tax cuts, changes to Medicare, prescription drug coverage for elderly Americans, strengthening the military and overhauling Social Security, Mr. Bush said: "This isn't a Republican agenda. It's not a Democrat agenda."
"As a matter of fact," he said, "this election, and the fact that it's been as close as it's been and as drawn out as it is, requires a group of citizens that rise above partisanship and do what's right for the country, more so than ever in recent modern history."
But the kind of resistance Mr. Bush may encounter was illustrated by an exchange with Mr. Lott, a Mississippi Republican, and Mr. Hastert, an Illinois Republican, in the meeting, one Bush adviser said.
The adviser said that Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney floated the idea of looking for a Democrat to fill the position of treasury secretary, and that Mr. Hastert and Mr. Lott were strongly opposed to it.
In his earlier comments to reporters, Mr. Bush said that he had talked by telephone on Friday with Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat, who leads a group of moderate Democrats in the Senate and whose Medicare proposals Mr. Bush has often described in approving terms.
Mr. Breaux has been mentioned in recent news reports as a potential cabinet choice, although not for the treasury post. But Bette Phelan, a spokeswoman for Mr. Breaux, said today that the two men had not talked about administration jobs. Ms. Phelan said they had discussed Medicare, along with the possibility of education being an issue that could yield bipartisan consensus.
Mr. Lott said he had already talked with Mr. Cheney about the "delicate situation" of a Senate with a 50-50 split of Republicans and Democrats. He said he had told Mr. Cheney that the best way to deal with the divide was "very gingerly, and with your vote." If Mr. Cheney becomes the vice president, he will have the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.
In their quest to build public support for the idea that Mr. Bush is the de facto president-elect, Mr. Bush, Mr. Cheney and their allies have stressed the importance of moving forward with transition planning. Mr. Lott and Mr. Hastert were snugly on that script today, emphasizing the need to begin preparing immediately for the work of the next Congress.
A senior Republican aide in Congress said that the meeting was arranged largely to amplify an aura of inevitability around Mr. Bush, and Bush advisers said before the discussion today that it was likely to be fairly broad. Bush advisers who were reached after it ended said they had not yet received a full report on it. One Bush aide said that the men had discussed everything that they and their Republican allies had telegraphed that it would.
That included Mr. Bush's legislative priorities. Although more attention over the last week has focused on how Mr. Bush may fill cabinet posts, he and his advisers have also been discussing how best to proceed with his legislative agenda, contemplating the most prudent, effective way to package legislation and the best order for tackling issues.
For example, these advisers said, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney have considered a strategy of starting with proposals that are most likely to generate bipartisan support -- education, for instance, as opposed to Social Security. One adviser said late today that Mr. Bush, Mr. Cheney, Mr. Lott and Mr. Hastert had talked about ways to build a bipartisan coalition for education measures.
Mr. Lott and Mr. Hastert, in their comments before the meeting, emphasized the importance of that issue, and earlier this week, Mr. Bush spoke by telephone with three prominent Republican members of the House Committee on Education and the Work Force.
Advisers also said that Mr. Bush might try to push for less contentious aspects of his tax-cut plan, like the elimination of the so-called marriage penalty and the reduction of inheritance taxes, before addressing across-the-board rate cuts. That approach, which one adviser said was also discussed today, might bring Mr. Bush some initial victories instead of a bitter, grinding debate.
"It's much easier to argue over a big enchilada than an individual taco," the adviser said.
But Mr. Bush said today that the importance of a sweeping tax cut was highlighted by signs and forecasts of an economic slowdown. He has long said that such a tax cut would stimulate the economy.
The nearly even divide of power between Republicans and Democrats in Congress will present a challenge on that front as well as others.
"You've got this very ambitious agenda that Governor Bush laid out during the campaign -- reforming Social Security, education, Medicare and defense," said Representative Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, who is one of Mr. Bush's closest allies on Capitol Hill.
"That's a lot to do, even in optimal times, even if we had increased our majorities," Mr. Portman said today. "With the razor-thin majorities, this is going to be even more of a challenge. But it's one that I believe his commitment to, and record of, bipartisanship will make possible."
Representative Ray LaHood, an Illinois Republican, was less optimistic.
"Before all this controversy in Florida, I thought Bush could be a lot more aggressive in his first 90 to 120 days," Mr. LaHood said today.
"Now," he added, "I'm a lot more cautious. Bush has to be really realistic about his tax cuts, for instance."
During his campaign, Mr. Bush leaned more heavily on support from fellow Republican governors than on support from Republicans in Congress.
At times, he distanced himself from the latter group, casting himself as a Washington outsider, implicating Republicans in Congress in the bitterly partisan atmosphere in the nation's capital and insinuating that they were not sensitive enough to the needs of struggling Americans.
So today's meeting was also a matter of forming closer ties to Mr. Lott and Mr. Hastert, with whom Mr. Bush has not spent all that much time. "I'm soon to be the insider," Mr. Bush said. "I'm soon to be the president."
"There will be disagreements," he added. "But our pledge is that we'll have disagreements in a respectful way."
One early legislative test will be the push by many lawmakers, led by Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, for an overhaul of campaign finance laws. Mr. Bush did not identify that as a priority in the campaign, and Mr. McCain has advocated some changes with which Mr. Bush strongly disagrees. Mr. McCain has already begun contacting Senate colleagues to press his case.
"We believe we have at least 58 to 59 votes now," Mark Buse, one of his senior aides, said today, "and can easily hit 60." That is the number that breaks a filibuster.
Mr. LaHood said that Mr. McCain, who was Mr. Bush's chief rival in the Republican primaries, was perfectly positioned to hold sway with Mr. Bush, given the Arizona senator's power, popularity and efforts to help Mr. Bush in the general election.
Mr. Bush's remarks before today's meeting gave him another opportunity to stress anew that every vote count in Florida had put him in the lead. That state's 25 electoral votes would make him the next president.
"That's why we're in the process of preparing to assume the offices to which we feel we've been elected," Mr. Bush said, speaking of himself and Mr. Cheney.
Mr. Bush, Mr. Cheney, Mr. Lott and Mr. Hastert struck relaxed, convivial poses in front of a crackling fire. Mr. Lott wore a jean jacket and, at one point, a Stetson-style cowboy hat with a gargantuan feather in it.
Referring to Mr. Hastert and Mr. Lott, Mr. Bush said, "I promised both of these leaders that I'm going to cook them a good hamburger."

HEADLINE: An Ailing Russia Lives a Tough Life That's Getting Shorter

SERIES: FREEDOM'S TOLL: Why Russians Are Dying Younger

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: PITKYARANTA, Russia

 BODY:
When the chest pains first gripped him that February day in 1998, Anatoly Iverianov was driving a tractor through one of the birch-and-pine forests that carpet Russia's border with Finland, dragging fresh-cut logs to a wood lot.
"I had a glass of vodka," he said. "I thought that would help." 
 It didn't. Mr. Iverianov was having a heart attack. Within six months he suffered another. Two years later, he is disabled, impoverished, embittered and sick -- so sick he has been in the local hospital three times since August.
Standing in his crumbling hillside apartment, in a Brezhnev-era block overlooking the paper factory, Mr. Iverianov added up the negatives: his disability pension is a pittance; he is bored and useless at home; hospitalization gives him no respite from illness.
"I've been drinking and smoking a lot," he said defiantly. "And I'm not alone."
Quite the opposite: two years after two heart attacks, 45-year-old Anatoly Iverianov is a Russian Everyman.
In a country whose most overworked word is "krizis" -- crisis -- here is a genuine one: Russian life expectancy has fallen in 6 of the last 10 years.
It fell every month last year alone, to an average of 65.9 years for both men and women -- about 10 years less than in the United States, and on a par with levels in Guatemala. Moreover, government statistics through last August point to a further drop in 2000.
It is a sore-thumb symptom of a precipitous decline in Russia's public health, a spiral not seen in a developed nation since the Great Depression, if then. Life expectancy is not just a medical issue but a barometer of a society's health. In a sense it is a lagging indicator of poverty, of stress, of cohesion and stability -- and of a government's ability or willingness to take care of its own.
Since 1990, according to the most recent figures, the death rate has risen almost one-third, to the highest of any major nation, and the birth rate has dropped almost 40 percent, making it among the very lowest. Mortality from circulatory diseases has jumped by a fifth; from suicides, a third; from alcohol-related causes, almost 60 percent; from infectious and parasitic diseases, nearly 100 percent.
Not all the toll was registered in deaths. The rate of newly disabled people rose by half.
When Russia's death rate surpassed its plunging birth rate in the mid-90's, demographers called it the Russian cross and suggested that it had profound implications.
By a United Nations estimate, Russia's population of 145.6 million could shrink to 121 million by 2050. In a report early this year, the Central Intelligence Agency forecast that by 2002, 1 in 70 Russians will carry H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS -- almost twice the United States rate. Tuberculosis, once nearly under control, is epidemic, and the C.I.A. says shortages of money and medicine "are creating the context for a large increase in infectious diseases."
Infections are only one factor in Russia's premature deaths. The leading killers are cardiovascular disease and violence, and the victims are not the elderly so much as young and middle-aged men. They are the working backbone that in theory should be available to help rebuild this nation. But the average citizen downs a world-record 4.4 gallons of alcohol a year. Reflecting that, accidents and violence have passed cancer as the leading cause of death after heart disease, something unthinkable for a modern nation.
Russian leaders sound increasingly apocalyptic. President Vladimir V. Putin has warned of an emerging "senile nation," too old and feeble to compete globally.
And the intelligence agencies in the United States believe that the deteriorating public health picture in Russia, and in the hospitals and clinics struggling to deal with it, could lead to political upheaval at worst and relief emergencies at best.
Such gloom is not unrelieved. After plunging in the early 1990's, life spans rose steadily from 1995 to 1998 before sliding again. Drinking has declined from mid-1990's highs. And in cities, there is growing -- and crucial -- awareness that good health is no longer the state's problem, but an individual duty.
Nor is the problem irreversible. Soviet health improved greatly, if briefly, after Mikhail S. Gorbachev cracked down on alcohol abuse in the late 1980's. Russia's current health minister, a cardiologist, favors reshaping medicine to emphasize prevention as well as treatment -- and appears to have Kremlin backing.
One senior Clinton administration official who is a Russia expert says dire scenarios of a shrunken nation fragmented into feuding fiefs or at war with a growing Islamic minority are overstated. But his forecast is little better: an ever-poorer, more miserable land, running down slowly like a clock long unwound.
Thomas Graham, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, says the decade's trends are markers not just of bad health but social crisis.
"In a word," he said, "it means that we have a Russia that's in decline. The long-term tasks facing Russia now are quite daunting. And Russia, at this point, just doesn't have the resources to deal with that."
Poverty has hastened the decline. Russia's elaborate system of state-run health care is even more desperately underfinanced now than in Soviet times. Hospitals are critically short of money, drugs and even syringes. The Soviet concept of free and universal medical care, however desultory in the past, now exists in name only. Paying for care, on or under the table, is the norm.
But money is only one problem.
The greater problem, far more difficult to gauge, is the collapse of the Soviet framework, which essentially propped up society: the guaranteed pay envelope, the free housing and child care, the cheap vodka, the numbing relief of having no responsibility for the future because the state carried it all, the sense of being part of a great empire.
Especially outside the big cities, that crumpled framework has left behind a wreck of despair, deep insecurity, poverty and even shame. And the ravages of the Russian loss are evident in the self-destructive quality of the mortality data: wholly preventable accidents, heart attacks, homicides and suicides whose rates, always high by Western standards, abruptly vaulted off the charts with the arrival of freedom.
"There was a psychological shock," said Vladimir M. Shkolnikov, a Russian demographer at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, Germany, and a leading expert on his country's mortality crisis. "It's the pace of reform. It's labor force turnover, the magnitude of change in the labor market. It's life style and alcohol, because alcohol consumption is a very important force in the large jump in mortality."
 
Vodka, Cigarettes and Death
Robust health has never been this land's defining trait. Soviet medical care was rationed by party rank and loyalty. As befit a system that saw people as cogs, the masses got enough to get them to farm or factory -- and little more. The Communist solution to high infant mortality was to subsidize births. Vodka and cigarettes, red meat and butter were state-promoted balms for a cruel life.
And when such policies began reaping a harvest of rising death and illness in the 1970's and 1980's, the Kremlin's response was to stamp the damning statistics secret. It is clear now that Russian life expectancy peaked at 68.8 years in 1965 and, but for a brief aberration in the 1980's, had fallen about nine months by the time the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
The Soviet government bears much blame for that. Western nations spent one in eight dollars on health in the 1980's. The Soviet Union spent barely 1 in 30 dollars of a far smaller income -- and walled itself off from breakthrough drugs and devices that Western investments reaped.
Not that Anatoly Iverianov sees it this way. Asked when his life took its turn for the worse, he did not hesitate. "The moment the Union ended," he said.
From Mr. Iverianov's four-story stucco apartment block in the center of Pitkyaranta, the capital of a verdant, lake-flecked swatch of northeast Russia, it is barely an hour to the Finnish border.
But that is the wrong yardstick. The true distance from Pitkyaranta to Finland is measured in years, not hours.
In Pitkyaranta, a newborn boy can expect to live just past age 57 1/2, about as long as a boy in Yemen or Nepal. An hour north, a Finnish boy can expect to live nearly 15 years beyond that, almost as long as an American. A Pitkyaranta girl can look forward to living 72 years -- as long as a girl in Peru. A Finnish girl should make it past 79, roughly as long as an American.
"You won't find any other land border in the world where there's such a sharp difference," said Pekka Puska, a doctor and expert on Russia at Finland's National Public Health Institute.
Much of Pitkyaranta's district could be mistaken for Finland: lakeside dachas besieged by snow-covered potato vines; hillside boulders discarded by retreating glaciers.
But it is a surface likeness. Pitkyaranta and the Missouri-size province that surrounds it, Karelia, are among the unhealthiest places to live in western Russia. The Russian cross is on full display here: twice as many people died in Pitkyaranta last year as were born, almost precisely the reverse of the situation 20 years ago.
To see why, talk to Galina Pritchiyev, 55, dark-haired, stout and stoic, who lives in Ryaimyalya, a bankrupt collective-farm village of unpainted cabins and untethered cattle about 25 miles south of Pitkyaranta.
Mrs. Pritchiyev has hypertension. So does her husband, a retired tractor driver who had a heart attack in 1992, at 53. So do half the men and women in Pitkyaranta district, which includes her village.
That makes sense. High blood pressure is caused by a fatty diet, obesity, excess alcohol and lack of exercise, all in abundance here. The Pritchiyevs get pensions totaling about $50 a month -- enough for milk, butter, bread and oil from the market, and little else. A few calves provide beef; a garden produces potatoes and tomatoes.
Exercise for its own sake is unheard of, and with jobs scarce, she said, few even benefit from farm labor. The young people have all left; nobody will work for the 500 rubles (about $18) that a dairymaid or other unskilled worker makes in a month.
"So a lot of people have started to drink," Mrs. Pritchiyev said. "They drink samogon, spirits, whatever," she explained, using a word for a poisonous-smelling home-brewed vodka. "They drink from boredom. There's no work. And there is very little hope."
The Pitkyaranta hospital physician who works with alcoholics, Dr. Mikhail Lipovetsky, echoes that. "The samogon made here causes very serious damage to the liver and heart," he said, but added that drinking it was "one of the few ways families without any money can entertain themselves."
The consequences are evident at the local morgue. Compared with numbers from 1990, the rolls of last year's dead make telling reading.
In 1990, 277 people died in Pitkyaranta district. Last year, 422 died. In 1990, cardiovascular disease claimed 147 lives. Last year it claimed 220.
In 1990 there were 38 alcohol-related deaths, from homicides and suicides to accidents and poisonings. Last year there were 90 -- overwhelmingly among men under 60.
Not least, 7 of Pitkyaranta district's 26,800 souls died last year of acute alcohol poisoning -- one more than the previous year's total fatal alcohol poisonings in Illinois, population 12.1 million.
"There's no simple answer as to why male life expectancy is so short in Russia," said Dr. Mikhail Uhanov, 56, the hospital's chief physician. "But you could probably say drinking is in first place. In every courtyard, you can buy a bottle of vodka made of who knows what, even here in this little town.
"Sometimes people realize how harmful it is to their health. And they don't value their health enough to care."
Officially, vodka is not a problem for Pitkyaranta district. The number of registered alcoholics -- those who seek treatment from Dr. Lipovetsky -- totals 164. Privately, however, officials say the number is closer to 4,000.
In the 1980's, doctors seldom saw more than two or three cases of alcoholic psychosis a year. This summer, during Pitkyaranta's two-week-long White Nights Festival, there were 14.
Vladimir was one of them. During White Nights, he passed out drunk on the floor of the town's huge lakeside paper mill and woke up in the hospital. He has been back three times since then, each time to dry out from two-week binges on 80-cent liter bottles of samogon.
"I wouldn't say it's that hard to quit," he said recently, with the rheumy-eyed conviction of a man who has quit many times.
What is more interesting, however, is why a 45-year-old man with a wife and two children binges at all. One answer is that his life crumbled along with the Communist experiment.
In 1990, Vladimir had been at the paper mill 20 years and was making 300 rubles a month, then about $180. His wife held a high-ranking job at the local food depot. In Soviet society most essentials were free, so their life was comfortable.
The Soviet Union vanished in 1991. So did the old rules: Vladimir's wife argued with her bosses and soon found herself jobless, an impossibility in Soviet times, when the unemployed either accepted new work or were exiled.
"She wasn't able to find anything for a year," Vladimir said, "and then she tried to start a private store. That worked for two years or so, and then that went bankrupt."
It was about then, in 1995, that alcoholic psychosis first sent Vladimir to the hospital. Things got worse. Money problems shuttered the paper mill, and for perhaps a year there was no pay. The mill reopened, but in 1998, Russia's economy crashed and Vladimir's salary, 1,000 inflated rubles, was suddenly worth $35.
His wife found work that year as a sales clerk. Vladimir, by then a hospital regular, was moved off the papermaking line and handed a broom.
One child is away at school now. The rest of the family lives in a two-room apartment in a brick-and-wood tenement, on a diet of macaroni, potatoes and cucumbers, the occasional herring and "only a little bit of meat."
"They don't pay me anything like pay," he said. "It's like kopecks. And the prices in the stores -- my pay would go into a kilo of sausage."
Would that it did. A typical binge can eat up a third of Vladimir's monthly wages.
It is an old story, said Dr. Uhanov, the chief physician. "There are many men who lost their jobs, or if they kept their jobs, they were not paid as much. Their alcohol consumption increased despite the fact that they didn't have enough money. It's typical of Russia."
Ask Vladimir why he drinks, and the answer comes slowly.
"I can't explain it straightaway," he said. "I have a home. But I have nothing to do."
Ask Dr. Lipovetsky, and he answers readily: "Social reasons. That, and a lack of belief in the future. A lot of people drink from a loss of belief.
"It's the same way across most of Russia. You don't need a lot of statistics to show that. It's obvious."
 
Neighbors, Decades Apart
Two hours north of Pitkyaranta, in the pristine Finnish town of Joensuu, Vesa Tuominen has a markedly different idea of how to spend his time. The thermometer has yet to hit 45, and a cold drizzle soaks the bike paths that weave through town. Mr. Tuominen, oblivious to the rain, is stretching after a brisk 25-minute jog.
He is not finished. Shortly, he will strip from his sweats to a swimsuit for a dip in one of Joensuu's frigid lakes, indulging in a predilection he shares with about 900 others in the local Ice Bears Club.
Of course, not all of them are like Mr. Tuominen, a retired schoolteacher, 65. Some are considerably older.
"We have some swimmers who are 80," he said.
Joensuu, population 51,000, is the capital of North Karelia, the Finnish district directly opposite Pitkyaranta. It seems everything Pitkyaranta is not. Crowds of cyclists ignore rain and even plow through snow; a lit cigarette draws stares; the usual drink is beer, not vodka. The average man in Joensuu can expect to outlive his Pitkyaranta neighbor by 15 years.
Yet three decades ago, the life span difference was measured not in years but months.
Joensuu was then the center of an impoverished region dependent on timber for survival. In both towns, people drank heavily, ate poorly and smoked ceaselessly. And both towns recorded the highest rates of cardiovascular disease on earth.
In the 1950's a Finnish researcher noticed that lumberjacks in North Karelia suffered frequent heart attacks despite jobs that kept them exceptionally fit. A 1970 study found that exercise was not the only key factor in cardiovascular health. Diet and smoking made it onto the radar screens.
Finland's response was the North Karelia Project, a five-year effort to cut heart deaths by changing people's habits. It was a scorched-earth campaign against cigarettes and butter, a combination of modern medicine and state-of-the-art propaganda.
Local legislators passed one of the world's first bans on smoking in public places. To accentuate the positive, no-smoking areas were renamed smoke-free zones. Shopkeepers and trade groups joined to spread the message, then novel, that heart disease was preventable.
Dairy farmers were converted to growing the sweet berries that flourish in Finland's 20-hour summer days, simultaneously reducing artery-clogging milk fat and adding heart-friendly vitamin C to diets.
The results were so remarkable that the program was adopted nationally. The latest survey, in 1997, showed North Karelians had cut death from heart failure among working-age residents by some 70 percent in just 25 years, and slashed lung cancer deaths by 70 percent.
From 1974 to last year, life expectancy in Joensuu rose almost eight years for men and almost six for women. And little North Karelia now has nearly 300 berry farms, compared with only a few 30 years ago.
The program is now so ingrained that it is a point of local pride, its director, Vesa Korpelainen, said during a recent chat in his downtown Joensuu office.
And that is part of its secret. "We've done this work boots-in-the-mud," he said. "We've gone all around North Karelia. People come to us when we have an activity in a grocery store or some other place and say, 'I'm also participating in the North Karelia Project.' "
Until this region fell under final Soviet control after World War II, Pitkyaranta was largely Finnish. Its name is Finnish. While most Finns fled north when the Red Army moved in, Finnish blood still flows here.
It is tempting to believe that what worked in North Karelia will work in Pitkyaranta. And in 1992, Finnish researchers came to Pitkyaranta with precisely that in mind.
Dr. Uhanov is the point man for Finnish research here, the leader of perhaps 20 hard-core volunteers trying to re-create Joensuu's success. They have plastered the walls of the hospital, the open-air market and other public places with posters, and begged for television time so they could condemn butter and praise fruit.
They have held health fairs, delivered lectures and staged quit-smoking contests, awarding Finland vacations to the lucky few who can stay off tobacco for a month.
And they have scored modest successes. The last detailed survey, in 1997, showed that smoking fell about 10 percent among younger men. It also leaped almost 50 percent among young women, a rise nevertheless lower than in Russia at large.
Residents used less butter and more cooking oils -- largely because times are harder, and margarine and oil are cheaper than butter. More were eating fruit daily, though still barely 10 percent, and women were eating more fresh vegetables.
"The men say salads are not a man's food," said Dr. Svetlana Pokusayeva, a leader of the Pitkyaranta effort. "But nevertheless, there are changes. It's a combination of economic factors and our propaganda."
The most important change, says Tiina Laatikainen, a researcher on the Pitkyaranta project at the Finnish Public Health Institute, is that residents' knowledge about their health has increased remarkably.
That said, eight years of evangelizing have not reaped a quick conversion as in Joensuu. That speaks to the depth and tenacity of Russia's health problems, Dr. Laatikainen said -- and to its economic ones, too.
"The most difficult things have been the social and economic pressures," she said. "People are not willing to change their life styles when they have to struggle to survive a normal life."
 
Many Links in a Chain of Misery
No one could expect Pitkyaranta to match Joensuu's early success. The Finns had merely to raise life expectancy. The Russians must stop it from plummeting.
"The big message is that there isn't a single cause," Martin McKee, a leading scholar on Russian public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said in a recent interview. "It's a chain of causation, with alcohol and stress playing major roles. We need to understand, why do people drink? And why are the consequences so grave? And a decade, 15 years after it all started, we're still floundering around, with far too little information."
In many nations, the response to such shocks would be addiction treatment and psychiatric help. Russia has few such cushions to offer.
Psychiatry is still emerging from the Soviet dark ages, when a diagnosis of mental illness was a political weapon. That remains true in parts of Russia, according to an October report by Moscow Helsinki Group, the human rights watchdog.
Mental hospitals, even more grossly underfinanced than the rest of the health system, are often true warehouses: St. Petersburg Psychiatric Hospital No. 3, for example, is 130 years old and houses 2,000 patients, twice its capacity. Alcoholics Anonymous, long banned from the Soviet Union, established programs in some Russian cities in the 1990's, and its 12-step treatment method is emulated by some churches and charities. But only a tiny fraction of alcoholics get intensive treatment. The majority are left, with their families, to fend for themselves.
The director general of the World Health Organization, Gro Harlem Brundtland, said in an interview that there was no reason for pessimism about Russia's situation, despite alarming rises in disease and an admittedly inefficient medical system. She said that political leaders understood the scope of their nation's crisis and the urgent need to address it, and that a mending economy would provide money for health programs and improve living conditions.
And she said there were quick fixes to some problems: ending 24-hour vodka sales and curbing cigarette advertising, for example.
Of course, alcoholism and disease are not confined to Russia. Poor health habits place American life spans squarely in the middle range of developed nations. For all its leading-edge technology, the American health care system is no model of efficiency for Russians to emulate.
But building a modern health system takes years and billions of dollars that Russia does not have. And as for weaning the country from ingrained habits, when President Gorbachev imposed a series of restrictions on alcohol, he was nearly toppled from power. Any such undertaking would pose a formidable challenge for leaders today.
Mending Russia's shattered health will take all that and something more difficult: surgery on millions of dark Russian souls like that of Anatoly Iverianov, the 45-year-old heart patient and former woodsman. Mr. Iverianov is a caricature of what ails the country. He treats chest pain with vodka. He smokes -- not much, he contends, though "just sitting around, I can smoke a whole pack, especially after a good drink." His diet is "whatever you got -- no delicacies, of course," which translates into bread, potatoes and the occasional chicken.
Household life is hard. Mr. Iverianov receives a $35-a-month disability pension. His wife gets about $18 a month for cleaning a local school. That must feed and clothe the two of them and two sons, 23 and 7.
It is not enough. "I've got three specialties from school, and already I can't get a job in any of them," said Viktor, the elder son, already an angry, arm-waving clone of his father. "In the last two years we've moved three times to smaller places to save money."
This is what independence gave the Iverianovs: the ability to sell their home in order to survive. But with two rooms and a kitchen for the four of them, they have little left now to sell.
To more than a few experts, Russia's problem is not just whether a rising economy will lift the boat. It is whether a society that has demolished a thousand-year compact -- a loaf of bread and a bed in exchange for the loss of all individuality -- now regards its masses as people, not expendable parts in some vast machine.
In that respect, the experts say, a decade of falling life spans, so far unaddressed, is not encouraging.
"In a sense, Russia has a life expectancy which we've managed to earn," said Sergei Ermakov, a principal demographer at the Research Public Health Institute in Moscow. "Russia has never spared resources. There has always been lots of wood, lots of water, lots of iron ore, lots of land and lots of people. And the attitude taken by the Russian leadership toward the people wasn't any different."
Mr. Iverianov would not argue with that. "In general, this isn't working," he said. "Basically, the country itself has fallen apart and into bankruptcy. And now I'm waiting for them to turn the lights off here."
Mr. Iverianov's story does not have a happy ending.
Just before 3 p.m. on Nov. 21, he was brought once more to Central Clinical Hospital by ambulance, this time displaying a weak pulse and almost no blood pressure. Doctors suspected a heart attack. Three hours later he died.
An autopsy concluded that he had been killed by fluid in the lungs and heart failure due to chronic alcoholism.
Mr. Iverianov would have turned 46 this month.

HEADLINE: In Terrorism Trial, Just Picking the Jurors Is a Challenge

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER 

 BODY:
As concerns grow about the difficulty of finding an impartial jury for a major terrorism trial scheduled to start next month in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the judge in the case says he plans to screen at least 1,500 people, one of the largest jury pools ever in a federal criminal case.
The trial set to start on Jan. 3 involves four defendants indicted on charges that they participated in a global terrorism conspiracy that included the bombings of two United States Embassies in East Africa in 1998. 
 More than 200 people were killed and thousands of others were injured in the two embassy blasts, which prosecutors say were organized by Osama bin Laden, who has been indicted in the case but remains a fugitive and is believed to be living in Afghanistan. The bombing suspects are being tried in New York because federal prosecutors in Manhattan were actively investigating Mr. bin Laden for other terrorism acts predating the embassy explosions.
The decision to screen such a large pool of prospective jurors stems from concerns by the judge, Leonard B. Sand, and lawyers on both sides that publicity about the attacks and the continuing investigation of Mr. bin Laden's suspected involvement in other acts of terrorism would cause large numbers of people to be excused or removed from jury service. Twelve jurors and a group of alternates are needed for the trial. It is also thought that many prospective jurors may be reluctant to serve because the trial is expected to last at least nine months, requiring them to seek extended leaves of absence from their jobs.
Yet another reason for calling so many jurors is that two defendants face capital charges, the first federal death penalty case to go before a jury in Manhattan in nearly half a century. More prospective jurors are likely to be excused as lawyers for both sides petition Judge Sand to drop them because of their views on the death penalty.
The judge has indicated that all lawyers in the case must be sensitive to economic and personal hardships created by such a trial.
"In many areas, we are treading on new territory," Judge Sand said in a recent hearing. "We will be selecting a jury in a case that will take over nine months, which involves terrorism, which involves viewing perhaps pictures of blood and gore, and which involves the death penalty."
He said it seemed very likely that "a large majority of those initially called will seek to be excused."
A criminal defense lawyer who is not involved in the case, Gerald L. Shargel, observed, "There's no question about the fact that this is going to be one of the most difficult jury selections in history."
The case will be the fifth major terrorism trial held in New York in eight years, beginning with the trial in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. None of the earlier trials, though, required such a large jury pool. Nor was the death penalty a factor. Lawyers say the largest pool was about 600 people who were screened for the 1995 trial of a group of men convicted of plotting to blow up the United Nations and other landmarks in New York.
In a more recent case, in Colorado, about 1,000 prospective jurors were initially screened before the 1997 trial of Timothy J. McVeigh, who was convicted of murder and conspiracy in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, which killed 168 people and wounded more than 800.
A lawyer for Mr. McVeigh, Richard Burr, said that one challenge for defense lawyers in the embassy bombing case would be finding jurors who could stay focused on the evidence before them, and not on the crush of publicity about Mr. bin Laden and other acts of terrorism against Americans.
The authorities, for example, are investigating whether Mr. bin Laden was involved in the bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen in October, which killed 17 Americans. The four defendants on trial in New York have not been accused of any role in that act.
"The defense ought to be given great latitude in probing whether people can separate these folks from bin Laden," Mr. Burr said.
"This kind of case connects to a kind of archetype in our unconscious," he continued. "There is a fear of terrorism that in part is justified and in part is not, but it is there. It means that you are defending against something that's extraordinarily difficult to defend against."
Jurors will be paid a daily fee of $40, which rises to $50 after their 30th day of trial. They will be drawn from Manhattan and the Bronx, and Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties, which are part of the Southern District of New York.
Michael E. Tigar, a lawyer for the second defendant convicted in the Oklahoma City bombing, Terry L. Nichols, and a professor at American University's Washington College of Law, said the embassy bombings case involved "many hot-button issues."
"The prosecution presents these defendants as Arabs who allegedly are terrorists, and who allegedly killed Americans," Mr. Tigar said. "These are things about which your average person called in the Southern District of New York can have deep, deep feelings. What you need to do is probe behind that."
Judge Sand said at the hearing that the screening process would begin with each of the 1,500 prospective jurors' filling out a questionnaire. Hardship issues will be dealt with first, then jurors' attitudes and beliefs.
The judge, a co-author of the leading text on jury instructions, also made clear that he would be a staunch advocate for the prospective jurors.
"A minimum of 1,500 people are going to be involved in a process in which they will be told that the next year of their life may be devoted to things which are not of their choice," he said. "Some consideration has to be given to their rights and their interests."
But Judge Sand also made clear that no one would be granted an exemption merely because jury service would be inconvenient. "It has to cause an unacceptable amount of personal hardship," he said.
The courtroom debate that ensued shows the difficulties in deciding what is a legitimate hardship and in putting together a representative jury.
The court's jury administrator, Robert W. Rogers, offered examples of hypothetical hardship excuses that might be allowed, including jurors who would suffer severe economic loss like loss of salary or a year-end bonus because of lengthy service.
Another would be someone who works five minutes from home to be near an elderly parent, and has to return home at lunchtime to check on the parent, Mr. Rogers said in court. He also cited jurors who would have to travel 80 to 100 miles to the courthouse in Lower Manhattan.
Judge Sand said he was trying to streamline the process by having Mr. Rogers handle the initial review of questionnaires. That would save "days, maybe weeks of time," the judge said, explaining that otherwise, the lawyers would spend that amount of time in court listening, for example, "to the psychiatrist say he has patients, some of whom are seriously ill, who are dependent on him for care, and if he cannot accommodate his patients, not only will his practice suffer, but his patients will suffer."
"How long should we spend debating whether or not a hardship exemption should be granted to such a person?" the judge asked. "Or the schoolteacher, in these days of critical shortage of schoolteachers?" he went on. "How long will we spend debating whether or not a schoolteacher should be asked to give up a year of school time?"
A defense lawyer, Frederick H. Cohn, said the process might allow too many exceptions, resulting in a jury that was too homogenous, and filled with only retired "Con Ed workers and telephone workers, and no schoolteachers."
But Judge Sand said he had no intention of letting that happen. "We should make every effort," he said, "not to have a jury consisting solely of retirees and volunteers."
Mr. Cohn also questioned whether an unintended result of the process would be the screening out of members of minority groups. "We want jurors who are going to be able to sit and not worry about whether their family is going to starve," he said.
But Mr. Cohn told the judge that if after the hardship screening process was complete, he came into court and saw only "one black juror, you are going to have a challenge."
To which Judge Sand replied, "If it turns out not to be racially neutral, then I am sure you will tell me that."
At one point, another defense lawyer, David A. Ruhnke, suggested making the questionnaire more specific, asking prospective jurors to consider whether they had responsibility for the care of elderly parents or young children, or had prepaid vacations.
At that, Judge Sand was skeptical.
"What is the point?" he asked, suggesting that if such hardships did not occur to potential jurors, why give them any new ideas?

Future Myths, Adrift in the Sands of Time

BYLINE: By MARILYN STASIO 

 BODY:
If you were a television producer with a $20 million property in your care, would you hand it over to a guy who had played a zombie in a George Romero movie? You would, if you were Richard P. Rubinstein, who figured that John Harrison -- who got a screwdriver in the ear in the legendary horror movie "Dawn of the Dead" -- was just the person to write and direct "Frank Herbert's Dune," an epic-scaled, six-hour mini-series that is the Sci Fi channel's most ambitious project to date.
"I've had a lot of fun with that zombie story," said Mr. Rubinstein, who met Mr. Harrison 20 years ago in Pittsburgh, when he was producing the cult classic in which the tyro director played a ghoul. Their initial synergy continued over the years that Mr. Harrison served as assistant director on other Romero films that Mr. Rubinstein produced. But it wasn't their shared history in the bloody genre trenches that sealed the deal, according to the producer; it was Mr. Harrison's authorial style -- literary, theatrical and austerely classical. 
 "Dune" demanded no less. Since its publication in 1965, Frank Herbert's futuristic adventure has sold more than 12 million copies worldwide. Legions of fans are intimately familiar with every twist and turn of its epic fantasy plot, which pitches great dynastic houses into war over control of their galaxy's supply of "spice," a life-sustaining commodity identified as "the greatest treasure in the universe and the never-ending cause of conflict, betrayal and murder." Herbert's genre masterpiece left its imprint on all the space sagas to follow, including "Star Trek" and "Star Wars"; and although David Lynch's 1984 film version disappeared into a black hole, the book and its sequels remain the mother lode of sci fi source material.
"A lot of people refer to Dune' as science fiction," Mr. Harrison said. "I never do. I consider it an epic adventure in the classic storytelling tradition, a story of myth and legend not unlike the Morte d'Arthur' or any messiah story. It just happens to be set in the future." To the director, the drama is determined by the "human politics" practiced by its archetypal characters, whose struggles over issues of "love, courage, loyalty and betrayal" are a reflection of "the human condition and its moral dilemmas."
Such universal conflicts, he said, make "Dune" timeless. Take away the high-tech hardware, and the feudal houses fighting for political supremacy and commercial dominance over trade and technology could be city-states in ancient Greece or ducal kingdoms in Renaissance Italy -- or corporate traders sailing to some new Byzantium in cyberspace.
"The story is actually more relevant today than when Herbert wrote it," Mr. Harrison said. "In the 1960's, there were just these two colossal superpowers duking it out. Today we're living in a more feudal, corporatized world more akin to Herbert's universe of separate families, power centers and business interests, all interrelated and kept together by the one commodity necessary to all."
Having settled on his thematic approach and theatrical style, Mr. Harrison went on to cast his drama with stage-trained international actors and to hire a creative design team with epic visions. William Hurt, the most recognizable name actor in the cast, was hired first to play Duke Leto, the stately but doomed leader of the noble House Atreides and the father of the young messiah-in-waiting, Paul Atreides, played by Alec Newman.
"I was a science fiction junkie," said Mr. Hurt, who had read the book as a teenager and responded to Mr. Harrison's treatment of the material. "He captured Herbert's prophetic reflection of our own age, where nation-states are competing with the new global economy and its corporate elements."
In keeping with that multinational concept, Mr. Harrison cast around the globe for his actors: Saskia Reeves (Lady Jessica) and Ian McNeice (Baron Harkonnen) from England; Giancarlo Giannini (Emperor Shaddam IV) from Italy; Uwe Ochsenknecht (Stilgar) from Germany; Barbora Kodetova (Chani) from the Czech Republic; and Julie Cox (Princess Irulan), like Alec Newman a native of Scotland.
"Everyone told me I was out of my mind," Mr. Rubinstein said, "casting all these unknowns and hiring all these basically theatrical people who are not used to the discipline of television. But I figured, Frank Herbert's book is not your conventional television material, and from a stylistic standpoint this is not your conventional television treatment. Today, television can accommodate themes and material that it couldn't handle 10 years ago."
Mr. Harrison refused to take his classically trained actors into a studio where they would act against a blank screen. "With 'Dune,"' he said, "we're in a world we don't know, in some distant time we don't know. I didn't want it to look like any world we know. I was determined to come up with a unique style."
Since location shooting was out of the question (Mr. Rubinstein clocked 45-mile-an-hour winds when he was scouting desert locations in Tunisia and Namibia), producer and director agreed to settle in for four months at the Barrandov Studios in Prague -- and to hire production wizards who could turn Europe's largest sound stages into a world beyond this world.
Vittorio Storaro, the three-time Oscar-winning cinematographer who was the linchpin of the creative team, almost made "Dune" for David Lynch, until he was lured away by Francis Ford Coppola for "Apocalypse Now." "I feel very fortunate to be given a second chance," said Mr. Storaro, who created photographic backdrops called Translites to give spatial depth to the eerie vistas of the desert planet Arrakis and who worked with a densely saturated color palette that he modulated by computer to change the mood of a character or the tone of a scene.
"I wanted to be able to create through production design a look that would instantly identify the cultural background of each of the individual tribes," Mr. Harrison said. With Mr. Storaro at his side, he devised a "fascistic architectural style" for the brutal House Harkonnen; a serene classical look for House Atreides' center of power at Arrakeen Palace; the sumptuous textures of the Italian Renaissance for the Imperial Palace of the Emperor; an ancient earthiness for the Bedouin-like desert culture of the Fremen.
And for those places beyond the reach of the Imperium, those silent spaces where planets spin and stars burst -- a sense of infinity that sets the ultimate scene for what Mr. Harrison calls "a classic story, a fable, a cautionary tale, the stuff of myth."

HEADLINE: Paths for Our Warming Planet

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The collapse of climate change negotiations in The Hague (front page, Nov. 26) provides us with an opportunity to readdress the issue of global warming. The Kyoto Protocol, not yet ratified, requires developed countries to constrain energy use, a major ingredient to economic growth and well-being. 
 Moreover, in presuming an atmosphere of crisis, the protocol frustrates consideration of a rational, long-term approach, one comprising continuing scientific assessment, development of cost-effective options and public debate and consensus building.
A useful start would be to abandon the protocol. We would do both the global economy and the environment a vital service by taking a pragmatic view in determining what needs to be done and how we intend to do it.

HEADLINE: DROP IN SPENDING BY U.S. CONSUMERS SIGNALS SLOWDOWN

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
Americans are buying less jewelry and fewer homes than they did a year ago. Personal computers are gathering dust on warehouse shelves. Sales of airplane tickets and minivans have flattened in recent weeks.
Just as the country has entered the most important shopping season of the year, consumers are holding back, reacting to a lower stock market and higher energy costs and interest rates. At the moment, the prospects for next year do not seem much better. The enthusiasm of American consumers for spending and borrowing, which has sustained the economy whenever it seemed to falter over the last decade, now appears to be at its lowest point in perhaps five years, economists say. 
 Of course, those five years have been among the strongest in history, analysts say, and the economy continues to grow today at a rate that would have seemed healthy at many other times during the last three decades. Most economists still believe the United States is unlikely to enter a recession in the next 12 months, even if the odds have risen lately.
The economy, said Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist at Merrill Lynch, has gone "from great to good, or maybe great to O.K."
The shift has happened more quickly than most analysts expected, however, and it has been particularly evident in the last week. For the second consecutive month, consumers said they were less confident about the future of the economy, the Conference Board reported Tuesday. The number of workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose 5 percent in just one week, the government said Thursday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index hit a 52-week low last week, as did the Nasdaq composite index, which has lost almost half of its value since March. Consumer debt has reached its highest level in at least 20 years, according to one measure.
All of this comes on top of the third quarter, when economic growth was less than half that of the prior three months.
"We're seeing a deterioration in economic growth that is much sharper than expected," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
At the heart of the deterioration is a newfound hesitance among many consumers. That skittishness is of particular concern because the other pillar of the 10-year economic expansion -- business investment in new plants and equipment -- has also weakened.
The first consumers to change their behavior were lower- and middle-income Americans, who have been most affected by the rise in energy costs over the last year and a half, economists said.
"I've definitely had more expenses this year," said Karen Guerrette, a single mother and resident of Aurora, Colo., who was shopping with a friend at a Denver mall last week. Both were looking for bargains. Ms. Guerrette's friend, June McClain, ended up choosing a set of linens that was on sale and perfume for her grown daughter that came with a free gift.
"I am probably spending less this Christmas than I did last year," Ms. McClain, a baker, said. "You have to do a lot of comparison shopping."
In recent months, the spending slowdown has begun spreading to wealthier consumers, many of whom have watched their soaring stock portfolios lose momentum and start falling this year.
High-end housing prices in some cities are leveling off or even starting to fall. In Manhattan, apartment costs continued to rocket upward in the first six months of the year, but seem not to have changed much since the spring, real estate agents say. And on the west side of Los Angeles, fewer homes have recently sold for between $500,000 and $2 million than in the past, said Tom Dunlap, a branch manager for Prudential John Aaroe, a Beverly Hills brokerage.
"People are looking very closely at values," Mr. Dunlap said.
As a result, many companies, in a wide variety of industries, are expecting significantly slower growth in the coming months. "We have seen a slowdown," said Kim Shreckengost, a vice president in Home Depot's office of the chief executive. For Home Depot, the slowdown began in the third quarter -- when sales in existing stores rose 4 percent, compared with a 10 percent gain a year earlier -- and has continued in recent weeks. The average customer purchase has not slipped, Ms. Shreckengost added, but fewer people are making it to the cash register.
Across corporate America, the story is similar: by traditional standards, sales remain strong, but recently they have fallen more quickly than executives had expected. For example, with fewer people buying minivans and the growth of sport-utility vehicles slowing, auto sales fell 3.5 percent last month, when compared with a year earlier, carmakers reported Friday. But 2001 will still likely be one of the best in the industry's history, said Emily Kolinsky, an economist at the Ford Motor Company.
The number of people boarding airplanes has stopped growing in recent months, and over the last three months airlines have halted a string of fare increases for leisure travelers, raising prices only on corporate fares. Still, the percentage of seats filled this year will be higher than in any year since 1947, said Michael Linenberg, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.
And home sales are likely to decline this year for the first time since 1995, but almost 50 percent more people will have bought houses in 2000 than did in 1992, said Mark Vitner, an economist at First Union in Charlotte, N.C.
To be sure, many consumers say they continue to feel flush because of the smart wage increases of the last four years and long-term stock market gains.
Jeffrey Rand, 51, a building contractor in South Burlington, Vt., said he bought a full-sized truck two months ago, upgrading from a smaller version, largely because he remains confident that his income will stay near its current level. "I'm a little nervous" about the recent economic news, said Mr. Rand, shopping last week at a mall in Boston, "but it hasn't dramatically affected my mood yet."
John Watkins, a 33-year-old computer programmer from Arlington, Tex., who was shopping in the same mall, said his stock market holdings had dropped about 40 percent this year, but that he had not changed his buying habits. His investment portfolio is still up, he said. And, he added, "I'm not planning on doing anything with that money for 20 or 30 years."
Still, economists say a moderation of consumer spending had to happen at some point because higher costs have left many people with less disposable income than in the past.
Since the middle of 1999, gas prices have jumped almost 50 percent, health care costs are up and the Federal Reserve, hoping to slow the economy, has raised interest rates six times.
For much of the last 18 months, the added expenses failed to curtail shopping, as consumers took out more debt and dipped into their savings. In the third quarter, the average minimum monthly payment that Americans owed on their debt reached its highest level since 1987. Americans also spent more money than they earned during the quarter, something that never occurred in the 1980's or 1990's, according to Economy.com, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa.
Now people seem to be reacting. In recent weeks, sales of personal computers have actually fallen below their level a year ago; Gateway said its revenue over the recent Thanksgiving holiday was almost one-third lower than during the comparable weekend in 1999.
Over all, Americans' consumption of products and services was virtually flat in October, after increasing rapidly over the summer.
Marnie Ross, a 35-year-old mother of five boys between the ages of 1 and 15, said she goes to the predawn toy-store sales in Albuquerque every year during Thanksgiving weekend. This year, though, to afford the Star Wars figurines and Etch-a-Sketch she bought, she and her husband postponed a family vacation.
"We're getting away from too much on credit," Ms. Ross said, "and staying in budget."
Some upper-end consumers seem to be making similar compromises. Two years ago, about 21 percent of consumers said they planned to buy jewelry as a holiday gift, according to America's Research Group, a marketing firm in Charleston, S.C., that regularly interviews 1,000 consumers. Last year, the portion rose to 27 percent.
But since August, equity markets in the United States have lost almost $2 trillion in value, and those losses now appear to be hurting sales of luxury items, from watches to sport utility vehicles. Last month, only 18 percent of people surveyed said they planned to buy jewelry as a gift this year, according to America's Research Group.
"Consumers are certainly reining in their most hedonistic impulses very quickly," said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Economy.com.
Luxury chains, which reaped some of the biggest benefits of the decade-long wealth explosion, are now experiencing a slowing of growth. After more than a year of double-digit gains, for example, sales in existing Nieman Marcus stores dropped 2.5 percent last month, compared with November 1999, according to Goldman, Sachs.
"Nieman was the last holdout," said George Strachan, a Goldman analyst, noting that most segments had already suffered from weaker sales since the middle of the year. "There are only a handful of companies that are really doing well."
If the current trends continue, many economists think the Federal Reserve may switch courses and lower interest rates sometime in the next four months to prevent growth from deteriorating further.
At its most recent meeting, on Nov. 15, the Fed's rate-setting committee said it continued to view inflation as a greater threat than a sharp slowdown. On Friday, Edward Gramlich, a Fed governor, said the economy had appeared less robust in the last two weeks. At the Nov. 15 meeting, the Fed "had noticed the slowdown in spending and the tightened credit conditions, and there have been data that came out since then that make it perhaps even more noticeable," Mr. Gramlich said, according to Reuters.
Barring some kind of shock to the economy, analysts say 2001 is likely to look much like the final months of 2000: weak in comparison with recent years, but not too bad when measured against the late years of other booms.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: 12-03-00;
I Was a Teenage Pornographer

BYLINE: By Erik Tarloff; Erik Tarloff is a scriptwriter and novelist.

 BODY:
When I finished high school, my family returned to Los Angeles after six years abroad. We spent that summer, the oddest of my life, at a raffish residential hotel for show-business transients. During the time I'd been away, my friends all seemed to have adopted the same hobby: taking drugs. Their voices had changed; they'd started shaving. Worse, I may have been the only adolescent in Los Angeles history without a driver's license. So much decadence, and I was stuck with my nose pressed against the glass, stranded in Gomorrah. And then my parents insisted I find a job.
My friends had summer jobs. They were busboys, store clerks, camp counselors, ice-cream-truck drivers. None of these jobs appealed to me. (Actually, the ice-cream gig sounded great, but the absence of a driver's license. . . . ) But when I bumped into an old friend whose current roommate worked in a pornographic mail-order warehouse -- writers needed! -- I knew I'd found my calling. Did I have sufficient life experience to write pornography? Irrelevant! My hormones would fill in any troublesome gaps. 
 There was a family confab. My father grudgingly acquiesced. But his blessing came with a caveat: "You understand this means you can never run for president?" Since a political career wasn't in the cards that summer, I cheerfully foreclosed the option. I chose a pen name -- call me Raoul Fitzgibbons, a name much better than the one I actually adopted -- established a perch by the hotel pool and invited the muses of lubricity to inspire me. They arrived in droves.
At the time, my new vocation wasn't a shameful secret; on the contrary, it was the anonymity that rankled. When my first opus finally appeared in print, a few weeks after I'd completed it, I'd locate it in bookshops -- it was a virtual porn best seller -- and offer to autograph it. The bookstore clerks always turned me down. One, who at least pretended to accept my claims of authorship, said, "Nah, people will just think it's been used." Used was his distressing word choice.
Over the years, as I achieved some of the outward trappings of adulthood, dignity became more precious than reflected decadence. I had a career, a wife, a child and, at long last, a driver's license. Oh, the subject came up a few times, but it didn't feel like some dreadful skeleton rattling in the closet. It was as if someone else -- Raoul Fitzgibbons, say -- had written those books and lent me his memories of having done so.
Then, in 1992, my wife, Laura Tyson, was named to a cabinet-level position by President-elect Clinton. For the first time in decades, I recalled my father's admonition. But he hadn't said anything about marrying an economic adviser. He'd simply said I couldn't be president. Well, someone else with embarrassing secrets -- much more embarrassing than mine -- was going to be president. Not my problem.
If only. My secret was suddenly a secret. Zo Baird lost her job over a nanny, after all.
The committee vetting my wife's nomination asked to read my writing. Her job, they said, depended on my compliance. Among the things I supplied them was a serious story of some sexual explicitness, but published in a prestigious literary quarterly under my own name. A good strategy to throw them off the scent. One of the members of the committee later admitted this story briefly jeopardized the appointment. Imagine their reaction to Raoul Fitzgibbons's oeuvre!
So I assumed we were in the clear. Then, one night in 1993, a reporter phoned to interview my wife about economic policy. I told him I'd get her. He said, "Thanks, Raoul," and chuckled ominously. Oh, yes, he assured me, he knew. How? He wouldn't say. Good journalists protect their sources.
Fortunately, he also protected me. Or perhaps it was my wife he was protecting. I spent the next four years waiting, burdened by inchoate foreboding. The situation was odd: a youthful escapade threatened to affect presidential economic policy. I didn't feel remotely guilty about the books, but the secret itself suddenly felt radioactive. If Raoul Fitzgibbons somehow undermined the president's recovery package, my conscience wouldn't be nearly so clear.
Miraculously, the other shoe never did drop.
Now that that danger has passed, I look back on the experience differently. Because I stumbled into a genre -- probably the only one -- where an 18-year-old would be hired to write an extended narrative, I actually managed to serve a professional apprenticeship and be paid for it. Of course, my writing must have been awful, and of course, if anyone located it now, I'd be mortified. But the feeling of triumph I enjoyed when I pulled that last page of my first book out of the typewriter, and the giddy sense of accomplishment I relished when I first held the published paperback in my hand -- these forecast what the very best moments of my future professional life would feel like. It's nice that the wellspring of that confidence no longer needs to be a secret. Still, I think I'll keep my real pen name to myself.

HEADLINE: Lost And Found;
Silence of the Lam

BYLINE: By Melanie Thernstrom; Melanie Thernstrom is the author of "The Dead Girl" and "Halfway Heaven: Diary of a Harvard Murder."

 BODY:
There's a particular quality to the moment a long-held secret is unearthed -- the one around which, subterraneously, a life is organized, like the temple of a ruined city. You take a step back and look again, with wonder. There it all is: roofless rooms, passages twisting into forgetfulness, an altar . . . painted? Blood-stained? What?
I had been surprised that Benjamin Holmes, an F.B.I. fugitive, wanted on charges of aggravated arson until he surfaced recently after two decades on the lam, was eager to talk. But 20 years of self-imposed silence turns out to be a difficult discipline to break. Holmes is uncomfortable talking in public when we first meet in the lobby of the Youngstown Holiday Inn in Ohio. The desk clerk's eyes go wide as we leave for my room. Holmes, 48, is an imposing man, 6 foot 4, thin but muscular, wearing cracked plastic shoes. 
 He needs to lie down, he says. He's a few days out of the hospital, recovering from the gunshot wounds that marked his re-entry into the world. He came out of hiding to reconnect with his wife, and she shot him. But he doesn't want to talk about that now.
Stretched across one of the room's two beds, he is startled by the maid's knock. "What are you going to do for security here?" he asks. "I could pick that lock." He refuses to let me tape the conversation (although I suspect he's taping it himself, a recorder concealed in one of the pockets of his guerrilla-style vest). He's wary about being photographed: "I've spent all these years making sure I was never -- ever -- photographed," he says. "Now I'm gonna sit for a portrait?" After many hours of conversation he becomes suspicious. "How do I know who you work for?" ID is no good. "This could be fake ID," he says. To an argument about the necessity of trust, he counters, "The only thing that's necessary is to know when people are lying to you."
But this man, Ben Holmes -- or Sandobal Reyes or Ibn Saad Kaharleed or Slim or at times just Robert Holmes -- has made deception his life's work.
"I had no choice," he says.
The police -- or perhaps the mob -- tried to kill him by planting a firebomb in his house, he says, burning 60 percent of his body. Charges of arson followed. He ducked bail, disappearing from Youngstown at the apt hour of half-past midnight, Sept. 28, 1980. Television and radio announcements said that he was dangerous, and he heard that the police had shoot-on-sight orders. Besides the arson charges, there was speculation that he was the head of three gangs and might even have had something to do with the disappearance of the brother of an alleged witness to the arson.
And why did someone blow up his house?
He had a "valuable skill," and "they" wanted him to make something "very illegal," and he refused. "I was framed," he says. It's a standard claim for a fugitive, of course -- not something you expect to believe. But unlike most criminals, Holmes has an arsenal of evidence refuting the charges against him that he has saved for 20 years. He also has old tapes of a police officer trying to blackmail him, which he promises to play for me and which he plans to use in the lawsuit he is preparing against the Hubbard Police Department in Ohio. He pats his ratty brown vinyl briefcase, stuffed with his legal documents, tapes and a fugitive self-help book, "The Poor Man's James Bond."
One more question -- about what his valuable, illegal skill actually was -- and Holmes snaps. His warm affect shifts; his glance is filled with fear. "Why should I tell you my secrets?"
The figure of the fugitive is a particularly resonant american fantasy. It's the literal embodiment of the American myth of endless self-invention, an echo from the time when the country had frontiers to disappear into, freedom lines to cross to a new life.
Holmes was the unusual fugitive who -- if he is to be believed -- stayed pretty close to home the whole time. He often thought of his forebears: "I was hiding out along the old underground railroad that crosses from Mississippi through Ohio into Canada, where some of my ancestors -- Mississippi slaves -- made it." He still has family in Canada he could have gone to live with, he says, but he didn't want to leave the state because he heard that the penalties for a fugitive captured crossing state lines are more severe. He made a point of spreading rumors that he had flown to California, Mexico, Brazil, however.
Being a fugitive wouldn't appear to be as exciting as its myriad fictional treatments; the main qualities it requires are patience and paranoia. Holmes seems to have had an abundance of both. It was many months, for example, before he even had a friend send word to his wife that he was alive. He lived briefly an hour away in a friend's apartment in Lorain, Ohio, then moved back to Youngstown and lived in a racing-car clubhouse owned by friends. It was back in his hometown that he perfected his guises. His face had been altered by the burns, his skin lightened. Formerly he had been clean-shaven and bespectacled; he grew a beard and long hair, got contacts and developed a limp. He learned never to look people in the eye when talking to them -- That's when they really see you."
Eight months later, he says, he moved to Cleveland, where a friend he identifies only as Peaches owned a building and an auto shop where Holmes could live and work. Peaches, so-called because he's a black man with light skin, was understood to have "disappeared" himself 30 years earlier, after being accused of the capital crime of killing a white man in Mississippi. Not that Holmes was happy to find himself keeping company with fellow desperadoes. "They're thinking they're doing me a favor," he says, "and I'm thinking I could get picked up if they come for them."
The old white stereotype of blacks looking alike was finally working in his favor. Twice during his years in Cleveland, Holmes claims he was in a car that was stopped by the police and taken to a station. ("That's racial profiling," he says. "Black men driving a nice car.") A fake ID saw him through both encounters. The ID, he told me, had been bought for $400 from a Dominican moving back home. Holmes notes, with a touch of pride, "I don't speak Spanish." When questioned about a neighborhood robbery and asked to take a polygraph test, he was terrified the police would fingerprint him, but they didn't; he says that biofeedback techniques helped him to pass the polygraph.
He calls the type of fake ID he used "double entry" ID because it was shared with someone else, someone who did not pay taxes or have a job or a bank account. Homeless black men were a good source of such ID's -- although these were usually good for only 30 days or so, because often, annoyingly, the owners resold their cards behind Holmes's back.
He found life in Cleveland liberating in some ways -- he could go to a basketball court and be the fifth man with four whites in a game, something considered beyond the pale in Youngstown. But when Whitney Houston or Michael Jackson came to town to give a concert, he felt it was too risky to go.
"Don't forget to say how lonely I was," he adds. "It was a lonely, paranoid existence." He had abandoned his wife, Addie, with their 3-month-old child, Benita. (Holmes is cagey about how much contact he had with his family during his early years as a fugitive.) Moreover, he says, he wasn't in a position to make new friends. He recalls a Haitian medical resident in Akron, whom he liked and who told him she was going to spend most of her salary on a fast car. "I would have liked to say, 'I like racing cars too,"' he says. "I would have liked to have told people who I was and laughed and talked. When you're socializing you get to wanting to talk."
Pressed about whether there was anything he liked about being a fugitive that kept him in hiding so many years, Holmes hesitates and then admits he had fun. "It's one thing to say you want to be a family man and another thing to live in the same place for years and years," he says. He had a talent, and he knew it. "I liked beating the system. I liked how easy it was. I could have hid out forever. I was hooked."
It sounds like the beginnings of a shaggy-dog story: how many enemies does a paranoid fugitive really have?
Holmes's answer is a long one, filled with the names of people who are dead or in jail or who refuse to talk. He's like the protector figure in "The Terminator" being questioned by the police captors: he can't prove he's from the future any more than Holmes can bring back his past. His story is airtight in its internal consistency, as paranoid fantasies often are, and numerous details check out, but it may take his lawsuit, if he makes it happen, to open the book on his gravest allegations.
Holmes dates his one-man witness-protection program to late spring 1977. He was working in a small shop he owned that converted ordinary cars into racing cars when two Black Muslim acquaintances paid him a visit, he says. "Salaam aleikum," they said. Then they told him what they wanted: help making gun silencers.
Holmes, who had studied mechanical engineering at Youngstown State University and in Sussex, England, often customized mufflers for racing cars and was excited by his alternative idea of trying to make a gun silencer from a lawn mower. He says he redrew the men's blueprints but stopped short of actually making the silencer (which is illegal).
Holmes's story now takes a darker turn. A few weeks later at Dee's Lounge, a strip joint down the block from his shop, he was sitting at the bar in front of the long mirror that was rumored to be a two-way, hiding men with machine guns on the lookout for raids and robberies and hits. Eddie Truelove, who managed the bar for Joey Naples, one of the two controlling mobsters of the region, sidled up to him.
"Brother Holmes, Benny, Benny the Blood," Holmes recalls him saying. "Why you helping the other side? The Black Muslims are running off at the mouth and telling people that they're going to own this town because you're doing things for them exclusively that you won't do for us."
The F.B.I. has described Youngstown as the last mob-controlled city in America. Also known as Bomb City, Crimestown U.S.A. and the Wild Wild West, Youngstown is a place that for decades has had among the highest per-capita homicide rates in the country -- exceeding those of nearby Cleveland and Akron by many times. When Holmes's parents left their sharecropping lives behind in Itta Bena, Miss., in the early 50's and reached Youngstown looking for work, the city was still hopping. "These mills, they built the tanks and bombs that won this country's wars," Bruce Springsteen sings, elegizing the economic collapse of Youngstown into poverty and crime. "We sent our sons to Korea and Vietnam, now we're wondering what they were dyin' for." The 1978 closing of the local mill was a civic disaster. "My sweet Jenny, I'm sinkin' down. Here, darlin', in Youngstown."
In November 1977, Holmes's home in the tiny town of Hubbard, just outside Youngstown, was burglarized. The officers who arrived to take the burglary report were uncharacteristically friendly that day, he says. They admired Holmes's gun collection and suggested that he visit the Hubbard Police Department shooting range sometime. Then, eyeing the threaded barrel of a Lugar pistol Holmes owned, one of them asked, according to Holmes, if he had a silencer that went with it; Holmes recalls the officer saying that he'd like to get one of those for himself.
"Isn't that illegal?" Holmes asked.
Yes and no, the officer replied.
It was the first, Holmes says, of many such requests. He claims that one officer in particular became obsessed with him. (Through the Hubbard Police Department, this former officer has repeatedly declined to answer Holmes's allegations or comment on the tapes, other than to pass along a reminder that Holmes is still under investigation for criminal charges.) Holmes recalls that whenever he was around or working on his car, his nemesis would come by and buddy up for hours, talking about favors for favors. Holmes says he refused.
In February 1978 there was a surprise raid on the Holmes house. Holmes says that the cops told him they had been tipped off to a silencer lab and a drug lab in the basement. Although the police found nothing illegal and the Holmeses were released the next day, their confiscated belongings were not. His wife's wedding dress disappeared, along with his valuable collection of 17 guns, with which, Holmes says, he had been futilely trying to outarm his packed neighbors. His arsenal included a pre-Civil War 12-gauge shotgun, which Holmes says was given to his great-grandfather by his slave master on his release, and an 1876 30-30 Winchester buffalo soldier rifle.
"In those days, when the police raided someone's house it was just like, 'Garage sale!"' says Anthony Longmire, a detective in the Youngstown Police Department, commenting on the general tenor of the time. "When they took a burglary report at Radio Shack, it was, 'Time for new radios!"'
Enraged, Holmes filed a lawsuit against the Hubbard Police Department for violating his civil rights, illegal search and seizure and theft. He says his nemesis warned him that the police felt such a suit was spitting in their faces.
On Halloween 1979, Holmes returned home with a friend from a private club for racing-car fanatics, and a trick-or-treater told him that he had seen a pink Cadillac in front of his yard and a man inside his house. Holmes says that when he hit the light switch, a "hot shower" -- a bomb made from gasoline inside the bulb -- detonated. Holmes was thrown into the garage. Then a ball of fire, he rolled into a puddle in his yard. "I prayed to Jehovah to see my unborn child," he says.
He spent several months in the Akron burn clinic, not expected to survive. It wasn't long, though, until his nemesis and another officer showed up at the hospital, smirking, Holmes says, and informed him that he was being charged with having burned down his house himself to get insurance money. They claimed that they had a witness (an acquaintance of Holmes's). He was placed under arrest. A police guard was posted in the room.
When the alleged witness's brother disappeared, Holmes says, a prosecutor threatened him: if he didn't cooperate, Holmes might be charged with obstruction of justice if the body was found. Then his nemesis offered him a deal. By this point Holmes had become so paranoid that he was secretly taping all his calls -- including his nemesis's.
Listening, finally, to the actual tape was a startling, eerie and persuasive experience. I was struck by the odd rapport between the two men, the threats mixed with chuminess. First, there's a series of messages they leave with families for each other, then a conversation. The officer's voice is low and self-effacing as he tells Holmes he has had to move in with his mother following his divorce. He expresses suspicion that Holmes is taping the conversation, which Holmes denies. Holmes asks the same of his antagonist. Without apparent irony, Holmes's conversant describes "the problems" between them as caused by "a lack of communication." He says he has been authorized by the prosecutor to make a deal. He asks Holmes to meet in a place where each will "feel comfortable." "Maybe things could work out for both of us," he says suggestively.
They met in the parking lot of the Perkins pancake house at 8 p.m. on Sept. 28, 1980. The offer, as Holmes maintains: he lies low for a while and fails to show up at the hearing scheduled for his lawsuit against the Hubbard cops, the court drops it and then, after a suitable interval, the police drop their arson charges. Holmes collects the insurance money and can rebuild his home. The officer, he says, told him to return to the pancake house at midnight; the prosecutor would be there to cement the deal.
In the parking lot, Holmes maintains, the officer rapped on Holmes's car window and told him that the prosecutor was in the other car and that the deal was solid. Holmes says he tried to shine his headlights into their car as he left, to see if the prosecutor was really there, but the person ducked.
Everything in Holmes's story leads to, and away from, this moment -- the moment he decided to disappear. And as often as he brings it up, the moment disappears: the end of the tape, the blinding headlights, no deal on paper -- nothing.
He went home to pack. He didn't wake Addie to say goodbye. He told himself he'd be back in a couple of months.
Holmes kept his end of the bargain, although the courts took two years to drop his suit. But the police didn't drop their charges until May 2000, when someone reviewing the books noticed that Holmes was declared dead 12 years earlier.
America is filled with two-bit fugitives. Van Harp, an F.B.I. agent, says that in his Cleveland office alone there are 14,000 outstanding arrest warrants. Of those, the F.B.I. selects some fugitives to search for aggressively. The majority are caught quickly, Harp says. After that, the warrant and information on the fugitives stay on the books, popping up if they are arrested for something else -- which happens often, according to Harp. Holmes's record stayed on the books right up to the day in October that he surfaced. But no one was looking too hard for him.
There's a dose of egotism to being a fugitive, a sense of playing Harrison Ford in a big movie, with important people on the chase. "There may have been a big cat-and-mouse game going on in his mind," Harp says. "But there was no cat."
Perhaps Holmes succeeded too well at the fugitive game, passing from invisible to forgotten. In some ways, the death certificate for him that Addie obtained in 1988, enabling her to collect life insurance on him for the next decade, represented the truth. From the world's point of view, Benjamin Holmes had been long dead.
"Good afternoon, Miss Sunshine!" says the detective at the Youngstown Police headquarters, the friendliest police station in America. All the detectives in the open room look up at me from their desks, expectantly. But everyone is disappointed at the mention of the former fugitive's name.
"Geez, why you interested in him?" Longmire complains, but he agrees to pull Holmes's file. "Look at this mug shot. Does this look like an innocent man to you?" Longmire, who happens to possess a lovely, guileless face, is part of the new law-enforcement generation. He's a member of the Black Knights, a minority police association that successfully sued the city some years back, effecting its diversification.
Longmire says that the file does not contain any of the old papers -- neither the detective's notes nor the fire inspector's reports. So Holmes's story that the firebomb in his house was planted by the police or the mob . . . ?
Everyone chuckles at the idea of the mob's botching a hit. "You think the mob would let him lie around in the hospital for months afterward?" Longmire asks. "You think the mob can't find someone when they disappear?"
And the police?
"The police might have done that kind of thing in the old days. But then again, why wouldn't they just take him out and shoot him?"
They refer me to Detective Jack Palma downstairs, one of the few detectives still around who was on the force at the time. Palma doesn't remember details of the case and says that the filing clerk couldn't locate the Holmes files, which means they're either misplaced or have been moved out of the office, into deep storage.
Surely they could be found?
Palma folds his hands over his waist. "Once something's gone, it'd take an act of Congress to dig it up."
I go over Holmes's story a last time with Longmire. "So the whole thing could be explained by bad police work," he says hypothetically after listening to the story. "Yeah," he says, mulling it over. "I told you things were far-out in the old days. But there's something I just don't trust about the guy. He's shifty."
From wherever he was hiding, Holmes always managed to obtain a copy of the Youngstown paper, The Vindicator, even if he had to go back to the city to get it. He carefully clipped news of his enemies and added them to his bulging briefcase.
In the last four years, the F.B.I. investigation into civic corruption in Mahoning County has resulted in the conviction of more than 70 cops, lawyers, mob figures, public officials and others -- many of whom Holmes says he was personally acquainted with, from the wrong side of the table. Holmes says that sometimes, frustrated with the slow pace of justice, he would send the F.B.I. an anonymous tip -- the names, say, of people who could corroborate the details of the night he saw a former Youngstown police officer standing behind the counter at one of the mobster Joey Naples's bars "selling coke and stolen leather jackets like they were Sno-Kones."
"I was really satisfied when a lot of people around fell," he says. He relished the news about the ambush-death of the mob grandfather Joey Naples after a lengthy reign and the death of Eddie Truelove after his heart exploded in a cocaine-snorting contest. He savored the story about Hubbard's police chief John Karlovic being convicted of, among other things, assault.
But most satisfying of all, he tells me, was the story of Allan Frost II, who fled to New Mexico in 1988 after Karlovic assaulted him when a drug deal with Karlovic's niece went sour. He filed suit in 1990 against Karlovic and other city officials.
"I almost came out when I read Frost sued and won," Holmes says. The actual settlement amount was confidential, but Holmes assumes that it was substantial, as he hopes his will be.
He watched the trials of Rodney King and O.J. Simpson on television and says he felt that "the public was ready to see police corruption -- that people can be framed just like I was." He was aware as the years passed that even if he could not beat the aggravated-arson charge, it would probably carry a sentence of only a year or two, and that he had never in fact been charged with the arson witness's brother's death. But he wasn't in a hurry. He had figured out how to support himself in exile, working in car shops and turning a profit on the very thing that led to the exile: gun silencers. He sold silencer blueprints through advertisements in the backs of handgun magazines he still carries in his briefcase. (Although this is legal, the editorial mood toward such ads sometimes shifted, and Holmes would have to juggle them among magazines.) He sold the blueprints and the parts as a package for $44.99. Once a month he picked up the money orders at a P.O. box.
He realized, though, that he was missing the markers of his family's lives. He missed his brother's and grandmother's funerals. He felt terrible for his mother, Lillie, who lived with curtains drawn for fear of the police.
He would go to Youngstown, sometimes, to check on his daughter, Benita. On one occasion, standing across the street, feeling like a ghost, he watched her wait for the school bus, then he saw a woman's car skid over the curb and almost hit her. He spoke to her once, and she told her mother that night that a strange man had approached her. "I wanted to see my daughter before her hair turned gray - or blond," he says.
It's in keeping with Holmes's biblical worldview that the real danger turned out not to be the law, which he successfully evaded for 20 years, but what was closest to him. It was Addie who finally snared him.
Addie and her new husband, James Crawley Jr., told me their story in her lawyer's office. Addie, a beautiful, fragile-looking woman who conveys a sense of profound sadness, says she had been involved with Crawley for a few years. Three weeks after their wedding this past September, her old husband popped up from the dead and, she says, held her hostage for four days before she shot him. "It wasn't a classic hostage situation," her lawyer, James Gentile, says quickly, trying to account for the fact that she went to work those days and didn't try to call the police. "It was more of a psychological situation."
Addie may have felt trapped by her fugitive husband, but the entrapment seems to have begun long before. Holmes says that he moved into Addie's small tract house two years ago. Addie and Crawley have disputed this claim in her criminal trial for shooting Holmes.
Holmes shows me his Nautilus equipment in the basement and the enormous manuscript he has spent the last two years working on, which connects racism to Satanism (and which he had been planning to publish under Benita's name). He opens a panel in Benita's closet to reveal a tiny hideaway he built to conceal himself when visitors came over -- the kind of thing his ancestor known simply as "the African" might have curled his long body into.
In the bedroom a cabinet is filled with kidney medications prescribed in the name of Robert Holmes, from when Holmes suffered kidney failure in May. He says Addie nursed him well, driving him back and forth to the hospital in Akron. He was haunted by the fear that during an operation he would give himself away.
The domestic situation mirrored Holmes's byzantine mind-set. He had finally come home, but he couldn't stop being a fugitive. He knew Addie was having an affair with someone at work -- and he used his intelligence techniques to spy on her. He bugged their phone and taped conversations between Addie and Crawley (and also between Addie and himself) and tormented himself by listening to their conversations. Yet even though he uncovered every detail of her secret, and confronted her again and again, he still listened to her denials.
"He ain't in no danger and neither are you," Holmes tells Addie toward the end of the tapes. "I ain't trying to interfere in nothing. I'm just a desperate man trying to hold on to what was everything to me, and it did not work. Like I said last night, you just never cared -- not for a long time. There ain't nothing I can do -- no violence, no love, no begging, no nothing."
Although Addie was making around $65,000 a year working as an engineering technician, Holmes claims she had developed a gambling habit and bad credit. He says he has been collecting her financial statements, lottery tickets and cash-advance receipts in his briefcase. She believed that Crawley, who drove fancy cars and went on cruises, was flush.
In late September, Holmes says, Addie told him she was going to visit relatives in Virginia. There -- in a ceremony whose legality is of course now suspect because of Holmes's reappearance -- she secretly married Crawley. After the wedding, she returned home alone. Holmes picked up a message on their answering machine from a local jeweler: a wedding ring was ready for pickup! He confronted Addie, but she claimed it was a practical joke. On the last of Holmes's phone tapes, on Oct. 11, he recorded Crawley telling Addie he would move in the next day.
That night, Holmes says, he stayed up all night making love to Addie. In the morning, he woke to gunfire, and a burning in his stomach, as Addie stood shooting the gun his father had given her. With one hand, he put two fingers in the two bullet holes (inspired, he says, by an episode of "Magnum P.I."). With the other, he wrestled the gun from Addie's unsteady grip.
She dropped to her knees and, according to Holmes, said: "I did it for Benita, I did it for Benita. James can be a better father than you."
He threw the gun on the bed and told her to take him to the emergency room.
"If I take you to Akron, you'll bleed to death."
"Take me to St. Elizabeth's," he said, referring to the local hospital. "I don't care anymore."
When Holmes came to in the hospital after an operation that left two bullets in his liver, his ID wrist bracelet said "Unidentified Male." But then a nurse came in and joked: "What do you want me to call you, Ben or Robert? Who are you today?"
And he knew they knew. He felt a long-forgotten happiness as he said his name aloud to a stranger again for the first time.
He plans to file suit as soon as Addie's trial ends. He has begun work on a memoir he calls "Invisible Man."

Turning a Sob Story Into a Bottle of Wine

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL 

 BODY:
What wine is best served with a failed Internet company?
Red, of course. Specifically, a 1996 bottle of Screaming Eagle cabernet sauvignon. 
 The recommendation comes courtesy of SecretCellars.com, an Internet retailer of specialty wines that plans to help an unlucky casualty of a dot-com drown his or her sorrows in style.
The company plans to award a $1,500 bottle of Screaming Eagle to the person who -- in 100 words or less -- writes the saddest tale of an Internet company gone sour. The competition has been fierce: Since early November, some 2,300 people have e-mailed their woeful stories to SecretCellars.
One man describes his company's closure the day before Thanksgiving. Another tells of moving from Japan to Silicon Valley to take a position at a company that failed a month later. A third writes of finding not a pot of gold at the end of the dot-com rainbow, but, instead, a job at Bowl-O-Rama, where he now works after his layoff.
And what of SecretCellars? Is the company doing a little new economy brand-building on the backs of its fallen brethren?
No way, said Nancy Malone, chief executive of SecretCellars, a privately held company in Santa Barbara, Calif. The campaign is merely meant to encourage humor and perspective, she said.
Just because her company is in the black, "I am not capitalizing on these poor schmucks who couldn't figure out that spending money on company picnics was not the way to spend it," she said.
 Hers is not the only Internet company offering a bounty for tales of woe. FindWhat.com, a search engine that lets advertisers pay to make sure they show up in relevant searches, is offering free advertising to dot-coms on the verge of failure.
Companies are eligible for the offer if they have less than $1 million in cash and are still losing money, or if they have announced layoffs and have not subsequently raised new money. Courtney Jones, the company's chairman, said FindWhat had received e-mail messages from more than four dozen companies hoping for free advertising, although he said many of them did not meet the criteria for eligibility.
FindWhat has seen its own reversal of fortune. Back in March, its shares stood around $18. Now they are on the shade side of $1. The company is not yet profitable, Mr. Jones said, but "we plan to be very soon."
Or maybe he shouldn't be in such a rush to succeed. After all, SecretCellars is accepting sob stories through Dec. 13. MATT RICHTEL

Executives See Trouble Spreading

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Dec. 2

 BODY:
Michael Dell just came out and said it.
"There haven't been a lot of great reasons to buy a new computer," Mr. Dell, the chairman of the Dell Computer Corporation told a group of investors here this week. 
 Jeffrey Weitzen, president and chief executive of one of Dell's rivals, Gateway, put it another way, the day after his company shocked the market with news that sales and profits would fall far below forecasts.
"Do you really need a gigahertz processor?" Mr. Weitzen said during an interview here. "We're finding people don't need that. The drive for speed is no longer what it once was."
Neither is the drive for online retailing, said Shelby Bonnie, chief executive of the technology news service, CNet Network. "People have way oversold the e-tailing space."
The doomsday declarations were uttered at the annual technology conference sponsored by the investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston, which seemed to be ground zero this week for the implosion of investor confidence in the information technology sector.
The conference's organizer, Elliott Rogers, managing director and head of the company's technology research group, said as much: "Suspicions of problems have been confirmed. It's like getting hit by a 2 by 4."
The conference, a weeklong open-microphone session for chief executives of technology companies, coincided with a particularly heavy pummeling of the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which fell nearly 9 percent this week. And the 2,000 or so investors here seemed to divide their attention between the Nasdaq and the 200 technology chiefs who found themselves here not to praise their companies but mainly to explain themselves.
The message from many was consistent, if it sounds a bit desperate at times: The drop in their stock prices was simply part of a correction -- an over-correction, they insisted, and not a reflection of the fundamentals of their businesses.
And yet, there was no getting around the evidence that the stock-market correction coincided with an actual slowdown in some key segments of the technology industry.
It is not news that the dot-com industry is in the dumps. But now, so is the semiconductor business. "You've got Intel and AMD on a suicide mission to make the fastest chip," Mr. Rogers said. AMD, or Advanced Micro Devices, is Intel's main competitor.
Fast chips, for now, anyway, may be beside the point. Computer makers are now saying their main source of revenue will be accessories, not the computers themselves. They are recasting their business plan along the lines of the time-honored practice of giving away the razor and profiting from the sale of blades. Gateway, for example, is hoping to grow by emphasizing a broad range of training packages and services for PC's, as well as electronic devices that can be linked to the Internet or networked in a home.
But the troubled industries go beyond makers of PC's and PC chips. The Internet consulting services industry is gasping for air -- notably MarchFirst, which this week forecast a fourth-quarter loss of perhaps 30 cents a share, instead of the seven cents a share profit analysts had expected. The software companies are not exactly booming. And various hardware companies are trying to figure out what a slowdown in the telecommunications industry will mean to them.
Each in their own way, the industry chiefs seemed to be asking the same questions: Is my rivals' problem going to become mine? Am I really in a cyclical business? Is the new economy subject to the same ebbs and flows as the old economy?
Thomas Galvin, a Credit Suisse analyst, described the technology troubles as "the cockroach theory -- where there is one, there is going to be a whole lot of them."
That may explain why chief executives at the conference tried to put as much distance as possible between their companies and their ailing competitors. For instance, Compaq Computer's chief, Michael Capellas, had this message for the audience: "So for all those people who ask, 'How was your Thanksgiving?' It was just fine, thank you." He was alluding to the announcement last week that Gateway's PC sales over the Thanksgiving weekend were down 30 percent from last year.
Lawrence J. Ellison, the outspoken chairman of the software company Oracle, took pains to praise his company's offerings for the e-commerce industry, primarily on grounds that they were so different from anything produced by his rivals. "It's unimaginable to me that we got this one wrong," Mr. Ellison said.
Steve Case, chairman and chief executive of America Online, told a packed room that investors had wildly overreacted to negative market news recently, battering his stock way lower than it deserved. "There are companies, including AOL, that now are screaming buys," he insisted.
John Connors, of Microsoft, sounded as much like a salesman as what he actually is -- the company's chief financial officer. "There is no better place to invest now than in the technology industry," Mr. Connors said. "Is there a cliff? Only if consumers decided they didn't want to buy our products anymore."
And Jeff Dachis, chief executive of the Internet consulting and World Wide Web-development company, Razorfish, sought to distance his company from others in the struggling Internet services business. "We're not part of that circus," he asserted."We're a real live company with profits. Don't lump us into the gloom and doom."
Despite that gloom and doom, Credit Suisse First Boston did call the bottom on several technology stocks and rate them strong buys, including DigitalThink, which offers corporate training courses over the Internet. The stock that Credit Suisse was pushing hardest was the chip maker Fairchild Semiconductor International, despite an acknowledgment by Fairchild's own chief financial officer, Joseph Martin, that a "cloud" hung over the entire sector.
And how might investors start picking the good apples among the bad? It will not be easy, but analysts say that companies that serve a particular market with the most sophisticated products for which there are few alternatives are the companies that tend to do the best if the market turns bad. There may not be a big demand to upgrade most commonplace computers, the reasoning goes, but there will always be a demand for the fastest systems among the customers that actually do need additional speed and processing power.
The same goes for hardware in other companies. Even as telecommunication companies face debt problems and ponder cutting their capital spending, for example, there are still some products -- like the optical networking gear made by companies like Cisco and Juniper -- that they feel simply they must have.
And as for those dot-coms -- at least the survivors? It may get worse before it gets better, but Mr. Bonnie of CNet insisted that it will eventually get better. "I'm sure the Wal-Marts took some time to get the kinks out," he said.
Mr. Rogers, the conference organizer, said technology investors of all stripes will simply have to accept certain economic realities.
"There is a shortfall in demand, if not a serious growth deceleration," he said. "It's not just in computers. It's in everything. I've been through this many times before. It's called a cycle."

HEADLINE: Hollywood Vitriol Meets Tech Suave;
Variety Braces as Competitors Enter Hallowed Precincts

BYLINE: By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
Last Monday morning in Los Angeles, Peter Bart, the editor in chief of Variety, opened the day's first editorial meeting with his core staff. The onslaught soon began.
Mr. Bart started with a barbed monologue on Jim Carrey and "The Grinch." Then he offered his opinion about how the never-ending election stories are affecting network anchors. "We know one thing for sure," he said. "And that's that Tom Brokaw does have marbles in his mouth." Later, he called Jim Wiatt, chief executive of the William Morris Agency, "the grouchiest agent in Hollywood" and on his way to lunch in his executive editor's Cadillac Catera he referred to a movie producer as "the most nakedly ambitious man in Hollywood" and various other executives as "vile," "toadying," and "scum." 
 Okay, so Mr. Bart may not be the nicest guy. But he expects everyone to have as thick a skin as he does, and he is in a fight these days to battle back gremlins who are trying to reshape the entertainment news that his 97-year-old publication has dominated. As he oversees the news of warring moguls and back-stabbing super-agents, a smaller, if just as pitched, battle is growing to determine who owns the changing entertainment coverage in this town.
"Variety is at the moment of truth," he said last week.
Call it a moment of truth, or a blip on the cultural radar screen, but there is little question that technology is altering the direction of the entertainment industry. And in the last year the trade magazines that cover the industry have aggressively changed their approach, expanding not only their coverage with a generation of spin-off titles and sections that focus on technology but also extending the medium in which that coverage reaches their readers.
And tomorrow, the latest twist: Powerful Media, the company that runs Inside.com, the media news Web site, will offer a print magazine, Inside, of entertainment news with a digital slant twice a month.
Inside's arrival comes two months after Variety -- which is published by Cahners, a division of the international media conglomerate Reed Elsevier Inc. -- introduced EV, a monthly magazine free to Variety subscribers that focuses on the impact of technology on entertainment. A flagship magazine that has distinguished itself with headlines like "Ovitz No Govitz at MCA" now publishes a magazine with headlines of a perhaps more sober tone like "Now Where, Napster?" It has a circulation so far of 54,000 copies.
And Variety's Web site will be re-introduced in January, in part to compete with Inside.com.
Inside magazine is produced in partnership with The Industry Standard, which provides production, manufacturing and distribution services but little editorial involvement, said Jonathan Weber, the editor in chief. The Standard, a big magazine success story, has equity and will make money if Inside magazine turns a profit.
The magazine will be distributed free at the outset to 75,000 readers, with hopes that it will reach 350,000 in four years -- a large figure considering that The Standard's circulation is 200,000.
And this fall, yet another contender, The Hollywood Reporter -- which is owned by Billboard Publications, a subsidiary of the Dutch company VNU N.V. -- introduced The Hollywood Reporter East, an e-mailed version of their West Coast edition with East Coast-tailored content. The Reporter has also added more technology coverage.
"There's a lot, but we are still on top," Mr. Bart said. "We are the king."
Daily Variety has a circulation of around 35,000, about 12,000 more than The Reporter's daily edition, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Its weekly edition's circulation is also 35,000, slightly better than the 32,600 for The Reporter's weekly edition.
As for Inside, it is more difficult to judge how large its audience will be. Inside.com will not release the numbers of subscribers to its Web site, where annual subscriptions, which once cost $217, are now available in deals for as low as $139, Deanna Brown, the chief executive of Powerful Media, said. Ms. Brown said she had expected 30,000 subscribers this year but that the real number fell short of that; she would not say how far.
According to Media Metrix, 227,000 different visitors went to Inside.com's Web site in October. The number for Variety.com and TheHollywoodReporter.com was considered too low to be measured, but Media Metrix estimated the figure at fewer than 200,000, and probably around 160,000 each.
Mr. Bart is happy to criticize his competitors' prospects and especially those of Inside magazine. In a recent memo, Mr. Bart wrote that not only does Inside.com fail to break the news that Variety does, but that the writing itself "exhibits a certain flatulence" and that the features are "flaccid."
Mr. Bart added that the subject matter of the magazine -- similar to EV's, he noted -- does not lend itself to necessarily happy readers nor happy advertisers. "Most technology stories right now are negative," Mr. Bart said. "EV gets calls from advertisers asking why we run so many negative stories, but that is the story with technology now: it is about lay-offs and scale-backs."
Michael Hirschorn, a founder of Inside who oversees both the Web site and the magazine, said that he had no comment on Mr. Bart's remarks.
EV and Inside both have to confront the issue of the downturn in technology advertising. Both missed the boom, which crested last year and is dipping. The field is still growing -- technology advertising is up by 26 percent through October of this year for all magazines, according to the Publishers Information Bureau -- but not by the leaps it was last year. For example, The Industry Standard, whose ad pages grew at a rate of almost 400 percent continuously through the middle of 2000, according to the Bureau, is now only up 126 percent through October.
And last week, The Standard announced it would be folding its monthly The Industry Standard Grok back into the main magazine because it does not have enough advertising support. Standard staff members in New York and San Francisco said that the emerging mood around the offices regarding the folding of Grok and the dip in technology advertising was positively gloomy.
Mr. Weber, the editor of The Standard, said he had always expected the downturn. "We were in the middle of an advertising explosion," he said. "So that was great but it is not something you can count on for the long term, and I do not think anybody, including Inside, has been counting on that level of business."
Industry observers said last week that while the technology wave has come and gone, there are ways to make up for it. Mark Mooradian, an analyst at Jupiter Research, said that magazines like EV and The Industry Standard can go after other categories of advertising. "I would think that, for one, Inside would now want to be thinking about retooling and going a bit after the entertainment advertising," he said.
Of the roughly 50 pages of advertising in Inside magazine, most are for technology or Internet companies. Ms. Brown said future advertisers would include luxury goods, entertainment, media and auto companies.
Richard Siklos, the editor-in-chief of Inside magazine, said the print product has always been in Powerful Media's plans. "The big thread running through the entertainment business right now is technological change," he said. "And the reason for doing a print magazine is that the subject is confusing and fast-changing and we should be able to do a 4,000-word story that is well-packaged and well-written that will not require scrolling down a computer screen."
Mr. Siklos, a 35-year-old former Business Week reporter based in New York, has a more earnest mien compared to the old-Hollywood style Mr. Bart evokes.
Mr. Bart, 68, lunches with heads of agencies and studios, and movie stars like John Travolta call up to chat. He writes regular columns, using old-fangled lingo like "tenpercenters" for agents, dishing out advice from a pulpit some find irksome and self-important.
"Sometimes he'll write something annoying, and sometimes he upsets people a little," Mr. Wiatt, the chief executive of the William Morris Agency, said. "Like, 'Agents don't return their phone calls,' which I personally find offensive. But it is the first thing I read when I open Variety."
Another studio executive who asked not to be named said, "You do not want to see a Dear Your-Name-Here column in Variety, if you know what I mean."
Mr. Bart's career began back when Variety reporters were still hammering away on Underwood typewriters and storing whiskey bottles in their desks on West 46th Street in Manhattan. From the late 1950's until 1967, he was a reporter at The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.
Then he went Hollywood. As an executive at Paramount and MGM/UA, he helped put together dozens of movies including "The Godfather," "Harold and Maude" and "Being There." Mr. Bart came on board as Variety's editor in 1989.
"I have seen all sides of this industry, and it can be very ugly," he said, reclining in the private movie theater in the backyard of his house in a gated Los Angeles neighborhood.
Terry Press, the spokeswoman for Dreamworks Pictures, said Mr. Bart does nothing to discourage the sturm und drang of an already tense and ego-driven industry. "He is a strong cup of tea, and not everyone likes strong tea," she said.
Mr. Bart pointed to a framed poster of "Goodbye, Columbus," the first movie he worked on as a producer and seemed almost wistful. But he perked up.
"Did you know this house used to be owned by the producer Harry Cohn?" he said, then added with a salacious smile: "He was an awful, evil man."

ADVERTISING -- Few traces of classic entertainment advertising but lots of newcomers, like HelloNetwork.com; ReporterTV.com ("Full Stream Ahead"); CameraPlanet.com and Morrison & Foerster ("Lawyers for the Global Economy").
 
EDITORIAL -- Has a loud design. Often downbeat about convergence. One story: "Interactive or inactive: Why can't anyone make something solid out of the interactive TV business." A ubiquitous phrase: "Growing pains." For example, "MTV has conquered the planet, but its Web strategy is experiencing some severe growing pains." Or, "The Digital Dilemma: Cable's sexier, more expensive counterpart is experiencing some big-time growing pains."
 
Inside Inside
ADVERTISING -- Technology-oriented (Audible.com, Zap2it.com; Netscape) with a touch of old media (The Economist, Conde Nast; Fortune)
 
EDITORIAL -- Design flair. A generally upbeat tone about convergence. Some corporate Kremlinology. Vampy treatment of two trendspotters: "The (Post-) Coolhuntresses Unleash a Killer Database." In-depth pieces on the AOL-Time Warner merger and TV networks' digital strategies. Kurt Andersen, co-founder of Inside, writes about dot-com negativism: "Sheep run together in one direction when the feed trough is being filled, and turn and trample themselves to run in the opposite direction the instant they're spooked."

HEADLINE: Indonesia Cracks Down on Separatists in Irian Jaya

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Dec. 3

 BODY:
If there were any doubts about who controls Indonesia's rebellious provinces, where demands for independence have strengthened in recent months, President Abdurrahman Wahid laid them to rest this weekend when he ordered a severe crackdown on separatists in Irian Jaya that left at least 10 people dead.
Indonesia has never recognized the declaration of independence in 1961 by Irian Jaya, a province on the western half of the island of New Guinea that is of great importance to Indonesia and the United States because it houses the world's largest copper and gold mines. The mines are operated by the American company Freeport-McMoran, Indonesia's largest foreign taxpayer. 
 Last week, under strong political pressure to act to curb the independence movements that threaten to break up Indonesia, Mr. Wahid sharply departed from his previous policy and dispatched thousands of heavily armed troops to the jungles of Irian Jaya, where some of the two million residents, members of dozens of indigenous tribes, marked the anniversary of the 1961 declaration.
Dozens of pro-independence leaders were arrested, and security forces began enforcing a new government ban on flying Irian Jaya's separatist "morning star" flag.
On Saturday the troops opened fire on about 200 independence supporters in the town of Merauke after secessionists armed with bows and arrows tore down the red-and-white Indonesian flag and hoisted their own banner.
The authorities said the soldiers had been forced to fire because the protesters had begun attacking migrant settlers and refused to disperse. Six demonstrators died from gunshot wounds and two migrants died from arrow wounds, officials said.
Human rights groups and some political activists strongly denounced the military crackdown and called on the government to withdraw troops from Irian Jaya, which is some 2,500 miles east of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. There was widespread concern across Indonesia today that violent clashes between residents of Irian Jaya and security forces could grow.
"The situation is very tense," John Rumbiak, a human rights activist, said in a telephone interview from Jayapura, the provincial capital. "The roads have been blocked by the military, and many people are staying indoors."
"Repressive measures are not the way to defuse this situation," said Mr. Rumbiak, director of the Institution for Human Rights Studies and Advocacy, a private agency. "The heavy concentration of military force will only incite people to riot."
Irian Jaya is one of several regions, including Aceh and Maluku, that are demanding independence from Indonesia, a sprawling archipelago of 17,000 islands and 210 million people, the world's fourth-largest population.
Residents of those regions suffered greatly under the repressive military government of President Suharto, who relinquished power in 1998. Separatist movements have been gaining momentum ever since residents of East Timor voted to break away from Indonesia in a United Nations-sponsored referendum last year.
The Indonesian government's decision to use brute force in Irian Jaya is a sharp departure from President Wahid's previous policy of trying to persuade restive provinces to accept what his administration calls liberal autonomy -- increased control over local administration and a greater share of profits from natural resources.
But beset by corruption scandals, a struggling economy and threats of impeachment, Mr. Wahid has come under growing pressure from nationalists and his political opposition to crack down on the separatists.
In a speech to the nation on Friday, he sternly warned independence supporters that security forces would not tolerate any efforts to secede from the union.
Daud Sihombing, the police chief in Jayapura, got the message. "Your guns are not toys or decorations," Mr. Sihombing told the police after the president's speech. "They must be used to defend the unity of the Republic of Indonesia and to protect the community. If there are people carrying spears, bows and arrows, your duty is to disarm them. If they resist, your guns must be used to shoot them."
The first deaths came on Friday in Fakfak on Irian Jaya's west coast, where the police shot and killed two men after about 50 members of local tribes staged a pro-independence protest and then rioted. The authorities said the police had opened fire when the mob attacked them with bows and arrows.
Security and political analysts say Mr. Wahid's crackdown in Irian Jaya was a grave error because such aggressive campaigns to crush separatists in the past have only increased the popular desire for independence and hardened the position of separatist leaders. "Deploying military force is counterproductive, especially in a place like Irian Jaya, which has no significant armed rebellion," said Kusnato Anggoro, a political analyst for the Center for Strategic and International Studies, an independent research institute.
Mr. Anggoro said that if the government continued its repressive tactics in Irian Jaya, the province could quickly follow the path of Aceh, a region on the northern tip of Sumatra, where more than 5,000 people, mainly civilians, have been killed in fighting between well-armed rebels and the military.
The violence in Aceh has intensified in recent months, despite a truce agreement that has been violated by both sides. The authorities have been bracing for further trouble in Aceh this week as residents plan to commemorate the anniversary of the founding of the rebel Free Aceh Movement 24 years ago.
Ever since Indonesia took control of Irian Jaya from the Dutch in 1963, it has faced hostility from the indigenous Papuan people, who have little in common with the Javanese who dominate the central government. Widespread human rights abuses committed by the military in Irian Jaya have never been addressed. The province's independence leaders could not be reached for comment for this article, because they were all jailed last week.
In contrast to the independence struggle of East Timor, there is little international support for an independent Irian Jaya, mostly because it could have a domino effect across Indonesia and lead to the disintegration of the largest country in southeast Asia. The breakup of a country that oversees some of the world's most important shipping lanes would have a major impact on the region's security and economy.
Human rights activists who have worked closely with the independence movement in Irian Jaya said they remained hopeful that both sides could reach agreement on some form of autonomy. Crucial to such an agreement, the activists said, are the end of military repression and recognition by the central government of the region's distinct cultural heritage.

HEADLINE: Iraq Says It Will Resume Oil Exports

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Iraq said today that it would resume its oil exports to fulfill its existing contracts, backing away from a halt it had called in a dispute with the United Nations over pricing.
Iraq, the third largest producer in OPEC, stopped production on Friday, saying the action was taken over the United Nations' refusal to authorize a new payment arrangement for exports under the oil-for-food program. 
 The action did not disrupt oil markets. The United States has said it will tap its reserves to counter any Iraqi cut-off and Saudi Arabia, by far OPEC's largest producer, hinted that it would do the same, citing the need to keep the market stable.
The announcement of the turnaround was made by Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid.
"The Iraqi oil policy has been always aimed at stability of the world oil market," he said at a news conference today. "Iraq has absolutely no intention to terminate or hinder the exports of its crude in the world market."
He said Iraq was working with United Nations oil overseers to export the full quantity of oil agreed upon under the current six-month phase of the oil-for-food agreement. That phase is due to end on Tuesday, but because of the disruption, pumping will now be extended until sometime in January. Mr. Rashid said Iraq has no conditions for resuming exports. Iraq has been under United Nations sanctions since it invaded Kuwait in August 1990.

HEADLINE: U.S. Weighs Expanding Aid Plan to Colombia's Neighbors

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Even as its $1.3 billion anti-drug program for Colombia is off to a sputtering start, the United States is making plans to expand its aid and cooperation to combat a "spillover effect" of drug trafficking and guerrilla activities in neighboring Latin American nations, Clinton administration officials say.
Consideration of the broader approach comes as Colombia's neighbors voice rising concern that the aid plan will inflame the conflict further and spread instability throughout the region as American helicopters and American-trained counternarcotics battalions deploy in coming months. 
 If pursued by the next administration, the broader plan would greatly increase Washington's investment in nations from Panama to Peru, most of which are struggling with political or economic turmoil and are seen as vulnerable to the organized crime, paramilitary groups and drug-financed rebels that currently rattle Colombia.
Consultations with Colombia's neighbors are still in the early phases, officials say, and there are few specific commitments so far. But Latin American diplomats said they expect the American aid in coming years to dwarf the $180 million in regional help approved by Congress this year; Ecuador alone is seeking $400 million over four years.
Clinton administration officials say they are merely extending their approach to reflect the reality that the effort in Colombia cannot succeed without regional support. "I think this is evolving now into not just a pure Colombia issue, but an Andean regional issue, something it has always been," said Under Secretary of State Thomas R. Pickering.
The administration felt compelled to focus on Colombia because it was in startling difficulty, Mr. Pickering said. But he added, "I think in future years there will be a broader regional aspect to this as we plan and propose to the Congress new budgets for this kind of activity."
Whether Congress will sustain a regional approach is not clear. Republican leaders have vigorously supported what is called Plan Colombia and have pressed the administration to free up funds and equipment. But so far Congress has cast the effort narrowly as a fight against drugs, even as some members warn that American troops could be drawn into combat with antigovernment guerrillas who have alliances with the narcotics traffickers.
During the presidential campaign, both Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore expressed support for Plan Colombia.
But even given the prospect of greater aid, several of Colombia's neighbors are resisting an American approach that they say relies too heavily on the military and could involve them in war.
"We feel the Plan Colombia is for Colombia," said Guillermo Ford, Panama's ambassador to the United States. "Panama does not want to get involved in the internal problems of Colombia. We've been shying away from that in every way."
President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, a former army colonel, has been especially outspoken against the American strategy. He ruffled Colombia last month when his government allowed a spokeswoman for Colombia's largest rebel group to denounce Plan Colombia on the floor of its National Assembly.
Officials across the region are eager, however, for American aid, credits and trade advantages. Even if those countries suspect that Washington is trying to buy their support for a plan with which they do not fully agree, officials cite the compelling need to help underdeveloped parts of their countries susceptible to drug traffickers and guerrillas and to provide sources of income other than the narcotics trade for poor peasants.
Ecuador, which borders Colombia's rebel-dominated Putumayo Province, is seen as especially vulnerable.
"This problem is coming on top of us, just as we are beginning to feel some oxygen," said Ivonne A-Baki, Ecuador's ambassador to Washington. Despite its misgivings, Ecuador is allowing the United States to use an air base on the Pacific coast in the expectation of hundreds of millions in future aid. "Everything comes back to the issue of poverty," Ms. A-Baki said.
Some analysts say the Clinton administration stumbled by failing to emphasize development assistance in Plan Colombia. American officials counter that the package is currently weighted toward military aid only because European and Japanese donors have failed to come through with funds for the "softer" programs to develop alternative crops, reform the judiciary and build a better infrastructure.
That has created problems for Colombia's president, Andres Pastrana, said Michael Shifter, a Colombia expert at the Inter-American Dialogue, a forum for leaders of the hemisphere.
"He's being pressured by the U.S. on one side and his Latin American colleagues are backing away from him," Mr. Shifter said. "They see him as tainted by the U.S. military anti-drug package."
Mr. Pastrana faces a daunting string of tasks: fight a war against two drug-rich rebel groups; improve the human rights record of the nation's security forces; battle drug cartels; cope with a troubled economy; and pursue a viable peace agreement.
Mr. Pastrana will need sustained international support, warned Bernard Aronson, who was an assistant secretary of state for Latin America under President Bush. "The Colombian wars," he said, "have to be approached with the same level of regional and international engagement we saw in Central America, Kosovo, Northern Ireland and the Mideast."

HEADLINE: Saudi Heir Urges Reform, and Turn From U.S.

BYLINE: By SUSAN SACHS 

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia

 BODY:
After a life spent in the shadows of a monarchy known for its caution and calculation, Crown Prince Abdullah, the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, has emerged as a voice sharply critical of American policy in the Middle East and an advocate of domestic reform.
At an age when many men would settle for a peaceful retirement, the 77-year-old heir to the throne has gathered up the reins of power during the protracted illness of his half-brother, King Fahd, and pointed his nation toward an unprecedented engagement with the outside world. 
 This venture into uncharted territory comes at a particularly unsettled time both in the region and at home, where economic troubles have made the ruling family especially vulnerable to popular complaints about its spending habits and its monopoly on decision-making.
Relations with the United States, the cornerstone of foreign policy for decades, are acutely strained by Saudi anger over the Israeli response to the Palestinian uprising of the last two months. Internally, the income gap is widening between the tiny slice of wealthy Saudis and the rest of the fast-growing population of 22 million. Only 5 percent of women work and unemployment for men is estimated at up to 35 percent.
The success of Crown Prince Abdullah's ambitious projects to open up his country may depend, ultimately, on his own longevity and the enthusiasm of the powerful princes behind him. Those princes, too, are advanced in age. Who among their many sons and nephews might succeed them on the Saudi throne is another unanswered question hovering over the world's biggest producer of oil. The ruling clique is already the oldest set of leaders that modern Saudi Arabia has known since King Abdel Aziz, its founder, took the throne at age 53. King Fahd was 59 when he came to power.
Still, many Saudis said the emphasis is on where the kingdom is going and not on who is navigating the road ahead. "We wake up each morning complaining about management, not legitimacy," said one young prince. "We never debate direction. We debate its focus, speed, style, emphasis, colors."
An aloof nation, Saudi Arabia has long used its oil wealth to purchase mountains of foreign consumer goods and weapons, while trying to limit exposure to foreign ideas about human rights, trade and governance. At the same time, it sought to preserve a longstanding political alliance with the United States without agitating a society that, outside the flashy modernity of the big cities, remains suspicious of any intrusion by non-Muslims.
In the four years since King Fahd suffered a stroke and relinquished day-to-day management to Abdullah, barricades have slowly begun to crumble. The Saudi leadership, accustomed to rule through censorship and subsidies, may not have chosen to see them fall. But satellite television, the Internet, globalization and a stagnant job market -- all the accumulating shocks that threaten the insularity of rigid regimes -- have caught up with the leadership.
"We cannot sit by ourselves and say we don't need others," said Prince Turki bin Muhammad, the undersecretary for political affairs in the Saudi Foreign Ministry and a nephew of the crown prince. "We are part of the international community. We have to live and work with it."
Saudi leaders have talked for years of creating more jobs for young people, weaning private business from government contracts and diversifying the economy. An unexpected plunge in oil prices in 1998 -- they fell to about one-third of their present levels -- gave the promises new impetus. But it took a commitment from Crown Prince Abdullah, Saudi officials said, to drive the government to cut the budget and seek foreign investment in job-intensive projects. Although oil prices have rebounded, they added, his interest in reform has not flagged. "We are in the process of inventing ourselves," said one aide to an influential Saudi prince. "All the indications are that we are opening. But what are the consequences? We will have to deal with it as it comes."
The opening, however, has coincided with a burst of anti-American feeling that has intensified with the Palestinian-Israeli violence. Many Saudis accuse the United States of defending Israel's use of military force. Crown Prince Abdullah, say diplomats who have spoken with him, shares that anger.
If the situation is not defused and peace negotiations are not restarted, the crown prince has said, instability could spread. He has called for the United States to show more even-handedness and last month threatened "decisive action" if Israel did not show more restraint.
"The reputation of the United States in the Arab region has dropped to zero," said Prince Talal bin Abdel Aziz, a brother of the crown prince. That is not only a problem for the United States, he added, because "too biased a stand makes an awkward situation for America's friends."
Asked how far Saudi Arabia might go in expressing dissatisfaction, Prince Talal demurred. "It's a delicate situation and not to be discussed now," he said.
Friendship with the United States, the Saudis' biggest trading partner and arms supplier, has been a touchstone of their policy. The leadership gave its backing in the last 10 years to the American-sponsored peace talks and acted as a go-between for Syria and United States.
Now, the new animosity toward the United States has set off a debate about the degree of engagement the Saudis want with the West in general and America in particular. "If the perception of the United States doesn't change, it will weaken the arguments of those who say we should totally open up and plug in with the world," said one influential prince. "People will say it's too risky."
Others said they feared that the hostility could spill over into anti-Western violence in the kingdom, where terrorist bombings in 1995 and 1996 killed 24 American service personnel. In some cities, following Friday Prayers, there have already been unauthorized demonstrations against Israel and the United States, rare in a nation as tightly monitored as Saudi Arabia. If the government feels compelled to crack down on such protests, the willingness to continue with potentially controversial reforms could evaporate, said one Saudi official.
This month, in two separate incidents, booby-trapped bombs exploded under the cars of British expatriates working in Riyadh. A man killed in the first explosion and two men injured in the second worked in the same hospital. Saudi investigators say they do not know if the attacks were linked or politically motivated.
Crown Prince Abdullah, at recent Arab and Islamic summit meetings, has avoided war-mongering but called directly for the United States to reprimand Israel. He has pledged Saudi money to the Palestinians and warned -- with the United States clearly in mind -- that Saudi Arabia would break relations with any country that moved its embassy in Israel to the disputed city of Jerusalem.
Strong statements may defuse public anger here, but the risks remain that the Saudi leaders could come to be seen as apologists for America. "An image of impotence is bad for rulers," said a European diplomat. "But the Saudis don't see themselves as a front-line state. They didn't fight a war with Israel. I think they want their government to cut the right figure and Abdullah has satisfied that desire."
Power in Saudi Arabia does not flow from one man, as in many neighboring countries. Under King Fahd and now under Abdullah, decisions are made in conjunction with senior princes who have held ministerial positions for decades, said diplomats and Saudi officials.
But the crown prince, they added, has put his stamp on both foreign and domestic policy. Regarded as a man of relatively simple tastes, he has occasionally shown up at shopping malls to eat fast food and chat with ordinary Saudis.
"The crown prince is a master politician in a way that Saudi Arabia hasn't had for a while in terms of reading his own public," said another Western diplomat. "I don't think he's in any way anti-American, but he is more openly critical than Fahd would have been."
The crown prince had been considered an unlikely innovator, say many knowledgeable Saudis. Little-traveled until recently, he had closer ties to the conservative tribal chiefs than to Western-trained technocrats and the business elite. He has been commander of the National Guard, a parallel military force to the Army and a bastion of tribal influence, since 1963.
But since acquiring political power, he has pushed to open the country to foreign investors and even tourists. Foreign oil companies, barred from the energy sector for decades, have been invited to bid on developing Saudi gas resources.
The country has applied for membership in the World Trade Organization, which would require reforms of the legal system and a tradition of protectionism. Long criticized by outside governments and organizations over its treatment of women and non-Muslims, it also signed a number of human rights conventions and treaties that oblige it to follow international norms.
Internally, the crown prince has installed young, Western-educated princes on new government councils overseeing key economic areas, while cutting some costly privileges for the 4,000 princes and princesses, including free telephone service and vacation allowances.
He also created what is called Family Council this year to manage the affairs of the royal family and appease public opinion by divorcing the family's finances from the government's. Eventually, the council may also deal with a question of succession. For now, according to several princes, family members are more worried about their public image.
"It's annoying to us," said Prince Talal, a council member, referring to the ruling family's reputation for profligacy. "It's a big family and they have been used to certain things from the days of King Abdel Aziz. If you disconnect these things abruptly, we will have a family problem and we want to avoid family problems, while at the same time satisfying our people."

HEADLINE: CONTESTING THE VOTE: UPDATE;
Battle Moves To Talk Shows

 BODY:

As the battle for the presidency between Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore continued in Florida courts yesterday, Dick Cheney hit the talk show circuits and Mr. Gore met with advisers.
 
On the NBC News program "Meet the Press," Mr. Cheney urged Mr. Gore to concede, saying history books will be more apt to portray him in a positive light if the election were brought to a close soon. But Warren Christopher, the former secretary of state who is assisting Mr. Gore in the Florida court battle, said the vice president has no intention of giving up right now. 

Mr. Cheney also said the nation could be on the verge of a recession and the $1.3 trillion tax cut at the heart of Mr. Bush's campaign platform would be economically appropriate and politically viable, assuming that Mr. Bush becomes president.
 
Teams of Republican and Democratic lawyers spent a second day in court in Tallahassee, Fla., arguing over the punch-card voting system.
 
Lawyers for Mr. Gore were able to get a Republican witness to admit that the devices used in Miami-Dade County could malfunction and fail to properly record a vote.
 
But Mr. Bush's legal team fired back, getting a statistician and an actual voter to assert other reasons that could result in a large number of questionable ballots.
 
 In Washington, Mr. Gore held a high-level legal strategy session. Participants said that no "fateful" decisions were made, but they were bracing for a possible setback in at least one Florida court and sorted through some options should the Florida Legislature award the state's 25 electoral votes to Mr. Bush on Dec. 12.
 
Mr. Gore gave every sign in a television interview that he was digging in for at least two more weeks. On CBS's "60 Minutes," Mr. Gore said he had given little thought to concession.

HEADLINE: A Smoldering Fire in Baghdad

 BODY:
Nine years after the Persian Gulf war, Saddam Hussein remains a menace to American interests in the Middle East. Seeing Gov. George W. Bush flanked recently at his ranch by two architects of the war effort, Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, was a piquant reminder that Washington has unfinished business in Iraq. One of the first tests awaiting Mr. Bush or Vice President Al Gore will be to devise a policy that keeps Mr. Hussein in check even as other nations like Russia and France press to end Iraq's isolation.
Mr. Hussein continues to defy United Nations peace terms by blocking international weapons inspections. He chips away at the economic sanctions meant to keep him from rebuilding his arsenal of biological and chemical weapons and to prevent him from developing nuclear weapons. Last week he closed the tap on the 2.3 million barrels a day of oil that Baghdad exports when consuming nations rejected his demand for a 50-cent-a-barrel surcharge over U.N.-administered prices. He relented yesterday. The surcharge would have been paid directly into the Iraqi treasury, where it could have been used to pay for new weapons. With global oil supplies tight, any sustained Iraqi cutoff would further inflate prices that are already painfully high and could even create an oil shortage. 
 For over a year, the Clinton administration has deliberately downplayed problems with Iraq. It hoped to avoid a new military showdown at a time when international unity was frayed and feared that another round of inconclusive airstrikes against Iraqi military and industrial targets might have complicated Mr. Gore's presidential campaign.
Iraq used this period to try to extricate itself from international monitoring and economic pressure. When the Security Council passed a compromise resolution last December that would have offered some promise of relief from sanctions in exchange for the return of U.N. weapons inspectors, Baghdad rejected it and the resolution has never been put into effect. An increasing number of countries have resumed civilian flights into Baghdad, ignoring a U.N. ban.
Iraq is preparing to use Russia's presidency of the Security Council this month to seek a further loosening of sanctions and financial controls while whittling down inspection requirements. Washington needs to deflect these new pressures and reinvigorate its own policies even before the next administration takes office.
America's guiding goals should be to keep Iraq from threatening its neighbors and the flow of oil to the West by making clear that any future Iraqi aggression would be unacceptable. To this end, Washington must work with Security Council members to maintain and if necessary tighten sanctions so long as Baghdad refuses to accept inspections. America should be prepared to use airstrikes against selected targets if there is hard intelligence that these sites are being used to manufacture new unconventional weapons. Mr. Hussein badly lost the Persian Gulf war. But he has not given up on winning the peace.

To the Editor:
"Racial Pattern in Demographics of Error-Prone Ballots" (news article, Nov. 29):
The punch-card ballots that were used by the majority of Florida's black voters in this election have a discriminatory effect on the votes of the poor and minorities in every election. We are only now concerned because the discriminatory effect has a tangible impact on the "haves," those powerful, monied interests that have invested heavily in the outcome of the presidential election. 
 Certainly, equal voting opportunity is highly important to our democracy, but so are issues that do not make or break a presidential election, like equal educational, employment and economic opportunity.
As a country, we need to find ways to address all of these pressing concerns.

HEADLINE: CONTESTING THE VOTE: THE REPUBLICAN RUNNING MATE;
History Will View Gore 'In a Better Light' If He Quits Soon, Cheney Says

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3

 BODY:
Dick Cheney called today for Vice President Al Gore to concede the presidential election, saying history would regard Mr. Gore "in a better light if he were to bring this to a close in the very near future."
Speaking on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," Mr. Cheney also said he believed that the nation was on the verge of a recession and needed the stimulus of a tax cut like the one proposed by the Republicans. 
 Both statements seemed designed in part to build public pressure in different ways for an end to Mr. Gore's legal challenge of the vote in Florida. In the same interview, Mr. Cheney talked about troubling economic indicators and the importance of a new administration getting to work on them.
The political conflict since the election has eaten up so much of the transition period, he said, that there could be damage to the effectiveness of the next administration.
"Let's get on with it," said Mr. Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential candidate.
Warren Christopher, the former secretary of state who is helping Mr. Gore in his fight in Florida, said the vice president had no intention of giving up while the legal challenges in Florida and at the United States Supreme Court were under way.
"It's late innings, but it's far from over," Mr. Christopher said on the CBS program "Face the Nation."
Mr. Cheney, he said, "is trying to hurry history along."
"I can assure you that the vice president, when the time comes, will concede in a very gracious way," Mr. Christopher said. "He understands his obligations to the people of the country."
Mr. Cheney cited "growing evidence" that the economy was slowing abruptly, including declines in automobile sales and corporate earnings, and he asserted that the $1.3 trillion tax cut at the heart of the campaign platform of George W. Bush would be both economically appropriate and politically feasible.
"We may well be on the front edge of a recession here, and I would hope that would change people's calculations with respect to the wisdom of the kind of tax cut that Governor Bush has recommended," Mr. Cheney said.
Mr. Cheney's comments about the possibility of a recession were unusual. Few politicians like to be the bearers of bad news or to be seen as pessimists. But his outlook was in line with comments on Saturday by Mr. Bush, who said he was concerned about a slowdown, and with the analysis provided to Mr. Bush by his chief economic adviser, Lawrence B. Lindsey, a former Federal Reserve governor, aides to Mr. Bush said.
Asked about Mr. Bush's expectations for the economy, Ari Fleischer, his spokesman, said that there were "all the bellwethers of short-term problems" but that the "long-term fundamentals are good."
There have been many signs in the past few weeks that the economy has slowed abruptly after a series of increases in the interest rate by the Federal Reserve and a steep fall in many stock prices. But most economists believe that the economy remains basically healthy and that a slowdown is needed to avert a buildup of inflationary pressures.
While there has been increased speculation among analysts about whether a recession might develop next year if the economy continues to decelerate, relatively few economists have predicted an end to what earlier this year became the longest business expansion on record.
Mr. Cheney and Mr. Bush appeared to be using the possibility of a slowdown to build support for their tax plan, which proposes cuts in all income-tax rates, a doubling of the child credit and elimination of the federal estate tax.
But they also seemed to use economic worries as a point of pressure on Mr. Gore, suggesting that uncertainty over the presidency was leaving financial markets on edge. Andrew Card, picked by Mr. Bush as his chief of staff, said on ABC's "This Week": "The economy is a little bit fragile right now, and the markets are reflecting that. But hopefully when the election results are finally settled and Governor Bush can begin to put together his team and announce it, there will be restored confidence."
In another sign of the Bush camp's effort to seize the initiative, Karl Rove, the chief Bush campaign strategist, will visit Washington this week to set up an office in the transition headquarters and work on the transition, several Bush advisers said. Other campaign officials may follow.
If Mr. Bush takes office, with the Senate evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans and Republicans holding only a narrow edge in the House, even Republicans on Capitol Hill have said Mr. Bush would have difficulty getting his entire tax package enacted. In his comments today, Mr. Cheney suggested that the political calculation could be altered by economic developments.
"I would think that the kinds of tax changes we recommended and that Governor Bush recommended, especially in terms of reducing marginal rates, for example, are in fact exactly what needs to be done with respect to providing the kind of stimulus to ensure the resumption of long-term economic growth," Mr. Cheney said.
Mr. Cheney's argument did not appear to sway Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader in the House. Mr. Gephardt said he did not think the country was in a recession.
"I think whoever is president, we're going to have a tax cut," Mr. Gephardt said. "I hope it's not a huge one that I think would overdo it, and get back to overheating the economy."
But Senator Robert G. Torricelli, a Democrat of New Jersey, asserted that "the economic situation has severely weakened, even deteriorated."
"To have 30 percent of the equity in the Nasdaq market in a matter of months evaporate, is going to have a profound economic impact on the country," he said.
But unlike Mr. Card of the Bush staff, Mr. Torricelli said that did not mean there should be a rush to resolve the election dispute. "This country cannot afford to have a presidency of George W. Bush or Al Gore without legitimacy, with questioned authority, where we spend four years debating this election," he said on "Face the Nation."
In raising the specter of a recession now, the Bush camp could also be trying to link it to the Clinton administration rather than taking the blame for it if Mr. Bush takes office.
Mr. Cheney said he and Mr. Bush's transition team would be ready to start announcing cabinet and staff appointments in the next few weeks, and that the picks would be "diverse in every sense of the word."
But Mr. Fleischer of the Bush campaign disputed a report in The New York Times today that Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney had discussed with leaders of Congress naming a Democrat to be treasury secretary and that it had been adamantly rejected by J. Dennis Hastert, speaker of the House, and Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader.
"There was no such discussion," Mr. Fleischer said. "It never happened. They talked about having Democrats serve in the cabinet. There was never a discussion that said certain cabinet agencies are off-limits to members of other parties."
Republican officials with ties to the Bush campaign have said that at least three people will probably be considered for the treasury post: Jack Hennessy, former chairman and chief executive of Credit Suisse First Boston; Donald B. Marron, chairman and chief executive of the Paine Webber Group; and Walter V. Shipley, former chairman of Chase Manhattan.
A person who attended Mr. Bush's meeting with Republican Congressional leaders on Saturday said Mr. Lott made a strong pitch for former Senator Dan Coats of Indiana to be considered for defense secretary. Other people whose names have surfaced as potential contenders for that spot: Paul D. Wolfowitz, who worked under Mr. Cheney in the previous Bush administration; Norman Augustine, who has served as chairman of two major defense contractors, Lockheed Martin and Martin Marietta; and Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, who recently indicated he was not interested. Mr. Lott and Mr. Hastert told Mr. Bush that he needed a labor secretary sympathetic to business interests to oversee regulatory matters, like new workplace rules promulgated by the Clinton administration.

2 Experts Predict Slower Ad Spending

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOT and GREG WINTER 

 BODY:
Two forecasters of advertising spending are predicting more normal but not recessionary conditions in 2001.
"We have seen the peak of an extraordinary advertising expenditure cycle," said John Perriss, chairman and chief executive at Zenith Media in London, referring to the strong results this year fueled by the Olympics, elections and dot-coms. 
 "We are returning to sustainable robust advertising expenditure growth in line with the prospects for economic growth," he added. "Slowdown would be an overstatement."
Mr. Perriss predicts worldwide ad spending will grow 6 percent in 2001 from 2000 after growing 7.9 percent in 2000 from 1999. He is to discuss his forecasts in detail this morning at the opening session of the UBS Warburg Media Conference in New York. Zenith is jointly owned by the Cordiant Communications Group and the Publicis Groupe.
And Jack Myers, chief economist for Myers Reports in New York, predicted softness in ad spending in the first half of 2001, followed by "a nice recovery" by the fourth quarter "that will build toward sustained media industry growth in 2002 and for several years thereafter." He predicts American ad spending will grow 4.9 percent in 2001 from 2000 after growing 9 percent in 2000 from 1999.

THE NEW GEOGRAPHY
How the Digital Revolution Is Reshaping the American Landscape
By Joel Kotkin
242 pages. Random House. $22.95.
In the 19th century the innovations of the industrial revolution -- the railroad, the telegraph and mass production factories, among others -- helped transform the economic and social geography of America. The digital revolution is working a similar transformation on the American landscape today, argues the writer Joel Kotkin in his jumbled new book, "The New Geography." 
 Whereas many avatars of high tech contend that the ascendancy of the Internet and wireless communication will free people from the constraints of place (and for that matter, from the bounds of the non-virtual world), Mr. Kotkin, a senior fellow with the Davenport Institute for Public Policy at Pepperdine University, argues that these developments have made geography more important than ever. If people and businesses are freed by technology to move wherever they want, he reasons, then "the question of where to locate becomes increasingly contingent on the peculiar attributes of any given location."
In the transition to a digital economy, Mr. Kotkin argues, the "quality of life" quotient, rather than access to raw materials or ports, will become increasingly important, turning three types of places into magnets for the technological elite, skilled workers and the upwardly mobile: cities like New York and Los Angeles, rich in "such creatively driven fields as media, fashion, advertising and design"; new high-end suburbs (or "nerdistans" in the author's terminology) like Irvine, Calif., and Raleigh, N.C., that seek to eliminate the sorts of distractions -- crime, traffic, commercial blight -- "that have commonly been endemic in cities and increasingly in older suburban areas"; and upscale rural areas (or "Valhallas") like Jackson Hole, Wyo., and Park City, Utah, with "significant urbanlike amenities and appealing scenery, where knowledge workers can enjoy a pastoral paradise yet remain plugged into the burgeoning information economy."
Among the losers in the new digital world, Mr. Kotkin suggests, are cities like St. Louis and Detroit, built around "a mass-industrial base" and lacking "any sustainable appeal for the new urbanites;" older suburbs (like Upper Darby near Philadelphia and Harvey outside Chicago), subject to the flight of businesses and the middle class, and well on their way "to becoming highly diverse suburban slums"; and rural communities -- in nondescript portions of the Great Plains, Appalachia, the South and West -- that "depend on ranching, lumbering, fishing and farming" for their economic well-being.
Interesting as some of Mr. Kotkin's observations may be, "The New Geography" remains a disorganized hodgepodge of a book filled with repetitions and contradictions. Sometimes the book seems to want to be a social history of cities (with heavy debts to writers like Jane Jacobs and Lewis Mumford) and their shifting relationship to the suburbs and the countryside. Sometimes it seems to want to address the subject indicated by its subtitle: that is, the consequences that the digital revolution is having on the American landscape.
Mr. Kotkin also seems to be of two minds about many of the issues he addresses, alternately optimistic and pessimistic, alternately hopeful and anxious about technology. On one hand, he observes that the digital revolution threatens to accelerate the already diminishing role that churches and neighborhood organizations play in individuals' lives. On the other, he believes that high-speed communication networks "could offer a new spur to the revitalization of place-centered local institutions" by giving grass roots groups a potent tool.
On one hand, he writes that "urban areas, with their confluence of design, fashion, entertainment and publishing professionals, are unquestionably best suited to incubate the firms and industries" that are part of the new "cultural industrial complex." On the other, he argues that improvements in telecommunication technology create "the ability to choose one's locale -- even in the most remote of places," thereby redrawing "the map of wealth and power away from their traditional abodes, largely the core cities, to a host of newer, previously marginal locations."
On one hand, he notes that commerce has become "increasingly detached from a sense of place," moving from the town center to the suburban shopping center to the theme mall and more recently to cyberspace. On the other, he sees a backlash against chain stores and conformity, and a desire on the part of some communities to re-embrace uniqueness and authenticity by rebuilding their downtowns.
Certainly many of the seemingly contradictory phenomena noted in this book coexist, as America struggles to come to terms with the digital age and its social and economic fallout. The problem is Mr. Kotkin does not manage to put these developments into a useful context; nor does he help the reader understand the momentous changes at work in America today. He has taken on an intriguing subject and raised some important questions but failed to write a coherent or illuminating book.

HEADLINE: Japan Shows Little Growth In Economy

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 4

 BODY:
The Economic Planning Agency of Japan said today that the economy grew 0.2 percent in the quarter that ended Sept. 30, continuing to teeter between growth and recession.
"That's a pretty tepid figure, which essentially means we've passed the peak and will see another slowdown," said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo. 
 Although the figure, which put the country on pace to grow 1 percent for the full year, was in line with economists' predictions, revisions introduced last month pushed the second- quarter figure down to 0.2 percent from 0.9 percent, a significant change.
Most economists were bracing their clients for a potentially sharp deceleration in growth in the current quarter as economies elsewhere around the globe, most notably in the United States, show signs of slowing. The appetite in those markets for Japanese exports has been a primary driver of economic growth here over the last several quarters, but in the third quarter, imports exceeded exports, a rare occurrence in Japan.
"Japan has not completely lost its momentum yet, so if external conditions turn out better than they currently appear to be, then maybe the gloom is unwarranted," said Masaaki Kanno, an economist at J. P. Morgan in Tokyo. "But if not, Japan faces quite a tough period ahead, I think."
Taichi Sakaiya, the head of the agency, said that the government could not afford to reverse its expansive fiscal policy despite growing public concerns about Japan's mounting debt burden.
"If the government abandons steps to support the economy, it would be a harsh blow," he said.
That comment affirms doubts in the private sector that Japan's economy can sustain a recovery on its own. Government spending was down 10.7 percent in the third quarter, as public works budgets were exhausted, and the effects of a modest supplemental budget passed a couple of weeks ago will not show up until sometime early next year.
Although Mr. Sakaiya insisted that consumer spending, which accounts for 60 percent of economic activity here, would pick up early next year, the statistics do not bear him out. Wages fell in the third quarter and pressure for Japanese companies to pursue more restructuring is rising.
A recent survey of almost 400 large companies by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun indicated that bonuses would be up slightly this winter, but Mr. Feldman said using that survey to predict trends in the overall economy "is tempting fate."
A bright spot in today's report was capital spending, which began to rise early this year and has been the largest contributor to economic growth this year. The figure was up 7.8 percent, but the number is likely to be revised.
Mr. Feldman said that there were signs that capital spending would slow in coming months. He said inventories had been growing and telecommunications and other information-technology-related businesses, which have been chiefly responsible for the robust outlays this year, plan to reduce spending.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: A Burst of Energy in the Regional Theater;
Spiffy New Homes and Riskier Productions Expand the Art and the Audience

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

 BODY:
This fall a new musical, "The Ballad of Little Jo," had its world premiere at the Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago. A historical tale thematically about gender issues, set in the late 19th century in an Idaho mining town, it was based on the life of a real woman, Josephine Monaghan, who, until she died, was thought by her neighbors to have been a man.
The show was not terribly well received by critics, nor should it have been. Among other things, the book was stretched thin by its ambition to be historically evocative, sociologically and politically current and narratively melodramatic. The set, an amalgam of mining mounds and rickety frontier structures, was unattractive and left little room for any significant choreography. For a western-theme show, the orchestrations were oddly incongruous; the instruments included a bassoon and an oboe but no guitar or squeezebox and the violinist was more a chamber player than a fiddler. 
 Nonetheless, the show was hardly dispiriting. It had a varied, lush and often catchy score by a theater newcomer, Mike Reid, and as directed by Tina Landau, it was performed and presented with the eager confidence of a first flight; I suspect that even its creators viewed it as a work in progress, and it will surprise me if it isn't mounted again somewhere, much improved.
It is significant that "Little Jo," the first musical by Steppenwolf, was chosen as the initial production of its 25th anniversary season, a signal that the company, best known for its acting ensemble, is upgrading its breadth and ambition. But it is also representative of a burst of energy in regional theaters across the country, many of which have taken advantage of a strong economy, a growing companionability with commercial producers and their own institutional maturity to present riskier and more expansive work than they did even five years ago.
There may be a certain reluctance to acknowledge this development. Nonprofit regional theaters are accustomed to economic struggle, particularly since the generosity of the National Endowment for the Arts was curtailed by Congress, and they are used to laboring under the perception that the commercial theater in New York is the dominant center of the theatrical universe. But these are, by many measurable standards, heady times. And by some less measurable standards, too. Steppenwolf's "Little Jo" was a clear example of a luxury that theater artists are always clamoring for: the opportunity to fail.
Signs are everywhere that regional theaters are more established than ever in their communities. The spiffy new Goodman Theater in downtown Chicago is only the most recent of a rash of capital improvement projects around the country, and others are in the works, like a new $100 million home for the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. Surveys by the Theater Communications Group, the industry's trade organization, show that average earned income has risen 13.6 percent over the last two years, attendance is on an uptick, and though expenses have increased by nearly 20 percent, more theaters are breaking even or better because contributed income has increased as well.
"The thing worth emphasizing is the moment of growth and expansion we're facing now," said Ben Cameron, the executive director of the communications group. "Especially after the funding crises of the early 90's, when many theaters pulled back a bit, and there was a sense that fiscal conservatism was beginning to translate into artistic conservatism. Our most recent analysis of the field, however, showed that in fiscal year 1999, cast size grew for the first time in many years, an important signal that larger work is coming back."
Mr. Cameron was speaking carefully, being sure to note that as the nonprofit regional theater industry enters middle age, with a raft of new artistic leaders, there are new concerns, issues involving institution maintenance rather than institution building and long-term stability rather than immediate black ink. Few theaters have significant endowments, and many are reconfiguring their boards.
Audience-building remains a nascent science. And many theaters are concerned with investment in new sound and lighting equipment, not just to stay technologically current but to answer a growing audience taste for spectacle. Whether spectacle belongs in nonprofit regional theaters -- whose numbers grew most rapidly in the 1960's with the anti-Broadway impetus of presenting classics and ensemble-based work -- is a continuing debate.
Still, for me, a reporter and a critic who has spent a fair amount of time on the road in the last three years, there is a palpable sense that regional theaters are now, perhaps more than ever before, expanding the art of and the audiences for the American theater.
"Tantalus," the 10-part Trojan War epic by John Barton, directed by Sir Peter Hall, now completing its sojourn at the Denver Center Theater Company, is the most grandiose current example of the trend. Equally indicative, however, is Mary Zimmerman's flashy treatment of "The Odyssey," a visual extravaganza that has yet to be seen in New York but has been presented in many regional houses that in recent years were more likely to rely on smaller-scale, better-known plays, like "Driving Miss Daisy" or "Wit," to fill out their subscription slots.
Untested works by known playwrights -- like "The Bungler," Moliere's early comedy, presented in a highly enjoyable production by Doug Hughes at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, and "The Play About the Baby," Edward Albee's elliptical new work, which had its American premiere in the spring at the Alley Theater in Houston -- are sharing schedules with untested works by less well known playwrights.
I have seen four of them in the last six weeks: "Rice Boy" by Sunil Kuruvilla (Yale Repertory Theater in New Haven) and "Nocturne" by Adam Rapp (American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass.), two coming-of-age plays by first-time playwrights; "Spin," a timely political satire by Robert William Sherwood (Wilma Theater in Philadelphia); and "Compleat Female Stage Beauty" by Jeffrey Hatcher (Philadelphia Theater Company), a clever exploration of rich territory, the world of the English theater at the 17th-century moment when women were first allowed on the stage.
It's a small and Northeastern sampling, and I couldn't recommend any of them without equivocating, but I would say the same about a random handful of Off Broadway shows. Pleasures are rampant in them all, and the range of subjects, writing styles and visual productions gives off a collective gurgle of a well-irrigated theater landscape. You can't predict for sure, but the harvest is looking good. One result of all this is an important alteration in the chemistry between theater in New York and theater elsewhere. It isn't just that shows are now regularly being seeded and grown in the regions for commercial ends: that's been going on for some time. "The Full Monty," the current Broadway hit which began life at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego, is only the latest musical to have been developed out of the New York limelight in partnership with Broadway producers. "Jane Eyre," which began at La Jolla Playhouse in Southern California is now in previews at the Brooks Atkinson Theater, and it may well be followed by "Thoroughly Modern Millie," now in La Jolla.
Nor is it only that terrific new plays and revivals produced by regional theaters continue to find their way to national prominence. Last year's "Death of a Salesman," which originated at the Goodman, continued a trend that has included, among many others, "Angels in America" (from the Eureka Theater in San Francisco and then the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles). There is a pipeline to Off Broadway as well; to name just one example, "A Lesson Before Dying," Romulus Linney's adaptation of the Ernest J. Gaines novel, opened the season for the Signature Theater Company, a co-production with the Alabama Shakespeare Festival, where it was presented earlier this year.
Rather, what has struck me most forcefully recently is a range of new productions that have been mounted by regional theaters without looking beyond their own audiences. In addition to the new plays and musicals, these include large-scale revivals that I found hugely admirable, like "The Plough and the Stars," Sean O'Casey's drama, at the Guthrie last summer; Howard Sackler's epic play, "The Great White Hope," at the Arena Stage in Washington; and "Dead End," Sidney Kingsley's class-conflict melodrama set in 1930's Manhattan, at the Huntington Theater in Boston, a vivid production (actors jumping into the downstage pool, that is, the Hudson River, regularly soaked the front row patrons) that was the initial offering of the theater's new artistic director, Nicholas Martin.
The point is that the American theater gospel is no longer being spread papally from New York. It has its own independent denominations.
Perhaps the most complex new play I've seen this season is "Work Song," a triptych of interlocking one-acts by Eric Simonson and Jeffrey Hatcher about the life of the architect Frank Lloyd Wright, presented by the Milwaukee Repertory Theater. Its three parts, each with a different narrative strategy and tone, take the form of a conventional stage bio.
One part presents an acid view of Wright in manipulative, pathetically regal celebrityhood at Taliesin, his monument to himself in rural Wisconsin, and the finale is an exquisite vignette about a visit by the 90-year-old Wright to one of his first houses in Oak Park, Ill. This makes for a directorial nightmare, and Mr. Simonson, who handled the director's chores, hadn't quite covered over the seams. Still, the show felt not only odd and new but at home; Midwestern theater on a Midwestern theme. I hope it will be remounted soon and often; Wisconsin deserves to be heard.
Recently I tested my outsider's viewpoint on a couple of regional insiders, one brand new, another a distinguished veteran. Is this a boom time for regional theater?
"I think we're in the middle of the good old days of the new regional theater movement," said Bartlett Sher, the new artistic director of the Intiman Theater in Seattle. "We're in a position to make our theaters into extraordinary artistic producing organizations, and it's a time when you don't have to be in New York. People are going to look back at this time and say: 'Remember when this guy did that? Remember when she did that?' "
Gordon Davidson, who founded the Mark Taper Forum 34 years ago, was just a bit crankier.
"There's no question that more and more theaters do new work; the excitement of developing a new piece and reaping the rewards, there's more of it going on," he said. The Taper is about to present three new plays in a row. Still, he worried, he said, about losing sight of the original emphasis on the classics and on actor-based theater.
"I think, in general, we're better informed, we're better managers, so we're more stable, if not necessarily healthy," he said. "What I'm worried about is quality. We need more time for rehearsal, more time for ensemble work. There should be more exploration of acting styles. So I don't have a stability angst. I have an artistic angst." As it should be, no?

HEADLINE: Russia Has Few Weapons As Infectious Diseases Surge

SERIES: FREEDOM'S TOLL: Tuberculosis Regains Ground in Russia

BYLINE: By ABIGAIL ZUGER 

DATELINE: VORONEZH, Russia

 BODY:
Natalia Kostina lay flat on her back on a metal examining table in this city's tuberculosis hospital, staring impassively at the ceiling. In an instant, a doctor jabbed into her abdomen a thick needle attached to a syringe and pushed in a few cubic inches of air.
A moment later the needle was withdrawn and Ms. Kostina, silent and stoic, got off the table and returned to her room. Her treatment was over for another week. 
 Injecting air into the abdomen is a painful, archaic, last-ditch way to battle tuberculosis when medications are scarce or can no longer help. It has not been used in the West for decades.
But this is Russia, where TB, once nearly under control, has become epidemic since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Doctors often use air injections to fight TB strains that resist the most commonly used drugs. The technique compresses infected lungs, giving them time to rest and heal.
Ms. Kostina, 24, was healthy until two years ago, working as a nurse at the local prison, just a mile down the road from this hospital. There, as in most of Russia's overcrowded prisons, tuberculosis has been spiraling out of control. When she fell ill with fever and a cough, doctors quickly ascertained that she had caught tuberculosis from one of her inmate patients.
Despite months of treatment, her disease got worse. All four of the antituberculosis drugs she tried were powerless against it. Moreover, during the year she spent traveling from work to home, then into the hospital, then to a convalescent home, then back to the hospital, she had undoubtedly exposed dozens of others to her drug-resistant germs.
Russia's political turmoil, its economic crisis and its new freedoms have been accompanied by a wave of old diseases. Tuberculosis is flooding the country, producing what some authorities are calling the world's largest outbreak of the drug-resistant variety, one of medicine's most ominous problems.
Rates of other infections, including hepatitis, syphilis and AIDS, are skyrocketing. An epidemic of diphtheria swept through in the mid-1990's. Reports of smaller, regional outbreaks of encephalitis, typhoid fever, malaria, polio, pneumonia and influenza pepper the nightly news.
Health experts describe Russia's prison system as an "epidemiologic pump," continuously seeding the country with pockets of tuberculosis that can spread on their own. Increasingly, TB cases of Russian origin are turning up in the Baltic countries and even farther afield -- for instance, Germany and Israel.
Specialists worry that if the rising rates of infectious diseases in Russia continue unabated, the country itself may turn into an epidemiologic pump, sending infectious diseases into the rest of the world.
"It's not surprising to see a case here," said Barry N. Kreiswirth, a tuberculosis expert at the Public Health Research Institute in New York City, "but it's a good reminder that it doesn't take much for one person to be a vector and start an epidemic."
 
An Old Scourge Made New
Tuberculosis is hardly new in Russia. It ravaged the country in the 19th century and the first half of the 20th. But before the Soviet Union fell it was finally being brought under control, through major government effort and expense. Infection rates, though roughly three times higher than in the United States, were falling in parallel with those in Europe and developed countries elsewhere.
This victory bred "a tremendous pride on the Russian side," said Dr. Mario Raviglione, coordinator for TB activities at the World Health Organization in Geneva.
That has changed.
With thin budgets, government health programs are no match for infections given new momentum by increasing poverty, stress, alcoholism, overcrowding and intravenous drug use.
Mortality from infectious diseases has not reached third world rates here. Last year, infections were estimated to account for 2 percent of all deaths.
But that is still four times higher than in most developed nations. "The total cost of infectious diseases in Russia is not that great," said Martin McKee, an expert in Russian public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, "but the important thing is that it is going up and up and up." As AIDS becomes more firmly entrenched, that cost is expected to rise even faster. Deaths due to tuberculosis alone rose 30 percent in 1999.
In the days of the Soviet Union, the powerful Sanitation and Epidemiology Service, or "SanEp," sought out infectious diseases and stamped them out with compulsory vaccinations and annual disease screenings: chest X-rays for tuberculosis, blood tests for syphilis. People suspected of harboring infection were removed from society for as long as it took to guarantee that they were no longer contagious. The SanEp tactics were brutal -- people were often taken from their families and hometowns for months to years -- but they were effective.
"Now, instead, we have human rights," said Alla Loseva, the Voronezh tuberculosis hospital's deputy chief doctor, rolling her eyes. SanEp is but a poorly funded shell of its former self. Its job has fallen instead to doctors like Ms. Loseva, struggling to contain the epidemic with minuscule budgets and skeletal staffs.
A colleague, Dr. Galina Chervanova, said that when she arrived at the hospital in 1987, "there was even talk of eliminating TB completely."
"Now we are not even close to that anymore," added Dr. Chervanova, the hospital's deputy chief superintendent. "The number of sick people has risen, and we are seeing many, many difficult, chronic cases."
 
Prisons as Incubators
When it comes to TB, this faded industrial city 300 miles south of Moscow mirrors the nation. As elsewhere, the number of TB patients has almost doubled since 1993 -- and the source of most of the local epidemic is the prison down the road.
After the Soviet Union collapsed, prison populations soared in Russia, which now shares with the United States the highest per capita rates of incarceration in the world. From overcrowding and weak health programs came breeding grounds for tuberculosis, which is transmitted by particles coughed or sneezed into crowded spaces.
Without a steady supply of the right medications, TB becomes resistant to drugs and much harder to treat. This was the case in the prisons, where anti-TB medications are continually running short, and prisoners still in need of treatments are released or transferred.
An epidemic-within-an-epidemic of drug-resistant disease soon arose and began percolating out of the prisons, carried by workers, like Ms. Kostina, or by released prisoners. Periodic prison amnesties also flooded the country with prison-bred TB -- last year, Dr. Chernova said, more than 1,000 prisoners with active tuberculosis were released into the Voronezh area.
"In Russia at one point," said Dr. Paul E. Farmer, a TB authority, "80 percent of the index cases of drug-resistant disease in the community could be traced to the prisons." Dr. Farmer is a Harvard anthropologist and infectious disease physician.
As many as 10 percent of Russia's million prisoners now have active tuberculosis, Dr. Farmer and his colleagues estimated in a report issued last year by Harvard University and the Open Society Institute at the Soros Foundation. More than half of those cases are resistant to at least one anti-TB drug, and 20 percent to 30 percent of them are resistant to several.
 
The Cost of Drug Resistance
Treating drug-resistant tuberculosis is among the greatest of medical challenges. It requires expensive, "second-line" drugs, which must be taken for years instead of months, and which have many side effects.
Dr. Raviglione of the World Health Organization estimated that drugs to treat an ordinary case of TB in Russia would cost $20. But he put the bill for a drug-resistant case at $13,000.
In Voronezh, Ms. Kostina has been luckier than most. To supplement the painful weekly injections of air into her abdomen, which let her infected lung rest, doctors found her a last-ditch pair of medications: a spray she inhales directly into the lung, and expensive American pills imported by the Russian government and doled out in tiny quantities to outlying hospitals.
With this concoction of archaic and cutting-edge treatments, she has gotten better. Her fever is gone. She has gained weight, and the cavities in her lungs have shrunk. She left the hospital last September to convalesce at home. So far none of her family has come down with TB.
But the expensive pills she takes twice a day use up her hospital's entire allotment. As long as she needs the medication, the hospital has none for anyone else.
In the face of desperate medicine shortages, nearly a dozen private and public international health organizations are now collaborating with Russian experts to regain control of the disease.
Although they represent an international investment of hundreds of millions of dollars, these efforts involve only about a dozen of the country's 70 provinces, Dr. Raviglione said, reaching a "pretty small percentage" of the population.
Nor is it very clear how best to use the money. The W.H.O. prefers to treat TB with a carefully monitored combination of standard first-line drugs. But that method is at best ineffective in treating drug-resistant TB. At worst, it risks increasing levels of drug resistance.
Yet freer use of the longer-term drugs has perils, too.
"We are terribly afraid of liberal use of second-line drugs," Dr. Farmer said.
Some experts fear that without close monitoring, such an approach would breed a form of disease resistant even to those drugs and essentially untreatable.
 
Sex, Drugs and Disease
Further, an epidemic in one disease could easily ignite epidemics in others. Infection with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, is rising faster in Russia than almost anywhere else, according to estimates from the Joint United Nations Program on H.I.V./AIDS. And syphilis and hepatitis B cases skyrocketed during the 1990's.
This is an explosive combination: syphilis enhances the sexual transmission of H.I.V., and tuberculosis can worsen the immune deficiency caused by H.I.V. An H.I.V. infection, in turn, can cause syphilis and tuberculosis to take unusual forms, making them both harder to diagnose and harder to treat.
The resulting cyclone of mutually enhancing infections can tax medical ingenuity and budgets everywhere. In New York City in the early 90's, for instance, an outbreak of tuberculosis among H.I.V.-infected people and their contacts -- involving about 1,000 cases of drug-resistant disease -- cost more than $1 billion to squelch, by some estimates.
In Russia, H.I.V. is largely confined to intravenous drug users. An estimated three million Russians use such drugs, with H.I.V. infection rates among them in some areas as high as 30 percent. Public health authorities know that H.I.V. will soon begin to spread among this population's sexual partners.
Pavel Ryabov, 21, works in a Moscow candy factory and has used intravenous drugs for the last two years.
He has hepatitis B and C, which are usually contracted through sharing needles with infected people, and he was admitted to a Moscow hospital over the summer with meningitis.
From his hospital bed, Mr. Ryabov expressed fear of AIDS, but said he nonetheless routinely shared needles with drug-using friends and did not use condoms with his two girlfriends.
"Yes, so maybe I'll stop using drugs," he said. "I've already begun to drink instead."
Risk of disease increases drastically, of course, where drugs and sex intersect. Recent studies have shown, for example, that in some groups of drug-using prostitutes here, H.I.V. infection rates have exceeded 50 percent. And prostitution, in turn, has been driven up by deepening levels of poverty.
Dr. Olga Loseva, chief of the venereal diseases department at the Central Research Institute for Skin and Venereal Diseases in Moscow, called sex "a new form of currency here."
"We really have had a sexual revolution here," she said. "People have earlier sexual relationships, more partners, more one-night stands, more children born out of wedlock."
In Soviet times, a system of screening and treatment, in combination with fines, unemployment and even imprisonment for some patients, kept syphilis and other venereal diseases in check.
While the punishments have been eliminated, the stigma of syphilis lingers. In Moscow and other cities where rates are particularly high, there are underground clinics that, for a price, guarantee anonymity. But they frequently fail to treat patients effectively and do not reliably keep track of the number of infections they see.
Thus, although figures over the last three years show a 30 percent drop in syphilis cases, public health authorities are skeptical.
"We're hopeful these figures really reflect a decrease in disease," said Dr. Caroline Ryan, associate director for international activities in the division of sexually transmitted disease prevention in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. But the decrease may merely reflect underdiagnosis or underreporting of cases, she said.
The worry is that the stigma factor may drive the young H.I.V. epidemic partly underground too, making it even more difficult to control.
 
Looming Infection
Here in Voronezh, as in most of Russia, these brewing infections seem invisible. Doctors say they have seen only a single case of AIDS, in an Ethiopian woman who got sick while visiting five years ago. Syphilis rates are low and stable, according to the city health commissioner, Dr. Michael V. Ivanov, and no cases of H.I.V. infection have surfaced.
But at the edge of the city, within the complex of infectious disease hospitals where pear and apricot trees separate the tuberculosis hospital from the region's largest infectious disease hospital for children, the doctors can hear the hoofbeats of trouble ahead.
The city's pediatricians are now seeing about 50 cases of congenital syphilis a year, a disease they only used to read about, said the hospital's pediatric epidemiologist, Dr. Emilia Bashenova.
And a steep increase in hepatitis B, which is far more contagious than H.I.V., has been ascribed to increasing intravenous drug use and sexual transmission of the infection.
Diphtheria cases soared nationwide in the early 90's, the combined result of declining childhood vaccination rates and the vulnerability of adults who had received shoddy Soviet vaccines as children. Since a new vaccination campaign backed by international aid, diphtheria is now rare again.
But the low numbers don't tell an accurate story, Dr. Bashenova said. "Even though numerically they are not up," she explained, "the cases of infections are more serious, and we see more complications from each. Immunity is down among our children here. It comes from poverty, from too little food, not enough vitamins, from more difficult access to health care -- the children are sick more often, and more seriously sick."
This city lies halfway between Moscow and Chechnya, and already Chechen refugees have turned up with TB. Doctors have been alerted that cholera, polio and the plague from that region may soon start showing up as well.
Dr. Bashenova shook her head doubtfully. "We're prepared," she said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Two forecasters say the growth in industry revenue will slow moderately in the year to come.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
ADVERTISING spending in America in 2001 will not grow as fast as had been anticipated as recently as this summer, two leading industry forecasters predicted yesterday.
But both characterized the slowdown as a soft landing after a year of record results bolstered by special factors like the Summer Olympics and the elections rather than a harbinger of a more serious downturn. 
 The predictions by the forecasters opened the annual UBS Warburg Media Conference in Midtown Manhattan. They were deemed significant because while the ebb and flow of ad spending is typically watched carefully, it is being scrutinized even more closely now because of a consensus that the economy is slowing as consumers reduce spending.
For example, the Conference Board said yesterday that its composite index of leading economic indicators, a key gauge of future economic activity, fell 0.2 percent in October. And ad spending in outlets like national broadcast television networks and local TV stations has slowed appreciably in the fourth quarter.
"We don't think things are falling apart because of a little softness," said Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at Universal McCann in New York. "The outlook is generally quite good."
The presentation by John Perriss, chairman and chief executive at Zenith Media in London, came after -- and echoed -- Mr. Coen's.
"There are really no signs in the activities of our clients around the world that we're on the verge of a decade-leading recession as in 1980 and 1990," Mr. Perriss said. "Marketing is more of a 'must have,' not easily cut any longer."
Analysts who attended the presentations said they agreed with Mr. Coen and Mr. Perriss to varying degrees.
"The outlook is for moderation, not oblivion," said Leland A. Westerfield, a director in the communications group at UBS Warburg Equity Research in New York. Mr. Westerfield endorsed Mr. Perriss's assertion that spending should not decline too steeply because "the need to maintain and build your brand name is becoming more of a fixed cost" than a variable that rises and falls with every economic cycle.
"People are reacting to short-term declines in corporate profits with some sense of fear," Mr. Westerfield said. "But Bob Coen indicated that ad spending would outpace G.D.P., which is remarkable in a post-election, post-Olympics year." His reference was to Mr. Coen's revised estimate that American ad spending in 2001 would increase 5.8 percent compared with an increase in total gross domestic product, including consumer price increases, of 5.7 percent.
"There's a tentative comfort from the numbers" offered by the forecasters, said Michael J. Russell Jr., who follows advertising for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York. That contrasts, he said, with "the news events around the conference," like the recent declines in media stocks.
"A lot of it boils down to the economists' viewpoints" about gross domestic product growth, he added. "Our economists here are less optimistic than Bob Coen, so I'd say there's more risk on the downside than the upside."
In his presentation, Mr. Coen trimmed his prediction of ad spending growth in 2001 to 5.8 percent from 6.5 percent, a prediction he made in June. American ad spending in 2001 will total $250 billion, he said, compared with a revised figure of $236.3 billion spent in 2000.
Among the reasons Mr. Coen gave for cutting his prediction for next year were a continued lag in ad spending in local media like newspapers, an inability by the big broadcast TV networks to raise prices in 2001 as much as they did in 2000 and a likelihood that huge increases in spending this year by advertisers in categories like computers and telecommunications could not be sustained.
One TV executive, however, took issue with Mr. Coen's estimate that the money spent to buy commercials on the four big broadcast networks would increase only 1 percent in 2001 from 2000.
At a presentation after the one made by Mr. Coen and Mr. Perriss, David F. Poltrack, executive vice president for planning and research at the CBS Television Network unit of Viacom in New York, estimated a gain of 7 percent. That was possible, Mr. Poltrack said, as long as there were no substantial difficulties from a potential strike by writers that could affect the schedules for the 2001-2002 season.
If Mr. Coen's new forecast for 2001 pans out, ad spending would amount to 2.37 percent of gross domestic product, the same as the record level achieved in 2000. The most recent low, 2.1 percent, was set in the recessionary years of 1992 and 1993.
Mr. Perriss said he reduced his 2001 forecast to an increase of 4.6 percent from one he made in July of an increase of 6.1 percent because, in retrospect, the gains made in 2000 "represent the peak of this particular trade cycle" as a result of a subsequent "decline in corporate profits."
"Through 2003, we're in for a gradual soft landing," he added. "Things could make that landing harder rather than softer, but the chances of that happening are not materially greater than a year ago."
Mr. Coen's figure of $236.3 billion for 2000 was an increase of 9.8 percent from the $215.3 billion spent in 1999 and represented the third time since June 1999 that Mr. Coen increased his estimate of spending for 2000. The 9.8 percent gain was the largest since 1984 -- also a year of Olympics and elections -- when American ad spending increased 15.8 percent.
Overseas in 2000, Mr. Coen said, ad spending totaled $229.2 billion, up 7.2 percent from $213.8 billion in 1999. That was unchanged from his forecast in June; he cited continued strong results in countries like France, Germany, Italy, Mexico and South Korea.
Mr. Coen's worldwide total for 2000, then, is $465.5 billion, up 8.5 percent from $429.1 billion in 1999. Though that rose only slightly from the $464.8 billion he forecast in June, it was the largest one-year percentage gain since an 11.5 percent increase in worldwide ad spending in 1995.
Turning to 2001 ad spending abroad, Mr. Coen predicted yesterday a total of $244.1 billion, up 6.5 percent from the revised 2000 total. That represented a slight decrease from the $247 billion forecast he initially made in June, up 7.8 percent.
So Mr. Coen's total worldwide estimate for 2001 is $494.1 billion, an increase of 6.1 percent from his projected total for 2000. That compares with his estimated total six months ago of $498 billion, up 7.1 percent from 2000.
Though Mr. Perriss uses different methods from Mr. Coen's, keeping track of only so-called major media like television, print and the Internet, his estimates were similar to Mr. Coen's.
Mr. Perriss said ad spending in North America this year would total $145.7 billion, up 8 percent in current prices from $134.9 billion in 1999. For 2001, he predicted $152.5 billion, up 4.7 percent from 2000.
His worldwide ad spending totals were $331.7 billion in 2000, up 7.9 percent in current prices from $307.6 billion in 1999, and $351.7 billion in 2001, up 6 percent from 2000.
Mr. Perriss also offered forecasts beyond 2001. In North America, he predicted total ad spending of $160.4 billion in 2002, up 5.2 percent from 2001, and $168.6 billion in 2003, up 5.1 percent from 2002. And worldwide, Mr. Perriss predicted a total of $372.5 billion in 2002, up 5.9 percent from 2001, and $393.5 billion, up 5.6 percent from 2002.
Mr. Coen and Mr. Perriss make their predictions twice a year and revise them based on updated data. Universal McCann, where Mr. Coen works, is the media services division of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Zenith, which Mr. Perriss heads, is jointly owned by the Cordiant Communications Group and the Publicis Groupe.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Declined 2.6% in October

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Sales of new homes fell 2.6 percent in October but were still on pace for the second-best year on record, the Commerce Department reported today. A separate report showed a decline in the index of leading economic indicators.
New-home sales declined to an annual pace of 928,000 from 953,000 in September, the department said. At that rate, builders will sell 898,000 new homes this year, compared with 907,000 sold in 1999. 
 Low unemployment and falling mortgage rates are giving buyers the confidence to purchase homes, even at record prices. So far, "we've had a stable interest-rate environment and a high consumer confidence level, and that's helped the housing market," said Joel Rassman of Toll Brothers, a luxury home builder in Huntingdon Valley, Pa.
The average rate on a conventional 30-year mortgage has held below 8 percent since the middle of August. In May, the 30-year rate was at a five-year high of 8.64 percent.
The nationwide median price of a new home rose 2.9 percent in October, to a record $174,900 from $169,900 in September. But 30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 7.80 percent from 7.90 percent in September, making the monthly payment on a median-price house bought in October only about $25 more a month.
The strength in the housing market can reasonably be expected to dwindle if the overall economy weakens. The Conference Board reported today that its index of leading economic indicators, a summary forecast of the economy's performance in the next three to six months, fell 0.2 percent in October after showing no change the month before. It was the seventh consecutive month that the index had not risen.
The index of coincident indicators, a gauge of current economic activity and industrial output, fell 0.1 percent in October after rising 0.3 percent in September. The decline was the first since September 1999, reflecting decreases in personal income and industrial production.
Six of the component measures of the index of leading economic indicators were negative and four were positive in October.
Higher jobless claims, lower orders for capital goods and for consumer goods, lower stock prices, diminished consumer expectations, and the smaller yield on the 10-year Treasury note relative to the overnight bank lending rate pulled the index down. An increase in the workweek, slower vendor deliveries -- suggesting strong demand -- and an increased money supply were positive contributors along with the increase in building permits.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Surges 186.56 Points As Nasdaq Stumbles Again

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks sprinted to one of their best gains in five weeks yesterday, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index failed in its attempt to recover from an early decline and finished with its 10th loss in the last 12 sessions.
Much of the stock market received a lift around midday after the United States Supreme Court set aside, at least for the moment, the Florida Supreme Court ruling that had extended the state's deadline for counting votes in the presidential election. The move, while not a clear victory for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, raised Wall Street's expectations that the deadlocked election might soon be settled with Mr. Bush the ultimate winner. 
 After the stock market closed, stock-index futures surged in reaction to a Florida judge's ruling against Vice President Al Gore's request for a recount of ballots in Palm Beach and Miami-Dade Counties, further improving Mr. Bush's prospects.
The Dow Jones industrial average, which rose more than 230 points during the afternoon, hung on to its gains to close up 186.56 points, or 1.80 percent, at 10,560.10. But the Nasdaq, which nosed briefly into positive territory, sagged again in late trading to finish down 29.54 points, or 1.12 percent, at 2,615.75.
"Good, solid old-economy names such as 3M are doing quite well," said Jeffrey Warantz, an equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. "There's a wariness of tech, and while people are realizing that while there are problems of a slowing economy, you don't want to stuff money under the mattress."
The market's mood was improved by what seemed an increased likelihood that the Federal Reserve would decide at its next policy-making meeting on Dec. 19 to ease its anti-inflation stance, clearing the way for a possible cut in short-term interest rates to head off recession in the new year.
"We anticipate the Fed will remove their tightening bias on the 19th," said Charles Reinhard, senior equity strategist at Lehman Brothers.
Two economic reports yesterday added to the evidence that the economy was slowing, possibly easing inflationary pressures. Sales of new homes fell 2.6 percent in October, although that was a smaller decline than economists expected. And the index of leading indicators declined 0.2 percent in October, the seventh consecutive month that it has not risen.
The biggest contributor to the Dow industrials' gain was Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, which climbed $5.38, to $105. Investors are anticipating that 3M will name a top executive of General Electric as its chief executive.
Other gainers among the Dow industrials included DuPont, I.B.M., Caterpillar, Wal-Mart Stores, United Technologies and Alcoa, which all rose two points or more. But American Express, down $2.09 at $52.16, and Intel, which is part of both the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average, down $1.19 at $32.94, were the Dow's biggest drags.
The Nasdaq was pulled down in part by Cisco Systems, which slid $2.69, to $45.81, even though the company said it stood by its revenue growth targets. Cisco and Intel were the most actively traded stocks of the day.
Quaker Oats, which agreed to be acquired by PepsiCo in a $13.4 billion all-stock deal, gained $2.06, to 91.06; PepsiCo rose $1.44, to $43.81.
Xerox, a once pre-eminent glamor stock fallen on hard times, skidded $1.25, to $5, a 52-week low, after trading as low as $4.75.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index moved up a modest 9.74 points, or 0.74 percent, to close at 1,324.97.
Chemical, paper and retailing stocks were among the strongest groups traded yesterday, while hotels were among the weakest. A Goldman, Sachs analyst said retailers should no longer be avoided.
Qualcomm, which announced a Chinese agreement to develop a mobile phone network, jumped $7, to $90.

HEADLINE: S.& P. Eliminates 4 Old-Line Stocks From Its 500 Index

 BODY:
Four venerable old-economy industrial warhorses, Bethlehem Steel, W. R. Grace, Crown Cork and Seal and Owens-Illinois, were designated for deletion from the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks yesterday. They are to be replaced by two prominent technology companies, Intuit and Symbol Technologies, plus a utility company, Allegheny Energy, and a financial services company, the Ambac Financial Group.
Changes in the S.& P. 500, the most widely used benchmark for index mutual funds, usually cause the deleted stocks to fall and the added stocks to rise, as fund managers adjust their portfolios to mimic the index. 
 Intuit, one of the two technology companies joining the index, is most famous for two widely used software products, Quicken, a personal finance program, and TurboTax, for tax preparation. Symbol Technologies rose to prominence making hand-held laser bar code scanners for checkout counters and warehouse inventory systems.
The deleted companies all have extensive pedigrees. W. R. Grace, once a conglomerate stretching from publishing to insurance, is now mainly a maker of specialty chemicals, construction materials and packaging; it began life as a guano trading company in 1854. Crown Cork and Owens-Illinois are also packaging companies; Crown dates from 1892 and Owens from 1907. Bethlehem Steel was founded in 1857 and was once among the largest and most profitable companies in the country. The stocks of all four now trade for less than $5 a share after long periods of decline.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Presidential Race Rulings Push Bonds Down

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Bond prices fell yesterday after rulings by two courts seen as favorable to Gov. George W. Bush in the unresolved presidential election overshadowed hopes a slowing economy will lead to interest rate cuts.
A victory by Mr. Bush is seen as a mild negative for bonds because his proposal for tax cuts could eat into government coffers, which would otherwise be used to continue to pay down the national debt. 
 "This is positive for Bush, negative for the bond market, positive for the stock market," said John Roberts, head of government bond trading at Barclays Capital.
The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 4/32, to 101 23/32, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.52 percent from 5.51 percent. The 30-year bond dropped 14/32, to 108 12/32; its yield rose to 5.66 percent from 5.64 percent. Treasuries slipped after the United States Supreme Court set aside a ruling by the Florida Supreme Court that extended the deadline for hand-counted votes in some counties. They fell again after a Florida judge rejected Vice President Al Gore's legal challenge to the certified result of the presidential election in Florida and his bid for a recount of thousands of disputed ballots.
Shorter-dated Treasuries, most sensitive to Federal Reserve rate sentiment and favored by investors looking for a safe harbor amid stock uncertainty, slipped into negative territory in late trading despite another decline in technology shares.
Treasury prices have surged in recent weeks, pushing their yields to lows not seen in a year or more as investors bet that the Fed would cut borrowing costs sooner rather than later. "People are jumping on the bandwagon that the Fed is going to ease in early 2001 -- or at least don't want to be left at the station," said John Santoro, head of governments trading at SG Cowen Securities.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

HEADLINE: Turkey Grapples With a Severe Financial Crisis

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Dec. 4

 BODY:
Confronting a plunging stock market, stratospheric overnight interest rates and protests in the street by teachers and hospital workers, the Turkish government struggled today to find a way to deal with a burgeoning financial crisis with political overtones.
Treasury officials met in Ankara with a team from the International Monetary Fund to discuss conditions for an emergency loan to alleviate the immediate crisis, but long-term structural solutions like banking reform and increased privatization looked tougher to work out. 
 The signs of economic trouble have intensified in recent days as concerns deepened that the government has not done enough to fight inflation, revamp its troubled banks and sell state enterprises.
"This started as a short-term liquidity crisis," said Burak Akbulut, an analyst with Bayindir Securities, "and it has turned into a crisis of confidence in the government's ability to reform the economic structure of the country."
The financial crisis is straining Turkey's coalition government as officials deal with a potential problem in relations with the European Union that could further shake confidence in the country's economy.
When European Union leaders meet in Nice later this week, they are expected to debate demands by Greece that Turkey resolve disputes over the divided Mediterranean island of Cyprus and some Aegean islets as part of its bid for membership in the organization. There was word late today of a possible compromise among European foreign ministers in Brussels, but there was no certainty that Turkey's fractious leadership would accept anything short of removing the questions of Cyprus and the Aegean from the membership criteria.
On the economic front, the Turkish government and the I.M.F. sought to calm the turmoil. The Turkish treasury said there was no need to change the basic economic plan. I.M.F. officials in Washington said over the weekend that the agency would recommend quick approval of a loan, but cautioned that Turkey would have to take hard steps to strengthen its economy and its banking system.
The reassurances and the start of special talks with the I.M.F. did not stop the Istanbul Stock Exchange's main index from dropping 8.12 percent today, to 7,329.61. Shares have lost 43 percent of their value over the last two weeks and, year to date, more than 60 percent in dollar terms. There was little sign today of a halt in the market's plunge.
The depth and duration of the financial crisis remain unclear. There were no signs of panic among the people, who are accustomed to economic and political turbulence. But even savvy investors seemed to be pinning their hopes on the I.M.F.'s coming through with an emergency loan quickly, an uncertain prospect.
News reports and rumors in financial circles here predicted that the I.M.F. was on the verge of pumping $2 billion to $4 billion into the economy. But a spokeswoman for the I.M.F. in Washington, Constance Lotze, said in a telephone interview that no decision was expected until after the meetings with Turkish officials end in 10 days. She also said it was uncertain that the I.M.F. board would approve more money before its meeting on Dec. 21.
The new round of troubles started with anxiety about the solvency of Turkey's midsize banks. The government is investigating some of the 10 banks already in receivership on suspicion of corruption, and more banks may be taken over. Healthy banks cut credit lines to the suspect institutions last week, starving the economy for cash and pushing up overnight interest rates into four digits.
The overnight interest rates -- what banks charge their best customers, usually companies and other banks, for short-term borrowing -- while staggeringly high, do not pose a financial risk on the basis of one night. But dangers increase if the rates remain high for an extended period.
Last week, Turkey's central bank added about $6 billion to the financial system to meet the demand for cash and to bring down rates, violating an agreement it had with the I.M.F. to let the Turkish lira float against a basket of dollars and euros.
When the central bank halted the cash infusions today, the overnight rate shot up again, touching 1,950 percent before settling at an average of more than 1,000 percent.
The cash squeeze is just one of the challenges impeding the government's 11-month effort to bring inflation under control and get Turkey's economy in line with those of advanced industrial nations. The effort was part of an economic overhaul required by the I.M.F. in exchange for a $3.7 billion loan package.
Turkey's currency has hardly been stable. The lira rose slightly today, settling in New York trading at a rate of 681,675 to the dollar. In the last six months, its value has declined roughly 10 percent.
The government managed last month to reduce consumer inflation to 44 percent for the year thus far, the first time it has been below 50 percent in 15 years. But the program has taken a toll on some business sectors and encouraged political volatility in this country of 65 million people.
Reduced government spending formed a key element of the anti-inflation program, but it meant that the government borrowed less from banks, whose profits then declined. Weaker banks were driven deeper into trouble.
The reduced spending also angered civil servants, whose pay raises have been kept well below the inflation rate. The 2001 budget proposes only a 10 percent raise for civil servants, most of whom are already paid barely enough to stay above the poverty line.
Government workers staged a one-day strike on Friday to underscore their demand for more money and a voice in the economy. Labor leaders said that 500,000 people joined protests around the country and 500,000 civil servants stayed home from work. "We are insisting on a dialogue," Resul Akay, president of the civil servants' confederation, said today, "but if they point us out to the streets, then we'll go to the streets."
Others have resorted to desperate measures. As the market dropped to a new low last Wednesday, a distraught investor walked into a branch of the Turkish Industrial Development Bank and shot the securities manager after an argument. The manager, who was hospitalized, is expected to recover.
Analysts said that the origins of the current crisis are short term and that it might pass, but they said long-term difficulties remained, particularly in the slow pace at which the government has been selling state-owned businesses.
"The government needs to fulfill the economic and political reforms and the privatization it has promised," Oner Ayan, a fund manager with Raymond James in New York, said in an e-mail interview.
The I.M.F. has urged officials to move faster with privatization, particularly big operations like the phone monopoly, Turk Telekomunikasyon, and Turkish Airlines. But politics and national pride have kept the pace slow.
The government had offered 20 percent of the telecommunications company and refused to relinquish control. Faced with the new economic difficulties, officials in Ankara swallowed their pride on Thursday and agreed to sell 35.5 percent and control to a strategic investor.
But it may prove too late. The bidding is scheduled for Dec. 15, but the potential bidders from the telecommunications industry are no longer flush with cash and the offers may prove disappointingly low at a time when Turkey desperately needs the money.

HEADLINE: Rightist Squads in Colombia Beating the Rebels

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Dec. 4

 BODY:
They began as a gang of thugs backed by the once-powerful Columbian drug cartels. But when the guerrilla war intensified, they evolved into quasi-independent right-wing paramilitary squads that killed peasants suspected of supporting Colombia's leftist rebels.
Now the paramilitary forces have demonstrated with alarming clarity that they have become something else again: an army of combat-ready fighters that is directly engaging guerrillas and winning wide swaths of territory. 
 The United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, as the paramilitary groups are known formally, or A.U.C. by the Spanish initials, are also gaining an important degree of popular support from Colombia's middle class, say experts on the conflict and government officials here and in the United States.
As the government tries to restart frozen peace talks this week, the right-wing militias may well have a role in the process.
With 11,000 fighters, nearly double what they boasted a few years ago, and the backing of landowners, businessmen and coca growers, the paramilitary forces have beaten guerrillas on their own turf.
Through intimidation, massacres and, increasingly, direct confrontations, the militias have tightened their hold on the northern provinces of Antioquia, Bolivar and Cordoba and expanded into other regions, especially the coca-growing strongholds in the south.
They have also thrust themselves into the roiling world of Colombian politics, upsetting peace negotiations between President Andres Pastrana's administration and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the nation's largest rebel group.
Through savvy public relations efforts by its straight-talking leader, Carlos Castano, and intimidation aimed at Colombia's establishment -- notably the kidnapping of seven congressmen in October in a successful attempt to broker a meeting with a top government official -- the paramilitary fighters have shown a determination to be heard.
Military success is widely believed to be strengthening Mr. Castano's hand in his quest for political recognition. Achieving military victory would make it more difficult for the government to prosecute him and other paramilitary leaders for war crimes if the conflict comes to an end. For the first six months of this year, the government's ombudsman has reported that 512 unarmed civilians were killed by paramilitary gunmen, compared with 120 killed by guerrillas.
Despite criticism from human rights groups, the public relations drive appears to be working. A large group of congressmen and several influential Colombians are publicly suggesting that the paramilitary units should have a role in the peace talks, a possibility that others say could produce years of conflict because of rebel opposition.
The debate comes as Colombia prepares to spend $1.1 billion in mostly military aid from the United States and other Western allies to curtail coca production in prime coca-growing regions like Putumayo Province in the south, an area where guerrillas and the paramilitary units have been battling for control.
"They are an unquestioned reality," said Senator Miguel Pinedo, who was among those kidnapped in October. "There's going to have to be a moment when they will have to be a part of the negotiating table, either independently or together with the rebels, but they have to be a part of it."
Phillip Chicola, director of Andean affairs for the United States State Department, agreed recently in a radio interview here. The paramilitary forces "are at some moment going to have to be part of a process," he said, "and I think the government and Colombian society are going to have to decide how to manage this issue."
Their growth can be attributed in part to the failure by the Pastrana administration to advance the peace effort in the last two years. The government is trying to resume talks before Thursday, when Mr. Pastrana must decide whether to reclaim by force the Switzerland-sized swath of territory ceded to the FARC guerrillas two years ago to lure them to the peace table. The talks have sputtered, but the guerrillas control the land.
Max Alberto Morales, who has served as an intermediary between the government and Mr. Castano, the paramilitary leader, said that Mr. Castano had been prepared to allow the peace talks with the FARC to proceed but that Mr. Castano had become concerned when the talks stalled, the FARC took control of a major chunk of territory and guerrilla violence continued.
"We had hope for a year that the peace process would get rolling, but what happened in that year is kidnappings became more common, roadblocks increased, they began to hijack airplanes and people were taken from churches," Mr. Morales said. "I think that all this touched the hearts of Colombians, and they said, 'We won't take this anymore.' For that reason the people in this country love Castano so much."
Beloved or not, Mr. Castano has been quick to take advantage of the shifting moods in Colombian society.
In two highly emotional televised interviews last spring, he cast himself as a protector not of the large landowning class that has helped finance the paramilitary forces, but rather of middle-class workers fearful of kidnappings. "The ones who have no one to defend them are the middle classes," Mr. Castano said. "The Self-Defense Forces are looking out for the interests of the middle class."
After the interviews, a poll in El Tiempo, Colombia's most respected newspaper, showed that 38 percent of those questioned said their image of Mr. Castano had improved. Seventy-two percent said the paramilitary forces should take part in the peace talks.
"Castano is the only Colombian who has the nerve to attack the guerrillas, and that makes him the good guy," said Luis Jaime Cordoba, a Bogota teacher.
Mario Fernando Hurtado, a geographer, said he had come to agree with Mr. Castano's logic after watching him on television. "He knows the reality of the problems of the country, and though he justifies his actions with force, he's convincing in his arguments," he said. "I'm not in accordance with many of his methods, but in this country they're necessary, because having a peace dialogue with the guerrillas when they're not interested doesn't make sense."
Colombia is a poor country, but its cities have large middle-class communities that feel little kinship or connection to the peasant farmers in the countryside who are most often the victims of the paramilitary units' violence. With Colombia's unsteady political situation and a harsh economic downturn worsening, the vacuum was open for Mr. Castano to step in.
"Against this backdrop of deepening chaos and the absolute lack of the rule of law, then a charismatic and articulate individual has risen to the level of leadership," said Bruce Bagley, an expert on the conflict at the University of Miami who is worried about a deepening conflict if the paramilitary forces gain political support.
"Carlos Castano, the fixture, the man, has found the right time for his leadership to emerge as powerful and important in Colombia," he said. "He has resonance among important sectors in Colombian society."
Mr. Castano has also expanded his forces' reach into sparsely populated regions where they had only occasionally operated in the past, notably Putumayo Province along the Ecuadorian border.
"It's remarkable, from a military perspective, that he's been able to push into new areas without any concern about his rear flanks," said Robin Kirk, who has interviewed Mr. Castano for her work as the Colombia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
"He's able to project a force way beyond his base of strength, which is northern Colombia, and he has the E.L.N. on the ropes, and that is very new," she said, referring to the National Liberation Army, the second-largest leftist guerrilla group, by its Spanish initials.
In Putumayo, the paramilitary fighters have so unnerved the FARC in a series of brutal entanglements since September that the rebels responded by closing off the province's roads.
The FARC's tactics have created an embarrassing crisis for the Pastrana administration, because it is in Putumayo that much of Plan Colombia, a multibillion-dollar effort backed by the United States to root out drug trafficking, is focused.
Mr. Castano's efforts to push deep into Putumayo are aimed at controlling the region's lucrative coca production. It remains unclear if the paramilitary forces have been able to gain the upper hand in the conflict there, but a top State Department official said intelligence reports showed that "at a minimum they've held their own against men who've had a full run of the place."
Human Rights Watch and other human rights groups insist that the paramilitary forces should not be allowed into peace talks until the government fully investigates their connections to the military, which the rights groups accuse of having provided munitions and tactical support to the paramilitary units. A Human Rights Watch report in February showed that half of Colombia's 18 brigade-level army units had links to paramilitary units.
"They have to disappear as an armed force and submit themselves to justice," said Senator Jaime Dussan, an outspoken opponent of including the paramilitary units in the talks. "How can we give amnesty to those who have killed, those who have massacred?"
Still, even among those who have aggressively pushed for the government to rein in the paramilitary fighters, there is a sense that it may be too late, that the right-wing forces have grown so large and independent that they cannot easily be disbanded.
"Today, the paramilitaries have grown too much," said German Martinez, the legal officer in Puerto Asis who has investigated paramilitary killings in Putumayo. "It is a monster created by the state, but now it's at the point where it's free of the state. It's a lion that the state controlled, but it has freed itself, broken away."

Forecasts Show Slowdown In Spending on Advertising
Advertising spending in America in 2001 will not grow as fast as had been anticipated as recently as this summer, two leading industry forecasters predicted.
But both characterized the slowdown as a soft landing after record results bolstered by the Olympics and the elections rather than a harbinger of a more serious downturn. While the ebb and flow of ad spending is watched carefully, the forecasts were being scrutinized even more closely because of a consensus that the economy is slowing as consumers spend less.

HEADLINE: 3M to Select G.E. Executive As Next Chief

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
For the first time in its history, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing has reached outside its ranks for a chief, hiring W. James McNerney Jr. from General Electric to be its chairman and chief executive.
The appointment, which 3M is expected to announce today, held little shock value on Wall Street. Livio D. DeSimone, 3M's chairman since 1991, will be 65 in July, and 3M's board has been prospecting for a replacement for several months. Although six 3M insiders were said to be on a short list of candidates, analysts had speculated that the company would go outside. 
 That speculation hit fever pitch last week, when G.E. ended its own much publicized succession race. The company named Jeffrey R. Immelt to succeed John F. Welch Jr. when Mr. Welch retires next year. Mr. Welch, in making that announcement, said that he expected the also-rans in that contest to be quickly spirited away to head other companies. Mr. McNerney, 51, head of GE Aircraft Engines, was one of them; the other, Robert L. Nardelli, 52, head of GE Power Systems, is expected to announce a new job this week.
Analysts say 3M could use an infusion of G.E. dynamism. "3M has good margins and a good product line that is getting better, but they need an injection of intensity," said Jack L. Kelly, who follows 3M for Goldman, Sachs. "G.E. has an 'in your face, perform or you're out' culture, and anyone who flourished in that culture will know how to raise the bar for performance at 3M."
Actually, 3M has reinvigorated itself of late. Until the middle of last year, the company was floundering badly. It had missed earnings estimates in three of six quarters, it was suffering from the economic downturn in Asia, and many of its products were selling in highly cyclical industries like construction.
Since mid-1999, though, the company, based in St. Paul, has cut costs and shifted its focus to high-growth markets. Products like fiber optics, abrasives used in the manufacturing of semiconductors and drugs that bolster immune systems already make up about 23 percent of its sales, and 3M has promised to raise that percentage to 35 percent by 2003. In September, Mr. DeSimone told analysts that 3M's earnings would grow at least 12 percent annually through 2003.
The company's stock has held its own through the market's gyrations. Although 3M has tried mightily to position itself as a high-technology stock, it has generally traded in line with makers of specialty chemicals.
That old-economy identification is helping it now. Since 3M's shares never rode the technology wave up, they did not ride it down. Moreover, G.E.'s $45 billion acquisition of Honeywell in October gave a boost to many old-economy stocks, as analysts predicted further consolidations of old-line manufacturers.
Shares of 3M, which entered 1999 trading around $70, closed up $5.38 yesterday, to $105.
Still, 3M has its critics. For example, it is only a small player in pharmaceuticals, and analysts say that it must either bolster that business with acquisitions, or shed it and concentrate on fiber optics.
Analysts say the need to make such moves might have spurred 3M's board to go outside for a new chief. The six inside contenders have each had three or more decades with the company, and analysts said they might well have been unwilling to rock a boat they had sailed in so long.
"The company needs to get out of a status quo rut and look at new strategic opportunities, and that means they need someone who is not wedded to the 3M world," said Peter J. Enderlin, who follows 3M for Ryan, Beck Southeast Research.
In his 18 years with G.E., Mr. McNerney certainly demonstrated ability to deal with change. He has run GE Aircraft Engines, GE Lighting and GE Asia-Pacific, which handled most of G.E.'s activities in Asia. He also did stints at GE Capital and GE Information Services.
"He's got the broadest repertory of any executive I can think of, and he'll be terrific for 3M," said Dayton Ogden, co-chairman of the executive search firm Spencer Stuart.
The company seems a good fit for him, too. Like G.E., 3M is a diversified manufacturer, with more than 50,000 products selling to a host of unrelated industries. Also like G.E., 3M executives are impatient with bureaucracy. Indeed, 3M will often split a business in two when it seems to be growing too big to react quickly to the market.
"3M has been gaining momentum in fast- growing markets," said Richard Friedman, an analyst with Standard & Poor's. "McNerney's challenge will be to keep that momentum going."

HEADLINE: Baseball's Unfair Economics

 BODY:
The signing of Mike Mussina, a star pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles, by the Yankees to a six-year, $88.5 million contract greatly increases George Steinbrenner's prospects for another World Series victory next year. That is great news for Yankee fans. But it reinforces a trend that plagues baseball.
Teams in big cities generate lots of revenue, pay big salaries and attract the best players. Teams in small cities generate little revenue, pay low salaries and watch their players exit for New York and Atlanta. The Yankees spend about six times what Minneapolis spends on players. One pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers made about as much money last season as the entire Minneapolis team. 
 The disparity matters. Between 1995 and 2000, 189 playoff and World Series games were played. Only three of those games were won by teams ranked in the bottom half of the league by payroll. Competitive balance has become a joke. Yet without balance, baseball cannot thrive. The satisfaction of watching the Yankees play ball has everything to do with the quality of teams they face.
Two proposals have been issued to tackle the competitiveness problem. One came from the four independent citizens -- Richard Levin, president of Yale; George Mitchell, former senator from Maine; Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve; and George Will, the syndicated columnist -- serving on a panel appointed by the commissioner of baseball. The other came from Paul Weiler, a law professor at Harvard. They differ in details, but agree in broad intent.
Both proposals include mechanisms to keep rich teams from spending too much. They also recognize the equally important need to keep weak teams from spending too little. The owner of the Florida Marlins may have made money by shedding his high-paid players after winning the 1997 World Series. But this decision was every bit as damaging to competitive balance as Mr. Steinbrenner's decisions to add to his already bloated payrolls. Both proposals would also redistribute locally generated revenue from rich teams to poor ones -- including revenue from gate receipts, local television and radio broadcasts and stadium advertising.
Some of these ideas are not new. For several years baseball imposed what amounted to a luxury tax on teams with the highest payrolls. But the tax was suspended in 2000, and besides it added only a couple of million dollars to payroll costs that already exceeded $90 million. By contrast, the independent panel would impose a 50 percent tax on payrolls that exceed $84 million. In addition, baseball has long had a system for distributing locally generated revenues. At present, it transfers about $160 million from high- to low-earning teams. The panel proposes to raise that by about 50 percent.
The proposed payroll guidelines and increased revenue sharing will trigger some opposition from owners and players. But neither proposal mirrors the one-sided assault on players' salaries backed by owners in the past, in that neither would do away with free agency or otherwise limit the ability of individual players to sell their talents to the highest bidder. But both seek to dampen the ability of the George Steinbrenners of this world to bid as freely as they presently do. And both focus on raising the payrolls of weak teams. The net result would be a better balanced, more profitable league. If the idea works, the league will attract more fans, and everyone -- players, fans and, yes, Mr. Steinbrenner -- will win.

HEADLINE: CONTESTING THE VOTE;
Excerpt From Bush's Remarks on the U.S. Supreme Court's Decision

 BODY:
Following is an excerpt from a news conference yesterday by Gov. George W. Bush at his ranch near Waco, Tex., as recorded by the Federal News Service, a private transcription agency:
MR. BUSH -- I'm grateful that the court made the decision that it made. 
 Remember, it wasn't all that long ago that a lot of people boldly predicted that the court wouldn't even hear our case. And now they're involved in making sure the outcome of the election is fair.
Q. Governor, yesterday Secretary Cheney suggested that it's time for the vice president to concede. Are you prepared to articulate that yourself?
A. No, I'm not, Carl. I think each of us is going to have to, you know -- that's a very difficult decision for anybody to make, and I understand that. I do believe I have won this election. I believe that I won it on the first count and on the second count and on the third count. But I'm -- but the vice president's going to have to make the decisions that he thinks are necessary. And I know that he'll put -- the interests of the country will be important in his decision making, just like it would be in mine.
 Q. Sir, are you saying you don't agree with Cheney? Do you think --
A. I think the vice president is entitled to his view. And -- but I do agree with this, that he's going to make a great vice president.
Q. Have we reached a point where the national interests are now in jeopardy because of this protracted process, Governor?
A. Oh, I'm not -- I wouldn't take it, necessarily, that far, Carl. I will tell you, though, it's important for us to -- at least as far as I'm concerned, it's important for our team to move forward.
Tomorrow, the vice president, at my request, is going to go up to Capitol Hill to further our discussions with the leadership and members of Congress because we've got a very strong agenda, and it's an agenda that I strongly believe has put me in the position I'm in. It's an agenda of strengthening the military to keep the peace, it's an education agenda. There are some warning signs about our economy that I think we ought to take seriously. And I talked to the leadership about that at the ranch over the weekend, and those -- which argues for a tax relief package. It's a tax-relief package that I campaigned on. And we need Social Security reform. And one of the benefits of Social Security reform is not only to make sure there's a Social Security system for the elderly today and for younger workers coming up, but under my vision of Social Security reform, it'll help with capital accumulation, which will help the economic growth. Yeah, Patsy.
Q. Governor, have you spoken to any more Democrats? And will Secretary Cheney be speaking to any tomorrow on the Hill?
A. I think the understanding with the secretary is that he'll be meeting with Republican leaders tomorrow and Republican members, and no I have not since I talked to you on Saturday.
Q. Governor, are you looking to have a Democrat as a treasury secretary?
A. Well, I'm not ruling anything out. And I know there's a lot of speculation going on, but I haven't made any decisions yet. And if I did, I probably wouldn't tell you.
Q. Do you think the Florida Legislature should go ahead and meet and vote on a slate of electors --
A. Well, Tom, I think it's -- I think we ought to take the -- I think we ought to take this process one day at a time. And today's the day, evidently, the judiciary is going to make some strong statements. And I felt like the Supreme Court of the United States made a very positive statement on our behalf. And I think that the important -- what I -- the sentiment I want to convey is this: that I am comforted by the fact that the highest court of our land heard our case and will make sure this election is fair.
I think that's -- I think that's very important for our citizenry to hear. And as far as what the Legislature does in Florida, that's going to be up to the leadership in the Legislature.

Two Court Rulings In Florida Vote Case
A Florida judge, N. Sanders Sauls, refused to overturn Gov. George W. Bush's victory in the state's presidential voting, rejecting every legal argument presented by lawyers for Vice President Al Gore, who immediately began to pursue an appeal to the Florida Supreme Court. A1
 
Several Gore advisers and leading Democrats expressed little hope that the Florida Supreme Court would overturn the ruling. A1
 
The United States Supreme Court asked the Florida Supreme Court to clarify parts of its Nov. 21 ruling permitting recounts to continue past a statutory deadline, and it vacated that ruling. A1
 
The Bush camp saw developments as a big step on the path toward a final and irrevocable determination of Mr. Bush as the next president. A1
 
Congressional Republicans intensified calls for Mr. Gore to concede, while Democrats mostly indicated they would stick with him for a few more days of legal maneuvering. A19
 
Republicans in the Florida Legislature said the court rulings offered a legal rationale to justify plans to have the Legislature consider appointing the state's 25 presidential electors. But legislative leaders did not call for such a session. A20

HEADLINE: Halls of Justice Going Up All Over;
New York City Nears a Peak In Its Courthouse Building Boom

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
In Hearing Room 387 at Queens Family Court, lawyers who jam into the closet-sized chamber have had to settle for a not-so-judicial-sounding seat assignment: the windowsill. At Brooklyn Family Court, defendants awaiting their turn overflow into equally grand accommodations: the stairwell. And at Manhattan's 111 Centre Street courthouse, where suspects and the families of victims sometimes have to assemble in the same room before trials because of cramped conditions, scuffles on occasion break out.
City and state officials need little nudging to acknowledge that the conditions are deplorable. But in the next breath, they are quick to boast about their very concrete response: the largest courthouse building boom in New York City since the 1930's. 
 Citywide, four new courthouses have recently opened, six new structures are under construction or in planning and eight courthouses or court-related buildings are scheduled for extensive renovations or expansions, although a few of these projects are several years off.
It is an estimated $2.4 billion, taxpayer-financed bricks-and-mortar campaign that will remake the daily courtroom experience for thousands of suspects, jurors and lawyers, among others.
Two of the projects -- the two-block-long Criminal Courthouse in the Concourse Village section of the Bronx and the 32-story Supreme and Family Courthouse in downtown Brooklyn -- will be the largest courthouses in the state and among the largest in the United States, state officials say. Both sprawling structures also happen to be coming in at a price tag tens of millions of dollars above their original budgets.
The 32-story project, at 330 Jay Street in Brooklyn, was originally expected to cost about $350 million. Now, officials say it will most likely be more than $700 million. In the Bronx, the new Criminal Courthouse, at 231 East 161st Street, which was originally budgeted at $231 million, is now looking more like a $353 million project, court officials said. And tag on an addition for Queens Criminal Court at 125-01 Queens Boulevard in Kew Gardens has jumped from $76 million to as much as $150 million.
The work under way in each of the boroughs is inspired by a 13-year-old state law that requires the city to evaluate its courthouses and repair or expand them as necessary to ensure that they are "suitable and sufficient." The push to fulfill this mandate started before Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani came into office. But it is only now, as the former federal prosecutor edges toward the final year of his tenure, that the construction campaign is reaching its full frenzy.
"This is a public works program on the scale the city of New York has not seen since the administration of Fiorello La Guardia and the Works Progress Administration," said Steven M. Fishner, the mayor's criminal justice coordinator, before adding with an obvious pride, "It will be Mayor Giuliani's legacy."
City and state officials say the new court space is desperately needed for a simple reason: rising caseloads. The Family Court system handled 240,480 cases last year, a 40 percent increase in the last decade. The Supreme Court's civil division has seen a 33 percent jump in its caseload in the last decade. The overall criminal caseload, meanwhile, is up 13 percent from 1989, although it is down somewhat from its peak during the crack epidemic.
The rising demands on the court system, particularly the Family Court, to serve as both arbiter of justice and social services supermarket has forced space requests to make room for everything from drug treatment facilities to offices for counselors who tend to the needs of abused or neglected children. Consider that the new Queens Family Court, set to open next October, will have more than 175,000 square feet, compared with the 71,000 square feet in the current court, a former public library at 89-14 Parsons Boulevard in Jamaica.
"We are bursting at the seams," said Jonathan Lippman, chief administrative judge of the state's Unified Court System, which operates the courts that are built at the city's expense. "And at a time when there are so many parts of our lives that are chaotic, you cannot afford to have a chaotic court system."
For people who use the court, the relief could not come sooner.
"It is prehistoric," said Peter Abbadessa, who was leaning against a phone booth door one recent afternoon at Queens Family Court. Every seat in the tiny waiting room was filled, with other people spilling over into hallways. "It feels like you are in prison, not court."
Upstairs, at Hearing Room 387, Amy B. Rood, a court referee who hears cases, must share her 10-by-12-foot room with three tables, two file cabinets and a desk, along with eight people on average who attend most hearings.
"It takes a lot of the dignity out of the process," she said. "It is not the type of setting anyone would want to have a custody case or an adoption or any significant event in your life to be decided."
The courthouse projects today honor few of the stereotypes set by the city's last major courthouse construction boom 70 years ago, when the structures rose like citadels. The grand marble entrance stairwells, towering neo-Classical style columns and robed sculptures holding staffs and scales to represent the figures of authority and justice are for the most part gone.
Instead, the new structures feature lots of exterior glass, open courtyards and natural light, as their architects say they are trying to create buildings that join the community, not serve as imposing temples on a hill.
"We want to make them feel accessible, part of the city that they occupy," said Ian Bader, a partner at Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, designer of the new Queens Family Court under construction at 152-02 Jamaica Avenue in Jamaica. "It is different from the temples of justice of the past, which are set apart and somewhat aloof."
The glass-and-brick Queens Family Court will be situated around a large glass-enclosed atrium, which will have a translucent sculpture by the German-American artist Ursula von Rydingsvard suspended from the ceiling. The structure will open out onto the grassy expanse of Rufus King Park.
The L-shaped Bronx Criminal Court -- which is so large that its footprint in just the first phase of the project is more than twice the size of a football field -- will also feature a extensive glass facade, as well as a large open-air courtyard with a mini-Guggenheim-looking building set within it that will serve as a jury assembly area.
The similarly giant Jay Street project in Brooklyn -- it will have 74 courtrooms and 10 hearing rooms -- departs so much from the courthouse norm that it could easily be mistaken for an office building, although the brick piers that will rise up its facade should, in at least a modest way, echo the notion of courthouse columns. Demolition of a city building at the site is supposed to happen soon, with construction set to start early next year.
Some city budget watchdogs have questioned the city's record infusion of money into court construction, although no one has publicly said the projects are not needed.
In a city with an more than $90 billion in estimated outstanding infrastructure needs -- schools, subway cars, fire stations and libraries -- only the court system has been allotted enough money to satisfy all its identified needs, according to a 1998 study of city capital demands and allocated financing by the city comptroller's office.
"It makes no sense to satisfy 100 percent of court capital needs when you are satisfying less than half of educational needs," said Glenn Pasanen, director of City Project, a nonprofit budget-monitoring organization, citing a 1998 study by Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi that put the schools' construction needs at only about 44 percent met. "It's yet another signal that the mayor is more interested in criminal justice rather than in investing in schools and kids where there is an societal and economic return."
City officials said the state helps out the effort by issuing the bonds needed to finance the construction. But city taxpayers must still cover the annual debt payments.
The officials said the costs of the projects have risen sharply because estimates in some cases were made years ago, when projects were conceived. Now, with the booming economy, contractors are submitting much higher bid prices given the intense competition for their labor.
"You can't expect that when a building is on the drawing board for years, and then comes into construction, that it is going to stay at the same price," Judge Lippman said. "That is not the way this economy, which is really booming, works."
Officials said heightened security in the wake of the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City bombings was also pushing up costs.
At the new Bronx Criminal Court, for example, a street that was planned to pass through the complex has been eliminated.
Bullet-resistant glass and blast-resistant walls have been added, resulting in about $25 million in extra costs, said Fred J. Wilmers, project manager at Rafael Vinoly Architects of Manhattan, the building's designer.
High-tech features in the buildings' designs are also adding to the bills. Lawyers, judges and every two jurors will have flat-screen monitors in some of the courtrooms at the new Bronx Criminal Court, in addition to other videoconference equipment that would allow some witnesses or defendants to testify from outside the courthouse.
But city and court officials, wary of previous criticism of high-priced courthouses, said they were trying to keep the luxuries to a minimum.
"It ain't no federal courthouse," said Mr. Fishner when asked about the 330 Jay Street project in Brooklyn, comparing it on his own with thefederal courthouse and office building at Foley Square, which features exotic wood paneling, private kitchens and showers.
The city's new courthouses are slated to have their own share of upscale touches, though, like the marble and granite lobby planned at the 330 Jay Street courthouse and the anigre -- an African hardwood -- on the lower part of the courtroom walls, according to plans.
The judge's chambers in the new buildings -- excluding staff space -- are typically about 350 square feet, which Robert E. Fisch, a court planning executive at Ricci Associates, a New York City company, said is "on the high end of reasonable."
Steps have clearly been taken to control costs, like the frequent use of artificial stone and a cement-based flooring, sprinkled with tan and white marble chips to give it a more upscale look. "It is a very utilitarian design," said Mr. Wilmers, project manager for Bronx Criminal Court. "The materials are chosen for long-term maintainability."
State and city officials say courthouse construction is an expensive undertaking, but well worthwhile.
"Our view is if you don't have a justice system that works, you don't have anything in these other areas, whether it be schools or social services," Judge Lippman said. "Without a justice system that is respected, society doesn't function."

Substitute for a Subway on Second Avenue: Free Enterprise

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
THE Second Avenue subway is dead! Long live the Second Avenue Free Way!
Actually, "dead" is not exactly the right word for the subway, since it has never shown signs of life. Voters in 1951 approved bonds to pay for it, and workers during the 1970's briefly worked on a tunnel, but otherwise it has remained on everyone's permanent "To Do" list. 
 Last month another bond proposal intended for the subway was on the ballot, but voters didn't bite this time. As usual, therefore, there is no money to build the subway, and even if some cash miraculously appeared, construction could take decades.
But there is a cheap idea for easing congestion immediately on the East Side of Manhattan. It comes not from a transit planner but from a professor of philosophy, Harry Binswanger, who has lived near Second Avenue for 35 years. Much of that time was spent next to the construction site of the subway tunnel to Roosevelt Island, a noisy experience that soured Dr. Binswanger on any new subway for Second Avenue.
Instead, he proposes to speed passengers along what he calls the Second Avenue Free Way, which embodies the philosophy he teaches at the Ayn Rand Institute. Dr. Binswanger wants to liberate Second Avenue from the taxicab cartel and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
"On Second Avenue," he suggests, "let anyone and any company hire out any vehicles they wish, at any price structure they wish, to provide any service they wish. Individual car owners with a free half-hour could run down Second Avenue, picking up passengers for whatever price is agreed upon. I project a flourishing, innovative, multitiered system of free, private, for-profit transport at rates far below the cost of subway fare or taxi fare."
Jitney vans in Brooklyn and Queens are already turning a profit while offering better service at lower fares than the M.T.A. buses, and they could presumably do it on Second Avenue, too. But the Free Way might work better with a little regulation of the sort envisioned by another libertarian, Daniel B. Klein, an economist at the University of California at Santa Clara.
Dr. Klein also opposes transit monopolies, but the alternative he prefers is a competitive system based on what he calls curb rights. A private company operating buses or vans on Second Avenue would have rights to pick up passengers only at certain stops. That way it could afford to invest in long-term regular service without worrying about part-time operators swooping in to snatch its customers. (Otherwise a crafty part-timer can turn a quick profit by showing up just ahead of the regular bus or van.)
THE city might, for instance, let private companies bid against the M.T.A. for its bus stops, and it could also let them lease spots on blocks where the M.T.A. buses don't stop. For return trips uptown they might get spots on First Avenue. They might also be allowed to use side streets or private lots to pick up passengers.
The newcomers would be free to innovate with different kinds of vehicles and routes: customized express runs into various spots in Midtown, say, or one-stop trips from the Upper East Side to Wall Street via the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive. By offering quicker, more comfortable rides in vans and buses, the private operators could lure people out of taxis and private cars, thereby easing congestion on Second Avenue.
The city could use the fees it collected from these operators to innovate with ways to speed traffic. It could afford to hire officers to keep private cars out of the right lane (which is now supposed to be reserved for buses at rush hour, but which is frequently clogged with cars anyway). If there were enough demand from private buses and vans, there could even be a second car-free lane.
Some of these innovations might be impractical (not to mention politically impossible). But the beauty of the Second Avenue Free Way is that it wouldn't take much money or effort to experiment with them. And some of the ideas could have an immediate impact, said Elliot G. Sander, who ran the Manhattan bus system in the 1980's and is now the director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University.
"We need to encourage more bus and van use in Manhattan," Mr. Sander said, "and Second Avenue would be an interesting place to start. The subway is at least 10 years away. In the meantime, we need innovative ways to move those folks along the line."

HEADLINE: Last Word in China's Phone Industry

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Dec. 5

 BODY:
He is not a member of the Politburo, the highest council of the Chinese government. He could walk the streets of Beijing without being recognized. Outside of China, his name scarcely registers.
Yet Wu Jichuan, the top communications minister in China, shakes stock markets and industries with his pronouncements. 
 Today, Mr. Wu came to Hong Kong for a conference organized by the International Telecommunication Union. And in a packed session with reporters, he struggled to calm the latest tempest set off by his ministry.
Last week, official newspapers in China reported that the government had approved a proposal to replace a system under which both the cellular telephone caller and the receipent pay for the call to one that would require the caller to pay for it.
The shares of China's two publicly listed telephone companies, China Mobile and China Unicom, sank after those reports because they raised fears that the companies would lose billions of dollars in revenue. The stocks fell a combined $26 billion in market value, each plunging more than 20 percent.
Under pressure from shareholders, Mr. Wu held a conference call with fund managers on Friday, in which he said Beijing would not adopt the one-way payment plan for one to two years. China Mobile and China Unicom embarked on powerful rallies, making up almost all their lost ground.
"I think the media and the fund managers should have known that the opinions expressed on an individual basis did not represent the views of the government," Mr. Wu said today with visible irritation. "They should have gone to the spokesman of the relevant department."
The spokesman -- when it comes to China's communications policy -- tends to be Mr. Wu himself. In running the sprawling Information Industries Ministry, Mr. Wu has control over every nook and cranny of the country's telecommunications industry, from pagers and satellites to the Internet.
Mr. Wu seems to relish his influence, though he tries periodically, and without much success, to play down his role. After the conference call last week, some economists criticized him for intervening on behalf of state-controlled companies rather than for Chinese consumers.
"Since I'm a government official, I know nothing about the stock market," Mr. Wu said. "I did not mean to support or raise the stock price."
Whatever Mr. Wu's motives, analysts said his soothing words underscored a recognition by Chinese leaders that shareholders can no longer be ignored. China Mobile and China Unicom are listed in New York as well as in Hong Kong, and they are held in investment portfolios around the world.
"In China, the idea used to be that foreign investors were merely a source of capital," said Duncan Clark, a partner at BDA China Ltd., a telecommunications consulting firm in Beijing. "The leaders have realized in the last few weeks that shareholders have got to be treated as a constituency."
China has a more immediate reason not to alienate foreigners. Beijing hopes to sell shares in yet another state telephone company, China Telecom, sometime next year, according to investment bankers here.
That offering could be the biggest yet for a Chinese state-owned company, generating $6 billion to $7 billion. China Telecom is the remnant of the country's telephone monopoly, parts of which were carved up in 1999 to create China Mobile and the paging operation of China Unicom.
China Telecom still owns a huge, but unwieldy, fixed-line phone network, as well as a data-transmission business. Analysts said Beijing might award the company a cellular license to make it more attractive to investors.
China is rushing to prepare its telecommunications industry for an expected onslaught of foreign competition after it joins the World Trade Organization. AT&T today became the first foreign company to announce a joint venture in China since Beijing pledged to open its market.
AT&T said it would acquire 25 percent of Shanghai Symphony Telecom, a broadband services provider that will offer high-speed voice and data communications in the Pudong district of Shanghai next year.
Even as Mr. Wu tried to smooth feathers, he reasserted that China intended to keep a tight rein on the Internet. His warnings about the Internet have generated as many ripples as his comments about telecommunications.
Last fall, he alarmed outsiders by saying that Internet content companies were subject to the same prohibitions on investment as were Internet service providers.
Today, he expressed concern about uncensored exchanges. "Anyone who has used the Web knows already that people always use false names; no one uses their own name," he said. "If someone attacks someone else, there is no way to catch them, no way to sue them."

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT: A Status Symbol Under Siege;
Big Plush Offices Make Way for More Humble Space

BYLINE: By EVE TAHMINCIOGLU 

 BODY:
Dick Poladian, a managing partner for Arthur Andersen in Los Angeles, received several angry e-mail and voice mail messages from distraught managers when he decided to get rid of their large windowed offices. And he acknowledged that his own children thought their dad "wasn't as important" when he, the boss, gave up his lavish corner office with credenza and conference table.
"They clearly thought I'd lost it," Mr. Poladian said about his family and the more than 200 managers that report to him. 
 But he stands by his decision nearly two years ago to reconfigure the offices, doing away with varying-sized rooms with windows and putting managers in cookie-cutter interior offices, in some cases two to a room.
To convince reluctant managers to go along quietly, some of the most senior people in the organization, including Mr. Poladian, moved into cubes, too. "The managers would have said 'he got his nice office' if I didn't do that," he said.
While lower-level managers throughout America have long been relegated to cubicle farms, senior executives have clung to big corner offices as a perk and status symbol. But lately, some companies are beginning to apply a more egalitarian approach to the management set's digs, too.
In part, cost is driving the trend. With real estate prices skyrocketing in much of the country, cramming more people into less space saves money. Verizon Communications, for example, squeezed Charles R. Lee and Ivan G. Seidenberg, its co-chief executives, into offices the same size as those inhabited by roughly 18 second-rung executives at the company's Avenue of the Americas headquarters in Manhattan. "We wanted to make sure we got as many offices as we could in there," said Peter Thonis, a spokesman for the telecommunications company.
Ending the turf mentality can also save in renovation expenses. Mr. Poladian of Arthur Andersen said he was sick of reconfiguring the offices every time someone was hired, promoted or left the firm. Until he adopted his one-size-fits-all policy, he says, the endless remodeling was his office's No. 2 expense behind payroll. "Now I can plug anyone in anywhere," he said.
The financial incentive for keeping things simple is also growing because knocking down walls and ripping up floors requires an immense amount of rewiring to handle high-speed computer data and voice traffic. "There's tons more cable than there was just five years ago," said John Lijewski, a principal at Perkins & Will, the corporate interior designers that remade Verizon's executive offices.
Doing away with all that construction work has less tangible benefits as well, like a more pleasant work environment. At the Tampa, Fla., law firm of Annis, Mitchell, Cockey, Edwards & Roehn, the constant sound of jackhammers was getting on the staff's nerves. When an associate was promoted to partner, or a new lawyer came aboard, rooms had to be enlarged or shrunk to fit the new occupant's rank.
"There was so much musical chairs," said Lawrence P. Ingram, a partner. "All this constant jockeying for the right offices. People were more preoccupied with the right office than billing clients."
Enough was enough. Annis Mitchell abolished the old-style law office architecture last year, spending $2 million to make every partner's and associate partner's office identical, down to the modular furniture. The new setup, Mr. Ingram says, helps in retaining and recruiting associates because it eliminates the hierarchical divide.
"I was very excited," said Ellen Koehler, a 30-year-old associate at the firm. "We got a 15-foot office with three windows."
Some partners were not as happy. "They felt we should have kept the old system: work hard, pay your dues and then get the reward of a big office," said Robert McLean, a partner who helped oversee the change. Mr. McLean held meetings with all the partners and ultimately everyone went along, though somewhat reluctantly, he says. The only concession the firm made, he says, was to let one longtime partner keep his old, bulky dark-wood desk.
For all the changes afoot in some places, workplace democracy remains a rarity in the old economy, said Jim Shaffer, owner of the Jim Shaffer Group, a management consulting firm in Annapolis, Md. Indeed, the size-is-power mentality holds even greater sway at some firms than it used to, he said.
Mr. Shaffer cited the example of a client who was hired recently for a middle-management position at a Midwestern insurance company. Shortly after she started work, a human resources representative came to her office and covered the windows with duct tape. When she asked why, she was told that the office had been occupied by a much higher-ranking company director and that "managers don't get windows," Mr. Shaffer said.
That incident might seem silly, but it demonstrates the enduring power of symbolism in the status-conscious world of corporate America. Even managers who have acquiesced to casual dress in the workplace can lash out when such a valued perk as a big office is threatened.
People still think the office is important, said Stephen Viscusi, the host of a nationally syndicated career-advice radio show called "On the Job."
"Look at 'Ally McBeal," ' Mr. Viscusi said of the television character. "She's not even a partner in that law firm but she's got a huge office."
In general, Mr. Viscusi says, executives he talks to still perceive the size of their office as a reflection of their position at a firm. Many even ask to see their office before they accept job offers. "Take away his car, club rights, a parking space," he said, "but don't take away his nice big private office."
Michael Gilson, director of facilities management for CBB Architects in St. Petersburg, Fla., agrees. No matter how many companies talk about discarding old habits, he says, most managers he works with are still obsessed with the size and positioning of their office. It matters to them, for example, whether the chief executive can see them from his own perch.
Mr. Gilson recalled standing with two utility company executives of the same rank who were checking out the results of a workplace renovation. "They walked up to the doorways of their offices, which were side by side, and both looked up," he said. "You could see their lips moving in unison as they counted the wall tiles, '2, 4, 6, 8.' "
One office was six inches wider than the other, but luckily for office morale, neither manager detected the difference, Mr. Gilson said.
Even when all the offices take up the same space, subtle accouterments can mark some off as first among equals. When the BF Goodrich Company moved its headquarters to Charlotte, N.C., this year, the entire executive team, excluding the chief executive, were given offices of roughly 15 feet by 15 feet with mostly identical furniture.
The move "speaks to our corporate philosophy; we are open and nonpolitical -- not a 'Dilbert' environment," said Gail Warner, a company spokeswoman.
There was one barely noticeable little touch in the offices of executives of vice-presidential rank and up, however: a quarter-inch wood inlay around the trim of their desks in the pattern of a Greek key. (Ms. Warner justified the distinction by saying it was "extremely subtle.")
If executives want to encourage democracy in the workplace, just bulldozing the posh executive suites will not do the trick, said Barry Miller, a workplace psychologist and management professor at Pace University in Manhattan. "It's like putting a honey label on a vinegar jar," he said. "It's not going to change the acidity of the contents."
And, he suggested, companies should think twice before cutting back office size and putting senior managers in cubicles because some positions require more space for storage and meetings, and confidentiality could be compromised in an open-office setting.
Beth Grossman, the executive vice president of Communications/Marketing Action, a New York-based marketing firm with a staff of 10, learned that lesson. Hoping to create an atmosphere of camaraderie, Ms. Grossman chose a smaller office than her previous one when her company moved last year. She soon regretted the decision. "My stuff started to pile up and I said to myself, "what am I trying to prove anyway?' " she said. Later, when an employee in a larger office resigned, she grabbed it.
And it wasn't just the need for more space, either, she confessed. "When my mother came up to visit, she was so upset because my office was so small," Ms. Grossman said. "She said: 'You're an executive of an agency. You should have the larger office.' "
To be sure, some executives really do not care a whit about how big their offices are or where they are situated. This insouciance, as everybody knows by now, is most pronounced in high-technology start-ups.
"We don't want people here who think like that," said Jim Nunan, the head of human resources for NonStop Solutions Inc., a software company in San Francisco, alluding to job candidates' intent on having their own offices. All eight members of NonStop's executive team sit in cubicles, just like the rank and file, he said. The main focus of their energy, he said, half-joking, is "let's go through the I.P.O. and get rich."
On the other hand, given the initial public offering market these days, maybe an office is not such a bad idea, after all.

EUROPE
 
EUROPEAN UNION: COHEN'S WARNING
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen warned the European Union not to set up a military structure that could compete with NATO. The 15-nation union has vowed to establish a 60,000-member force by 2003, a move the United States supports on the conditions that NATO remain the primary guarantor of European security and do the planning for both groups. But France has insisted on a more autonomous role for the European Union. If the Europeans insist on setting up a rival planning structure, Mr. Cohen said, "NATO could become a relic of the past." Michael R. Gordon (NYT) 

AUSTRIA: VOTE ON EUROPE
More than 100,000 Austrians have signed a petition for a referendum on whether to quit the European Union, obliging Parliament to discuss the issue within six months. The petition says the union had stripped Austria of its sovereignty, undermined its agriculture and threatened its neutrality. The union imposed sanctions on Austria early last year for seven months for including the rightist party of Jorg Haider in government. Austria joined in 1995 after 75 percent of voters favored it in a referendum, but recent polls show support slipping drastically. Victor Homola (NYT)
 
IRELAND: WAGE ACCORD
Acknowledging union concerns about the impact of rising inflation on working-class wages, the government and labor leaders reached an accord to raise increases in pay rates by 3 percent over the next two years. The deal will help to defuse threats of strikes by public sector workers. A wide-ranging current pact limits increases to 5.5 percent a year until 2002. The new rates will add 2 percent in April 2001 and another 1 percent in April 2002. Brian Lavery (NYT)
 
ASIA
 
JAPAN: CABINET SHUFFLE
The embattled prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, shuffled his cabinet in an attempt to streamline the government and bolster its low public approval ratings. The new government contains 17 ministers, down from 22, but the biggest innovation, from a prime minister seeking credibility with voters in the coming election year, is the inclusion of two former prime ministers: Kiichi Miyazawa, the finance minister who was returned to his post, and Ryutaro Hashimoto, selected as minister for the new post of administrative reform. Howard W. French (NYT)
 
INDIA: POSTAL STRIKE
Postal workers across the country began an indefinite strike, demanding higher wages and better benefits. Three unions, claiming a total strength of 600,000 members, say the government has failed to live up to a May settlement. Post offices were deserted in most towns and cities. Barry Bearak (NYT)
 
CHINA: DALAI LAMA TALKS
The exiled Dalai Lama said he has reopened indirect talks with China for the first time in two years. The Tibetan spiritual and political leader, who has lived in India since 1959, said his brother visited Beijing in late October at the invitation of the authorities. He said the Chinese had not allowed his brother to travel in Tibet or responded to a request to send a fact-finding mission to Tibet. Erik Eckholm (NYT)
 
AFRICA
 
IVORY COAST: PROTEST DEATHS CLIMB
The number of deaths mounted as supporters of Alassane D. Ouattara, the opposition leader barred from running in legislative elections next Sunday, continued to clash with security forces. The government said 13 people had been killed since Monday, including a police officer and a gendarme. The party of Mr. Ouattara put the number killed at more than 30. Norimitsu Onishi (NYT)
 
SOUTH AFRICA: LOCAL ELECTIONS
Thousands of voters turned out to elect the members of 284 city and town councils across the country. The governing African National Congress was expected to win most seats, but races were expected to be close in Cape Town and Pretoria. Rachel L. Swarns (NYT)
 
ANGOLA: AMNESTY OFFER
Parliament approved a law that would grant amnesty to people accused of political crimes. President Eduardo dos Santos said the law was a gesture of reconciliation to members of the rebel group Unita. The state news agency reported that hundreds of Unita supporters surrendered after hearing about the amnesty, but Unita officials said the rebels had rejected the offer. Rachel L. Swarns (NYT)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
COLOMBIA: EX-AIDE KIDNAPPED
A former development minister in President Andres Pastrana's cabinet, Fernando Araujo, was kidnapped from the Caribbean city of Cartagena, continuing a series of abductions in the business world in recent days, officials said. It was unclear who kidnapped Mr. Araujo, left, but leftist rebels, right-wing paramilitaries and common criminals are responsible for 3,000 kidnappings a year. Mr. Araujo's abduction came after the Nov. 28 kidnapping of the daughter of a top industrial leader and the Nov. 25 kidnapping of the Colombian manager of Hyundai Corp. Juan Forero (NYT)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAN: ISLAMIC BARBIE ABANDONED
Iran has abandoned a plan to protect Iranian youth from the "negative influence" of the popular Barbie and Ken dolls by replacing them with home-made Islamic substitutes called Sara and Dara, the official news agency reported. An official said "technical difficulties" were to blame for the abandonment of the project, adding that Iran was now forced to ask foreign companies to make the dolls. (Agence France-Presse)
 
IRAN: AFGHANS SENT BACK
Some 26,000 Afghans who illegally crossed the border into Iran's southeast Sistan-Baluchestan Province were arrested and sent back to Afghanistan, an Iranian police official told the state news agency. The United Nations issued a warning on Oct. 27 saying 500,000 to 1 million people were in danger of starving to death in Afghanistan because of the worst drought there in 30 years.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From the Speech by the Fed Chairman

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech yesterday by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, at a conference of America's Community Bankers in Manhattan:
During the past couple of years, however, the widespread optimism that was apparent in financial markets has given way to some reassessment of risks and opportunities. This process has been under way ever since the global financial crisis in the fall of 1998. That episode forced many market participants to recognize the potential for international risks to feed back on U.S. markets. Events brought into sharper focus the possibility that liquidity in many markets can dry up simultaneously when fear spurs risk aversion, and an intense, near-term focus on protecting capital values markedly elevates the demand for liquidity. Markets largely recovered from that episode, but an imprint was left in the form of wider credit spreads and more cautious behavior on the part of banks and other lenders. . . . 
 In periods of transition from unsustainable to more modest rates of growth, an economy is obviously at increased risk of untoward events that would be readily absorbed in a period of boom. The sharp rise in energy prices, if sustained, is worrisome in this regard. As we learned from previous episodes, rising energy prices could engender risks to both inflation and economic activity. If accommodated by monetary policy, the jump in energy prices could spill over into general inflation and inflationary expectations, as was so evident in the 1970's. At the same time, the hike in the price of imported energy has acted, in effect, as a tax equivalent of roughly 1 percent of national income. Although there is as yet little evidence of the type of destabilizing inflationary pressures observed in the aftermath of previous oil price spikes or of exceptionally large restraint on consumer spending, Middle East tensions have heightened such risks.
The most significant effect to date from higher energy prices appears to be on profit margins, where corporate businesses, constrained by competitive market forces, have not been able to raise prices to fully offset energy cost increases. We estimate that owing to the rise in oil, natural gas and electric power prices, energy costs of nonfinancial, nonenergy, corporations have increased at a 40 percent annual rate since the spring of 1999. Apparently, most of the increase has eaten into the margins of domestic corporations outside the energy sector.
With equity prices weakening in response to reduced earnings from higher costs and a more moderate pace of sales, the "wealth effect" that spurred consumer spending is being significantly attenuated. Moreover, high and rising equity prices had facilitated a good deal of financing for newer companies, both in the equity and bond markets. Widened spreads in the high-yield markets reflect, in part, a reduced potential for new equity issuance to support debt servicing. Higher costs of capital for these companies likely is exerting some restraint on overall business capital spending.
Nonetheless, in the face of the energy price spike and the erosion of optimism in financial markets, consumer confidence, or sentiment, appears to be holding up reasonably well to date, though there have been some mixed signals of late. And although new orders for high-tech equipment have slowed from their torrid pace of earlier this year, order backlogs for such equipment continued to rise through October, and capital deepening and structural productivity growth continued apace.
Still, in an economy that already has lost some momentum, one must remain alert to the possibility that greater caution and weakening asset values in financial markets could signal or precipitate an excessive softening in household and business spending.
As might readily be expected, these changing economic dynamics, of necessity, are being reflected in our banking markets. Technological innovations played a key role in rendering decades-old banking laws and regulations obsolete. The relaxation of these regulations has, in turn, further reduced barriers to competition and accelerated the modernization of our financial system. That evolution, however, must continue to occur in a manner that preserves the fundamental soundness of the financial system and, in particular, the nation's banks. History teaches us that a sound banking system, willing and able to take deposits and extend credit, is a prerequisite for the long-term health of the national economy. Securities markets alone will never be able to substitute for the extensive and detailed knowledge that bankers -- especially community bankers -- bring to the intermediation process. . . .
At the same time, it is important that the response of management to these concerns not be overdone. The rise in the problems that we are observing can in some sense be attributed to the kinds of overreaching typically experienced during strong economic periods, when downside scenarios are more challenging to visualize fully, when the ambitions of borrowers are at their height, and when competition for market share is an especially driving force. Though lenders will be viewing new transactions with greater caution than they did a couple of years ago, both bankers and their supervisors should now guard against allowing the pendulum to swing too far the other way by adopting policy stances that cut off credit to borrowers with credible prospects.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Fell 3.3% In October

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Factory business turned in its weakest performance in three months in October as a big drop in demand for transportation equipment and electronics helped depress orders to American manufacturers.
The Commerce Department reported today that factory orders fell 3.3 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $373.9 billion, the latest evidence that the slowing economy is suppressing the appetite of businesses and consumers for manufactured goods. 
 October's decline, which was larger than many analysts expected, wasthe first and biggest drop since factory orders plunged by a record 8.1 percent in July.
"The economy will finish the year 2000 not with a bang but with a whimper," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
Manufacturers are feeling the pinch of both the Federal Reserve's six interest rate increases since June 1999, which have raised borrowing costs and dampened demand for big-ticket items, and of a strong dollar, which makes American goods more expensive overseas.
In another report, the Federal Reserve said industrial production grew more slowly in the third quarter than previously thought.
According to revised figures, output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 3.5 percent in the July-September quarter, down from the previous estimate of 3.7 percent.
Meanwhile, orders for transportation equipment in October plummeted 16.1 percent, mostly because of weaker demand for airplanes and aircraft parts.
Excluding the volatile transportation category, factory orders fell 1.2 percent in October, the second decline in the last four months. The transportation sector swings widely from month to month because it includes costly items like airplanes and ships.
Total factory orders rose 1.1 percent in September, according to revised figures, slightly weaker than the government previously reported.

HEADLINE: MARKET PLACE;
Whoopee, a Stock Surge! Finished? Now, a Reality Check.

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
I am not a Grinch.
Thus spake Alan Greenspan yesterday at a meeting of community bankers in New York City. The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board signaled that because the economy is showing signs of a serious slowdown, he is prepared to change interest rate policy from an inclination to increase rates to a far preferable predilection to cut them. 
 Investors exulted at the news, sending stocks into the stratosphere. The Nasdaq composite index, which at Monday's close had fallen 48 percent from its March high, surged 274.05 points, or 10.5 percent, its biggest one-day jump, to 2,889.80. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 338.62 points, or 3.2 percent, to 10,898.72. Prices of Treasury bonds also soared, and their yields fell, as investors bought securities that would benefit from declining interest rates. Page C12.
"In periods of transition from unsustainable to more modest rates of growth, an economy is obviously at increased risk of untoward events that would be readily absorbed in a period of boom," Mr. Greenspan said. Nodding to the market turmoil of recent months, he added: "In an economy that already has lost some momentum, one must remain alert to the possibility that greater caution and weakening asset values in financial markets could signal or precipitate an excessive softening in household and business spending."
Translation: Even though labor markets remain drum-tight, Mr. Greenspan will cut rates to avoid the chilling effect on consumer spending and capital expenditures by businesses that a declining stock market may bring.
Mr. Greenspan's comments came just two weeks before the next meeting of interest rate policy makers, on Dec. 19. The Fed chairman's speech makes clear that while it was once true that the economy drove the stock market, today, with households supplanting their savings accounts with shares, the stock market is very much in the driver's seat of the economy.
But even as stock and bond investors celebrated yesterday, troubling questions remained. Can Mr. Greenspan avert a recession or even a hard economic landing with a couple of interest rate cuts? Indeed, how much control do his interest rate levers give him over future economic performance in the United States?
"They are sending a message that they see the weakness and they are responding to it," said Ed McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. "Certainly the Fed can play a useful role in shoring up confidence through a policy move it might take. But it's not like it's going to affect the cost of credit a whole lot."
Although Mr. Greenspan has been credited with steering the economy to its longest expansion on an astute management of interest rate policy, the instruments he has to ward off a recession are relatively blunt ones. Cutting rates by a quarter or half of a percentage point in the first six months of 2001, which is what many economists are now expecting, can only achieve so much. For instance, companies of questionable financial strength must now pay 16 percent annually or more to attract capital from lenders. It will take more than a one-half point cut to reduce these companies' borrowing costs.
"The numbers coming out of the economy this quarter and next are going to be modest numbers," said Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economist and author. "It is going to require more than a one-quarter point move by the Fed to bring back some momentum to the economy."
Mr. Kaufman said that several issues now place the Fed on its most difficult voyage in years. For example, debt amassed by both individuals and corporations stands at excessive levels. Corporate interest payments in the third quarter of this year stood at $182 billion, a record. As a percentage of corporate profits -- 18.7 percent -- these interest payments are not near an all-time high. But if profits recede, debt payments could easily become a problem.
Inventories of manufactured goods are also at high levels, Mr. Kaufman pointed out. And with Japan still in economic distress and European economies subdued in their growth, America's ability to export its way out of a slowdown is doubtful.
While the Fed may be able to engineer a soft landing in the early months of next year, it is the second half of 2001 that worries Mr. Kaufman. "What will be the drivers in the economy after a period of very modest economic growth?" he asked. "Because of inventories, heavy debt loads, sluggish growth in the rest of the world and the huge amount of capital spending that has already occurred, the answer is not clear."
Mr. McKelvey also says he believes the Fed faces a perplexing problem today. "They're starting from a position where the labor market is the tightest in a generation," he said. "If labor costs increase, that can be inflationary. The Fed has to be careful not to ease prematurely."
The most recent figures show that hourly compensation costs among nonfarm businesses rose at a 6.4 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the fastest pace since 1992. And the rise in labor costs has been accompanied by an increase in core consumer prices, growing at an annual rate of 2.7 percent so far this year, up from 1.9 percent in 1999.
This suggests that the euphoria seen among stock investors yesterday, while fun and festive and a big vote of confidence in Mr. Greenspan's abilities, is a little bit more than premature.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Nasdaq Sets Record In Broad Rally Amid Hope On Rates

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Stocks soared yesterday, propelled by what investors took as a clear sign of impending cuts in interest rates and by optimism that the presidential election stalemate may be nearing an end.
The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index leaped 10.48 percent, beating the previous record one-day advance, 7.94 percent on May 30, by a wide margin. 
 Other gauges joined in the renewed enthusiasm for stocks, which had dwindled for weeks as one technology company after another warned of sales or profits that would fall short of expectations, and nervousness over slackened economic growth grew more acute.
Early gains accelerated markedly in midmorning after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, strongly suggested that the central bank would cut short-term rates if the economy's deceleration, already pronounced, threatened to become too rapid.
The Fed is now thought to be confident that its rate increases between mid-1999 and May 2000 have reined in unsustainably fast growth. And it is widely expected to remove a longstanding anti-inflation stance at its policy meeting on Dec. 19 and to replace it with a more neutral one giving equal weight to heading off possible recession.
Actual cuts are expected in the first quarter of next year, analysts said.
The Nasdaq rose 274.05 points, to 2,889.80. But even after that unprecedented jump, the index remained 525 points lower than it ended on Election Day and 29 percent lower for the year. It had fallen in 10 of the preceding 12 sessions.
The other main gauges also reflected a broad scramble to buy stocks, one that forced some traders who had sold shares short in hopes of profiting from further declines to cover their positions, adding to demand.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 338.62 points, or 3.2 percent, to 10,898.72. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 51.57 points, or 3.9 percent, to 1,376.54. The Dow is now down 5.2 percent for the year, and the S.& P. 500 is down 6.31 percent.
Bond prices, following Mr. Greenspan's signal, climbed enough to push yields down by as much as one-tenth of a percentage point. The 10-year Treasury note rose 24/32, to 102 15/32, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.42 percent from 5.52 percent on Monday. The 30-year bond rose 17/32, to 109 19/32. Its yield dropped to 5.58 percent from 5.66 percent.
"Lower interest rates and increased liquidity usually will overcome slower growth in earnings and take stock prices up," said Eugene Mintz, a financial markets analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman. But while he predicted new highs for blue-chip stocks and the S.& P. 500 early next year, the Nasdaq is not likely to end its prolonged slide until perhaps spring, he said.
Investors were also encouraged that the monthlong deadlock in the presidential election appeared likely to be resolved soon, with Gov. George W. Bush the probable winner.
But interest rates were almost certainly the main force behind yesterday's surge, the analysts said.
"I'd say election relief contributed 25 percent of this rally and the acknowledgment by the Fed of economic risks 75 percent," said Ned Riley Jr., chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. As evidence, he pointed to the exceptionally strong performance of interest-sensitive stocks like banks and home builders.
Despite yesterday's euphoria, 3Com, which warned of a wider-than-expected quarterly loss after the stock market closed on Monday, plunged as low as $8.97 and ended at $10.03, down $3.34.
But most technology stocks bounded ahead, even Xilinx, a maker of programmable semiconductors, which also warned of poor results; it gained $1.88, to $43.56. Microsoft, which many think would be under less antitrust pressure in a Bush administration, rose $3.44, to $59.88.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
Club's Members Learn Skills for Life

BYLINE: By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
Three years ago Carlos Knight was living in a Williamsburg homeless shelter and surviving on $599 a month in Supplemental Security Income. He was unable to hold a permanent job, he said, because of bipolar disorder, which causes him to feel elated one minute and utterly depressed the next.
"I get a lot of mood swings," he said. "When I get depressed I get frustrated, and I can't think, and I can't make a decision." 
 Mr. Knight, now 35, was referred to the East New York Clubhouse by a worker at the shelter where he slept. "They said you need something to occupy your time all day," Mr. Knight said.
The clubhouse offers a daytime program for mentally ill adults. It is run by the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
The clubhouse has 130 members. To qualify, one needs only have an interest in coming and have a diagnosed mental illness or disability. Each member is referred by a social worker or a mental health therapist. About 45 members come each day to the clubhouse, several inviting rooms on the ground floor of a brick building on Atlantic Avenue between Vermont and Wyona Streets.
"The goal of the clubhouse is to foster independence through a variety of tasks," said the clubhouse's director, Beth Schultz.
Members, most of whom have depression or other mental disabilities like schizophrenia or developmental retardation, cook breakfast and lunch for one another, make sure the clubhouse is kept clean, learn computer programs, answer the clubhouse's phones, and form discussion committees. Among these are the problem resolution committee, which aims at resolving conflicts that may arise between members, and the men's committee, in which male clubhouse members talk about the stresses of relationships.
Each day members sign up for a variety of tasks listed on a large black chalkboard near the dining area, such as: "Sweep in front of building," "Water plants," "Empty garbage," "Clean off stove," "Mop kitchen" and "Re-stock bathrooms."
The jobs provide basic skills for the members who need them, Ms. Schultz said, but for the members with depression they can serve another, perhaps more important purpose. "It takes our minds off all that stuff that we struggle with," she said. "Some of the members said when they're busy in the kitchen they don't think about their mental illness."
Before Renee Pierce, 44, came to the clubhouse a year ago, she was unemployed and sleeping on a couch in her mother's Brooklyn apartment.
When she first came to the clubhouse, Ms. Pierce, who is mildly mentally retarded and schizophrenic, was shy and inactive. She has become a great help to the clubhouse's staff, acting as a receptionist and messenger, Ms. Schultz said.
Ms. Pierce is studying for her G.E.D., and plans on getting it within two years. She said she hoped to become a home health aide or a nurse's assistant.
As Ms. Pierce sat across the room, laughing and joking with other clubhouse members, Ms. Schultz looked at her and said, "This is someone who was pretty much more withdrawn. For her to realize that she can be accepted is pretty powerful."
Mr. Knight said he found a reason to believe in himself at the clubhouse. He recently was hired by the New York Foundling Hospital to help build custom-made wheelchairs for disabled children.
"You come here and you try to build yourself," he said. "Where else can you come to make friends and build up your skills?"

HEADLINE: West Africa's Widening Conflict

 BODY:
Sierra Leone's agony is sadly familiar by now. In a decade of war the notorious Revolutionary United Front has terrorized the West African country, killing and maiming tens of thousands of people and looting the nation's diamonds. The rebels' leader, Foday Sankoh, was arrested last May and remains in custody awaiting trial for war crimes. A tenuous cease-fire has prevailed since early last month. But the rebels still control two-thirds of the country, and the lethal malignancy they represent is spreading. The threat of a regional war seems to be growing, with potentially ruinous consequences.
In the last two months the rebels and their Liberian allies have engaged in a series of border clashes with the armed forces of neighboring Guinea, and they have massacred hundreds of Guinean civilians. Some 60,000 Guineans have been scattered from their homes. Guinea already shelters 500,000 refugees from Sierra Leone and neighboring Liberia, and many of these could be uprooted. This would create yet another African humanitarian emergency, and it raises fears of an expanding circle of conflict akin to the intractable wars now consuming Congo. 
 The primary source of instability throughout the region is President Charles Taylor of Liberia. He helped create the Sierra Leone rebel front in 1991 as a means of destabilizing that country and exploiting its diamonds, and few doubt he is using the fighters for the same purpose in Guinea. Richard Holbrooke, Washington's representative to the United Nations, has aptly described Mr. Taylor as "Milosevic in Africa with diamonds," a reference to former President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. Like Mr. Milosevic, Mr. Taylor has brought misery and destruction to his own country.
The United States has maintained a special relationship with Liberia since the country was founded by freed American slaves in 1847. Throughout the cold war, Washington supported a succession of authoritarian regimes. But the Clinton administration has wisely distanced itself from Mr. Taylor. In October, Washington imposed a ban on visas to the United States for Liberian government officials and their families. It is now seeking international support for a broader regime of sanctions that might include a ban on all diamond exports from Liberia, the seizure of Mr. Taylor's financial deposits overseas and a ban on logging exports. This plan deserves support. The U.N. imposed an arms embargo on Liberia in the early 1990's, but it needs tightening.
The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, visited Sierra Leone last weekend and appealed to the rebels to open areas under their control to government and U.N. peacekeepers. The U.N.'s shaky peacekeeping force, which now numbers 12,000, will be shored up later this month with the planned arrival of West African battalions, mostly Nigerians. American military advisers have been training these battalions in more aggressive tactics that may enable them to begin reclaiming the country from the rebels. Their arrival will be welcome. But it is difficult to imagine a lasting peace for Sierra Leone or its neighbors as long as Charles Taylor continues to destabilize the region.

HEADLINE: Home Depot Names Officer From G.E. As President

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Moving quickly to sign up the remaining also-ran in the race to succeed John F. Welch Jr. at General Electric, Home Depot Inc. announced yesterday that it had named Robert L. Nardelli as president and chief executive.
Mr. Nardelli, 52, is president and chief executive of GE Power Systems, a $15 billion division. His appointment at Home Depot is effective immediately. 
 To make room for Mr. Nardelli, Home Depot said Arthur M. Blank, 57, its current president and chief executive, will join Bernard Marcus as co-chairman. The two men co-founded Home Depot in 1979.
In addition to these positions, Mr. Nardelli will become a member of the company's board and its executive committee.
"We have known Bob for many years, and we are delighted to welcome him to Home Depot," Mr. Marcus said in a statement. "Not only has he compiled an impressive track record of delivering superior sales and profit growth in all of the G.E. business units he ran, but he has also demonstrated an uncanny ability to develop managerial talent and motivate employees to perform exceptionally well."
Home Depot, which quietly began a search about five months ago for an executive to become president, moved exceptionally fast. The company first contacted Mr. Nardelli on Nov. 27, only hours after General Electric said it had chosen Jeffrey R. Immelt to succeed Mr. Welch.
"It happened quickly and I am absolutely elated," Mr. Nardelli said in a telephone interview yesterday. "It took me about a nano-second to accept."
Along with Mr. Immelt and W. James McNerney Jr., Mr. Nardelli was a prime contender to assume Mr. Welch's post at G.E. It was further assumed that when a successor was named, the other two executives would become leading contenders to run other large organizations.
A week to the day after Mr. Welch named his successor, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing said it had hired Mr. McNerney as chairman and chief executive. Yesterday it was Home Depot's turn.
"This is a testament to the guys, to my clients and to their ability to move fast," said Gerard R. Roche, senior chairman of Heidrick & Struggles International, the search firm that placed both executives.
Kenneth G. Langone, chairman and chief executive of Invemed Associates, an investment banking firm, said he realized that the so-called losers of the competition for the top job at G.E. would not be idle for long.
"I was sensitive to the fact that whoever didn't get the G.E. job would be picked off in nothing flat," Mr. Langone, who is a member of both the G.E. and Home Depot boards, said yesterday. "I was in Los Angeles last week, and I put out the word that it was clear 3M was after Mr. McNerney. When it became obvious that Bob Nardelli was there, I made a call, and we at Home Depot got in high gear."
General Electric is a well-known entity at Home Depot. G.E. is a big supplier of products. In addition, other G.E. executives have left the company to join Home Depot. Dennis J. Carey, an executive vice president and chief financial officer, is a General Electric alumnus.
Even as they praised Mr. Nardelli's management credentials, Wall Street analysts expressed some skepticism about his selection. Part of their doubts center on his lack of retailing experience. Further, they said the appointment raised some questions about Mr. Blank's future commitment to Home Depot.
Those doubts were not shared by investors. In after-hours trading, Home Depot shares rose as high as $46.75. The stock ended regular trading at $46, up $5.25 a share.
"This clearly has been in the works for some time, but at the analysts' meeting on the 20th and 21st of November we didn't get any indication that Arthur Blank would be changing his role," said Bonnie Tonneson, a retailing analyst at Chase H&Q in San Francisco. "I don't think this means Arthur is backing away from his commitment to the company, but it is a concern."
Dan Wewer, a managing director at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, said that finding an available executive with extensive retailing experience would have been a difficult undertaking. "One of the big issues that has been affecting retailing for 10 years has been a lack of heavyweights in the executive suite," he said. "Where else would Home Depot find a successor to Arthur Blank? They might as well start at General Electric."
Mr. Nardelli, who started his career at G.E. in 1971, left in 1988 to join the Case Corporation and came back to G.E. in 1991, had a quick answer to a question about his lack of retailing experience. "Coming out of a business that will do $15 billion in revenues this year, you have to be able to sell something," he said.
Home Depot has stumbled this year, victimized by rising lumber prices, a slowing economy and its own expansion, which has made it difficult to meet growth targets.
"Home Depot became a really big company really fast," Mr. Wewer said. "They will do $56 billion in revenues next year, up from $46 billion this year. The law of large numbers is affecting the company."
The other challenge, Mr. Wewer and others said, is the slowing economy.
"They can't do much about that except for focus on cost management," he said. "And General Electric manages expenses and inventories really well."

HEADLINE: Aide Charges Harassment In Milwaukee

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 5

 BODY:
The relationship of Mayor John O. Norquist of Milwaukee with a former aide has been catapulted into the public spotlight, with the aide filing a sexual harassment complaint against the city and the mayor saying they had a consensual extramarital affair.
On Monday the aide, Marilyn Figueroa, a longtime staff aide to Mr. Norquist until last January, filed a complaint with the state Equal Rights Division. She said that the mayor sexually harassed her over a five-year period and that she faced job discrimination when she tried to resist, said her lawyer, Victor Arellano. 
 The complaint has not been made public and Mr. Arellano declined to provide details. But in a statement read by Mr. Arellano on Monday, Ms. Figueroa, who was the mayor's liaison to the Hispanic community, called the mayor an "oppressor" who subjected her to a "very abusive and nonconsensual experience."
On Friday, Mr. Norquist, aware that the complaint was being prepared, gave a public statement acknowledging "a consensual sexual relationship with Marilyn Figueroa, a former staff person in my office, which ended a year ago." With his wife standing by his side, Mr. Norquist, 51, said he was admitting the affair with Ms. Figueroa, who is 41 and divorced, because "there have been repeated threats and attempts to coerce my family economically and emotionally" and "we can no longer tolerate escalating threats and outrageous demands."
He said accusations of "unfair treatment by my office or me" are "groundless," adding, "there has been no harassment and no discrimination."
Mr. Norquist's lawyer, Anne Shindell, said in an interview today that for nearly a year, representatives for Ms. Figueroa have sought a financial payment from the mayor. "The context of the communications with me have been from the beginning, 'pay me money or I'll go public,' " Ms. Shindell said.
Today. Ms. Shindell released a copy of a letter from Mr. Arellano referring to his proposal that "we attempt to put this painful matter to rest for the amount of $275,000 in exchange for a confidential release of all claims." The letter said that although Mr. Arellano had instructed his client to "remain silent" thus far, should a complaint be filed with the state, "all of the details will become public as a matter of law."
Mr. Arellano, in an interview today, said that any suggestion that he or his client were trying to extort money was "atrocious, if not slanderous and inflammatory."
Mr. Norquist, who is the longest-serving mayor of any city with a population over 500,000, was re-elected to a fourth term in April.
In a profile in The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel on Sunday, Ms. Figueroa, who began working for the mayor in 1991, is portrayed as a strong, confident woman who took an active role in organizing everything from voter registration drives to campaigns for improved housing, primarily for Hispanics.
But in her statement about her sexual harassment complaint, she describes herself as overpowered by the "relentless pursuit of a powerful individual over me." She said, "My attempts to break away from the shackles of a very oppressive and controlling sexually harassing environment imposed upon me eventually led to a health-related breakdown."
Ms. Shindell disputed that characterization. "We're talking about in this situation a mature, 41-year-old, executive-level woman who publicly was very aggressive in asserting both her status within that office and her desire to advance within it."
Ms. Shindell said that rather than face job discrimination, Ms. Figueroa declined three promotions that would have taken her out of the mayor's office, the last offer made 60 days before she resigned.
Mr. Norquist said on Friday that his wife of 12 years, Susan Mudd, had been aware of his relationship with Ms. Figueroa "for quite some time, and we are working though this as a couple, committed to each other and our marriage."

HEADLINE: CONTESTING THE VOTE: THE COURTS;
Florida Supreme Court Moves Quickly to Hear Gore Contest of Presidential Election

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Dec. 5

 BODY:
The Florida Supreme Court moved quickly today to set a Thursday hearing for Vice President Al Gore's contest of the presidential election, giving his lawyers what could be their last opportunity to argue the case before the Dec. 12 deadline for naming the state's electors.
The decision to hold another televised hearing before the seven justices raised the possibility that the court could issue a definitive ruling on the case before the weekend. If they rule against Mr. Gore, he and his lawyers have suggested that they might not appeal the decision to the United States Supreme Court. 
 "I do think that it's likely that all of the current controversies will end up being resolved one way or another in the Florida Supreme Court," Mr. Gore said today in Washington. But he left open the possibility that he may wait to decide until several other lawsuits involving absentee ballots are resolved.
If the high court rules in Mr. Gore's favor, the following few days could be filled with a frenzied counting of 14,000 disputed ballots from South Florida, which Democratic lawyers say might contain hidden votes for the vice president. Mr. Bush's lawyers would almost certainly appeal such a decision to the high court in Washington.
Mr. Gore lost his lawsuit to overturn Gov. George W. Bush's victory in the state when Circuit Judge N. Sanders Sauls issued a strongly worded ruling on Monday afternoon that Mr. Gore had not presented sufficient proof. His lawyers immediately filed a notice of appeal, and though they have until noon on Wednesday to file their formal appeal briefs, the Supreme Court moved ahead and announced that oral arguments would be held at 10 a.m. on Thursday. Each side will be given 30 minutes to present its case, half the time allotted during the last elections hearing before the court on the legality of manual recounts.
The court did not definitively say it would take the case, despite the decision to hold a hearing. In its announcement today, the court told lawyers for each side to prepare arguments on why it should take the case on appeal, in addition to arguments on the merits of the case.
Democratic lawyers said there was little distinction between the issues, noting that a decision not to take the appeal would have the same effect as a formal ruling against Mr. Gore. "It's not a big deal," said W. Dexter Douglass, one of the vice president's lawyers here. "When they pass a case through so quickly, they usually ask the lawyers to tell them why it should be under their jurisdiction. It's standard language."
At the same time as both sides were preparing their briefs in the contest case, they also submitted briefs to the Florida Supreme Court today on the ruling handed down by the United States Supreme Court on Monday. Earlier this month, the Florida court had extended the deadline by which the Secretary of State had to accept manual recounts from county election boards, but on Monday the United States court vacated that ruling and sent it back to the Florida court to be rewritten.
The court in Washington said it could not tell if the ruling had been based on the Florida Constitution or on statutes written by the Florida Legislature. The issue is crucial, because many interpretations of federal law say that only state legislatures, through their laws, can set the rules for the selection of a state's presidential electors. Under that interpretation, a state constitution can have no say in the matter.
Mr. Gore's legal brief, as expected, urged the Florida court to re-enter its ruling and clarify that it made its decision based on an interpretation of the state's election laws, not the constitution.
"This court did not -- as the U.S. Supreme Court worried -- rely upon the Florida Constitution to circumscribe the Legislature's authority to establish a method for the selection of electors, under the United States Constitution," the Gore brief said. "This court's discussion of the Florida Constitution merely confirmed that its statutory interpretation was consistent with the principles of that Constitution."
Mr. Bush's team suggested the court simply drop its ruling and revert to a trial judge's ruling that Secretary of State Katherine Harris was within her rights to certify the election without the manual counts. But Republican lawyers also had another suggestion they said was better: the court should simply turn down Mr. Gore's appeal of the contest, and then it would not have to take up the earlier case at all.
If the court is forbidden by the United States Constitution to extend the deadline for the manual counts -- which the Bush team argues is the real import of the United States Supreme Court ruling on Monday -- then by the same principle, it cannot allow a counting of dimpled ballots in only a few counties, the Bush brief argues. To do so would be to change state election law in the same illegal manner as the earlier ruling, the brief says.
If the court dismisses Mr. Gore's appeal of the contest first, the Bush brief says, the earlier case sent back by the Supreme Court in Washington will be moot, because the same Republican electors will be sent to the Electoral College. In that case, says the brief, "judicial economy will be served and this court will avoid the complex federal and constitutional issues implicated in this remanded case. And, of course, the period of uncertainty and instability regarding Florida's participation in the presidential election will be brought to an end and final resolution will be achieved for the 2000 presidential election."
Republican state legislators also filed a brief with the Florida court urging it to drop its earlier ruling and impose the original deadlines for the manual counts. The Legislature, not the court, has the power to choose the presidential electors of the state, the brief said, and such a ruling would allow the state to avoid a confrontation between the two branches.
"Plainly it would be far more preferable if this court could avoid any arguable changes in law and resolve all contests before Dec. 12, 2000, so that legislative action becomes unnecessary," the Legislature's brief says.
But Democratic leaders in the state's House and Senate sent letters to the court reminding the justices that the Republicans do not speak for the entire Legislature.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
A Man Who Likes His Quiet Comes to the Big, Noisy City

BYLINE: By BUSTER OLNEY 

DATELINE: MONTOURSVILLE, Pa., Dec. 4

 BODY:
Stepping between the 40-foot pines surrounding his house, Mike Mussina is 15 minutes from Divine Providence. That's the hospital where he was born, and the Little League field on which he played is even closer, 10 minutes if you obey the speed limit. It takes eight minutes to get to the house where his parents live, where he sought isolation as a child, in this isolated town.
Everything Mussina needs is contained within these boundaries, and he cannot foresee a time in his life when that will change -- and he abhors change, as his family knows. He can live anywhere now, and he is here, where there is one movie theater and three sub shops. Mussina planted more pine trees around his house last year, and when they are middle-aged he will be here, moving snow and grass and probably coaching at the high school where he was coached, nine minutes away. 
 There is stability here, predictability. Those traits do not apply to New York City, where Mussina has committed to spend the next six years of his baseball career, as a pitcher for the Yankees, for $88.5 million.
He will inevitably hear boos at Yankee Stadium, like every player from Ruth to DiMaggio to Mantle to Rivera. He will hear sirens from the dugout and see fires over the center-field horizon.
There is almost no sound on a windless, cold day where Mussina lives -- only the faint hum from I-180 several miles away, and from Broad Street, the two-lane road that runs through the center of Montoursville (population 4,983). Many streets here are named for trees, the intersections and houses built on straight lines and right angles. A boy riding his bicycle across town, perhaps to Indian Park, is recognized by neighbors who know his parents, or at least know of them; there are two degrees of separation in Montoursville. In 1996, 16 students and 5 chaperones from the Montoursville High French Club were killed on T.W.A. Flight 800, and the community was devastated.
When something is out of place in Montoursville, you can tell right away, Mussina's father said earlier this week.
Big Mike returned from his law practice at 6 o'clock every night. He was home on weekends, and he played catch with his two sons in the backyard. Ellie and Big Mike Mussina were awaken on Saturday mornings by loud thumping from the basement, where Little Mike threw a ball against a wall, aiming at a box he made with tape, rattling a radiator when he missed badly.
But he was usually pretty good, starring in Little League. Williamsport is only a few miles away, so the Mussinas attended the Little League World Series most years, and Big Mike thought it prudent to prepare Little Mike for the reality that there were a lot of other children who were pretty good at baseball.
"There must be 10,000 kids who do what you do," Big Mike said when the boy was 11.
"I don't think there are," Little Mike responded.
A year later, Big Mike stopped playing catch with his son because he simply threw too hard.
Little Mike was perfectly comfortable throwing alone, or kicking a football up and down an empty field, or shooting baskets alone. If a friend called Mike and asked him to go somewhere, that was fine, Ellie Mussina recalled. But Mike was never going to pick up the phone; he hated talking on the phone.
His brother Mark, younger by three years, was and is completely different, a social magnet. When Mark was in the fifth grade, he came home and announced that he would be the student council president when he was in eighth grade. Those words caromed off Mike, who was already in the eighth grade and locked into his reserve.
"Sometimes I wish I could be like that," Mike said to his mother.
The three students with the highest grade-point averages are designated to speak at the Montoursville High graduation. Mike finished fourth and was pleased. He hated the thought of standing before a large group of people and talking, his attention directed on them and their response, their attention on him.
But playing sports, pitching -- somehow that became much different to him. He starred in football and basketball and baseball, and he didn't care if hundreds or even thousands of people were watching him. Three balls and two strikes, two outs, game on the line, it didn't matter. For Mike Mussina, it wasn't any different than all those hours he had spent alone in the basement.
"I'm still by myself when I'm on the mound," Mussina said today at his home here. "It's still me against that guy at the plate. I know I'm good enough to beat him, so I'm going to beat him. So that was it. It's just me doing something that I'm comfortable doing.
"I know what I'm doing. Some days I'm going to win, some days I'm going to lose. But I know the right thing to do. I know how to go about it, and in the long run, I'm going to come out ahead."
He wanted to get better at baseball, to find someplace that gave him the best chance to excel. His mother was shocked when Little Mike -- who had almost never left Montoursville in his lifetime -- chose to attend Stanford University, in California, where he could play baseball year-round.
"It was great, and I got everything out of it that I wanted to get out of it," he said. "If I could've played another year, I would have."
But he graduated in three years with a degree in economics, was drafted by the Orioles in 1990 and signed -- a fellow Montoursville alum, Tom O'Malley, hooked him up with an agent, Arn Tellem, who is also from Pennsylvania. Mussina was in the big leagues with Baltimore the next year.
At the Yankees' news conference to announce his signing last week, Mussina appeared stunned by the volume of cameras flashing continually, and he paused a couple of times to remark that surely the photographers had enough pictures. He folded his arms across his chest occasionally as he spoke, staring at the ground several times, seemingly unsure of where he might focus his eyes. Nothing in Montoursville causes this kind of discomfort for him. He is never this uncertain when he is pitching.
He will probably never fully embrace the idea of living in the New York area. Mussina went to Yankee Stadium as a boy, and his feelings of wariness mirrored his father's: too many cars, too many people, too many buildings. Too much. He worked out for the Yankees at the Stadium when he was a junior in high school, and somebody backed into the Mussinas' station wagon, confirming their image of a reckless city.
The Orioles stayed in Manhattan when they came to play the Yankees, and while Mussina rode the subway to the Bronx, he almost never left his hotel room. At the time he filed for free agency, his father did not think there was a chance Mussina would sign with the Yankees.
But Yankees Manager Joe Torre called first, and Andy Pettitte and other Yankees phoned as well. Mussina mentioned to his parents how honored he was that they felt he could help them, after the Yankees had had so much success. Methodical and resolute in how he makes decisions, Mussina eventually began to draw a parallel to the decision he made in choosing Stanford as a high school senior: if he wanted to take his baseball career to the next level, he was going to have to make a change. If he wanted to play with the best, he was going to have to go someplace totally unfamiliar, someplace completely different from Montoursville.
"When Baltimore dragged this out so long and never did anything," he said, "and they changed the offer only slightly but nothing to really stand up and take notice, I made up my mind: if I'm going to go, then I'm going to go to the place that gives me the best opportunity to go to the playoffs and win. At the start, I never thought it would be the Yankees. It wasn't that I didn't want to go to New York, it's just that I didn't think the Yankees would call -- and they called first, and most often."
Roger Clemens called Mussina last week, the night Mussina signed with the Yankees, talking rapidly for 30 minutes, excitedly, about how thrilled he was that the Yankees added such an established pitcher and how he couldn't wait for spring training. Mussina, who has a career record of 147-81, has never been a part of a World Series winner, and Clemens said the veterans would be driven by the prospect of winning a ring for him.
"Now I get to go to a three-time defending world champion," Mussina said, "with an M.V.P.-caliber shortstop, M.V.P.-caliber center fielder, Hall of Famer in the rotation, the best closer in the American League, postseason experience, one of the best managers in the game, and 53 years of Don Zimmer."
Mussina will probably live in Westchester County or Connecticut. Wary that his commuting would be lengthened by delays on the George Washington Bridge, he does not want to live in New Jersey.
"He just needs to be respected by his neighbors," his father said. "I think his feelings are: 'If you drive by on the street, wave to me, but don't shove three baseballs in my face to sign for you. Pay as much attention to me as your other neighbors.' That's the difference between whether he likes it or not."
Mussina will be 37 when his contract with the Yankees expires, and he might play a few more years. Or he could retire, perhaps with numbers that will qualify him for the Hall of Fame, and certainly with enough money to live anywhere.
But he will live here, in a house on a hill protected by a forest of pine trees, with the gymnasium recently finished. This is where his children will grow up, in the same place where he grew up, where his wife was raised, where his parents live, in the middle of nowhere, 15 minutes from everything.

Cheney Gets Vulgar

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
It has become fashionable to say that if and when George W. Bush makes it to the White House, Dick Cheney will be the de facto president. This may be unfair -- or it may be wishful thinking. But in any case it was Mr. Cheney, speaking last weekend, who gave us our first post-election hints about Mr. Bush's economic policy. And the news is not good.
Mr. Cheney suggested -- with more confidence in his forecast than any professional economist I know -- that we face a looming recession. And this, he argued, means that we should press ahead with that $1.6 trillion tax cut. 
 Why is this bad news? Let me count the ways.
First, on their face Mr. Cheney's remarks were those of a vulgar Keynesian -- a believer in the now-discredited doctrine that taxes and spending should be routinely twiddled in an attempt to "fine-tune" the economy. Decades of experience shows that this is a bad idea, that when governments try to fight garden-variety recessions by cutting taxes or increasing spending they almost always get it wrong. By the time Congress has finished negotiating who gets what, and puts the new law into effect, the recession is usually past -- and the fiscal stimulus arrives just when it is least needed.
Fiscal pump-priming has its place; it's appropriate in the face of deep and persistent slumps. But otherwise we should make budgets for the long run, and let the Fed deal with short-run problems by adjusting interest rates. It's disturbing that Mr. Cheney seems unaware of this basic policy rule.
Mr. Cheney's argument also sounds strange when one recalls that during the campaign Mr. Bush's advisers made a point of arguing that his tax cuts wouldn't pump up demand. Most notably, his economic guru Lawrence Lindsey declared that tax cuts wouldn't further overheat a booming economy, because they would be phased in only gradually. How gradually? Mr. Lindsey declared that "no one knows what the economic circumstances will be in 2004 or 2005." (What he didn't point out was that while promises of future tax cuts probably won't fuel today's consumer spending, bond traders take a longer view. Realizing that the government will pay off less debt, they will immediately drive up long-term interest rates, depressing investment.)
But let me not accuse Messrs. Cheney and Bush of inconsistency. I don't really believe that they are vulgar Keynesians. They may advocate tax cuts when the economy is down, alleging that this will perk it up; but they also advocate tax cuts during booms. So they are perfectly consistent: they always want to cut taxes. Only the sales pitch changes with the state of the economy.
And that is the more serious bad news in Mr. Cheney's remarks: They suggest that the administration-in-waiting is not at all chastened by the questionable nature of its victory.
Many have argued that Mr. Bush, having lost the popular vote and won Florida (if he has) in a way that leaves his legitimacy in doubt, will try to calm the nation with centrist policies. Among other things, it is often assumed that those huge tax breaks for the rich that were the centerpiece of Mr. Bush's campaign are now on hold. Indeed, The Economist, which endorsed Mr. Bush and continues to cling to the belief that he is more moderate than his party, has even suggested -- in what strikes me as delusional thinking -- that he might keep the austerity-minded Lawrence Summers on as Treasury secretary. But now Mr. Cheney has signaled that he and Mr. Bush are as inclined as ever to push for big, irresponsible tax cuts.
And they may get them. Congress always has a hard time resisting calls to give away the store. It will be especially hard to maintain discipline after new budget projections are released next month. Because these projections will assume a higher rate of growth, and will not yet have factored in the revenue effects of slumping stock prices and the growth effects of declining technology investment, they will create a false sense that there is plenty of money to give away. Add a specious recession-fighting rationale and the temptation may be irresistible.
Some people have taken comfort from the fact that Mr. Bush will be a president without a mandate. But a president doesn't need a mandate to do a lot of economic damage.

HEADLINE: Security Council Lets Iraq Spend Oil Fund

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 5

 BODY:
After a day of hard bargaining, a divided Security Council agreed tonight to give Iraq new leeway in spending the billions of dollars in oil proceeds accumulating in this period of high oil prices.
At the center of the package, incorporated in a six-month renewal of the Iraqi "oil for food" program, is a provision pushed by France and other supporters of Iraq that will allow the release to the Iraqis of 600 million euros, or $525 million, to spend locally on repairing and maintaining their oil industry. Council members also agreed unanimously to expand the list of goods that Iraq will be allowed to import without seeking approval from a Council sanctions committee. 
 But Iraq will remain under United Nations monitoring and supervision, especially in deciding how the cash will be spent on oil installations. Those guarantees allowed the United States, the last holdout tonight, to support the resolution.
"Nobody suggested putting the 600 million euros into an unsupervised account," said Ambassador James B. Cunningham, the American representative on the Council who deals with Iraq. He said Secretary General Kofi Annan would be making proposals on how that money and an unspecified sum of cash for relief goods could be spent in Iraq.
"We feel that it's not a bad outcome," Mr. Cunningham said.
The debate over changes in the oil-sales program, which was originally devised to provide basic goods for Iraqi civilians who have been living under a decade of stringent sanctions, pitted the United States, and to some extent Britain, against the French.
The Americans argued against loosening restrictions on Iraq, while the French saw opportunities in the oil-sales plan and in a coming debate over arms inspections to produce some movement on the Iraq issue by offering the Iraqis some incentives.
The French and other Council members have apparently concluded that whoever becomes president of the United States next month will be too preoccupied with other issues to focus on Iraq and that American policy could continue to drift as it has for more than two years. There have been no arms inspections since 1998 and, therefore, no hope of removing sanctions.
In that period, however, rising oil prices have given President Saddam Hussein a lot of money to spend, and contractors have flocked to Iraq to offer goods and services under the United Nations program, helping to end Mr. Hussein's isolation. Since December 1996, when the "oil for food" program went into effect, Iraq has sold more than $37 billion in oil. Oil is also being smuggled out of the country, with profits going directly to Mr. Hussein and his circle, American officials say.
Iraq has made deductions for a fund to compensate victims of the 1990 invasion of Kuwait -- which have now been lowered to 25 from 30 percent of profits -- and has paid set-asides for programs in Kurdish areas. Still, Baghdad has been left with $19 billion from the United Nations program to buy a wide range of civilian goods like food, medicine and educational and agricultural equipment.
As of Nov. 30, $4.7 billion remained unspent, United Nations supervisors say. They are encouraging Iraqis to spend more on their poorest citizens.
Today, in considering what goods to add to the list of approved imports, the Council split over a French plan to include telecommunications and transportation equipment, as well as electrical goods and housing supplies. In a compromise, electrical equipment and housing supplies were added to the list.
But telecommunications and transportation items were mentioned as something to be considered in the future. The United States has been wary of supplying Iraq with any sophisticated equipment or heavy machinery that could fall into the hands of the military.
Iraqis also wanted to spend some of the windfall on projects as diverse as paying back dues to the United Nations or supplying help to the Palestinians who are battling the Israelis in Gaza and the West Bank. The dues payment was left open to consideration. But the request for money for the Palestinians never made it to serious discussion.
The Council worked all day against a midnight deadline to renew the oil-sales program. By midday, the tradeoffs in the 15-member Council had begun. The United States dropped calls for more attention to smuggling, which the French, Russians and Chinese opposed. The French agreed to a shorter list of unrestricted Iraqi purchases and to a link between spending cash locally on relief goods, as well as maintaining the oil industry.
United Nations officials have recommended that more cash be spent in Iraq on items like food and educational services, injecting money into the local economy. Iraq has refused, and it has barred a panel of experts from visiting to make a feasibility study.
"It always becomes in the end the lowest common denominator," Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the British representative, said of the debate today. "The denominator drops until you reach consensus or a minimum of nine votes."
In the last few days, Iraq has been sending mixed signals on the stalemate over oil prices that brought exports to a standstill.
Last week, Iraq stopped pumping and exporting oil, after the United Nations had said Iraq could not lower the price to offset a surcharge of 50 cents a barrel that Baghdad's national oil company wanted to impose on buyers outside the supervised system. Today, Iraq said the surcharge was never official policy. No oil purchaser had agreed to pay the extra charge in contravention of United Nations rules.
The Iraqis and United Nations officials who are running the oil program gave conflicting accounts about where the dispute over the price of Iraqi oil stood. The Iraqis said they were in talks with United Nations overseers in the country about a "compromise." In New York, officials said they knew of no such talks.
Until United Nations oil officials and the Iraqis agree on a price for exports, sales are effectively suspended. A spokesman for the United Nations, Fred Eckhard, said no oil had been exported from Iraq since Thursday night.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Says Fed Would Act To Ease a Slide

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan signaled today that the Federal Reserve was finished for now with raising interest rates to slow the economy, and he set off a big rally on Wall Street by making clear that he stands ready to cut rates should the nation show any signs of heading toward recession.
After months in which investors have become increasingly pessimistic -- and after Gov. George W. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, publicly raised the possibility of an economic downturn ahead -- Mr. Greenspan's comments seemed intended to reassure the markets and the country that the Fed would step in as needed to keep the 10-year-old expansion going. 
 Stock prices surged after his remarks in a speech in New York to a conference sponsored by the trade group for the savings and loan industry. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 338.62 points, or 3.2 percent, to 10,898.72, its third-biggest point gain ever. The Nasdaq jumped 274.05 points, or 10.5 percent, to 2,889.80, its biggest gain to date in both percentage and point terms.
In his speech, Mr. Greenspan, who was reappointed Federal Reserve chairman earlier this year, said there was still some risk of inflation, especially from high energy prices.
But in his clearest terms yet, he acknowledged the possibility that the economic slowdown the Fed has helped engineer through a series of interest rate increases could deteriorate into a downturn that would end the longest period of growth without a recession on record.
Analysts said it was unlikely that the Fed would actually cut rates as soon as its next meeting on Dec. 19. If rates are to be reduced, it would almost certainly not be until next year, they said, and then only if the economy showed continued signs of slowing.
Mr. Greenspan's speech, and interviews in recent days with other Fed officials, suggest that at its next meeting, the central bank's policy-setting committee, will drop its policy bias toward higher rates. Instead, it is expected to move to a "neutral" position that the risks of inflation are no greater than the risks of the economy's stalling.
"The Fed chairman seemed to confirm that the Fed will switch to a neutral directive at its Dec. 19 meeting, with the possibility of easing in the new year if financial conditions tighten further and the economy looks like it is easing too much," said James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at J. P. Morgan.
Seeking to squeeze any inflation pressures out of a red-hot economy, the Fed has raised its benchmark federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks by 1.75 percentage points in six steps since June 1999, to 6.5 percent. The last increase was in May, when it raised the rate half a percentage point.
Tighter monetary policy has played a role in causing the stock market to swoon this year and in prodding banks to stiffen their lending standards. At the same time, the bond market has been making it more difficult for all but the most financially stable of companies to raise money.
Economic indicators the last few months have shown that growth has slowed abruptly and now appears to be running at or below a 3 percent annual pace, a full percentage point below what most economists think it is capable of sustaining without generating inflation.
In the latest sign of the slowdown, factory orders fell 3.3 percent in October, the first decline in three months, the Commerce Department reported today.
There are signs that the unemployment rate is creeping up from its current low level of 3.9 percent, reducing the chances of a sharp rise in wages that might ignite inflation.
For now, the improvement in productivity, or output per hour, appears to be holding up, a development that should also help hold down inflation pressures.
"For some time, growth in aggregate demand exceeded even the productivity-enhanced expansion of potential supply," Mr. Greenspan said. "More recently, though, the pace of expansion of economic activity has moderated appreciably, in part as tighter financial conditions have had some impact on interest-sensitive areas of the economy."
Mr. Greenspan said financial conditions had not reached the point of a crisis, as they did in 1998, when the Fed had to cut rates in the wake of the global financial panic that spread from Asia to Latin America and Russia.
But he said the Fed had to be wary of potential problems.
"In periods of transition from unsustainable to more modest rates of growth, an economy is obviously at increased risk of untoward events that would be readily absorbed in a period of boom," Mr. Greenspan said.
With the economy losing momentum, he said, "one must remain alert to the possibility that greater caution and weakening asset values in financial markets could signal or precipitate an excessive softening in household and business spending."
Mr. Greenspan generally tries to telegraph to investors any change in the Fed's monetary policy stance. But in this case he may also have been trying to keep the pessimistic mood that has permeated the markets recently from setting off a downward spiral of reduced expectations among investors, business executives and consumers.
"What separates a soft landing from a recession is the ability to modulate the expectations of investors, consumers and businesses without having them fall off the face of the earth," said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at ABN Amro.
"Greenspan seems to have sensed the shift in the national mood," he added, "and decided that while it might be a while before the Fed actually eases, that there was some need for immediate psychological therapy."
Mr. Greenspan concentrated his remarks on two potential concerns: the possibility of a credit shortage and the risk that households and businesses might stop spending.
On both fronts he noted difficulties, but stopped far short of concluding that they would require lower rates.
He said it had become harder for companies, particularly start-ups and riskier ventures, to raise money this year and warned that bankers should not overdo their push for tighter lending standards. But in essence he told investors not to expect lower rates just on that basis, because one of the goals of Fed policy is to rein in excessive risk-taking.
"Financial markets have continued to function reasonably well, and credit continues to flow, although admittedly with reduced availability to less-than-investment-grade borrowers and at interest spreads sufficiently elevated to press on profit margins of those lower-rated borrowers," he said.
Among businesses, he said, there was still optimism about profit growth and a sense that it remained worthwhile to invest in new cost-saving equipment.
With stock's having fallen substantially this year, consumer spending is letting up, he said. But surveys of consumers show that confidence has generally held up well, despite some mixed signals in recent months. All this suggests consumer spending is more likely to continue at a moderate pace than to fall precipitously.

HEADLINE: Once More, California Comes Close to Running Out of Electricity

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 5

 BODY:
For the second time in as many days, power companies today were forced to shut down electricity to customers statewide as California came the closest it has this season to running out of power, state officials said.
As late as tonight, energy officials were concerned that they would be forced to announce a last-resort emergency as power reserves crept close to a dangerous level of 1.5 percent, and utility companies would have been required to institute rolling hourlong blackouts in various parts of the state. Such last-resort steps have never been taken in California before. 
 On Monday, Californians were urged to postpone turning on Christmas lights until later in the evening as use hit near record levels for this time of year.
Then, as today, state officials declared an intermediate-level emergency, which meant power reserves dipped to 5 percent and utilities began cutting service to large customers who had agreed to the cuts in exchange for lower rates. In a Stage 3 emergency, the worst situation, any customer's service can be shut off.
"We are riding the edge right now," said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman for the California Independent System Operator, which manages the electricity system for 75 percent of the state and charged with ensuring that there is enough power for users. "This will only get tougher."
Mr. Dorinson said the shortfall was the result of several factors, including the fact that a number of power plants were not running because of maintenance or would have violated air quality standards if they had. Additionally, power imports from the Northwest were cut in half because of a cold snap there, he said.
Californians have been plagued since last May by both an electricity supply shortage as well as high prices, the result of deregulation. Consumers in San Diego revolted last summer when electricity bills nearly tripled and when officials said the state had severe energy shortfalls 23 times. But emergencies like the one this week are almost unheard of in late fall when usage is usually low compared with summer.
"If you have rolling blackouts, that shows that the system is failing," said Paul Jaskow, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has studied the deregulation of California's electricity market. Before deregulation, he added, "the system was designed so that this happened rarely. If it happens repeatedly businesses and customers will get angry."
Steve Maviglio, the press secretary for Gov. Gray Davis, said: "It is the perfect storm of the energy situation in California. This is Day 1 of what is to be a two-week problem."

RUSSIAN BANKING PARTNERSHIPS

BYLINE: By Sabrina Tavernise 

 BODY:
Russia's struggling banking sector got a vote of confidence from the United States Export-Import Bank, which introduced a program of partnerships with 15 Russian banks. The banks, mostly private, will guarantee payment on Russian companies' purchases of American-made equipment. Russia's weak and largely unregulated banking sector still awaits a promised revamping after the financial collapse of 1998. Sabrina Tavernise (NYT)

HEADLINE: Cutting Flights at La Guardia May Not Mean Fewer Delays

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
Despite a lottery held on Monday that will essentially reduce the number of flights at La Guardia Airport, there is no guarantee that travelers will see an end to the overcrowding and delays that have become common there, industry officials said yesterday.
"In the short term, I'm not sure what changes you'll actually see," said Bill DeCota, director of aviation for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates La Guardia. "It's impossible to predict." 
 The problem, officials say, is that while the number of flights will be reduced by about 150 a day, La Guardia will continue to operate beyond capacity, handling around 1,200 flights a day. The next goal, experts say, is finding a long-term answer.
"This is a temporary measure, and the intent is to relieve the congestion that we are now experiencing," said James Peters, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. "While this proposal is in effect, we will work with the Port and the airline carriers to come up with a long-term solution." Part of that solution could include administrative options like further limits on flights and "market based" measures like additional landing fees.
Even the breathing space achieved by the cutbacks Monday is only temporary. The revised schedule will remain in effect only until Sept. 15, when officials hope to have a more permanent solution in place.
While La Guardia has always been one of the nation's busiest airports, congestion there has become particularly acute since April, after Congress lifted flight restrictions in an effort to encourage air service to smaller communities, like Buffalo and Knoxville, Tenn., that had been ignored by most airlines. From April 5 to Nov. 1, the number of flights rose to 1,344 from 1,064, and the F.A.A. predicted that the number would have increased to 1,395 in January without the cutbacks.
Because of the crowding, the Port Authority put a moratorium on new flights, and came up with the lottery to reallocate those added since April. In the lottery, held in Washington by the Federal Aviation Administration, 13 airlines competed for 159 landing or takeoff slots.
Because of the way the lottery was arranged, new or smaller airlines like Midwest Express will keep the same number of flights, although they may be scheduled for different times, but regional subsidiaries of major airlines like Delta and US Airways will lose more than 60 flights each.
Representatives at those airlines said that it was premature to say precisely how their schedules would be affected, but that they would have to reduce some new services. The airlines will have to adjust their schedules by the end of January.
"Obviously, we'll be reviewing our schedules as quickly as possible," said Russ Williams, a Delta spokesman. Mr. Williams added that the airline needed to get through this "shakeout period" and explore various options, including swapping slots with other airlines, before announcing any changes. Mr. DeCota suggested that airlines could consolidate flights to major markets to retain added regional service.
As for long-term solutions, Mr. DeCota said that many economists supported treating La Guardia as a scarce resource subject to market forces. In a market-driven situation, fees could vary in a number of ways: airlines that operate the most during busy times could be charged higher overall fees, or airlines could be charged different fees for using more or less congested time slots.
Currently, all airlines at La Guardia are charged landing fees based on an arcane formula: the historical cost of providing airport facilities and infrastructure divided by the weight of the aircraft.
"It's the equivalent of charging rent based on what it cost to build a building in 1964 divided by the number of occupants in the apartment," Mr. DeCota said. "It doesn't reflect the real value of landing at the airfield."
Testifying yesterday before the House Transportation subcommittee on aviation, Louise E. Maillett, a policy administrator at the F.A.A., said that the increased volume of traffic was the No. 1 cause of delays at La Guardia, and that those delays affected arrivals and departures at airports across the country.
Richard Marchi, a senior vice president at Airports Council International, a trade organization, said that in light of La Guardia's crowding, the question for the aviation industry was: "How do you protect service to the smaller communities without overwhelming the system?"
"That's something the F.A.A. really needs to look at," he said.
Mr. Marchi suggested that any long-term solution had to take all flights into account, not just the ones to smaller cities. "There's no process by which someone gets to decide that 2 trips to Chattanooga are more valuable than 20 flights to somewhere else," he said.

HEADLINE: Lockheed Martin Offered State Aid; Faces Racism Claims on Separate Front

 BODY:
Gov. Christie Whitman announced a $64 million business assistance package yesterday to help Lockheed Martin Corporation, one of South Jersey's biggest employers, win a contract to help develop the next generation of Navy destroyers.
But word of the package coincided with a separate announcement yesterday that the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was joining two class-action lawsuits charging widespread racism at Lockheed Martin sites outside New Jersey, raising concerns among some minority leaders in the state. 
 Under a deal contingent on Lockheed's being awarded the Navy contract, the company would receive a $15 million cash grant, plus income and sales tax benefits worth $9 million, spread over 10 years.
The rest of the deal involves the state's spending $40 million to build a 420,000-square-foot research center at Lockheed's 405-acre site along Route 295 in Moorestown, N.J. Lockheed would lease 300,000 square feet of the new center, which the state would also make available to other defense or technology companies.
The deal was negotiated by the New Jersey Commerce and Economic Growth Commission in conjunction with the governor's office, and must be approved by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, which administers the state's economic incentive packages. The $15 million grant is part of a new state economic development program now before the State Legislature.
The entire deal will be off if Lockheed, which is based in Bethesda, Md., and its partner, Bath Iron Works of Bath, Me., lose the bidding to a partnership led by the Raytheon Company of Lexington, Mass.
"It's entirely contingent upon it," Charles E. Hance, the state commerce secretary, said of the assistance package. "The hope is, it will make the Navy, the U.S. government, more inclined to award the contract to Lockheed."
The companies are seeking contracts for the design and integration of weapons systems on the Navy's proposed DD-21 destroyer, which would replace the Aegis destroyer that 2,000 Lockheed employees and 1,000 other military and civilian workers in Moorestown now work on. If the grant legislation is approved, the $15 million would still be contingent on Lockheed's retaining those 2,000 employees and hiring 500 others at the site, Mr. Hance said.
Tomorrow is the deadline for the bidders to submit cost proposals to the Navy, which is expected to award the weapons contract in March.
Also yesterday, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said it would intervene in federal court on behalf of two private lawsuits involving allegations by black Lockheed employees in Georgia. The employees allege they were subject to racial slurs and other forms of discrimination, and then to intimidation after complaining. In a statement, the E.E.O.C. chairwoman, Ida L. Castro, accused the company of "persistent failure to respond to the systemic discrimination."
The E.E.O.C.'s New York district director, Spencer Lewis, said, "Neither the Lockheed plaintiffs nor the E.E.O.C. will tolerate racial harassment, particularly when the harassment goes so far as to become corporate policy."
James Fetig, a Lockheed spokesman, said that the company denied the allegations "in total," and that Lockheed had offered to submit to mediation, but lawyers for the 11 employees at the company's Marietta, Ga., site declined the offer.
Mr. Hance said he was unfamiliar with the allegations and declined to comment on them. Two telephone requests to Mrs. Whitman's press office to address the allegations were not returned.
While there were no charges of racism at the Moorestown site in the lawsuits or from the E.E.O.C., the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, executive director of the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey, said that he was disturbed by the E.E.O.C.'s suggestion of a racist corporate policy, and that he would look into the matter further. State Assemblyman LeRoy J. Jones Jr., a member of the Legislature's Black and Latino Caucus, said the Whitman administration had a responsibility to ensure that companies receiving state money were free of racism, particularly in light of the state's problems with racial profiling of minority drivers.
"We don't want to be condoning anything that might be reminiscent of what we might call corporate racial profiling," Mr. Jones said.

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
Turning an Alley Into a Jewel

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
They've put the stone back in Stone Street.
For half of its entire length -- that is to say, two blocks -- one of the oldest roads on Manhattan Island has just been resurfaced with chunky Deer Isle granite paving blocks bordered by smooth New York bluestone sidewalks. 
 "This street has such historic consequence," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, which undertook the newly completed $1.8 million streetscape renovation. "But it was really a back alley filled with graffiti, a garbage pit; used for low-level drug dealing."
It seems like only three and a half centuries ago that they were saying much the same thing along Stone Street. In a petition to the burgomasters of Nieuw Amsterdam in 1655, residents of what was then Brewers' Street asserted that it was "becoming more and more unfit for public use." Their answer? "Pave the said street with round stone on the first favorable opportunity."
Though Stone Street is often called the oldest paved street in New York, the 1655 petition said the cobblestone project ought to "follow the general rule relative to paving," suggesting strongly that it was not the first.
This time, the stones are intended to spur commercial investment.
The alliance, which runs the Lower Manhattan Business Improvement District, is trying to break an impasse that has long hampered redevelopment of the low-rise patch between Hanover Square and Broad Street into what could be a beguiling enclave, a mix of sober counting houses from the early 19th century and fanciful evocations of the Dutch Renaissance and Tudor England.
While the government waited for the Stone Street landlords to do something, they waited for the government. "The owners said, 'Why should we fix up our buildings when the city hasn't maintained the streets and sidewalks around our buildings?' " said Suzanne O'Keefe, vice president for design at the alliance. "The infrastructure was in terrible shape."
About 23,000 new paving blocks have been installed, along with lampposts that look like gas lights, in a project that is supposed to turn a back alley into a jewel, Mr. Weisbrod said, "a little engine that could.
"Very much a little engine."
Little known, too, even though it is a stone's throw from Bowling Green and the New York Stock Exchange. Contributing to its isolation, Stone Street was closed between Coenties Alley and Broad Street in the 1980's to permit construction of the giant Goldman Sachs headquarters at 85 Broad Street.
In a novel concession, the crooked path of Stone Street was retraced in 4-by-4-inch tiles through the lobby of 85 Broad Street as a public amenity. But last year, Goldman Sachs installed security turnstiles at either end, with the city's permission, according to a new study, "Privately Owned Public Space."
In time, Stone Street's remove from Wall Street bustle may be one of its chief charms, drawing residents as well as tourists and investment bankers.
Encouraged by the streetscape project, several owners said they would undertake their own renovations in the Stone Street Historic District, which includes Pearl and South William Streets, Mill Lane and Coenties Alley. The district was designated in 1996 by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in concert with the alliance's streetscape project.
The former Lehman Brothers annex, a lacy, Gothic building at 9 South William Street, has already reopened as the 46-room Wall Street Inn.
Early next year, Goldman Properties plans to open the Wall Street Kitchen Express at 17 South William Street, a takeout version of its four-year-old Wall Street Kitchen and Bar at 70 Broad Street. Goldman will also open a jewelry store called Fragments at 53 Stone Street.
In the spring, Goldman plans to open Joey & Tony's, a 200- to 300-seat Italian-style grill that will use Stone Street itself as part of the setting in warm weather, taking advantage of the fact that the street is now closed to traffic every day from 10 a.m. until 2 the next morning.
At 15 South William Street, Goldman Properties will open Gold, a multilevel Champagne bar and cocktail lounge serving tapas, or appetizers. It will cater to the Wall Street crowd on weeknights but also have Saturday hours.
"We feel the future of Stone Street is a day-and-night, seven-day-a-week destination," said C. Joey Goldman, a partner in Goldman Properties. By "we," he was including his father, Tony, who heads Goldman Properties; his mother, Janet, who runs Fragments, now at 107 Greene Street (next door to the family's SoHo Kitchen and Bar); and his wife, Thea, who helped him design Gold.
Another important family operation in the district is that of Harry and Adrienne Poulakakos. For 28 years, they have run Harry's at Hanover Square in the lower floors of the landmark India House, which overlooks the square, between Stone and Pearl Streets.
Two years ago, they opened Bayard's restaurant upstairs at India House, which has been very well received. Run by their son, Peter, Bayard's serves dinners only, as India House is still used at midday as a private club. The family also owns 58 Stone Street, next to India House.
Next year, they plan to open restaurants or stores in 7,500 square feet of space. Mr. Poulakakos imagines serving light fare and, like the Goldmans, spreading out onto Stone Street itself on nice days.
About the streetscape project, Mrs. Poulakakos said: "For our old customers, it didn't matter. But when you want to attract new people, these things become important. Residential people walk around. They look at their surroundings much differently than business people."
A residential conversion is planned at the other end of the district, in a Tudor-style building once known as Block Hall and more recently as the Italian Alps restaurant. It faces Coenties Alley, South William and Stone Streets.
The developer is Steven M. Varsano, who is a partner in the Roebling Building, 169 Hudson Street, between Laight and Vestry Streets, another residential conversion.
All the projects will be subject to review by the landmarks commission, as part of what Mr. Weisbrod called "the strategy of holding out the carrot of economic development to owners who were, for the most part, wary of historic preservation."
The streetscape renovation was designed by the RBA Group and Signe Nielsen Landscape Architecture. The contractor was a joint venture, Rosewood Contracting Corporation/A.F.C. Enterprises Inc. Financing came from New York City ($850,000), the federal government ($800,000) and the alliance ($150,000).
The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, owners of 85 Broad Street, and Goldman, Sachs & Company, whose headquarters are there, also undertook a $350,000 renovation of Coenties Alley, along the east side of the tower.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 16, 2000, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 6 about the revitalization of Stone Street in Lower Manhattan referred imprecisely to access through the Goldman, Sachs headquarters at 85 Broad Street, built on a closed section of Stone Street. Though a security turnstile was installed at each end of the lobby, the company said its policy was to let the public walk through.
A picture caption referred incorrectly to a new lamppost on Stone Street. It is an electric reproduction of the bishop's crook design, not a gas lamp.

HEADLINE: The Greenspan Effect

BYLINE: By Daniel Gross; Daniel Gross, the author of "Bull Run," is a fellow at the New America Foundation.

 BODY:
Since he started boosting interest rates in May 1999, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has singlehandedly tried to cool off an economy and stock market that he viewed as overheated.
On Tuesday morning, four years to the day after he first warned of "irrational exuberance," Mr. Greenspan proclaimed victory. In a speech, he noted that the stock market, home-building, car sales and demand for consumer durables were all down. Meanwhile, unemployment claims and lending standards were up. With the economy losing momentum, he said, the Fed must "remain alert to the possibility that greater caution and weakening asset values in financial markets could signal or precipitate an excessive softening in household and business spending." 
 Traders took this convoluted prose as a clear signal: The asset bubble had been pricked. The economy was slowing. And the Fed might start thinking about lowering interest rates as soon as Jan. 30, 2001, when its Open Market Committee meets.
Very quickly, the soundtrack on Wall Street changed from "Stormy Weather" to "We're in the Money." Investors -- stunned into inaction by recent market declines -- emerged from their bunkers and gobbled up stocks. The Nasdaq spiked 10.47 percent, its biggest single-day gain ever. (The Dow Jones industrial average rose a less impressive 3 percent.)
Mr. Greenspan showed once again that he can move markets with a few well-chosen words. But it is also abundantly clear that the markets move Mr. Greenspan. And by the time the Fed meets to consider its stance on interest rates, the environment may have changed; Mr. Greenspan may be worried not about a slowing economy, but about an overheated stock market.
I hate to pour cold water in everybody's eggnog. But the rally on Tuesday wasn't particularly rational. e-Bay soared 17 percent, Cisco rose 13 percent and Network Appliances spiked 38 percent -- all on a day in which Apple Computer announced that its revenues for the next quarter would fall well short of expectations.
The rise in these stocks was not fueled by any improvement in earnings or by a rebound in consumer demand for the goods and services of these companies. It was a result of wishful thinking, prompted by the Greenspan announcement, for a return to the days of cheap, easy money.
That wishful dream could continue, the market declines of yesterday notwithstanding. There is the possibility of a Santa Claus rally: the market gains momentum as holiday cheer builds and the Fed appears to be in a giving mood. Then the January effect could kick in. That's the annual phenomenon whereby billions of dollars in year-end bonuses and profit-sharing checks flow into mutual funds, thus jacking up stock prices further.
January is also likely to bring the inauguration of George W. Bush -- a prospect that contributed to the rally on Tuesday and that could serve to create inflationary pressures. Mr. Bush has pledged to eliminate the estate tax and cut marginal tax rates. The mere expectation of such actions could stimulate excessive demand for everything from stocks to mink stoles. And Mr. Bush has shown little interest in deficit reduction. Add high energy costs and tight labor markets, and you've got a recipe for the Fed to adopt a policy of watchful waiting -- not easing interest rates immediately.
Of course, if Mr. Greenspan indicated that the Fed wouldn't cut interest rates, stocks would fall -- and fast. That would remove the threat of asset inflation -- meaning that the Fed could once again safely consider cutting interest rates.
After Mr. Greenspan's speech on Tuesday, it was tempting to think that "irrational exuberance" had been conquered once and for all. But investors' swift reaction to his low-key victory speech proves that we still have a long way to go.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A study shows committees can be more than the sum of their members.

BYLINE: By Alan B. Krueger 

 BODY:
WHEN Alan Blinder returned to academia from his post as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, he was convinced that the committee nature of the Fed made it slow to recognize and respond to changes in the economy. There was no research on the topic. So he and a Princeton University colleague, John Morgan, conducted an experiment to test whether committees performed worse than individuals.
Their results pointed in the opposite direction: At least in a laboratory setting, groups were just as quick as individuals to detect changes, and their collective judgment was substantially better than that of the individuals who made up the groups. 
 The researchers actually carried out two experiments. To highlight the decision problem in as stark a way as possible, the first was quite artificial. The second mimicked the type of decision the Fed's Open Market Committee makes regularly. The results of both experiments, which were strikingly similar, are reported in their study, "Are Two Heads Better Than One?" (available from the Web site, www.princeton.edu/ rjmorgan/working.htm).
In the first experiment, a computer randomly drew a series of red and blue balls from an electronic urn, with equal probability on each draw. Subjects were told that sometime in the first 10 draws the chance of drawing a red or blue ball on subsequent draws would change from 50-50 to 70-30 -- but they were not told in which direction or in which round the change would take place. The computer randomly selected the round and direction.
As the game was played, subjects endeavored to infer whether a change had taken place, and whether the odds had shifted in favor of red or blue balls. They were rewarded for the speed with which they detected a change, and for their accuracy in predicting the direction. (Speed was measured not by the clock, but by the number of draws requested -- i.e., the amount of information received -- before a change was alleged.) Players were penalized if they guessed early or late. The incentives were set so that a large premium was paid for accuracy relative to speed, reflecting the view that it is better for the Fed to get the direction right than to get it fast.
After a practice period, subjects played the game 10 times individually, and then 30 times jointly in groups of five. Groups were instructed to make decisions by unanimous consent or by majority rule. This process was repeated, alternating individual and group play, and unanimous consent and majority rule. In all, 100 subjects participated, generating 1,200 outcomes for groups and 3,000 for individuals.
Contrary to their expectations, the results indicated that groups and individuals reached decisions equally quickly. Professor Morgan was also struck that unanimity and majority rule seemed to make no difference in group decision making.
The groups were a third less likely to guess the wrong color than were the individual players; the groups, on average, erred just 11 percent of the time while as individuals they were wrong 16 percent of the time. Checks indicated that these results were not an artifact of the order in which the games were played.
Their second experiment placed subjects in the role of the Fed, and asked them to navigate the economy through a turbulent course. A small-scale macroeconomic model simulated inflation and unemployment. The economy faced a series of random shocks and, at some random point, a large shift in unemployment that also affected inflation with a lag. Subjects selected the nominal interest rate to stabilize unemployment and inflation at low levels. The would-be central bankers were rewarded for achieving low inflation and low unemployment, and penalized for making frequent interest-rate adjustments.
Despite the different setup, the results mirrored the initial urn experiment: groups made decisions as quickly as individuals, and more accurately.
Robert MacCoun, a social psychologist from the University of California at Berkeley, said of the results, "There is no intrinsic tendency for groups to be more cautious than individuals, absent any prior history or explicit hierarchy in the group."
Interestingly, a group's performance was not well explained by the average, median or best performance of its members as individuals. "What the results suggest," Professor Blinder said, "is that the interaction that takes place in a group does improve the decision making, so a group should not just have one person decide."
Because of the politicking, hierarchical structure and strongly held beliefs of members, the study's applicability to an organization like the Federal Reserve Board may be limited. Nevertheless, Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor, called the study "absolutely fascinating" and said it "definitely has relevance to the Fed."
The Clinton administration, believing the Fed chairman calls all the shots, has not made filling vacancies on the board a top priority. One plausible implication of the Blinder-Morgan study is that appointing Fed governors with economic expertise and independent views should be a priority. The next president will immediately have three openings to fill -- two vacant ones and one now occupied by the vice chairman, Roger Ferguson, whose term has expired -- and one more in a year when Mr. Meyer's term expires. Mr. Ferguson, who has served just three years, deserves to be reappointed to a full term for his Year 2000 stewardship and efforts to make the Fed more transparent.
Bob Woodward's best-selling book "Maestro" depicts the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, as God on a good day -- rarely making a mistake and winning over recalcitrant governors. This view is ubiquitous: a taxicab driver told me last week that as long as Mr. Greenspan is in charge, the economy will do fine, so it doesn't matter who is president.
Yet the Blinder-Morgan study suggests even a maestro performs better with an orchestra than without. Another reason for the next administration to appoint serious macroeconomists to the Federal Reserve is that the new governors' terms will almost certainly extend into a post-Greenspan Fed, where it is likely that decision making will be more diffuse and the chairman less adroit at economic forecasting than Mr. Greenspan.

HEADLINE: Productivity Loses Steam As Economy Keeps Ebbing

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
The productivity of workers, which has underpinned the nation's record economic expansion, rose in the third quarter but at a much slower pace than in the previous one, the government said today.
The Labor Department said nonfarm productivity, which measures the output per worker outside the farm sector, rose at an annual rate of 3.3 percent in the third quarter, down from an initial estimate of 3.8 percent. That was weaker than the 3.5 percent gain forecast by Wall Street economists and much slower than the 6.1 percent advance in the second quarter. 
 Economists said that although productivity growth slowed in the third quarter, the gains were still strong enough to reassure policy makers at the Federal Reserve that increasing worker efficiency was continuing to help dampen inflation.
In a separate report, the Fed said that the economy lost more steam in October and November and that consumer prices held steady despite companies' rising energy and wage costs.
Other signs of economic slowdown are underlined in the Fed's latest summary of national economic activity, known as the beige book, which will be used by members of the Federal Open Market Committee when they meet on Dec. 19 to consider interest rate strategy.
The Fed said there was "widespread weakening" in new-car sales though retailers were cautiously optimistic that the vital Thanksgiving-to-Christmas holiday sales season would be a strong one.
"Manufacturing activity was said to be leveling off or slowing in most districts," the summary said. There were still labor shortages, but in at least a few regions they were less pressing than earlier in the autumn.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, indicated in a speech on Tuesday that the central bank was closely monitoring the slowdown in economic activity. He said the Fed had to be alert to the possibility of "excessive softening" in spending as the economy lost momentum.
Most analysts expect the Fed to switch its stance toward eventually reducing interest rates next year if the slowdown persists.
A report on November employment, scheduled to be released on Friday, is considered to be a crucial indicator for the Fed whether the economic cooling so far is taking pressure off wages. Recent weekly reports from the Labor Department have shown a growing number of new applications for jobless pay.
In today's report on productivity, unit labor costs, which are closely watched for signs of potential inflation pressures because they are the largest cost of total production, rose at a 2.9 percent clip in the third quarter, faster than the previous estimate of 2.5 percent and up from a drop of 0.2 percent in the second quarter.
Still, while that third-quarter surge in costs was slightly faster than the 2.8 percent gain expected by Wall Street, unit labor costs stood a mere 0.2 percent above levels a year earlier, the report noted.

HEADLINE: New Panel Will Try to Solve Air Traffic Snarls

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
As public frustration with airline delays continues to climb, the Clinton administration intends to make a final push to overhaul the country's beleaguered air traffic system.
At a White House event scheduled for today, President Clinton is expected to announce his appointments to a new five-member committee to oversee the air traffic control system. He will also direct the Federal Aviation Administration to merge all of its air traffic functions into a single entity called the Air Traffic Organization and to examine what changes in rules and laws are needed to allow congestion pricing at the country's busiest airports. 
 The steps, called the "president's challenge," fall short of past proposals from the Clinton administration, like the introduction of user fees at airports, that foundered in Congress. But they are seen as a final opportunity for the administration to add some momentum to its goal of making the air traffic control system operate less like a bureaucracy and more like a private business.
Though the next president might have his own views on overhauling the air traffic system, an administration official stressed that Mr. Clifton's actions stick closely to aviation legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Congress in recent years.
Indeed, the five-member air traffic control oversight committee was created by Congress earlier this year. Its mandate is to supervise management of the air traffic control system by the F.A.A., which has spent billions of dollars over the last 18 years in its attempt to modernize the country's 1960's-era air traffic control computers. One of the committee's first acts will be to hire a chief operating officer for air traffic control, a position also created by Congress.
By instructing the F.A.A. to explore the adoption of user fees and congestion pricing more vigorously, the administration is likely to run into fierce opposition. While many economists say that raising the cost of using the country's runways is the only way to reduce gridlock, manufacturers and owners of private planes, who have a strong lobby in Congress, are firmly against the idea. And the administration is likely to get little support from those who say that the F.A.A. is so troubled that the only answer is to spin off its air traffic control function into a private corporation.
"This plan sounds like an improvement from what we have now, but to the extent that it precludes something better, like a more significant restructuring, it could take the pressure off," said Steven A. Morrison, a professor of economics at Northeastern University, who has written extensively about the airline industry and favors privatization.
The White House declined to say whom Mr. Clinton would appoint to the new oversight committee, but two people close to the situation said the nominees were John W. Snow, chairman of the CSX Corporation; former Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker of Kansas; Leon Lynch, vice president of the United Steelworkers of America; John J. Cullinane, former chairman of Cullinet Software Inc.; and Sharon Patrick, president of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc.

HEADLINE: Army Corps Falsified Data For a Project, Study Says

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Senior commanders at the Army Corps of Engineers manipulated an economic analysis to justify the proposed construction of a $1 billion system of locks along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers, according to a sharply critical report released today.
The findings of the report, by the Army's inspector general, raised the possibility of disciplinary action against three officers, including a major general who retired last month as the corps' deputy chief and another who now oversees projects in the Southeast, including the recently approved restoration project for the Everglades. 
 The investigation, prompted by a complaint filed by a corps economist under the federal "whistle-blower" laws, focused on a narrow accusation that officials skewed an arcane economic analysis. But it concluded that problems extended throughout the corps, a branch of the Army responsible for flood control and other construction projects.
The report concluded that the corps had developed "an institutional bias" that favored large, expensive construction projects, like the locks proposed along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers, regardless of their economic benefit.
The misconduct outlined today involved an ambitious seven-year, $54 million study of navigation traffic along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers north of St. Louis. While barge owners and agricultural corporations have advocated building new locks to ease congestion along the bustling waterways, the proposals have encountered opposition, including from environmental groups.
Investigators found that Maj. Gen. Russell L. Fuhrman, the corps' second-ranking officer, who for a time this year served as acting commander, exerted pressure that "led to the abandonment of objectivity in the economic analysis" of the locks project, the report said. That perception extended to many corps employees, who, the report said, "had no confidence in the integrity of the corps' study processes."
The investigators also found that Maj. Gen. Phillip R. Anderson, who commanded the corps' Mississippi Valley Division, gave "preferential treatment" to representatives of the barge industry, letting them contribute to feasibility studies even though they stood to gain from the results.
They also concluded that a colonel in the division, James V. Mudd, who has since retired, directly intervened in the study by ordering that a crucial statistic be altered to produce a more positive result.
In a statement, the Army announced that Secretary Louis Caldera had ordered the Army's vice chief of staff, Gen. John M. Keane, who is responsible for meting out punishment, to consider disciplinary actions against the three officers. While two of the officers have retired, they could still face punishment, including a reduction in rank and benefits.
The officers declined to discuss the accusations, a corps spokesman, David W. Hewitt, said today, but in testimony included in the report today, they denied any wrongdoing.
Mr. Caldera also ordered the corps' new commander, Lt. Gen. Robert B. Flowers, to recommend "any warranted changes" in regulations or practices. That could set up a new confrontation with Congress, where the corps has considerable political clout since its construction projects bring jobs and money to districts around the country.
In March, after the accusations first surfaced, Mr. Caldera announced a series of changes that would give civilian leaders in the Army more direct control over the corps' projects, budgets and management. In the face of Congressional opposition, however, Mr. Caldera backed down. According to an internal memorandum written last week, the Army now intends to seek no legislative changes in the corps' structure or relation with the Army.
The report was released today by the Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency that evaluates disclosures and complaints by federal employees. In this case, a civilian economist involved in the corps' study, Donald C. Sweeney, approached the office in February, prompting officials there to order an investigation.
The office's director, Elaine Kaplan, said in statement today that the investigation had substantiated many of Dr. Sweeney's accusations. Ms. Kaplan also criticized the Department of Defense and the Army for not yet detailing how it intended to address the issues raised by investigators.
Dr. Sweeney, whom corps officials reassigned after he concluded in a draft analysis that the proposed project was not economically justifiable, said the investigation had vindicated his decision to come forward. "I'm heartened that the process seems to have worked," he said.
The corps' study was never completed. Earlier this year, the corps extended it for another year. Mr. Hewitt, the corps spokesman, said that officials would redo the analyses that investigators concluded were manipulated.
Timothy D. Searchinger, a lawyer for Environmental Defense, an advocacy group that helped Dr. Sweeney in filing his complaint, said the findings that analyses were manipulated should prompt the Army to reconsider similar projects.

HEADLINE: Warning From Bank of America

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C., Dec. 6

 BODY:
The Bank of America Corporation said today that it would miss fourth-quarter earnings forecasts because of losses on loans and slack investment banking and trading results.
The company, based in Charlotte, said it expected to report quarterly earnings of about $1.4 billion, or 85 to 90 cents a share. That is well below Wall Street expectations of $1.17 a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks corporate earnings forecasts. 
 The company said last month that its loan losses would probably more than double in the fourth quarter after problems with a large corporate loan. Bank of America did not identify the borrower or lower its earnings outlook at the time, but analysts said the loan was to the Sunbeam Corporation and totaled $450 million to $500 million.
Shares of Bank of America fell $3.19, to $38.00. Other bank stocks were lower after Bank of America's announcement, made in a presentation to an investment conference in New York and through a statement.
Wall Street is worried about the rising number of bad loans at banks after a string of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve put brakes on the economy and caused some corporate profits to flag.
Credit quality continues to fall, Bank of America said. It said it expected nonperforming assets, or loans with potential repayment problems, to be about 20 percent higher than they were in the third quarter.
Bank of America is budgeting for significantly higher loan losses and credit costs in 2001, the statement quoted James Hance Jr., the chief financial officer, as saying in the presentation at the investor conference.
For 2000, Bank of America said it expected to report operating earnings of nearly $8 billion, or $4.72 to $4.77 a share. The bank expects to report 2001 earnings of $5.10 to $5.20 a share, compared with estimates of $5.46, according to First Call.
Bank of America said it had based its 2001 projections on an assumed "soft landing for the U.S. economy and no change in the company's business mix." It said it would provide more detail on its 2001 outlook in January.

HEADLINE: Texas Officials Endorse a Plan to Reduce Smog in Houston

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: DALLAS, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Texas officials approved a plan today to bring Houston's runaway smog under control by reducing the speed limit on the region's freeways and highways to 55 miles an hour, requiring deep cuts in emissions from refineries and other industrial plants, and eventually banning use of heavy construction equipment during the morning for much of the year.
Houston, which by some measures has overtaken Los Angeles as the smoggiest city in the nation, has been under tremendous pressure to reduce ozone emissions or face sanctions from the federal government. The city is home to many petroleum refineries, and for years it had largely ignored its growing smog problem as an acceptable byproduct of a thriving economy. 
 Officials at the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, a three-member body that oversees state environmental regulations, called the plan the most significant air quality proposal in Texas history. The measures, which are intended to bring Houston into compliance with federal clean-air standards by 2007, will be submitted to the federal Environmental Protection Agency this month for approval.
One state commissioner, Ralph Marquez, called the plan a "new era of clean air" and said the state "will continue to be as flexible as possible, and we will continue to pursue improved scientific knowledge, but we must get the job done."
But the plan was attacked by environmentalists as falling far short of what is needed. Ramon Alvarez, a scientist with the Texas office of Environmental Defense, a private American group that has focused on building environmental programs that have the support of industries. Mr. Alvarez said that while the plan would "improve air quality, it is not enough to protect public health."
He also said it weakened "previous positions endorsed by the natural resources commission and includes ideas that are simply unworkable" and urged the E.P.A. to reject the plan unless it was strengthened.
Among other things, the plan calls for these steps:
*Reducing the speed limit in the Houston area to 55 m.p.h. from as high as 70 m.p.h., beginning in May 2002.
*Requiring a 90 percent cut in nitrogen oxide emissions from major industrial sources.
*Strengthening vehicle emissions testing in Harris County, where Houston is situated, and surrounding counties.
*Banning the use of heavy construction equipment and commercial lawn mowers in Harris and four other counties from 6 a.m. to noon from April through October, beginning in 2005.
George Beatty Jr., the president of chamber of commerce division of the Greater Houston Partnership, a leading business group, praised the plan over all but said, "We're a little concerned with the restrictiveness of some of the actions."
Mr. Beatty also said the plan gave Houston officials time to find alternatives to the morning ban on heavy construction equipment.
State environmental officials said the plan was expected to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide, a primary ingredient in the creation of ozone, by 75 percent in the eight-county Houston metropolitan area. Roughly 55 percent of Houston's nitrogen oxide is produced by industry, while 25 percent comes from automobiles and trucks and 20 percent from airplanes, trains, ships, lawn mowers and construction equipment.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers to Try Philippine President on Impeachment Charges

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: MANILA, Philippines, Dec. 6

 BODY:
After two months of sensational accusations, seamy disclosures and steadfast denials, President Joseph Estrada of the Philippines is finally getting his day in court.
On Thursday, Mr. Estrada will become the first head of state in Asia to face an impeachment trial. The president has been charged with accepting $11 million in bribes from illegal gambling rackets. 
 Prosecutors from the Philippine House of Representatives will try to prove that Mr. Estrada betrayed the public trust and violated the Constitution by using his office to enrich himself and several mistresses. As in the United States, the Senate will hear the case, after a vote last month by the House to impeach Mr. Estrada.
The senators, intent on showing that this country uses lawful means to solve political scandals, met today to sort out procedural issues. "We have a working democracy in the Philippines," said Franklin Drilon, a senator who broke ranks with Mr. Estrada after the bribery accusations. "Even the most powerful man in the land is not above the law."
Mr. Estrada, 63, denies that he accepted any bribes, though he acknowledges that a local official deposited gambling payoffs into an account controlled by him. The president, a onetime film star, has likened his plight to an action movie in which the hero is bloodied but triumphs in the end.
"This is just a wake-up call for me," Mr. Estrada said today. "I leave my fate to God and to the sense of fairness and justice of the senators." Mr. Estrada is also counting on the Philippine masses, who catapulted him into office in 1998 on a tidal wave of populist support.
For oddsmakers here, the real question is how the 22 senators will vote. Two-thirds of the members must vote to convict Mr. Estrada to remove him from office. Eight votes to acquit would save him.
An informal poll of political experts and Senate staff members suggested that Mr. Estrada has the support of 12 senators.
Several senators conceded the trial was as much a political as a legal exercise. How they vote may ultimately hinge on public sentiment, which is expressed in demonstrations by people for and against Mr. Estrada.
"If we fail to convict him, we cannot prevent people outside from continuing their protests," said Joker Arroyo, one of the most vocal House prosecutors. "Those people do not believe in this process."
The government plans to deploy 1,000 police officers to seal off the Senate, which is in a concrete monolith on the Manila waterfront. The security cordon is intended to thwart a rally by Mr. Estrada's critics, who say they will assemble tens of thousands of protesters on Thursday.
Despite the tension, there was palpable relief that the day of reckoning has come. The scandal has shaken the Philippine stock market and sapped its currency. Analysts say the economy will not recover from a prolonged crisis of confidence.
"It took much longer to settle this than we thought," said Alexander R. Magno, a political commentator. "Estrada has dug in his heels. But public sentiment demands getting this done by the end of the year."
With testimony from 54 witnesses scheduled, the trial is likely to run through January. It is to be televised live every day, and it promises to be riveting.

HEADLINE: CONTESTING THE VOTE: THE ABSENTEE BALLOTS;
With 24,000 Votes at Stake, Dual Trials Open on Incomplete Ballot Applications

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER 

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Dec. 6

 BODY:
In back-to-back trials, lawyers for Gov. George W. Bush urged two Florida judges today to resist disqualifying thousands of absentee ballots, even though they acknowledged that Republican workers had been allowed to fix some flawed ballot applications.
One suit, brought by a supporter of Vice President Al Gore, seeks to discard 15,000 absentee ballots cast in Seminole County, where Republican workers were allowed to go into the elections office to fix the applications. The other seeks to invalidate the more than 9,000 absentee ballots cast in Martin County, where Republicans were allowed to remove the rejected applications from the elections office, fix them and resubmit them. 
 Because Mr. Bush carried the absentee ballots heavily in both counties, the loss of the votes in either county would be enough to overturn the election results in Florida. Mr. Gore's central argument about the Florida election is that every vote should be counted, so the vice president has not joined the suits. But on Tuesday he said he was watching them closely.
The Seminole case was heard for roughly 10 hours today. When it broke for the night at 7, the lawyers for Mr. Bush took a brief break before going to a night session called for the Martin trial.
The accelerated schedule for the two trials meant that opening arguments in the Martin case were made after 8 tonight.
Edward Stafman, a lawyer for the plaintiff, Ronald Taylor, argued that the case involved a local Republican supervisor of elections acting in concert with local Republican officials to achieve a partisan advantage in the election.
Daryl Bristow, a lawyer for Mr. Bush, asserted that every voter was innocent.
Few of the facts in the Seminole case were in dispute.
Both sides acknowledged the basic outline: Sandra Goard, the supervisor of elections in Seminole County, allowed a Republican official to use her offices for more than two weeks to add missing voter identification numbers to absentee ballot applications from Republicans that had been rejected.
So the question today was not so much what happened as what, if anything, should be done about it.
Lawyers for the plaintiff, Harry Jacobs, cited a Florida law passed in 1998 to crack down on absentee ballot fraud.
The law states that only voters and their relatives can request absentee ballots and that "the person making the request" for an absentee ballot must disclose several pieces of personal information, including a voter identification number.
Mr. Jacobs's lead trial lawyer, Gerald F. Richman, said, "We believe that the law says that all of the ballots have to be thrown out if the applications are tainted."
But the defendants, who included Mr. Bush, Ms. Goard, Secretary of State Katherine Harris and the Florida Republican Party, said that throwing out the ballots would be excessive. They said there was no evidence that the ballots came from ineligible voters or that they did not reflect the will of the voters.
"They want, in essence, to throw out the baby with the bath water," said Terry Young, a lawyer representing Ms. Goard.
Judge Nikki Ann Clark, who presided over the trial, said at the outset that she would consider two issues: whether the addition of the identification numbers was sufficient cause to throw out the ballots and whether the access the Republicans were granted was favorable treatment that had an effect on the outcome of the election.
The case arose out of a practice common to both the Democratic and Republican parties in Florida. Both parties, in an effort to increase voter turnout, routinely mail out thousands of largely filled-in absentee ballot application forms to voters likely to support their candidates. All the voters have to do, in theory, is complete the forms and send them to their county elections office. But this year a printer's error left the voter identification numbers off thousands of Republican application forms that were returned.
After the Republican Party learned of the error, court papers show, officials asked Ms. Goard to allow Michael A. Leach, the north Florida regional director of the state Republican Party, to go to her office and add the missing identification numbers to the rejected ballot applications.
She agreed. But while Mr. Leach was allowed to fix the applications, no action was taken to fix hundreds of other incomplete ballot applications, and they were not processed.
All told, the lawyers agreed, Mr. Leach added identification numbers to at least 2,126 incomplete absentee ballot applications that resulted from the Republican mailing. Those applications resulted in 1,932 absentee votes cast: 1,833 from Republicans, 54 from Democrats and 45 from independents.
Since there is a secret ballot, and those votes were added to the rest of the more than 15,000 absentee ballots cast in Seminole County, it is impossible to segregate them and throw them out. So Mr. Richman argued that all the absentee ballots should be thrown out. But at the trial today, he also offered the judge a third way. Mr. Richman suggested that the 1,932 absentee votes resulting from altered applications could be thrown out according to a mathematical formula estimating how those votes could be expected to have been cast.
The plaintiffs called an expert witness, James Bradford DeLong, a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, to explain several possible formulas to reapportion the 1,932 votes. One formula would simply count all the applications from Republicans as votes for Mr. Bush, Mr. DeLong explained. One would apportion the ballots using the ratio of the Bush absentee ballots to the other absentee ballots in the county, and one would devise a formula based on likely voting habits using exit polling data from Voter News Service.
Stuart Levey, a lawyer for Mr. Bush, jumped on the fact that Professor DeLong suggested relying on Voter News Service, the exit polling consortium whose trouble with its data resulted in severe confusion among news organizations on election night as to who won the state of Florida. "Exit polls can be faulty, as we heard on election night, right?" Mr. Levey said.
And Barry Richard, another lawyer for Mr. Bush, asked sarcastically, "Wouldn't we save a great deal of time and money if we relied upon you and your colleagues to tell us who was going to win the election, and skipped all this voting interest?"
That question drew an objection, which Judge Clark sustained.
The Republican lawyers argued that the act of altering the ballot applications was not enough on its own to alter the outcome of the election. They argued that if Mr. Leach had not been allowed to fix the rejected ballot applications, many of the voters would simply have reapplied for ballots or gone to the polls on Election Day.
Mr. Young, the lawyer representing Ms. Goard, said his office conducted an analysis of all the rejected absentee ballot applications that were not altered by Mr. Leach. Of the 742 people whose ballot applications were rejected, he said, nearly half received absentee ballots anyway, either because they had already applied for absentee ballots or because they reapplied when they failed to receive one.
Of the rest, he said, approximately 80 percent voted at the polls. Of the remaining 70 to 80 people who did not receive absentee ballots and did not go to the polls, he said, many had applications rejected because they did not sign applications, they were not registered to vote, or they lived in another county.

HEADLINE: CONTESTING THE VOTE: UPDATE;
Legislative Action and Last-Ditch Appeal

 BODY:

As the Florida Legislature prepared to weigh in on the 30th day of the presidential election, these were the day's main events.
 
The Republican leaders of the Legislature called a special session for Friday to appoint a set of presidential electors who would support Gov. George W. Bush. 

Lawyers for Vice President Al Gore filed what they said was his final appeal in his quest for the presidency, when they asked the Florida Supreme Court to agree to count 14,000 disputed ballots. Mr. Gore's lawyers urged the high court to reject what they described as a strategy of delay being used by Mr. Bush. "In but a few more days, only the judgment of history will be left to fall upon a system where deliberate obstruction has succeeded in achieving delay -- and where further delays risk succeeding in handing democracy a defeat," read their brief filed with the court.
 
For their part, lawyers for Mr. Bush said the trial court's decision in the case on Monday was "plainly correct," and told the seven justices that they had no choice but to accept the finding that Mr. Gore had failed to prove the disputed ballots would change the outcome of the election.
 
Mr. Gore could be the beneficiary in other trials that began yesterday in Leon County Circuit Court. The trials involve charges by Democrats that Republicans improperly amended applications for absentee ballots that had been rejected by officials in Seminole and Martin Counties.
 
If the judges in the two cases rule in Mr. Gore's favor, the cases could produce a net gain of thousands of votes for Mr. Gore, although the cases would almost certainly be appealed to the Florida Supreme Court.
 
As the doubt about the election continues, Mr. Bush has begun trying to broaden his support by talking about the high hurdle he has faced in trying to unseat an incumbent vice president and by portraying the possibility of clearing that hurdle as clear proof that his ideas caught fire in the campaign.
 
With the economy clearly slowing from the red-hot pace that was threatening to spark inflation to a more modest but still healthy pace, the Republican ticket is using the prospect of a downturn to build support for Mr. Bush's $1.3 trillion tax cut. Mr. Bush and Dick Cheney are arguing that such a tax cut would give the economy enough of a kick to keep it out of the doldrums or to spur a recovery should there be a recession, which they are characterizing as a "Clinton recession."

HEADLINE: In Ruined Liberia, Its Despoiler Sits Pretty

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia

 BODY:
Soon after the sun sets, the road into this capital, which has had no electricity in nearly a decade, disappears into the dark night. The glimmer from candles and oil lamps casts faint shadows of pedestrians moving about in the very center of town, where the few clusters of light come from private generators. There are no traffic lights.
All of Monrovia is plunged into darkness -- except one short block, where a huge house sits surrounded by a white wall that extends almost to the side of the road. On this block, two rows of majestically tall street lamps yield constant light. 
 The house on the block belongs to Charles Taylor, the president of this country, the warlord who destroyed Liberia in one of the most barbaric civil wars in Africa's recent history, and who terrorized its people into electing him in 1997. Having made an inaugural promise to "not be a wicked president," Mr. Taylor, 52, has spent the past three years becoming the single most destabilizing force in West Africa, diplomats and international workers say.
At a time when Africa draws less and less attention from the United States and Europe, Mr. Taylor's deeds could easily have gone unnoticed; he could have been dismissed as yet another African despot ready to fill his pockets and leave his people's bellies empty. But from his corner of the continent Mr. Taylor, perhaps more than any other leader, has forced the West to pay attention -- whether to the diamonds sold in New York and Paris to fuel African wars, or to the peacekeeping role the West should play in Africa.
Next door in Sierra Leone, he has backed the rebels of the Revolutionary United Front, who have given him diamonds in return for guns. With the largest operating United Nations peacekeeping force now installed in Sierra Leone, Mr. Taylor's role there has drawn increasing condemnation from the Security Council. His government has become an international pariah.
Meanwhile, he has transformed Liberia into what one Western diplomat in the region calls "Charles Taylor Inc." In addition to Sierra Leone's diamonds, he has plundered his country's natural resources, enriching his family and a small circle.
"Electricity is the key to Liberia's socioeconomic progress," reads a billboard not far from the presidential palace, a relic of Mr. Taylor's unfulfilled promise to provide power by the turn of the millennium.
There is no running water here, either. And the government has nearly abandoned the schools and hospitals. The brutal security forces provide the one lasting reminder that a government does exist. A five-minute walk from downtown leads to a neighborhood near the gutted Inter-Continental Hotel, where people have dug holes in the ground, getting water from wells as if they were living out in the country, not the capital of what once was one of the continent's better-off nations.
"Before the war I stayed in my home and opened the faucet and water came out," said Dominic Weah, 40, who dug one of the wells after the war began in 1989 and still comes to draw from it every day. "We have a lot of problems in this country. I expected Charles Taylor to do much better. He brought the war in this country and destroyed the water system, the electricity, the sewer, telecommunications. These are the things used by the common people. Everything is upside down."
Jobless despite his high school education, Mr. Weah works out two hours a day. "So I won't have to think too much," he explained. The dream of leaving Liberia sustains him, as it does many Liberians. His own sister won the green card lottery and left for the United States this year.
"We have a saying in Liberia," he said. "The day you get a visa to go to America, your suffering is over. You are in heaven. You are out of hell."
Mr. Taylor, who received an economics degree from Bentley College in Waltham, Mass., has brought Liberia's relationship with the United States to a low point. It was freed American slaves who founded this country in 1847 and whose descendants kept the symbols marking that link -- a red-white-and-blue flag with a star and stripes; a currency called the dollar; and English that oddly resonates with the accent and cadence of the American South. The capital was even named after President James Monroe, who decided to pay to establish a place in Africa for freed slaves.
In October, Washington stopped granting visas to Liberian government officials and their families -- a big blow because many of them have lived in the United States or have other strong ties.
The last time Mr. Taylor spent an extended period in the United States was in 1985, when he broke out of a Massachusetts prison as he awaited extradition to Liberia on embezzlement charges.
He then went to Libya, where he received military training as the guest of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. It was in Libya that he met another dissatisfied West African rebel, a cashiered Sierra Leonean corporal named Foday Sankoh, who would go on to establish the Revolutionary United Front and start the war in Sierra Leone in 1991.
Mr. Taylor and Mr. Sankoh would help each other over the next decade, as soldiers loyal to both fought in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Liberia provided a conduit for diamonds smuggled out of Sierra Leone, as well as a source of arms. In their war against their respective governments, Mr. Sankoh copied the guerrilla tactics that Mr. Taylor pioneered here: the widespread use of child soldiers, who were often drugged to commit atrocities; the deliberate victimization of civilians to bring about their submission.
In 1997, a year after the war ended, Liberians overwhelmingly chose Mr. Taylor as their president -- believing that he would resume the war if he lost. And while Liberians have lived in relative peace in the past three years, Mr. Taylor has, in the words of a religious official who has been here since 1983, "pushed things back 50 years."
The peace has betrayed fragility in recent months; a long-simmering conflict with neighboring Guinea has erupted. Hundreds have been reported killed in skirmishes between Liberian and Guinean soldiers.
Near the billboard promising electricity stands another: "Liberia is a country of laws, not men! Help keep it that way!" Perhaps the message is supposed to give some credibility to the National Assembly, whose members have not helped fulfill the billboard's promise. Mr. Taylor has allowed them the shortest of leashes: he gave each lawmaker a dark blue Isuzu Trooper sport utility vehicle, which the legislators drive around Monrovia, with license plates like "16-REP" and "44-REP," as if defiant symbols of their complete lack of independence.
The president has likewise squelched nearly all criticism, having chased out most dissidents.
"The media has found itself the only voice of criticism left of the government," said Suah S. Deddeh, president of the Press Union of Liberia. "A few political opponents are here, but they are more or less paper tigers."
The government has cleverly selected its media targets. In March, it shut down the two independent radio stations, though one of them, belonging to the Roman Catholic Church, reopened a few weeks later. But it has allowed great freedom to newspapers, betting on the fact that they are not sold outside the capital, that only a third of the three million Liberians are literate and that even fewer can afford the 50 cents for an eight-page daily.
And few read recent newspapers that described the near-collapse of the country's largest public hospital, the John F. Kennedy Medical Hospital, as well as public health care in general. Few read the explanation from the health minister, Peter Coleman, that there were only 25 doctors in public hospitals in Liberia -- down from 85 in 1997 and 400 in 1989.
International relief workers say the government gives little money to its hospitals, and the same is true of its schools. An official at one organization that feeds schoolchildren said that half of the teachers at schools were volunteers and that the other half had not been paid in three to six months. Competent teachers have left.
Public services continue to deteriorate even as Mr. Taylor and his family -- several of his relatives head ministries -- loot Liberia, according to Western diplomats, international workers, Liberian and foreign business people here.
A principal income source in the last couple of years has been Liberia's rain forests, according to these officials. The Forestry Development Authority, headed by the president's brother, Robert, has allowed a shadowy logging company, Oriental Timber, with headquarters in Hong Kong but mostly Indonesian workers in Liberia, to wipe out entire forests, diplomats say. No one knows where the government's profits are going.
"The country is going through an economic devastation," said Conmany B. Wesseh, executive director of the Center for Democratic Empowerment, a private group that gets American financing. "There is not any economy to speak of. There is nothing working in this system. Everything revolves around the whim and caprices of the president."
(A few days after Mr. Wesseh was interviewed, a group of men believed to have ties to the government ransacked his office and beat him, as well as the chairman of the organization, Amos Sawyer, a former interim president of Liberia. The incident, the second attack on Mr. Wesseh since last year, was condemned by the Carter Center, which recently shut down its Monrovia office because of "concerns over the threats to human rights." In a statement released on Dec. 5, former President Jimmy Carter said he was "profoundly shocked and saddened by this incident," adding, "Such organized violence against this organization is an affront to all those who advocate peaceful dialogue and democracy in that country.")
In the past, Mr. Taylor has blamed the West for failing to provide money to rebuild Liberia. While acknowledging his ties to Mr. Sankoh, he has always denied accusations that Liberia provides the Sierra Leonean rebel group with arms for diamonds.
The president's press secretary, Reginald Goodridge, said the West had demonized Mr. Taylor by falsely accusing him of diamond smuggling and gunrunning.
"We have diamonds all over Liberia," Mr. Goodridge said, adding that there was no need to take Sierra Leone's. He indicated the presidential grounds outside his window and said, "I could go outside and dig there, and I'd find diamonds."
Most people in Monrovia were content to dig and find water.
A young woman, Heretha Takpa, who was carrying a baby on her back, had drawn three buckets of water from the well near the city center. "I voted for Pape," she said, speaking of Mr. Taylor. Asked whether she would support him again in the 2003 elections, she said nothing for a few seconds, then blurted out, "The things I expected from him, he's not doing it."
But with no political freedom or opposition, Mr. Taylor is not expected to lose.
"Our leaders here are so greedy -- they got us into such a mess," said Mr. Weah, the brother of the green card winner. "We got everything in Africa. We have resources, everything. But they are so greedy. They buy luxurious cars, they have lots of teenage girlfriends. Our leaders want to be in power until they die. If all African leaders agreed to serve their term and give another man a chance, there will be total peace in Africa."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
Holidays Come to an End, But Needs of Poor Stay On

BYLINE: By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
After last year's Neediest Cases annual appeal ended in March, gifts to the fund tapered off, as they do every year.
While on an average day in February $12,633 came into the fund's coffers, by March the average amount had dropped to $9,686 a day. By July, the month with the lowest level of contribution, the fund received about $374 in an average day. 
 The gifts continued to ebb, and by September it was common for days to pass without a single gift.
Though the donations decreased, the needs of the poorest and most forgotten New Yorkers continued, and The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which supports seven social service agencies in New York City, continued to serve them.
"The New York Times drive is concentrated in three months," said Philip Coltoff, executive director of the Children's Aid Society, one of the seven local charities supported by Neediest Cases Fund, "but it really takes care of need throughout 12 months."
While a vast majority of donations come to the fund while an appeal is running, and especially during December, the fund's coffers are always open.
"People tend to be a bit more forgetful when the holiday season is over," Mr. Coltoff said, "but whether it is just before Christmas or around the holidays, or whether it's in June, that doesn't determine how much food is on the table or whether the rent is paid or whether a child needs dental care, or whether a baby needs diapers."
The money donated goes to seven of the oldest and most respected social service agencies in New York. The agencies include UJA-Federation of New York, whose many programs include providing housing and supportive environments for mentally ill adults; the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, which helps people who have been unemployed for years find jobs; and the Children's Aid Society.
"The children of the Children's Aid Society often have very little that other children enjoy and deserve, and are the beneficiaries of this larger giving by all of us that the children themselves are not even aware of," Mr. Coltoff said. "Which is the way it should be."
Samuel and Courtney Sloane of Abilene, Tex., visited the city in March and were moved to give $100 to the fund.
"As on-again New Yorkers, we have seen some wonderful changes in the city, as well as some continual areas which need more attention," the Sloanes wrote in a letter that accompanied their gift.
"We hope our small donation through the fund will make a difference in someone else's life here."
And the gifts came from farther than Texas. Tsanejiro Nakaba, who lives about 20 miles northeast of Tokyo, sent a check for $200 in March.
Jennifer Saal, a corporate planning lawyer who lives in Teaneck, N.J., gave $100 in March, and wrote a note on the theme of the final sentence that accompanies every article The Times publishes about people who have been helped through the fund. "To delay does mean to forget," she wrote.
"Everybody leads busy lives, and to sit down and write a check takes time," she said recently by telephone.
"I read all the articles and I never do anything until I finally sit down and write the check.
"What always gets to me is that it's such a small amount of money," she said.
"For some people it's a couple of hundred dollars that can mean keeping an apartment or feeding their children. I can blow that on a dinner."
Ms. Saal said she planned to give to the Neediest Cases Fund again this year, in lieu of giving to people who had come to her house and asked for help.
"I know for certain that I have been scammed," she said.
"It's just safer to give to something like the Neediest Cases, especially because you know that The Times pays for the administrative costs. It seems to be a sure way to see that the money goes where it's needed."
Steven Corn of Emerson, N.J., gave $400 to the fund in late April. Though he was a donor, he summarized the thought that is spoken each year by innumerable recipients of the money. With his check, he wrote simply, "Thank you."

A Series of Compromises In Design of Ford's Explorer
For Ford, the Explorer was the perfect vehicle for a baby-boom generation that believed you could have it all. People could use it as the family car, and it had the rugged image of a truck. The problem was, it also had the Achilles' heel of a big, tall truck: it rolled over more easily than a car would.
The biography of the Explorer reveals how executives at Ford, under great pressure to be in on the coming sport utility boom, decided to build their entry in a hurry and on a shoestring, but with only moderate attention to stability. In succeeding years, amid rising concern about rollovers, Ford engineers strove to adapt that tippy, bouncy pickup design, but with limited success. Page A1.

HEADLINE: U.S. Warns Of 50% Rise In Heat Costs

BYLINE: By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
Just as winter tightens an icy grip on much of the United States, the federal government warned yesterday that consumers can expect to pay about 50 percent more than a year ago to heat their homes with natural gas.
In its latest short-term energy outlook, the Energy Information Administration estimated that consumers who rely on natural gas would spend an extra $300 on average than last winter. Slightly more than half of American homes are heated with gas, according to 1997 census figures. 
 But a quadrupling of the price of natural gas over the last year will spread its effects through the economy as a whole, as factories, electric utilities and retailers join suburbanites in the scramble to pay their mounting gas bills.
"This will be a hardship for many families," said Martin Cohen, executive director of the Citizens Utilities Board, a utility watchdog group in Illinois, where residential consumers are expected to spend $400 more this winter on natural gas. "That will be $400 less going into the economy, into food, clothing and entertainment."
With demand soaring in a hot economy and supplies tight, wholesale prices for natural gas had nearly doubled by early July to about $4.44 for a million British thermal units, compared with $2.39 one year earlier. At that time, experts predicted that prices would level off or decline, and that consumers might have to pay 25 percent to 30 percent more for heat this winter.
Instead, the supply-demand imbalance grew more severe, and the price of natural gas continued to climb. Prices jumped sharply in the last week, as a cold snap rippled through the Northeast, Midwest and South, raising both demand for gas and concern that wellheads could freeze, further curtailing supplies. The price of natural gas for January delivery was $8.49 per million B.T.U.'s at the close of trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, an increase of $1.10, or 15 percent, from the day before.
Although Energy Information Administration analysts expect that prices will settle back from the spikes this week, they nonetheless decided to revise their earlier estimates about how much it would cost to heat with natural gas this winter. The new estimate projects that it will cost the average family about $834 to heat their home, compared with about $540 last year, said David Costello, an analyst with the agency, the statistical arm of the Energy Department.
"This assumes that spot market prices won't stay as high as they are," Mr. Costello said, "but it presumes that we have something like normal temperatures," rather than the mild winters of the last two years.
In some big urban areas that rely heavily on natural gas for heating, bills are poised to rise more steeply than the average.
In the Chicago area, where more than 90 percent of residents heat with gas, People's Gas, a unit of People's Energy, predicts that gas bills will rise 64 percent this winter. Mr. Cohen's estimate for Chicago residents was even higher: an 80 percent increase.
In San Diego, where summer electric bills doubled or more under a much-criticized deregulation program, December gas bills are expected to double to an average of $70, utility executives said; in the Los Angeles area, bills could rise to $80 from $50 last year.
"We have given a great deal of warning to people about the situation," said Steve Baum, chairman and chief executive of Sempra Energy, the parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric and Southern California Gas. "But people are just now seeing higher bills. I don't know if there will be the same revolt as we had on electricity prices. I think there will be outrage."
In New York City, Keyspan and Consolidated Edison expect to keep price rises within the 25 percent to 30 percent range predicted earlier in the year.
But the utilities may be hard pressed to meet that pledge if the winter -- like fall -- turns out to be colder than expected. In the 24 hours ending Wednesday morning, for instance, Keyspan customers used more than twice the amount of natural gas they had a year ago, because temperatures were so much lower.
The rise in natural gas prices began in late spring, and the fear now is that it will not abate soon. Because gas prices were low over the last two years, oil and gas companies lacked the capital to invest in new drilling, so supplies gradually fell.
At the same time, the economy -- and hence demand -- was growing briskly. Manufacturers that use natural gas for their industrial processes demanded more. Electric power plants that kept the economy running needed more natural gas, too; nearly all the latest plants use gas, which burns more cleanly than other fuels.
(Consumers who heat with electricity generated by gas-burning plants generally pay regulated rates, and so will not bear the brunt of rising gas prices.)
There is no shortage looming, but inventory has been slow to build at many factories and some utilities that rely on natural gas. Market nervousness about those lower storage rates has also fueled higher prices.
"A lot of people feel that if we have normal winter temperatures, we could move to record low levels of storage, and that could drive prices up," Mr. Costello said.
Many gas utilities appear to have hedged their costs by purchasing natural gas through long-term contracts. But long stretches of cold weather could send them to the spot market for additional supplies. And that would be costly. At the New York citygate -- the pipeline's point of entry into the city -- bids ranged from $15 to $30 per million B.T.U.'s yesterday.
The inexorable rise of natural gas prices has spurred significantly more drilling in the United States than last year, and that could lead to a decline in prices -- but not for the another year or two.
"We will make a transition, hopefully, into a period of more supply," Mr. Costello said, "but that is not going to do much for us this winter."

HEADLINE: CONTESTING THE VOTE: POLITICAL MEMO;
On Cloudy Economic Horizon, Bush's Silver Lining

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Gov. George W. Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, have clear tactical reasons for warning of possible economic trouble ahead, as they have repeatedly in recent days.
The Republican ticket is explicitly using the prospect of a downturn to build support for Mr. Bush's $1.3 trillion tax cut, arguing that it would give the economy enough of a kick to keep it out of the doldrums or to spur a recovery should a recession hit. 
 "There are some warning signs on the horizon about the economy; both Secretary Cheney and I have spoken about that publicly," Mr. Bush said on Tuesday in an interview with CBS News. "One of the reasons I fought so strongly for tax relief was to serve as an insurance policy against a potential economic downturn."
More subtly, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney are signaling that any economic difficulties that might arise have roots already in place before they take office and that they should not be held responsible for any bad news that breaks early in their term. If there is a recession next year, they seem to be saying, it will be the Clinton recession.
"We're in that rare period where the political leader has no stake in the economy, so he can tend to talk it down to justify campaign promises," said Tom Gallagher, a political analyst in Washington for the International Strategy and Investment Group. "For at least a year, you can try to blame any problems on your predecessor."
The economy has clearly slowed in the last few months, from a red-hot pace that threatened to spark inflation to a more modest but still healthy pace. Few forecasters are currently predicting a recession.
But some parts of the economy, especially manufacturing, are suffering from a sharp drop in activity. History suggests that it is difficult to slow the economy without putting it into a stall, but it may be months before it becomes apparent whether the expansion that is now nearly a decade old will continue.
In pressing his case for a tax cut on economic grounds, Mr. Bush may find himself at odds with the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Alan Greenspan.
Mr. Greenspan has made clear over the last few years his view that the best thing for the economy would be to use as much of the projected federal budget surplus as possible to reduce the national debt.
Failing an emphasis on debt reduction, he prefers tax cuts to new government spending. But he generally takes a dim view of efforts by Congress or any administration to fine-tune the economy through fiscal policy. Stimulating the economy with tax cuts or spending increases works only in the case of long lags, many economists believe, and with often unpredictable results.
In signaling during a speech in New York on Tuesday that he stood ready to cut interest rates should the economy show signs of serious trouble, Mr. Greenspan seemed to be emphasizing that the Fed could take care of the situation through monetary policy.
With Congress so evenly divided between the two parties, it is unclear whether Mr. Bush's emphasis on economic dangers will help him win votes for his tax plan.
John Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, said across-the-board cuts in income tax rates, as Mr. Bush has proposed, "look especially good when people start to worry about the continued growth of the economy."
But Mr. Feehery said Mr. Hastert generally preferred to address tax cuts piecemeal, believing that they had greater political appeal in bite-size chunks than when sold as a single package whose big price tag dominates the debate.
Those comments suggested that Congress might choose to deal first with the two most politically popular components of Mr. Bush's plan: an income tax cut for married couples and elimination of the federal estate tax. Bills addressing both those issues passed Congress this year with some support from Democrats, and leaders of both parties agree that there is room for a true bipartisan compromise.
Enacting a reduction in income tax rates, if it is possible at all, would almost certainly prove more time-consuming and contentious.
In discussing his priorities during the interview with CBS News, Mr. Bush singled out the so-called marriage penalty and the estate tax, but said he also remained committed to broad rate reduction.
Whatever the merits of their warnings about the possibility of a recession, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney could be stepping into a minefield by publicly emphasizing the risks to the economy.
Economies are not just about steel production and holiday sales and stock dividends. They are also about psychology, and as the financial markets have become increasingly influential in determining the economy's course, psychology has become a greater factor in the outlook.
It was in part to keep a negative attitude on Wall Street from setting off a downward spiral in stock prices, consumer confidence and economic activity that Mr. Greenspan offered reassuring words on Tuesday about the central bank's determination to keep a healthy slowdown from deteriorating into a messy downturn.
Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a research organization in Washington, said it was generally a bad thing "for a presidential administration in waiting to be talking about a recession before there's clear evidence that there's going to be one or that there is one."
"Obviously," Mr. Weisbrot said, "there are self-fulfilling prophecies here that could have a strong psychological impact."
Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said it was only responsible for the governor to raise the possibility of economic difficulties ahead and to advocate policies to deal with them.
"To ignore economic reality would be playing politics," Mr. Fleischer said. "To accurately describe the state of the economy is in the nation's best interests, now and at all times. As the governor has said, it's important for leaders to look down the road to anticipate events."

HEADLINE: Scient Warns Of Shortfall; Will Revamp And Cut Jobs

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Scient, an e-commerce consulting firm whose fortunes have mirrored the rise and downturn of the dot-com economy, said today that it would lay off 460 employees and reorganize its business as it projected that quarterly earnings would fall far short of earlier estimates.
For its fiscal third quarter, ending Dec. 31, Scient executives expect to earn revenue of $80 million and report an operating loss of $13 million, or 16 cents a share. Industry analysts had expected the company to lose 8 cents a share for the quarter. 
 In announcing the layoff of about one-quarter of Scient's workers, Bob Howe, the company's chairman and chief executive, blamed an abrupt downturn in demand for its services, which entail creating Web sites and e-commerce strategies for corporations. Mr. Howe said Scient had also had an increase of competition from other consulting firms, which were undercutting its prices.
Other Web consulting firms are suffering, too. On Tuesday, the Lante Corporation said that it expected to cut 120 jobs, or 19 percent of its work force. And Xpedior Inc. said it would eliminate 380 jobs.
In late November, another big-name new-economy consulting firm, MarchFirst, which was born of the merger of USWeb/CKS and Whittman-Hart, said that it was getting out of the business of consulting Internet start-ups and seeking to provide e-commerce strategy to more traditional businesses. Earlier, MarchFirst said it was eliminating 1,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its work force. Also in November, IXL Enterprises Inc., said that it planned to lay off 850 employees, or 36 percent of its work force.
David Sturtz, research analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston, said the cutbacks at the consulting companies were not unexpected given their reliance on capital from dot-com start-ups. "This is all a byproduct of this irrational euphoria that created the Internet boom," Mr. Sturtz said.
"There was a tremendous amount of venture capital and I.P.O. money poured into this market and that is all gone and the need for all the bodies is also gone as well," he said.
In its announcement, Scient, which is based in San Francisco, said it planned to close offices in Austin, Tex., and in Silicon Valley. It said the cost of the cutbacks would be $40 million to $45 million, but that as a result the company should save $60 million next year in expenses.
The company's stock price has been on a wild ride since Scient went public earlier this year. The stock rose to nearly $134, but today trading was halted midday, down 13 percent at $4.50. In after-hours trading, it fell to $3.44.
Mr. Sturtz said executives at Scient should not be surprised by the downturn. He said the firm had known for several months that it relied too heavily for business on Internet start-ups, backed by venture capital that many industry analysts and executives had expected to dry up. "They gorged themselves on V.C.-backed clients," said Mr. Sturtz, who downgraded the stock in August.

HEADLINE: RISKY DECISION/A special report.;
Study of Ford Explorer's Design Reveals a Series of Compromises

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Josh Barbanel contributed to this article by conducting a computer analysis of federal crash statistics.

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Dec. 6

 BODY:
Stephen Ross knew how dangerous it would be to wait.
His bosses at Ford would approve only one risky new project that year, 1986. If his new sport utility vehicle -- the one he thought the Ford Motor Company needed right away to stay competitive -- was to beat out a luxury sports car being promoted by more senior rival executives, he and his small team would have to come up with an inexpensive design. 
 So they improvised. Instead of a whole new design, which would be far too costly, they would simply bolt a roomy passenger cabin, stocked with leather seats and other family-friendly amenities, to the underbody of the existing Ranger pickup truck. The plan's crowning beauty was that the new vehicle could be built on the Ranger assembly line, using many of the same robots and auto parts.
"It's a lot riskier to do a complete new vehicle, particularly back then," Mr. Ross recalled. "In hindsight, we probably could have afforded it, but hindsight is always 20-20."
Ford called it the Explorer, and it succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams. Months after it went on sale, in April 1990, it was America's No. 1 sport utility vehicle; today, 3.2 million are on the road. And it was a gold mine: while Ford made less than $1,000 on the average sedan, the profit on an Explorer was nearly $8,000.
The Explorer was a marketing dream -- the perfect vehicle for a baby-boom generation that wanted it all. You could use it as your family car, and it had the rugged, adventurous image of a truck. The problem was, it also had the Achilles' heel of a big, tall truck: it rolled over more easily than a car would.
The roots of that problem lie in Ford's original design decision to build the new sport utility on the bones of a pickup truck instead of all in one piece, like a car.
Most other sport utility vehicles are also built on pickup truck underbodies. Indeed, many have rollover death rates considerably higher than the Explorer's. But the Explorer has become the most visible example of the problem because of recent deaths in sport utility vehicles after treads peeled off their Firestone tires.
A review of recently obtained Ford documents, as well as interviews with executives, engineers and marketers, shows how Ford designed itself into a box, then struggled to design itself back out. The biography of the Explorer reveals how executives at Ford, under great pressure to be in on the coming sport utility boom, decided to build their entry in a hurry and on a shoestring, but with only moderate attention to stability.
In succeeding years, amid rising concern about rollovers, Ford engineers strove to adapt that tippy, bouncy pickup design for a family vehicle that spent far more time racing down the highway than bumping along dirt roads. In the end, they had only limited success.
In most of the deaths linked to the Firestone tires, the vehicles were Explorers, and in almost every case they flipped over. Today, federal safety officials said the number of complaints of deaths linked to the tires had risen to 148. And while much attention has been focused on the tires, the accidents have also raised questions about the Explorer itself; in fact, tire problems have caused a tenth of the more than 1,200 Explorer rollover deaths since 1991.
An analysis of federal crash statistics by The New York Times shows the price that drivers of Explorers pay for a car with the lineage, and image, of a truck. The analysis shows that since 1991, occupants of Explorers have been 2.3 times as likely to die in rollovers -- tire-related or not -- as people in traditional cars. What is more, they are nearly twice as likely to die in rollovers as are occupants of Jeep Cherokees and Grand Cherokees, the only popular sport utilities long built like cars.
And the Explorer's fatal rollover rate has been rising considerably, according to the analysis. While the rates for cars and the Jeep sport utilities have stayed fairly steady (roughly 40 or 50 fatal rollovers per million vehicles), the rate for the Explorer rose from 53 per million in 1994 to 121 last year. Rates for other midsize pickup-based sport utilities have also risen, though not as much. Experts attribute the trend to a mix of factors, particularly growing numbers of younger drivers as middle-age parents have switched to even bigger sport utilities. Tire problems did not push up the Explorer rate significantly until last year, when they accounted for 18 of the 121 deaths per million vehicles.
The Explorer may be the sport utility leader, but it is hardly alone, and its story illuminates the kind of trade-offs other automakers made, as they tried to balance cost, safety and market appeal. Most of the 21 million sport utilities on the road -- including the Ford Expedition and Excursion; the Chevrolet Blazer, Tahoe and Suburban; the Dodge Durango; and the Toyota 4Runner -- were built on truck bases.
In the Firestone cases, Ford officials say a flaw in the tires, not the Explorer's design, was to blame. In designing the Explorer, they say, they consistently erred on the side of safety. Not only has the Explorer passed all the company's stability tests, they add, but it has the lowest rate of fatal rollovers of any similar-size pickup-based sport utility.
"Our analyses continue to find that the Explorer is a very safe vehicle and has performed very well in the hands of its customers since its introduction 10 years ago," said Ernest Grush, Ford's manager of safety-data analysis.
But many auto-safety experts have argued that there was a cocktail of blame behind the accidents -- that after the tires failed, the Explorer's pickup-truck base and high center of gravity made it harder to control, while drivers often made the fatal mistake of swerving at high speed.
Mr. Ross said the company had considered stability issues in early designs. But another Ford manager on the original project said rollovers had not become a priority until a controversy erupted in the late 1980's over the rollover record of the Bronco II, which was also based on a Ranger underbody.
"At the time we locked up the design of the Explorer, we had no knowledge of the rollover problems of the Bronco," said the manager, who insisted on anonymity to avoid being identified by company executives or lawyers suing the company. "It all hit later."
And by then it was too late, for Ford and the other automakers as well.
"There was a flurry of 'Let's have a sport utility,' and look around for the nearest platform," said Brian O'Neill, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which is financed by insurers seeking to reduce the cost of crash claims. "I don't think a lot of thought went into a lot of these designs. There was a bandwagon, a gravy train, that they couldn't afford not to jump on."
 
The Creation
Facing Trouble In Detroit
The mid-1980's were tough years for Detroit. Two oil shocks had nearly bankrupted Ford and Chrysler and humbled even General Motors. When the American economy began recovering in 1983, the soaring dollar allowed Americans to buy Japanese cars much more cheaply.
But as gas prices fell, the American auto industry began to sense salvation in a group of obscure, and relatively fuel-inefficient, vehicles known as light trucks: sport utility vehicles, pickups and minivans. Chrysler introduced the first modern minivan in November 1983, and the same autumn brought the Jeep Cherokee, the first four-door sport utility with the comforts of a car. Buyers snapped them up.
Observing popular culture, Ford recognized why Cherokees were selling so well. The rugged Western look was in style for clothing, partly because of Ronald Reagan's popularity. The researchers paid particular attention to Hollywood, where the top box-office draws were films like "Top Gun," "Rocky IV" and "Rambo First Blood, Part II." Americans, the researchers concluded, wanted automobiles that communicated ruggedness, individuality and an outdoor spirit.
The clear answer, Ford's light-truck team decided, was what, by the standards of the day, would be an unusually large sport utility vehicle.
"The Ford Explorer has the message, 'I'm big, I'm tall, I'm prepared to explore the world,' " said Dr. Clotaire Rapaille, chairman of Archetype Discoveries, a psychological research company that works for Ford and other automakers. Its name constantly brings that message home. "The letter "x" means outside, exterior, exploration," Dr. Rapaille pointed out.
Ford's research found that potential Explorer buyers cared a lot about their image and that the image they hoped to be envied for often had little to do with the way they actually used their Explorers. While they were unlikely to drive off-road even on vacation, for instance, they wanted four-wheel drive because it suggested they took adventurous trips.
From a marketing standpoint, that week or so of vacation became "the most important week of the year," said Mr. Ross, now the vehicle development director for Ford's Land Rover subsidiary in Britain.
So as it rolled out the Explorer in 1990, Ford began a marketing campaign to build the Explorer's image as a versatile vehicle that could take its owners anywhere their fantasies led them. Television ads consistently showed the Explorer going on adventurous trips, traveling over rock fields and mountain tracks, instead of running errands, a much more common use. Soon Ford added references to luxury. One ad showed a couple splitting their time between a Manhattan penthouse and a country cottage. In 1995 and again this year the Explorer became the nation's best-selling family vehicle.
Of course, the adventure ads overlooked the Explorer's shortcomings in everyday driving. The rollover problem was the most significant. But there were others.
Off-road, for instance, four-wheel drive helps motorists free themselves from deep snow and mud, but it provides little, if any, advantage on roads that are merely wet or covered with light snow. And off-road vehicles tend to be harder to stop. The four-wheel-drive Explorer needs 164 feet to stop from 60 miles an hour, 20 to 30 feet more than a typical family car.
The driving habits of many Explorer owners did not help. An extensive Ford survey in 1993 found that sport utility buyers said they drove faster than other motorists drove, followed other vehicles more closely than other drivers did and were especially likely to risk driving in bad weather.
Off-road driving also requires a high floor, so that the vehicle does not scrape its gas tank and other important components on rocks, and so that the wheels have plenty of room to bounce up and down. But a high floor limits cargo space and makes it harder for people to climb in and out, particularly the elderly.
The Explorer, in short, had a case of ambiguous identity. It said so right there in the "special notice" at the front of the owner's manual: "Your vehicle is not a passenger car."
 
The Problem
Unpleasant Surprise In Rollovers
In early 1989, with the Explorer just a year from mass production, Ford executives found themselves with a puzzle.
Consumer Reports, enormously influential in the auto industry, had just criticized the Explorer's two-door ancestor, the Bronco II, for a tendency to roll over during certain high-speed turns. Having already designed most of the Explorer and ordered its parts, company documents show, Ford grasped anxiously for a solution.
Ford executives, by their own account, were surprised by the extent of the Bronco's problems. Even so, rollover problems had plagued sport utilities since primitive truck-based ones were built for the military during World War II. Indeed, costly rollover lawsuits involving truck-based Jeeps had pushed American Motors to design the Cherokee from scratch as a sport utility vehicle in the early 1980's.
But once a sport utility is built on a pickup-truck base, particularly a base designed for another vehicle, it is extremely difficult to make it as stable as a well-designed car-based model, most auto engineers say.
Car-based vehicles have two main advantages, they say. Their seats -- and hence their centers of gravity -- are considerably lower. And since they are built as a single unit, they are more rigid than vehicles whose passenger compartments and underbodies are manufactured separately.
No matter how firmly bolted together, tall vehicles based on pickup trucks are more prone to sway during sharp turns, said Roy Lunn, a legendary designer of Ford sports cars who later designed the Cherokee. This is especially true of the Explorer and other vehicles with "leaf spring" suspensions -- a cheap, simple design dating back to buggy days.
To make a pickup-based sport utility as rigid as a car-based model, Mr. Lunn added, "you would have yourself such a heavy chassis that it wouldn't be practical, so you just live with it."
As the Ford engineers pondered their problem in 1989, they would have to live with that first design decision made three years before. To undo it would have set the Explorer back years more, and besides, this was the Explorer they wanted. So again, they improvised.
They came up with three options, company documents show. They could choose shorter suspension springs to lower the front end by half an inch and the back by an inch. They could recommend a fairly low tire pressure, which would give the Explorer a more stable ride (except when a tire failed) -- as well as the softer ride favored by people accustomed to cars. And they could redesign the entire vehicle to mount the wheels two inches farther apart.
They chose the first two. And when prototypes passed Ford's stability test, they decided against the widening, which would have been extremely time-consuming and expensive. "Utilize as many of the chassis revisions as possible without delaying Job 1," said a Ford memorandum, using industry jargon for beginning mass production of a new model.
The decision making shows how they weighed costs and benefits -- and, ultimately, were hemmed in by the original design as they tried to make that tippy truck into a safer family vehicle.
On the one hand, they did improve stability. On the other, the more radical option would have made it even safer. According to the government's new rollover ratings, which rank vehicles from one to five stars, the changes Ford made each added a quarter star. The widening would have added three-eighths more.
In the end, though, what they did not do was make the Explorer as stable as a traditional car or sport utility built on a car base, according to crash statistics and the rollover ratings, which compare the height of a vehicle's center of gravity with its width -- the lower and wider the better. The Cherokee scores near the top of the two-star group in the five-star ratings, while the Explorer is at the low end. (A Ford Taurus sedan, by comparison, rates four or five stars, depending on the model year.)
Mr. Ross, the Explorer planner, said a pickup-based sport utility could be as stable as a car-based model. In the case of the Explorer, he said, Ford's primary stability goal had been to make it better than the other sport utilities on the market at the time.
Ford took a similar tack several years later, with the 1995 Explorer. The front suspension was redesigned to be somewhat less prone to rollovers, but the new suspension was also lighter, providing less weight down low in the vehicle. Ford rejected a costly move to lower the engine, so the Explorer's center of gravity actually rose slightly.
 
The Trade-Offs
Along With Benefits, Design Liabilities
Automobile design is a matter of trade-offs. And often, dealing with one problem only adds to another.
For instance, using the Ranger's underbody for the Explorer gave Ford the image it wanted, with the budget it needed. But while the Explorer looked roomy, its design actually limited the weight it could safely carry.
By extending the passenger compartment and installing a second row of seats, Ford made the Explorer more than 600 pounds heavier than the Ranger but did not upgrade the suspension and tires to carry the bigger load. That meant a typically equipped Explorer could carry 1,025 pounds, even less than the 1,100 pounds for a Taurus. Many Explorers are built to carry as little as 900 pounds --a 150-pound person in each of five seats and 150 pounds of cargo.
Sport utility vehicles are more prone to roll over when heavily loaded because the seats and cargo area are above the vehicles' center of gravity. By contrast, the stability of cars and minivans is less affected when they are full because the passengers and cargo are situated at roughly the cars' and minivans' center of gravity.
Whether overloading played a role in the Firestone tire failures is not clear. Some of the Explorers that crashed were stuffed with people and luggage; some were not. In general, though, overloading "can really affect your stability and handling," said Donald F. Tandy, an engineer who oversaw much of the early work on the Explorer.
Another trade-off involved the tires. Ford chose the same size tires it had long chosen for the Ranger. Those tires had the lowest possible rating for withstanding high temperatures. And when the company lowered the recommended tire pressure in 1989 to increase stability and soften the ride, it also further reduced the tires' ability to carry weight without overheating.
Tire pressure became an issue in the Firestone controversy, with Firestone arguing that the lower recommended pressure -- 26 pounds per square inch, compared with 35 for the Ranger -- had contributed to the tires' failure, especially where Explorers were being driven at high speeds in high temperatures.
For its part, Ford pointed out that Goodyear tires inflated to the same pressure almost never failed on Explorers, and that Firestone had endorsed the recommendation for nearly 10 years, until it recalled 6.5 million tires last summer. Even so, Ford recently raised the recommended pressure to 30 pounds.
Sometimes, the trade-offs are not intended, and not understood until much later.
Ford believed the Explorer's size and design made it safe, Mr. Ross said, and Explorer occupants do have an unusually low death rate in multivehicle crashes. But he acknowledged that planners had scarcely considered whether the Explorer, while safer for its own occupants in a crash with a lower-riding car, was more deadly to other motorists.
Pickup-based designs are much deadlier to other motorists than are car-based models because these vehicles are heavier and taller and rely on two stiff, heavy steel beams that run the length of the underbody and curve up like runners of a sleigh. Instead of crumpling and absorbing shock, these beams tend to slide up and over cars' bumpers and door sills, punching into the other vehicle's passenger compartment.
Quantifying that danger is difficult.
Ford says it has no specific statistics for the Explorer. Its senior traffic-safety researcher, Priya Prasad, said the designs of all light trucks were responsible for an extra 1,000 deaths a year in other vehicles.
One statistician, Hans Joksch of the University of Michigan, has studied the deadliness of the Explorer's design. Explorers cause 115 to 140 deaths a year in vehicles they strike, while big cars of the same weight cause 30 to 40. So the Explorer's design appears to cost about 100 extra lives a year -- almost as many deaths each year as in tire-related crashes of Explorers over the entire decade.
 
The New Explorer
Making Safety A Higher Priority
Ford is trying to position itself as the industry's safety leader, so when it invited reporters last month to see the completely redesigned 2002 Explorer, engineers waxed particularly enthusiastic about new safety features.
The tires are larger, with a higher recommended pressure. The vehicle is two and a half inches wider -- the option discarded in 1989 as too expensive and time-consuming. The stiff steel rails of a pickup-truck underbody remain, but Ford lowered them considerably when it exchanged the Explorer's primitive suspension for a sophisticated car-like one, a change that also improved the braking to car quality. And the new underbody can no longer be built on the same assembly line as a Ranger.
Taken together, these changes should mean that the Explorer would be less likely to roll over and less deadly to other motorists as well. But the decisions to incorporate them were actually made several years ago, before the tire cases threw a spotlight on the Explorer's stability.
Impressed by the success of the Durango, with its third row of seats, Ford decided to add a third row to the Explorer as well. The width, tire sizes, suspension strength and maximum payload were increased mainly to accommodate the extra passengers and make the Explorer more competitive with other models, though stability was also considered, Ford executives said.
The rails were also redesigned to curve down just behind the grille. Mr. Prasad said this change seemed obvious only with hindsight.
More than half all midsize and large S.U.V.'s have been redesigned the last two years to be less deadly to other motorists.
Even so, Mr. Tandy cautioned that while engineers could do much to make certain models more stable, sport utilities would always be somewhat more rollover-prone than cars because of their greater height.
"Light trucks in general will have a higher rollover rate," he said, "because of all the things that make an S.U.V. an S.U.V."

Chart: "The Explorer: Product of an Imperfect Marriage"
Ford designed its Explorer on a shoestring budget in the late 1980's, bolting a roomy car-like passenger cabin on top of the underbody of a Ranger pickup truck. The high- riding design made the vehicle more prone to rolling over. Here are some of the design features of the Explorer -- many of them shared by other pickup-based sport utilities -- that have contributed to the vehicle's rollover problems and the steps Ford is taking to fix them on the 2002 model, which goes on sale in February.
 
PAYLOAD -- Ford did not tell buyers the maximum weight the vehicle could carry, even though overloaded vehicles are vulnerable to rollovers.
CHANGE ON 2002 MODEL: Will provide information on stickers in door jambs.
 
SIDES AND ROOF -- Sides are almost vertical, barely leaning in as they go up to the roof.
CHANGE ON 2002 MODEL: Roof will be a half-inch narrower, with the sides tapering in. This improves stability when luggage fills the interior to the ceiling.
 
TRACK WIDTH -- Wheels are only as far apart as on the Ranger, even though the Explorer is a bigger, more top-heavy vehicle.
CHANGE ON 2002 MODEL: Wheels will be mounted 2 1 /2 inches farther apart.
 
REAR SUSPENSION -- The Explorer uses a leaf-spring suspension dating back to buggies that slows braking and lets wheels slip sideways.
CHANGE ON 2002 MODEL: Will use costlier, carlike coil springs that improve braking and are more resistant to sideways wheel movements.
 
REAR SUSPENSION MOUNTS -- The frame rails are bolted on top of the suspension, so the vehicle's cargo floor is high.
CHANGE ON 2002 MODEL: Coil springs will be attached to rods that go through holes in the rails, lowering the cargo floor six inches.
 
GAS TANK -- It is mounted on the same side of the vehicle as the four-wheel- drive system, putting extra weight on the left rear tire, which has failed more frequently than other tires.
CHANGE ON 2002 MODEL: Will be moved to the opposite side of the underbody.
 
FRAME RAILS -- Shaped like the letter C, they are open on one side, making them less stiff and therefore less stable. They also curve up at the front, making them more likely to override car bumpers in crashes.
CHANGE ON 2002 MODEL: Will have enclosed rails, which make the vehicle stiffer, except at the front, where holes have been punched in the rails to help them absorb energy during a crash. The new frame rails also will curve down at the front.

 BODY:

NEW YORK
 
MANHATTAN: WOMAN MINIMIZES ROLE IN DEATH -- A woman who was convicted with a friend in the 1997 slaying of a man in Central Park testified in a deposition this week that she had played only a minimal part in the crime. The woman, Daphne Abdela, and her friend Christopher Vasquez, both now 18, are being tried in a $150 million wrongful-death suit for the killing of Michael McMorrow, a 44-year-old real estate broker, in May 1997. Mr. McMorrow was repeatedly stabbed, then disemboweled, and his body left in a park lake. Ms. Abdela, who pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter, for which she is serving a 10-year maximum sentence, testified for the first time under oath Tuesday that it was Mr. Vasquez alone who stabbed Mr. McMorrow, according to her lawyer, Paul Callan. Arnold N. Kriss, the lawyer for Mr. Vasquez, would not comment. Lawyers for the McMorrow family said both defendants were responsible. Eun Lee Koh (NYT) 

BROOKLYN: SCHOOL GUARD DEPLOYMENT -- The way the city deploys 3,700 safety officers in 1,200 public schools is being reviewed, safety officials told the Board of Education yesterday. The officials hope to increase the number of agents at crowded schools and at schools with multiple buildings. The authorities are also considering expanding a program of parent patrols being used successfully in Community School District 6 in Upper Manhattan. Terri Thomson, above, the board member representing Queens, said some schools seemed understaffed, including Public School 19 in Corona, Queens, where two agents patrol a six-story elementary school with five temporary buildings and 2,100 students.

MANHATTAN: COLUMBIA STUDENT DIES -- The police are investigating the death of a 19-year-old Columbia University student who they say jumped or fell from the eighth floor of a campus apartment building to the ground-floor lobby around 3 a.m. yesterday. The student, who was identified as Andrea Melendez, was taken to St. Luke's Hospital, where she died of her injuries, the police said. Ms. Melendez was a sophomore at Columbia. She was apparently a resident of the building, at 562 West 113th Street. Nichole M. Christian (NYT)
 
BRONX: 2 CRITICALLY HURT IN FIRE -- A 71-year-old woman and her daughter, 52, were in critical condition yesterday after a fire erupted in their sixth-floor Bronx apartment, the authorities said. The woman, Idela Harris, and her daughter Louise Harris were admitted to Jacobi Medical Center's burn unit, a hospital spokeswoman said. Three firefighters were treated for smoke inhalation. It was not clear yesterday what caused the fire, which broke out at 1134 Burke Avenue at 6:47 a.m. and was under control by 7:29 a.m., a Fire Department spokesman said. Elissa Gootman (NYT)
 
MELVILLE: HOME LOAN FORECLOSURES -- Senator Charles E. Schumer called on the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development yesterday to impose an immediate moratorium on foreclosures of federal home loans in Long Island communities that have the highest rates of loan defaults. Hundreds of homeowners in Brookhaven, Patchogue, Wyandanch, Coram and Central Islip have said they are unable to make mortgage payments or pay for repairs on their homes. They had received appraisals and mortgages from what Mr. Schumer called predatory lenders who appraised properties at inflated rates. HUD said it would make a decision within seven days. Tina Kelley (NYT)
 
MINEOLA: CELL PHONE BILL INTRODUCED -- The Nassau County Legislature is considering a ban on the use of cell phones while driving. The proposed law, introduced by Presiding Officer Judith Jacobs yesterday, would ban people from using cell phones while driving in Nassau County unless they use a hands-free device like an earphone. Emergency calls are exempted. Violators would be fined $150. If adopted, the law will go into effect on March 1. Tina Kelley (NYT)
 
CONNECTICUT
 
HARTFORD: AIRPORT ECONOMIC STUDY -- A new economic study reported yesterday that Bradley International Airport generated $2.5 billion annually for the region's economy, including $700 million in wages paid to 26,000 employees. The so-called direct impacts of the airport, in Windsor Locks, were estimated to be $334 million annually, led primarily by government operations, including the military. Paul Zielbauer (NYT)
 
NEW MILFORD: PRAYER CLUB ORDERED CLOSED -- A couple have sued the zoning commission after being ordered to stop holding weekly prayer meetings in their home for as many as 40 people. Kathy Castagnetta, the town's zoning enforcement officer, said meetings of that size, no matter what their purpose, were not a permitted use of a residential property under the town's zoning code. The couple, Robert and Mary Murphy, have filed a federal lawsuit charging that their First Amendment rights are being violated. (NYT)
 
NEW JERSEY
 
TRENTON: WORKER SHORTAGE -- A business group said yesterday that New Jersey businesses were facing the greatest worker shortage in 30 years. The group, the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, surveyed 16,500 member companies in September. Eighty percent of the companies said they had had trouble finding skilled workers last year. Forty-eight percent said the skilled-worker shortage had curtailed business expansion plans. (NYT)
 
TRENTON: GATES GIVES MILLIONS TO SCHOOLS -- The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced a $5.1 million grant to help teach New Jersey school principals and superintendents how to make the best use of computer technology. New Jersey is the 12th state whose school administrators have received such a grant, which is part of the foundation's total commitment of $350 million to education. The foundation derives much of its assets from shares of Microsoft Corporation, which Mr. Gates and a partner founded. Steve Strunsky (NYT)
 
CHERRY HILL: RACETRACK SOLD -- Garden State Race Track, in decline since casino gambling arrived in Atlantic City in the 1970's, has been sold and will be replaced by a 230-acre residential and commercial development, said Dennis Maloomian, president of Realen Properties in Berwyn, Pa., yesterday. The company and a partner bought the track last week from International Thoroughbred Breeders. Steve Strunsky (NYT)

HEADLINE: Hot Economy Cooling Down? Not New York's

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Every day brings new evidence that the once-booming national economy is slowing; even Alan Greenspan says so. But take a walk almost anywhere in Manhattan -- jostled by the leather-wearing, cell-phone-wielding, taxicab-grabbing, shopping-bag-swinging hordes -- and you have to wonder: what slowdown?
Economists here are wondering, too. They know from sad experience that New York City is not immune to national economic trends. They see some small clouds on the horizon, and a big black one called Wall Street. They are poring over data on jobs and housing and taxes, looking for signs of a slowdown. 
 "So far, we just don't see it," said Larian Angelo, chief economist for the City Council.
Private economists agree. "The New York City economy is not going to march to a different drummer forever," said Marc M. Goloven, senior regional economist at Chase Manhattan Bank. "But so far, there is very little evidence of a slowdown."
New York City, for so many years the country's economic problem child, the place that was hit the hardest during the last recession, that lagged while the rest of the nation boomed, has now shot to the top of the heap.
At 5.5 percent, the unemployment rate is as low as it has been in a dozen years. Tax collections are up, and a local measure of business activity just hit an all-time high. Since March, the economy of the city has been growing far more robustly than that of the nation.
Most important, the city's private employers are creating jobs at the fastest pace in half a century and far faster than the national average. "We've never really seen anything quite like it in our historical records," said John L. Wieting, regional commissioner of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Part of what makes New York City different is simply its mix of industries; there is no Detroit Stock Exchange, after all, and this is not exactly Motor City. The city was also late to the national economic party, and to some extent has just been making up for lost time.
The relative shortness of the recovery here may even bode well if there is another economic downturn. "It's not conclusive," said Jason Bram, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. "But often, regions that get hit hard in one recession are not hit as hard in the next one."
Look hard enough and you can find some indications of softening. But even the experts cannot tell if these numbers mean that the economy is slowing down or just that people are coming to their senses after a multiyear spending spree.
For example, more hotel rooms were empty this October than in October of last year, the first drop in occupancy rates since last December, when the expected millennial windfall did not materialize, according to PKF Consulting, which tracks the hotel industry.
That does not mean, however, that it is easy to book a room at the Plaza (or the Carlyle or the Waldorf-Astoria). The new, lower occupancy rate is 87.5 percent, despite an increase in the number of hotel rooms in the city and a 9 percent increase in room rates over the last year, said John A. Fox, senior vice president of PKF. It is most unusual, he said, "for any major city to have occupancy rates in the high 80's or low 90's for any sustained period," as the city has for almost a year.
Retail sales may have cooled off a bit, too, after last year's holiday frenzy, but are still growing. During the 10-day shopathon that followed Thanksgiving, purchases in New York City rose by 2 percent compared with last year, according to one indicator from TeleCheck Services, which monitors payments made by check. That increase is well below the national average of 3.2 percent.
But it is unclear whether some shoppers here have been spooked by the stock market or are simply procrastinating because Hanukkah is late this year, said William Ford, a professor at Middle Tennessee State University and an adviser to TeleCheck.
Of course, the barrage of bad national economic news, the stock market's swoon and the continuing fight over who gets to live in the White House are having at least a psychological effect. A monthly survey of local businesspeople found that their expectations for the future had tumbled over the last two months, even as they said current business conditions were excellent.
And New Yorkers preparing to plunk down hundreds of thousands of dollars for apartments are also "a little bit more hesitant with everything that's going on," said Diane M. Ramirez, president of the Halstead Property Company.
But apartments are not going begging for buyers. Although prices are no longer soaring, they are holding, Ms. Ramirez said, adding that she becomes concerned when an apartment sells for less than what a similar apartment in the same building fetched six months ago. She has not seen that yet this year.
The city's economy has built up so much momentum in the last year that it may well take months to slow down, some economists say. "New York City is like a great big supertanker that goes steaming ahead," said John Tepper Marlin, chief economist for the city comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi.
For example, he said, despite the carnage among the Internet companies known as dot-coms, October was one of the best job-creating months in the last five years for the business services sector, which includes many dot-coms as well as accounting firms, computer programming firms and temporary-help agencies.
The demise of dot-coms also freed up commercial real estate in the city, which was snapped up by financial firms that had been frantically seeking more space, said Bruce E. Mosler, president of United States operations at Cushman & Wakefield, the big commercial real estate brokerage. "Vacancy rates are declining, not rising, and rents continue to rise," he said, adding that he does not expect the market to quiet down until the middle of next year.
All this buoyant economic news does not extend to the entire downstate region. Job growth has slowed in the northern suburbs and on Long Island, and has stalled in parts of New Jersey and Connecticut, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The culprit, however, may not be a slowing economy, but a shortage of workers. In most of the places where job growth is slow, the unemployment rate is less than 3 percent -- and in Stamford, Conn., it is a minuscule 1.2 percent. Why create a new job if you can't find someone to take it?
Nationally, places where companies make stuff -- cars, combines, computers -- have been experiencing the biggest slowdowns, said Mark Zandi, who is the chief economist at Economy.com, which tracks regional trends. (These days, only a relative handful of jobs in New York City -- fewer than 7 percent -- are in manufacturing.)
High-tech centers like San Francisco, Boston and Austin, Tex., are also showing some weakness as individuals and corporations throttle back on their computer purchases, he said.
The fact that New York City is neither a high-tech mecca nor a manufacturing powerhouse does not mean the future here is necessarily bright, Mr. Zandi said. He worries about the outlook for the city's most important industry: Wall Street.
"If the equity market continues to struggle as it has been," he said, "I think the city's going to hit a wall."
Struggle is a mild word for the gyrations of the stock market this week. It soared on Tuesday, after Mr. Greenspan said the Federal Reserve would act to head off any recession if the economy slowed too much. Yesterday, though, the market swooned again as some big companies warned that their earnings would be poor.
The Dow Jones industrial average is down more than 7 percent this year, and technology stocks, as measured by the Nasdaq index, have plunged about 31 percent.
This is bad news not only for investors, but also for Wall Street. When stocks decline, securities firms may make a little money from trading, but they lose the huge fees they make from initial public offerings and mergers.
Those high-profit businesses boomed in the first half of the year, sending Wall Street profits to record levels. But business fell during the third quarter of the year, and October and November have been even worse.
The stock market is not the only problem. The bond business has also been bad. And securities firms have been hit with a wave of mergers.
Industry estimates suggest that 10,000 workers will be laid off, most of them in New York. (About 5,000 will come from Chase Manhattan's purchase of J. P. Morgan, which sounds like a bank but is really an investment firm.) That sounds like a lot, but almost 180,000 people work in New York's securities industry; even they are a relative drop in the city's bucket of 3.7 million jobs.
There is some debate, as much political as economic, about how much the city's economy depends on Wall Street. Democrats tend to say the city leans on the securities business more and more; Republicans contend that the city's economy is becoming increasingly diverse.
The industry itself sides, for once, with the Democrats on this issue, and is now warning of a cataclysm for the city if its profits plunge.
"The disaster to the city's and state's budgets, economies and job markets from a declining securities industry could be biblical in proportion," according to a new report from the Securities Industry Association. (The industry, not coincidentally, is angling for more favorable tax treatment.)
Jobs are not the only, or even the biggest, issue. So many Wall Street jobs pay so well that the securities business has been the biggest driver of income gains in the city, and of tax collections, too.
Wall Street's lavish year-end bonuses, roughly $12 billion last year, accounted for about 7 percent of all the wages paid in the city, according to the industry association. Frank Fernandez, the group's chief economist, said that this year, bonuses will be the same as last year's, or "maybe down fractionally."
The New York State comptroller's office, however, just estimated that bonuses would reach a record $13.3 billion because of gains earlier in the year.
Tax collections, then, may not be much lower this year. But the association warns that 2000 bonuses "may be the last large infusion into the local economy from the industry in the near future."
Then there's the outlook for all the restaurants, cigar merchants, limousine services, jewelry purveyors and assorted sellers of life's little (and big) luxuries. Because of the uncertainty on Wall Street, this may not be a great time to be a Jaguar dealer, said Joan Zimmerman, executive vice president of G. Z. Stephens, an executive recruitment firm.
"I just think there will be fewer diamonds," she said, "and a little less champagne popped."

HEADLINE: Reversing Course, Accounting Board Eases Stance on Mergers

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The accounting rule-making body in the United States reversed course on a contentious issue yesterday and agreed to change accounting rules in a way that will substantially raise reported profits for companies that acquire other companies.
The rule makers, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, reversing a tentative decision it had made last year, ruled that good will -- the asset created when companies pay more to acquire each other than the book value of the underlying assets -- need not be written off over any particular period. 
 Instead, good will would be allowed to remain on the books indefinitely, until the company determines that the operations of the acquired company are performing so poorly that a write-off is needed.
In the corporate world, merger accounting has long been a highly contentious area, with companies seeking rules that would allow them to look good. The standards board is moving to end one of two ways that mergers are now accounted for, the so-called pooling method, that companies have long preferred.
The prospect of its elimination aroused fierce opposition from many businesses, which argued that changing the merger rules would make it harder for companies to merge, and legislation was introduced in Congress to stop the board from acting.
The new plan, which the board accepted in a unanimous vote, would eliminate pooling but would also make the alternative approach, known as purchase accounting, much more palatable to business.
"There is an element of compromise in this decision," said Robert Willens, an accounting analyst for Lehman Brothers. "It was clear that, as a political matter, for them to have any chance to eliminate pooling, they had to make purchase more attractive."
Edmund L. Jenkins, the chairman of the accounting standards board, said in an interview that political factors were not paramount in the decision. "Will this make some of our critics go away?" he said. "I expect that will be the case, but I also think the decision is well grounded."
Mr. Jenkins said that some intangible assets, as good will is formally known, clearly do not lose value over time. He said that if the board could design a rigorous test that companies must apply in deciding whether assets are impaired, and thus must be written down, it would provide more information for investors than an arbitrary standard requiring that assets be written off over a certain schedule. The current rule requires that assets be written down over 40 years or less, a timetable the board had decided to cut to 20 years before it reversed course yesterday.
With a 20-year write-down period, a company that bought another for $1 billion more than the book value of its assets would have $1 billion in good will, and writing it off would cut reported profits by $50 million a year. Under the new proposal, the reported profits would be that much higher, unless the company concluded that the asset needed to be written off because its value was impaired.
The current rule on when assets are deemed to be impaired, and thus must be written down, has been criticized because it allows so much discretion to executives that write-downs can seem arbitrary. They often come as part of a "big bath," in which a new management takes a large loss that can be attributed to the previous management.
Jane Adams, an accounting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston and a former deputy chief accountant at the S.E.C., said: "I expect that the Securities and Exchange Commission will have some concerns relative to the adequacy of impairment models. Will the model be rigid enough to keep the good will impairment write-downs from being absolutely discretionary?"
Lynn Turner, the S.E.C.'s chief accountant, declined to comment on the Accounting Standards Board's decision. The board is a private-sector organization; the S.E.C. has the authority to overrule its decisions.
The decision was praised by Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who had opposed legislative action but pushed for the action the board took yesterday. "I think this is a sound approach, an economic approach," he said.
For companies, the new rule may come to seem the best of all worlds. Pooling accounting, which companies love because it does not require them to put good will on the balance sheet, has other problems. To use it, companies must use common stock to pay for the acquisition and are restricted from making future stock buybacks or selling assets of the acquired company for up to two years. That leads to companies' delaying the sale of assets they do not want, simply to ensure the accounting treatment they prefer.
Dennis Powell, the controller of Cisco Systems and an advocate of keeping pooling accounting, said the board's decision would "make the purchase method of accounting more effective and realistic."
The board has not decided whether companies merged under the old rules will no longer have to amortize good will. A final rule is not expected before spring, and its effective date has not been disclosed.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 9, 2000, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Thursday about a change in accounting rules for writing off "good will" defined the expression incorrectly. It is the difference between what one company pays for another and the fair market value of the acquired company's assets -- not the book value of those assets, which is the value on the company's balance sheet.

HEADLINE: ART GUIDE

 BODY:
A selective listing by critics of The New York Times of new or noteworthy art, design and photography exhibitions at New York museums and art galleries this weekend. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free. * denotes a highly recommended show.
 
Museums
 
"AMAZONS OF THE AVANT-GARDE," Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500 (through Jan. 7). A concise exercise, monographically arranged, this show focuses on six Russian women who painted around the time of the revolution. Several continued to work much later and do more than paint, but this is a tendentious affair, plausibly so. If just a couple of the women, Natalia Goncharova and Liubov Popova, were truly great painters, the exhibition still isn't a case of special pleading. The Russian avant-garde wouldn't have been what it was without them collectively. The story as it unfolds here seems, if anything, more remarkable, not less, for having as little to do with sex as it does and almost everything to do with painting. Many of the works have a surprising fortitude. Revolution. A brave new art world. The dream persists even though the form it takes keeps changing. Hours: Sundays through Wednesdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $12; $8 for students and the elderly (Michael Kimmelman). 

 * "A CENTURY OF DESIGN, PART 3: 1950-1975," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through April 1). Free form, a fixation on the curve, the bulge and the hollow, was the aesthetic of international design in the 1950's, to be augmented by the influence of Pop, Op and other art trends in the 60's and 70's. Designers welcomed new materials and worked the old in new ways, using plastics, rubber, steel, fiberglass, leather and synthetic fabrics. This show, the third in a four-part cycle meant to cover the whole of 20th-century design, is from the Met's own collections, so it can't be regarded as a survey of the field. Still, the show works hard and successfully to clue you in, presenting familiar icons of the period, like chairs by Harry Bertoia and Eero Saarinen, and more offbeat material like the brilliantly retro writing desk (circa 1953-54) by the Italian designers Gio Ponti and Piero Fornasetti. Hours: Sundays and Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 8:45 p.m. Admission: $10; $5, students and the elderly (Grace Glueck)
 
 * "THE EMBODIED IMAGE: CHINESE CALLIGRAPHY FROM THE JOHN B. ELLIOTT COLLECTION," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Jan. 7). In China the written word has traditionally been the highest art form and a source of political and emotional power. To see that power in action, check out this grandly scaled exhibition, which brings together two superb calligraphy collections -- from Princeton University and the Met -- in the most comprehensive survey yet seen in these parts. The dozens of scrolls covered with handwritten words collectively radiate a kind of conversational buzz and suggest a richly varied cast of personalities: fastidious court functionaries, impulsive social agitators, unworldly monks, visionary poets. Together they offer an icebreaking introduction to an art that to anyone who doesn't know Chinese can seem unapproachable. Hours and admission: See above (Holland Cotter).
 
 LEE KRASNER, Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 7). Despite its restless energy and moments of formal power and elegance, Lee Krasner's career in this economical retrospective looks more like one of tantalizing frustration than real fulfillment. In the 1950's and early 60's, Krasner painted splattery, ambitious Abstract Expressionist works, but they look indebted to other artists, Pollock and de Kooning mainly. Where she looks most herself is in collage; a set of large collages on canvas from the early 50's have raw density or explosive buoyancy. Collages made in the 1970's using 40-year-old charcoal drawings have a beautiful Cubistic elegance; they are the best works of her career. Hours: Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of each month); Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: $4; $2 for students and the elderly (Ken Johnson).
 
 * "OPEN ENDS," Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, (212) 708-9480 (through Jan. 2). The third and final cycle of "MOMA 2000" covers 1960 to the present and fills nearly the entire museum with almost a dozen different theme shows. "White" is one theme. Memorial art is another. Childhood and lost innocence is yet another. Like previous installments in this year-and-a-half-long navel-gazing reconsideration by the museum of how to present its permanent collection in anticipation of its future home, the show has the effect of being clever and a little too solipsistic: it's about smart curators making occasionally vivid and previously unseen connections among disparate works without making particularly fresh sense of the period as a whole. It's artistic game playing, highly pleasurable up to a point. The themes are always arguable, which is part of the game. This also becomes an occasion for the museum to parade acquisitions during the last decade, which include Gerhard Richter's series of paintings based on the Baader-Meinhof gang, occupying an entire room and probably the exhibition's high point. Hours: Saturdays through Tuesdays, and Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 8:15 p.m. Admission: $10; $6.50, students and the elderly (Kimmelman).
 
 * SCYTHIAN GOLD. "The Golden Deer of Eurasia: Scythian and Sarmatian Treasures From the Russian Steppes," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710 (through Feb. 4). "Gold of the Nomads: Scythian Treasures From Ancient Ukraine," Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000 (through Jan. 21). Certain kinds of art are box-office gold. Art made of gold is one of them, and there's a Fort Knox-size supply of the precious stuff in these two opulent exhibitions. The Brooklyn show is a survey-style glimpse at some exquisitely wrought 14-carat objects drawn from museums in Ukraine, where the Scythians put down roots in the first millennium B.C. The Met has drop-dead museological rarities from the State Hermitage Museum, but the focus here, which gives the proceedings a kind of treasure-hunt thrill, is on a cache of objects excavated fairly recently from tombs belonging to non-Scythian people whose identity is something of a mystery. Ideally, the two shows should be seen together: they offer a really substantial archaeological update on the last big Scythian showcase in these parts, the Met's smash-hot "In the Land of the Scythians" of 25 years ago. Hours and admission: See above (Cotter).
 
 * EDWARD STEICHEN, Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676 (through Feb. 4). A big, thorough exhibition, maybe a little too big and glossy, of one of the great photographers in American history, a restless, benign, flawed genius. Steichen also painted, made films, designed textiles, organized aerial reconnaissance photography in two world wars and put together the most popular photography exhibition ever, "The Family of Man." We'll see how people respond to someone whose eclectic work can look, if anything, almost too elegant and self-regarding. Steichen ultimately seemed to reduce everything and everyone to props to demonstrate his own refined and stage-savvy sensibility. But what refinement. His best work has a finesse that borders on the erotic. Hours: Tuesdays through Thursdays, and Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $10; $8 for students and the elderly (Kimmelman).
 
 * UTOPIA: THE SEARCH FOR THE IDEAL SOCIETY IN THE WESTERN WORLD," New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089 (through Jan. 27). A pensive extravaganza, if one can imagine such a thing, with hundreds of books, manuscripts, maps, prints, photographs, bits of music, film, Nazi paraphernalia, Soviet propaganda, 1960's antiwar buttons, rock album covers and other curiosities spilling across galleries on two floors. It begins with a gigantic subject and enlarges on it, an ambitious strategy, serious, stylish and amusing. Like most library exhibitions, it is more of a reading event than a show about visual pleasure, but it has more than its share of redeeming virtues and benefits. Hours: Mondays, and Thursdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free (Kimmelman).
 
 * "JOHN WESLEY: PAINTINGS 1961-2000," P. S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084 (through Jan. 14). For 40 years Mr. Wesley's paintings have maintained the same mild form of constructive lunacy. The art world has a handful of indispensable visionaries like Mr. Wesley, who help to keep everyone else honest. You may not enjoy his show, the first full-dress local retrospective, only because simple pleasure is not the intended effect. The images are borrowed from magazines and comics: Blondie and Dagwood Bumstead, Donald Duck and young naked women, painted flat, like coloring-book designs, with delicate black outlines, and off-key colors. The style alludes to Matisse, Hokusai, Greek vase painting, Art Nouveau, Toulouse-Lautrec. Emotion is there below the comic exterior, and it is pathos, mostly. Mr. Wesley offers up sex as unquenchable desire and woeful male inadequacy, a black comedy of men chasing after women they can only dream about. Hours: Wednesdays through Sundays, noon to 6 p.m. Admission: $5 (Kimmelman).
 
 "THE YEAR ONE: ART OF THE ANCIENT WORLD EAST AND WEST," Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 879-5500 (through Jan. 14). The Met puts the millennial-marking art exhibition in a new perspective with a show that only an institution of its stature and girth could pull off. Drawn from seven departments, it revisits the beginning of the "modern era" around the time of the birth of Jesus with 150 sometimes tiny artworks that sample the nearly two dozen cultures flourishing at the beginning of the first millennium. The array stretches from imperial Rome to Han dynasty China, with many stops in between. High points include bronzes from Thailand and Indonesia, a Chinese mortuary pillar and a stunning re-creation of the frescoed bedroom of a Roman villa. The display is supposed to reflect the beginning of a new world consciousness brought on by expanding empires and trade, a thesis more complex than the actual objects can sustain. But no matter, most of them are considered masterpieces, all are beautifully installed and the opportunities for cross-cultural visual comparisons are rich. Hours and admission: See above (Roberta Smith).
 
 * "YES YOKO ONO," Japan Society, 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155 (through Jan. 14). The eye roll, a vestigial reflex, has the effect of not allowing you to see what is in front of you. It is understandably used these days to respond to celebrity spectacles passing themselves off as art events in local cultural establishments. Occasionally, however, you will miss something. You should bear this in mind here. We see Yoko Ono as she was before she became a celebrity: a mischievous, wry conceptual artist with a canny sensibility, cool but not dry, sometimes sweet, even corny -- and way ahead of her time in giving acute visual form to women's issues. As well as anyone, she encapsulated an evanescent and shifting moment in art. Fame distorts, and the show helps set the record straight. Hours: Tuesdays through Fridays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission: $5; $3, students and the elderly (Kimmelman).
 
Galleries: Uptown
 
LYONEL FEININGER, "From the Gelmeroda Cycle," Achim Moeller, 167 East 73rd Street, (212) 988-4500 (through Dec. 22). The painter of misty yet precisely gridded Cubist cityscapes was always an excellent and versatile draftsman. In this fine exhibition of small drawings, mostly from the teens and all focused on a single church in the village of Gelmeroda near Weimar, Germany, we see the artist working with an exquisitely sensitive touch in styles ranging from sketchy naturalism to vigorously gestural Expressionism to crystalline abstraction (Johnson).
 
 * "FROM THE ARTIST'S STUDIO: UNKNOWN PRINTS AND DRAWINGS BY MARY CASSATT," Adelson Galleries, 25 East 77th Street, (212) 439-6800 (through Dec. 29). This extraordinary exhibition presents 120 prints and drawings from a heretofore privately held collection. Covering the entire course of Cassatt's printmaking career, it features multiple states of many of the great color etchings that she produced after seeing a show of Japanese woodcuts in Paris in 1890. These intimate images of women in private domestic moments or tending children are as striking for their abstract structure as for their incipiently erotic sensuality (Johnson).
 
 LASZLO MOHOLY-NAGY, Ubu, 16 East 78th Street, (212) 794-4444 (through Dec. 22). Moholy-Nagy (1895-1946), the once hugely influential Modernist and Bauhaus educator, is today only hazily remembered. This extensive and diverse sampling of small works on paper shows why. The show is like a hall of mirrors that palely reflect many more interesting artists: Rodchenko, Mondrian, Man Ray and others. Moholy-Nagy's dream of fusion among art, science and industry shows in a Constructivist formalism that while not unplayful has a bland, corporate impersonality (Johnson).
 
 JAUME PLENSA, "Twin Shadows," Richard Gray, 1018 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 472-8787, and Galerie Lelong, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 315-0470 (through Dec. 22) This 45-year-old Catalan who lives in Paris and Barcelona has an impressive flair for theater. At Gray, video-projected, God-like eyes survey a broad table covered in red velvet that bears engraved glass balls spelling out elemental dualities like "semen-blood," or "night-day." At Lelong recorded sounds of lovemaking issue from below a wooden deck; glass ball works mounted on opposite walls spell out the themes: "dream" and "desire" (Johnson).
 
 LAURIE SIMMONS, "Tourism, 1984," Skarstedt Fine Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street, (212) 737-2060 (through Dec. 23). Known for her photography of constructed mini-scale scenes, Ms. Simmons concocted "Tourism, 1984" after a harried visit to the Acropolis that year. She decided that such glamour destinations might be better experienced in reproduction, the way most of us know and remember them, anyway. So she photographed her doll-size "Teenettes" against sites blown up from bad slides: Las Vegas, the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal and other cliche attractions. The 60-by-40-inch Cibachromes play up the nostalgia-knowledge foisted on us by reproductions. To make it more fantastical, the stiff little mannequins who stand agape at the backdrops take on the coloration of the slides. It's enough to deter you from world travel for quite some time (Glueck).
 
Galleries: Chelsea
 
CHARLES AVERY, "The Riddle of Pooch Avery," Dee/Glasoe, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 924-7545 (through Dec. 23). More a figure of intriguing sensibility than real accomplishment, this young London-based artist presents a series of illustrative, elegantly gestural drawings of decadent young people or wizened men in monastic robes. In each there appears a small dog, a kind of space-time traveler. It all hinges enigmatically on an enlarged family snapshot of the teen-age artist and his actual dog, Pooch (Johnson).
 
 MEL BOCHNER, Sonnabend, 536 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-1018 (through Dec. 22). Mr. Bochner's new paintings give fresh immediacy to his enduring preoccupation with the tension between perceptual and conceptual experience. Contemplating a series of near-Minimalist red-and-white works with 12-inch dimensions graphically indicated, your mind oscillates between mathematical abstraction and the vibrant punch of color and shape. For some viewers, this may prove too dryly self-reflexive; for analytical philosophy buffs, it may be deeply absorbing (Johnson).
 
 SPENCER FINCH, "Up," Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, (212) 727-3323 (through Dec. 23). This clever Conceptualist offers a variety of works inspired by the idea of looking or being "up," including pictures of a stain on his bedroom ceiling, a glowing watercolor representing the smell in an airplane at 35,000 feet, views of the Milky Way painted with Tang, and a dazzling installation of suspended lights configured according to the molecular structure of blue pigment that matches the sky over Los Alamos (Johnson).
 
 BERNARD FRIZE, Cohan Leslie and Browne, 138 10th Avenue, near 18th Street, (212) 206-8710 (through Dec. 23). In his first New York solo Mr. Frize, a French painter who has exhibited widely in Europe, presents resinous abstract paintings that suggest what Morris Louis might be doing today. Mr. Frize is oriented more to process than form, however; excepting one lovely striated veil painting, the interest is more in his inventively matter-of-fact ways with materials and procedures than his pictorial effects (Johnson).
 
 DAMIEN HIRST, Gagosian Gallery, 555 West 24th Street, (212) 741-1111 (through Dec. 16). The Damien Hirst Universe is a big shiny place with mathematical grid paper printed on the walls, pale pristine dot paintings and many large vitrine sculptures, including two outfitted as gynecological examining rooms and filled with water and fish. It shows the artist moving beyond the dead animals and putrefying flesh that catapulted him to fame while clarifying and enriching the grandiose themes of his art: life and death and their complex, sometimes oppressive relationship to science and commerce. It contains some undeniable duds, but if it doesn't win over those who have resisted the work of this notorious young British artist, it won't be for lack of trying (Smith).
 
 * "THE IMPERIAL GAZE," Sepia International, 148 West 24th Street, (212) 645-9444 (through Dec. 30.) The British photographer Samuel Bourne was in India for only seven years (1863-70), but he took thousands of pictures, established a lucrative business and became well-known for his cityscapes and pictures of architectural monuments. Like many quest-driven travelers, though, he wanted, even needed, something from India: in his case, an experience of the Sublime in nature. In Kashmir, he encountered an earthly Eden, and on arduous treks to the Himalayas, he discovered the meaning of hugeness. The pictures that resulted are part of one of the richest bodies of photographic work to emerge from British India (Cotter).
 
 JILL LEVINE, Art Resources Transfer, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212) 691-5956 (through Dec. 31). All three of this gallery's project spaces are devoted to a survey of Ms. Levine's buoyantly quirky wall-sculpture. Since the late 1980's the artist has been assembling standardized styrofoam parts -- balls, rings, cones, cubes -- into funky configurations and painting them in various ways: Constructivist-style, intricate patterns or trompe l'oeil. Most recently, she has covered them with detailed Hindu imagery, setting up a Pop-brokered marriage of East and West (Johnson).
 
 "PROCESS/REPROCESS: JAPAN AND THE WEST," Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-8450 (through Dec. 23). This disconnected but highly suggestive show mixes Western artists who have been influenced by Japanese traditions (like Richard Serra, James Lee Byars and Richard Tuttle) with Japanese artists who have been oriented to Western avant-gardisms (like Yayoi Kusama, Yoko Ono and Nikki S. Lee). What is most remarkable is how many different modes of artmaking are thus embraced, from Abstract Expressionism and Minimalism to Fluxus to the latest kinds of photographic and video performance (Johnson).
 
 * CINDY SHERMAN, Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, (through Jan. 6). With her latest untitled series Ms. Sherman is back in front of the camera lens again, disguised as women who, you might say, used to be somebody, maybe. They grin at the camera in clownish make-up, wobbly wigs and discount blouses, proud, valiantly oblivious to, or simply defiant of, our condescension, like the beauty pageant queen who drops her baton in the talent contest but keeps beaming. Formal devices by Ms. Sherman get overlooked because of the human element: the pattern of pigtails against plaid shirt in one portrait; the purplish freckled face of another woman with purple shirt and purple cap. This formal order becomes a rational structure that gives to the work its mix of frigidity and heat, a perfectly ambiguous cocktail for an ambiguous moment and an antidote to the weary sophistication of which there is too much in art now (Kimmelman).
 
 * SUE WILLIAMS, 303 Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-1121 (through Dec. 16). A decade ago Sue Williams was making rage-filled, clotted, sometimes outrageously funny works about the tribulations of women. Now she's painting like late de Kooning: confetti splashes of red, yellow and blue, calligraphic pirouettes, sweeping curves and minor skirmishes, mostly spare on big, bare white canvases. It is as if she were seeing how far she could push this sort of elegant abstraction before alienating her old audience, which, in terms of approach, is not so different from her button-pushing early work (Kimmelman).
 
Galleries: SoHo
 
KIM DINGLE, "Never in School," Sperone Westwater, 121 Greene Street, (212) 431-3685 (through Dec. 22). In dainty little dresses and Mary Jane shoes, two small troublemakers, Fatty and Fudge, use classroom and playground for their subversive antics: fighting, taking off their clothes, writing dirty words on a blackboard and generally mess-making. What brings it all off is Ms. Dingle's chronicling of their cartoony doings in a satirical painting mode usually reserved for high-art subjects. Velazquez, meet Fatty and Fudge (Glueck).
 
 ADRIANNE GALLINARI, Drawing Room, 40 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166 (through Dec. 20). Ms. Gallinari, a Brazilian artist who lives in Argentina, has used black crayon to cover the gallery walls with fields of illegible writing punctuated by primitivistic signs and figures. It suggests a kind of autistic or obsessive-compulsive industry, but lacks the intensity of real Outsider Art. (Johnson)
 
 JULIO GONZALEZ, Kent, 67 Prince Street, (212) 966-4500 (through Dec. 16). This modest show of drawings and sculptures offers a glimpse of the artist who, in company with Picasso, revolutionized modern sculpture by inventing welded-steel assemblage. Drawings range from deft academic portraits to energetic sketches for the semi-abstract, semi-Surrealist sculpture "Cactus Man." The half-dozen small metal sculptures look at once like ancient artifacts and modernist fragments; among them is a graceful female torso hammered from a sheet of bronze (Johnson).
 
Other Galleries
 
RALPH FASANELLA, Bread and Roses/1199 SEIU Gallery, 310 West 43rd Street, (212) 603-1186 (through Jan. 2). You could not pick a more appropriate place than this, the art gallery of New York State's largest health care worker's union, to present a small retrospective of paintings by Fasanella, the self-taught working-class hero, passionate leftist and visionary Social Realist, who died in 1997. His celebratory cityscapes and baseball stadiums and his darker allegories of American politics are marvels of expansive imagination and industrious detailing (Johnson).
 
 MIRIAM HERNANDEZ, Mixta Gallery, 1706 Lexington Avenue, near 106th Street, (212) 828-9173 (through Dec. 16). Ms. Hernandez's new work, which combines painting, drawing, collage and print techniques, has a loose, trying-things-out, diaristic feel. Each piece is about the size of a notebook page and centers around the figure of the artist as a golden-skinned Buddha wearing dark-rimmed glasses and floating in fields of soft reds, pinks and greens, which manage to look both tropical and Tibetan (Cotter).
 
 "PASTORAL POP!," Whitney Museum of American Art at Philip Morris, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453 (through Dec. 15). Nature-inspired kitsch is the theme of this delirious seven-artist show. It includes Rob de Mar's comical landscape in the form of a spindly tree, Lisa Ruyter's psychedelic update of Seurat's "Grande Jatte," Alyson Shotz's grove of weird plant machines, Peter Gould's transformation of the guard station into a bucolic cartoon, Jason Middlebrook's Styrofoam stone wall planter, Katrin Asbury's miniature diorama in a planter and Rachel Feinstein's suspended Rococo-style pitcher exploding flowers like a pinata (Johnson).
 
 JILL VINEY, Trans Hudson, 416 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 242-3232 (through Dec. 16). Ms. Viney produces pod-like sculptures with heavy, translucent outer shells and hazily visible entrails of found junk. Sleek, pudgy "Drifters" hover overhead like extraterrestrial putti; four-limbed works from the "Pulse" series attach to the walls like submarine bio-industrial creatures (Johnson).
 
Last Chance
 
* "THE CHINESE PAINTER AS POET," China Institute Gallery, 125 East 65th Street, (212) 744-8181 (through Sunday). In China, painting, poetry and calligraphy were the dream team of art: the "three perfections," they were called. Any truly evolved person was adept at each, and discussion of any of them was framed in the same terms: rhythm, touch, tone, spiritual energy. This eloquent exhibition examines the three-way partnership through some four dozen paintings, several of them of the first rank, ranging in date from the Song dynasty (960-1279) through the 20th century. In many cases the artist has inscribed his own poem on the surface of his painting in what amounts to a virtuoso multimedia solo performance. Hours: Mondays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Tuesdays and Thursdays, until 8 p.m.; Sundays, 1 to 5 p.m. Admission: $3; $2 for students and the elderly (Cotter).
 
 R. CRUMB, "Restaurant Place Mat Drawings," Paul Morris Gallery, 465 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2752 (through tomorrow). All the drawings are from the last 10 years and were done, doodle-style, while Mr. Crumb waited for his meal. If the veteran Comix-meister makes no big advances here, that's O.K. His draftsmanly style and thematic obsessions are classics (Cotter).
 
 INGE MORATH, "Saul Steinberg Masquerade," Leica, 670 Broadway, near Houston Street, SoHo, (212) 777-3051 (through tomorrow). When the Austrian photojournalist Inge Morath first met Saul Steinberg, the brilliant New Yorker magazine cartoonist, in 1956, he greeted her wearing a paper-bag mask with his self-portrait drawn on the front. An extensive project of photographing people masked by Steinbergian personae ensued. Almost 60 (more than enough) of these mildly amusing pictures are on view (Johnson).
 
 * PETER SAUL, Nolan Eckman Gallery, 560 Broadway at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 925-6190 (through tomorrow). If Mr. Saul isn't great, in his own gross way, he's close enough. The paintings and drawings in his 27th New York show, which is one of his best, dispense with his usual horrific epics. Each zeroes in on a series of large, misshapen marginally human heads that are, on their own, an epic of physical contortion and psychological pain. Yet everything about these images functions both as physical, largely repugnant fact and as gorgeous, seductive optical event -- while conveying a ferociously comic sense of the human psyche literally turned inside out. Few artists since Philip Guston have fused form and subject matter with quite such blistering, yet refined results (Smith).
 
 TOM WESSELMANN, "Blue Nudes," Joseph Helman Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 245-2888 (through tomorrow). Think saucy, sexy nudes when you think of Mr. Wesselmann, and you won't be wrong. But those were in his Pop mode of the 1960's. These, cued by Matisse's "Blue Nude" cutout of 1952, are something else again. Suave, elegant and painterly, the life-size figures are oil-painted aluminum cutouts that lie flat against the wall, which cleverly becomes part of them. The painting, built up in delicately nuanced layers, is virtuoso (Glueck).

HEADLINE: MY MANHATTAN;
Even When Frost Dusts the Fields, a Cornucopia Spills Onto City Streets

BYLINE: By SUSAN JACOBY; Susan Jacoby's most recent book is "Half-Jew: A Daughter's Search for Her Family's Buried Past."

 BODY:
At Christmas I no more desire a rose
Than wish a snow in May's newfangled mirth;
But like of each thing that in season grows.
 
-- Shakespeare, "Love's Labour's Lost"
Every spring, when customers return to the Union Square Greenmarket to buy baby leeks or tender young asparagus, they tell the farmers, "We're so glad you're back." 
 In fact, New York's largest farmers' market never goes away. It is open year round, unless a fierce storm intervenes, on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Although the number of stalls on Saturdays -- the biggest greenmarket day -- drops from a high of around 70 in September to about 30 in the depths of February, there is always something worth buying and someone worth talking to.
I used to be one of the greenmarket's "summer people," turning up at the first sighting of asparagus in early May and disappearing with the last field-ripened tomatoes in October. But the market has gradually insinuated its way into my weekly routine in all seasons.
Every Saturday morning -- except when the weather is so cold or snowy that most farmers are apt to stay home -- I head out from my apartment with a big shopping bag and take the Lexington Avenue line from 86th Street to the Union Square stop at 14th Street. Emerging from the subway with a cup of coffee to warm my hands, I walk uptown and begin my vegetable search with the northernmost farm stands in the paved area between 16th Street and Union Square Park.
 
Seasonal Pleasures
September, which combines the continuing bounty of summer tomatoes with the full fall harvest, remains my favorite greenmarket month. A close second, though, is December, with its unmistakable seasonal scent of freshly cut spruce, pine and balsam.
In a sense the greenmarket is a combination general store and church social. Here in front of the mushroom stand is a radical feminist writer I haven't seen since the ancient era of women's consciousness-raising groups (i.e., the 1970's). We rarely agreed on anything in the old days, but we agree now on the vast superiority of these mushrooms, cultivated in indoor darkrooms by the Bulich brothers -- the fourth generation of farmers in their family -- of Catskill, N.Y.
I also enjoy talking to people who used to be strangers and whom I would never have met were it not for our common attraction to fresh vegetables. One of my greenmarket familiars lives on East 123rd Street, and like me, she always tries to make it to the market by midmorning to snap up the best vegetables.
We greet each other by our first names because we buy tomatoes, mushrooms, sweet potatoes and squash from the same farmers. Odessa is well into her 80's, since she admits to having cast her first presidential vote for Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936, but you would never know it from the ease with which she hefts 10-pound sacks of fruits and vegetables.
I used Odessa's sweet-potato casserole recipe for this year's Thanksgiving dinner. Raised in a small town in Georgia, she sneers at cooks who top their sweet potatoes with marshmallows. "A touch of whiskey was my mama's secret," she revealed. "And never, ever goo up the potatoes with all that sugary stuff. If they come straight from the ground, they're sweet enough. If you have to put extra sugar on them, they're not fit to eat."
One of the things I love most about the greenmarket is its seasonal predictability. Each year, on the Saturday after Thanksgiving, the first Christmas trees, wreaths and garlands signal the real start of the holidays for me.
Anyone who can manage to haul a tree home from Union Square (I once saw a man wrestling a 10-foot Douglas fir down the subway stairs) will find it worth the effort. Most of the trees, like everything else in the market, are grown within a 120-mile radius of the city (though a few longtime tree farmers come from Vermont and the Finger Lakes region of New York). In my experience, the greenmarket trees are fresher, and last longer indoors, than anything sold at neighborhood sidewalk stands.
 
Defying the Frost
A dazzling assortment of seasonal plants is also on display. Hodgson Farms of Walden, N.Y., even sets up a portable greenhouse to provide a cozy environment for poinsettias that sell for about half of what florists charge.
Jack Faoro, the owner of Burnt Meadow Greenhouses in Gardiner, N.Y., specializes in handmade boxwood wreaths and garlands for the holidays.
Mr. Faoro is one of the hardy souls whose stand is open year-round on Saturdays (with the exception of a two-week vacation after New Year's). During the January-February nadir of the greenmarket year, he sells daffodil and tulip bulbs, which always cheer me up with their promise of better days to come.
The availability of a surprising array of fruits and vegetables attests dramatically to the mildness of recent winters. When I started shopping at Union Square in the mid-1980's, vegetables (except for winter squash and pumpkins) seemed to disappear by Thanksgiving.
Now fresh-from-the-ground carrots, celery, broccoli, cauliflower, radishes, turnips, scallions and even lettuce are for sale through December, unless there is an unexpected long freeze. The more predictable winter fare of apples, potatoes, onions and squash are there, too. Mushrooms cultivated in darkrooms are available all year, along with greenhouse-cultivated herbs and (usually) grape tomatoes.
 
'I'll Plant It'
Even in January and February farmers continue to sell celery and parsley root, along with potatoes, carrots and onions. "If the weather's mild enough, the root vegetables still come straight from the ground," says Alex Paffenroth, the owner of Paffenroth Gardens in Warwick, N.Y.
Mr. Paffenroth also responds to customer requests for new root crops. "If you want it and I don't grow it now," he says, "I'll plant it next season."
Even when the vegetables are at their lowest ebb, the market always offers fresh meat, fish, dairy products and baked goods. Customers must be prepared to stand in line for at least 15 minutes for the lobsters, scallops, flounder and other fish sold (when they abound in local waters) by P. E. and D. D. Seafood of Riverhead, on Long Island.
There is no need to worry about spoilage because all perishable greenmarket products are transported in refrigerated trucks and sold from impeccably clean coolers. One reason the crowd is so thick around P. E. and D. D. is that the seafood, surrounded by crushed ice, is displayed in glass cases that attract rubberneckers as well as paying customers.
For clam aficionados, the Doxsee Sea Clam Company of Point Lookout, on Long Island, offers not only the fresh variety but also its own Manhattan and New England clam chowder. New Yorkers may rememberthe old commercials claiming that Doxsee clam chowder was packed with so many clams that it should simply be called "Doxsee Clam." It's true.
Being an unregenerate carnivore (as I'm called by a friend who never eats anything but fish and vegetables), I avoid the fishy crowds and head for the Blew family farm stand. The Blews raise hogs in New Jersey, on their Oak Grove Plantation in Hunterdon County, with no hormones, growth steroids or antibiotics, and sell everything from fresh pork roast and spare ribs to bacon cured without nitrites.
The stand also features flour and meal products milled from the Blews's own grain, including not only plain flour but pancake mixes as well.
Although the greenmarket is open only four days a week (and there are extremely slim pickings on winter Mondays and Fridays), there is an extra reason to stop by Union Square in December.
Clustered around the south and southwest perimeter is the Union Square Holiday Market, with some 100 booths open daily from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. through Christmas Eve. The enterprise, now in its fifth year, was the brainchild of Eldon Scott, founder of Urban Space Management. It is unrelated to the greenmarket but Mr. Scott notes that "we like to think of ourselves as kissing cousins."
 
A European Tradition
The project was inspired by the northern European tradition of the Christkindlesmarkt -- seasonal booths found in Swedish, Danish, Austrian and German cities. The Union Square version features small businesses -- the kind of shops you almost never hear about unless they are in your neighborhood -- selling everything from antique jewelry to unusual children's clothes.
Many of the greenmarket farmers also offer a variety of homegrown or home-cooked products that make unusual and economical holiday presents. The endearingly named Wooly Hill Farm of Jordanville, N.Y., features yarns of every hue, sheepskin gloves and slippers and the kind of fluffy rugs that used to serve as backgrounds for snapshots of bare-bottomed babies.
Beth's Farm Kitchen, of Stuyvesant Falls, N.Y, produces succulent jams and chutneys made exclusively from fruits grown in nearby orchards. During the holidays the jars are boxed and beribboned for an extra dollar.
A year or two ago, Beth's also provided a classic example of one of the more comical greenmarket sights -- that of a first-time (and in many cases, last-time) customer trying to use city-slicker wiles to bargain.
 
A Country Store Mentality
Dressed in ungreenmarketish garb consisting of tight leather pants, Manolo Blahnik shoes and a mink jacket, a woman looked over a jar of "blazing tomato chutney" priced at $5.95. "How about $4 for that?" she asked. One of the many cheerful, polite young women who sell Beth's products replied, cheerfully and politely, "Sorry, the price is $5.95."
The customer from hell slammed down the chutney and said, "I can pay that at Dean & DeLuca." Hardly. One of the joys of the greenmarket is that prices are far below those for comparable foods in gourmet stores. Urban rubes, not city slickers, try to bargain down prices with farmers who are themselves sophisticated entrepreneurs.
Unlike the exchange at Beth's, most of the discourse between city and country gentlefolk is more in line with what the greenmarket founders intended in 1976.
"Obviously, the main purpose of greenmarkets was to make more fresh food available to city residents," says Joel Patraker, assistant director of the 27 markets scattered throughout New York City. "But beyond that, it's a way for people from the city and the countryside to exchange experiences. You see that with the thousands of schoolchildren who make field trips to the market every year. They learn that food doesn't originate in takeout cartons."
 
Conviviality Amid Carrots
The humanity and courtesy attached to most greenmarket transactions does indeed soothe the spirit. One reason I am such a faithful customer is that I relish the weekly contact with people who value my business instead of taking it for granted.
When someone suggests (as someone frequently does) that I am a little crazy to schlep bags of humble vegetables up and down the subway stairs every week, I tell them the story of the Day I Forgot My Money.
In mid-October I was inspecting some of the last heirloom tomatoes of the season when I discovered that I had forgotten to transfer money from my handbag to the waistband pouch I use for greenmarket shopping.
I asked a farmer if she would hold the tomatoes for me -- I knew they would be sold out in a few minutes -- while I looked for a cash machine.
"Oh, don't bother" she said. "I know you, honey. Just pay me next week." Lucky for me, since I discovered that I had also forgotten to bring along my A.T.M. card. When I showed up with the cash the following Saturday, my benefactress observed, "I knew you weren't the type to skip town."
 
To Market
The Union Square Greenmarket is open year round on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays, from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Some farmers arrive later in the morning and many close well before 6 p.m., especially in winter.) Those hours are not firm during snowstorms or when the temperature is below 32 degrees.
All of the farmers mentioned in this article are in the market on Saturdays, weather permitting. Check with them for their schedule on other greenmarket days.
The hours and dates for greenmarkets around New York City are available from the central Greenmarket office, (212) 477-3220.
The Union Square Holiday Market is open daily from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. through Christmas Eve.

HEADLINE: Brazil Still Optimistic on Phone Auctions

BYLINE: By JENNIFER L. RICH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Despite waning interest in cellular phone licenses around the globe, the Brazilian government hopes to raise at least $3.4 billion over the next three months by selling nine licenses to offer mobile phone services.
The government will sell three licenses for personal communications services, on the C, D, and E bands, for each of the country's three service areas: the urban state of Sao Paulo, the largely rural south and center west, and the populous north and northeastern coast. The minimum prices on the licenses range from $273 million to $510 million, depending on the area and the band. The licenses for the C band are more expensive, since operators will be allowed a six-month head start over D and E band winners. C band winners can start commercial operations on July 1. 
 Although many analysts consider the minimum bids high, the government is counting on carriers that do not yet have a presence in Brazil, like Vodafone of Britain, to bid up the prices. Industry experts also expect Brazil's fixed-line operators, especially local companies owned by Telefonica of Spain and Telecom Italia, to bid aggressively so they can expand their presence in the country's growing cellular market.
According to the National Telecommunications Agency, or Anatel, the number of mobile phone users in Brazil is expected to nearly double by the end of 2001, to 29.2 million, from 15 million in 1999. Anatel wants that number to reach 58 million by 2005 in a country of about 170 million.
"Investors showed a huge amount of interest during our road shows in Brazil, London and New York," said Renato Navarro Guerreiro, the president of Anatel. "The pent-up demand for telecommunications services in the Brazilian market is the largest in the world."
But uncertainty remains about how many companies will participate in the sale, which will begin with the C band auction on Jan. 30, followed by the D band on Feb. 20 and the E band on March 13, especially when heavyweights like AT&T, British Telecommunications and France Telecom have remained out of the bidding.
"The telecommunications industry worldwide has changed a lot in the last six months," said Paul Groom, an industry consultant here. "It has gone from being a strong-cash-flow, highly capitalized business to being one where a lot of these companies are highly in debt because of their third-generation bids in Europe." Third-generation technology, commonly called 3G, allows for services like high-speed Internet access and data transfers over a cellular telephone.
After Britain took in a record $34 billion for 3G licenses in April, only to be trumped by Germany's $46 billion sale in August, a recent auction in Italy brought in only $12.2 billion, less than half what the government had expected. Poland was the most recent disappointment, selling only three of its five licenses on Saturday.
Part of the problem, analysts say, is that 3G services are not catching on as quickly as expected in relatively mature cellular markets in Europe. That raises doubts about demand for 3G technology in markets where consumers have less buying power. A big question is how many Brazilians are going to be willing to pay for Internet access over their cellular phones.
Mr. Guerreiro from Anatel counters that the Brazilian government is not auctioning 3G licenses, but a middle ground called 2.5G, that will permit companies to offer regular cellular services using existing technology, as well as some mobile Internet applications.
In Brazil, the situation for regular cellular service is complicated because the country is coming out of an economic crisis and subsequent devaluation that brought economic growth, and consumer spending, to a virtual standstill in 1999 and most of 2000. That has cut deeply into expected revenues for existing providers.
"What you have are licenses for the third, fourth and fifth operators in these regions at a time when the second operators are having a very difficult time, and have had in most regions since they won their licenses in 1998," Mr. Groom said.
Analysts say, however, that companies that want to have a global presence will find it very difficult to skip this opportunity to enter the Brazilian market on a large scale.
"At the end of the day, one needs to be big in mobile service to be successful," said Luiz Carvalho, a telecommunications analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "You want to achieve nationwide coverage."
As a result, companies will have to rework their business plans to fill the holes in Brazil's cellular coverage.
"In order for these companies to succeed, they are going to have to move down to the lower-income customers, which means that each operator is going to have to be much more efficient," said Luis Cuza, chairman of the telecommunications committee at the American Chamber of Commerce in Sao Paulo. "They are also going to have to focus much more on sales and marketing and gaining and retaining customers."

The Brazilian government hopes to raise $3.4 billion over the next three months by auctioning nine new licenses for cellular phone services. The licenses will operate on the C, D and E bands in each of three regions, with the C-band licenses fetching a premium over the others because the winners of these licenses will be allowed to start service six months before the D and E band operators.

HEADLINE: Argentina's Woes: With Peso Overvalued, It Can't Compete

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
IT'S bailout time.
The International Monetary Fund, having just broken speed records for arranging a huge cash infusion for Turkey, will turn next week to Argentina, where it is expected to anchor a $25 billion rescue package. 
 The moves seem to have calmed markets in both countries, and it is to be hoped that they will work in the long run, too. But these countries' need to be bailed out reflects their failure to learn a clear lesson of the 1998 Asian crisis: Fixed foreign exchange rates have a way of blowing up when the going gets tough.
That lesson was ignored because fixed rates have such clear attractions when things are going well. Businesses can enter into contracts with foreign companies with confidence about exchange rates. The fixed rate is supposed to discipline governments, which learn they cannot simply print money to get around problems and therefore must make the tough decisions needed for economic stability.
All that is true enough. But what happens if those tough decisions are not made, or if external events overwhelm otherwise sound policies? When a crisis arrives, people start selling the currency to the government, which obligingly buys it and drains foreign exchange reserves. Mehmet Simsek, a Merrill Lynch economist, notes that the $7.5 billion the I.M.F. is putting into Turkey is about equal to the amount Turkey's central bank spent defending the lira to keep it from depreciating more than the planned 1 percent a month.
In Argentina, the government uses a currency board to assure that one peso equals one dollar. That policy helped end hyperinflation a decade ago and remains popular.
But it is also largely to blame for the country's inability to cope with a run of bad news. Neighboring Brazil devalued its currency, commodity prices fell, the dollar became the strongest currency in the world, and international investors became risk averse. "It was the biggest set of negative shocks Argentina has had since the 1930's," commented Francis Freisinger, a Merrill Lynch economist.
With a currency board, Argentina could not devalue its currency to stay competitive with Brazil. It cut wages of its workers, but not by enough. Unemployment soared, those with jobs had less money to spend, and the money supply contracted as investors took money out of the country. Argentina found itself in a classic Catch-22: Investors would not put money into an economy that was not growing, but there was no hope of growth without that investment.
The I.M.F. bailout buys time, and Alan Greenspan's hints that the Federal Reserve will reduce American interest rates provide hope. Since Argentina does not have its own monetary policy, it is stuck with Washington's. That hurt when the Fed raised rates while Argentina was in a recession. The best situation for Argentina next year would be a big decline in the dollar, which would devalue the peso and make Argentine exports more competitive.
Perhaps that will happen. If not, in a year or so the I.M.F. may have to decide whether to step in again. To keep that new aid from simply flowing out to foreign bondholders, Argentina might have to restructure its debts in a way that penalizes bondholders. If speculation ever rises that the dollar peg might be in jeopardy, the rush of local companies to buy dollars could force devaluation.
Two years after its devaluation, Brazil is booming. Argentina's currency board solved one problem, but it left the country unable to cope with a new round of adversity.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Rise on Expectations of an Eventual Rate Cut

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices recouped earlier losses yesterday as stocks declined, and as investors looked for added signs of slowing growth and an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
"The Treasury market has come a long way already," said Michael Cloherty, a fixed-income strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. But with volatility in the stock market and investor expectations for a Fed rate cut by the end of March, "the recent pattern is to do anything but stay steady," he said. 
 The 10-year Treasury note rose 1/32, to a price of 103 11/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.30 percent from 5.31 percent on Wednesday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond increased 4/32, to 110 26/32. The bond's yield declined to 5.50 percent from 5.51 percent on Wednesday.
Government debt tempered earlier losses as the Nasdaq composite index fell 1.6 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.40 percent.
Investors have pushed bond and note yields down while anticipating a Fed rate cut by the end of March. In a speech Tuesday, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, suggested that policy-makers were not as concerned with inflation, which prompted Treasuries to rally.
"The bond market seems convinced that Greenspan has turned around , but the stock market's not sure if he's in time," said Frank Waung, an economist at Societe Generale.
Mortgage bond investors who were caught by surprise as yields fell have been furiously buying Treasuries and derivatives known as interest-rate swaps over the last three days, traders said.
As rates fall, more homeowners can refinance their mortgage loans, which cuts short interest payments on mortgage bonds and hurts investors' returns. Mortgage investors hedge this by buying Treasuries or swaps to receive fixed-rate payments for a set period of time. In a swap, traders and investors agree to exchange fixed-rate and floating-rate interest payments for a set period of time based on a nominal dollar amount.
Signs that growth cooled in November may emerge today, when the government is expected to report that the unemployment rate rose to 4 percent after holding at a 30-year low of 3.9 percent for two months, according to a survey of economists. Average hourly earnings probably increased 0.3 percent in November after a 0.4 percent gain a month earlier.

The Last Green Mile

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
With the odds increasing every day that George W. Bush will be declared the 43rd president, a couple of things are becoming clear: Bush voters are the likely winners. Gore voters are the likely losers. And all those people who voted for Ralph Nader and the Green Party are the likely really big losers.
Why? Just do the math. Assuming a very narrow victory for Mr. Bush, and a 50-50 split in the U.S. Senate, it's highly doubtful that on the big policy issues -- tax cuts, Social Security, education, foreign policy -- a Bush administration will be able to do much more, or much less, than a Gore administration. 
 Where Mr. Bush will have the biggest impact is not through the macro-politics, but through the micro-politics -- on all those issues that reside just below the radar, on all those issues where the hundreds of assistant secretaries, agency heads and department chiefs, whom the Bush team will appoint throughout the government, will have the discretion, guidance and desire to impose a conservative ethos.
And what are those issues? Well, let's see -- things like how environmental regulations are interpreted, where oil wells can be dug in Alaska, what sorts of lands the Interior Department sets aside for conservation, how worker health and safety rules are enforced or expanded, how labor laws are interpreted, how gun control is dealt with, how aggressively fuel efficiency standards are pursued, how assiduously global population control programs are supported and to what extent the U.S. works to curb the "greenhouse" gases that are causing global warming.
There is actually another name for all these environmental, social and labor issues: "The Nader Agenda." These are all the issues that Ralph Nader and his supporters professed to care most about. Well, guess what? All their issues are going to get the short end of the stick from a Bush-staffed bureaucracy, which will be heavily influenced by the oil and gas industry, the National Rifle Association and the anti-abortion lobby.
Just think about one area -- global warming. Instead of having as president Al Gore, someone who would have made it a priority to rescue the failed Kyoto climate change treaty, we will probably have a president and vice president both of whom came from the energy business and don't even believe global warming is for real. Mr. Bush's chief of staff will be Andrew Card, who spent the last seven years as chief lobbyist for the auto industry, fighting tighter fuel economy, air pollution and global warming regulations. So Mr. Nader helped deliver a president from the oil industry, a vice president from the drilling industry and a chief of staff from the auto industry. Have a nice day.
Indeed, when we wake up 20 years from now and find that the Atlantic Ocean is just outside Washington, D.C., because the polar icecaps are melting, we may look back at this pivotal election. We may wonder whether it wasn't the last moment when a U.S. policy to deal with global warming might have made a difference, and we may ask why the party most concerned about that, the Greens, helped to elect Mr. Bush by casting 97,000 Nader votes in Florida.
Nader's voters forgot what Nader's Raiders always remembered: Government is not just about the big bills and legislation. It's also about lots of little things, decided by lots of little bureaucrats whom each party brings to Washington when it takes over.
Throughout the campaign, the egomaniacal Mr. Nader -- who makes Ross Perot look selfless by comparison -- justified taking away votes from Mr. Gore by arguing that there really wasn't much difference between him and Mr. Bush. And, like a good Leninist, Mr. Nader also didn't seem to mind destroying the Democratic Party to save it. Well, maybe there didn't appear to be much difference between the two men -- but there was a huge difference between the hundreds of key people Al Gore and George Bush would appoint to staff their administrations. And those hundreds of people will make thousands of decisions that one day will add up to a very big difference.
If you need any proof of that, look at Florida. Look at how many key decisions were taken by "little people" who resided below the radar screens -- local judges, senior state officials and local election supervisors. They are the gears of government, and in a Bush administration they are the ones who will be interpreting and regulating everything the Naderites care about. As I said, have a nice day.

A TriBeCa Building Is a Curtain Raiser for a Trio of Developers

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
A group of developers is advancing plans for a mixed-income rental building on a site in the far eastern corner of TriBeCa that long has been dotted with vacant lots and mostly empty low-lying structures.
The $118.5 million project will contain 330 apartments. Of these, 204 units will be one-bedrooms, and the rest will be studios and two-bedroom apartments. They will range from 500 to 1,200 square feet and some will have terraces. 
 There will also be 18,000 square feet of ground-level retail space and a 225-car parking garage in the 19-story building, which will rise on the parcel at 111 Worth Street, just north of City Hall. Construction is to start in February and be completed by the summer of 2002, the developers said. The building is a project of three developers: Forest City Ratner Companies in Brooklyn, Joel Wiener of Manhattan and Schenkman/Kush ner Affiliates in Bridgewater, N.J.
The developers are applying for tax-exempt permanent bond financing from the New York State Housing Finance Agency to develop the building as a so-called 80-20 project. Murray Kushner of Schenkman/ Kushner said he and his partners have secured a construction loan from Hypo Bank and are optimistic about receiving the bond financing. Still, he added, the partners could move ahead without it if necessary.
In exchange for the bond financing, the developers would reserve 20 percent of the units for residents making 50 percent of the median annual income in New York City, or $28,000, which is then adjusted according to family size. The remaining 80 percent of the apartments will be rented at market rates.
This is the initial foray into residential development in TriBeCa for each of the developers, who joined together over the last 18 months. Mr. Kushner said that while his company had never built a high-rise apartment building in New York City, it owns and manages 5,000 rental units and five million square feet of commercial space, mainly in New Jersey.
Forest City is known primarily for its office and retail projects, including the Metrotech office complex in downtown Brooklyn. While it has developed 40,000 residences nationally, none are in Manhattan.
To change that, the company began "to scout around for residential developments 18 months ago," said Sandeep Mathrani, executive vice president of Forest City. His company is also involved with different partners in a 300-unit rental project on which construction is to begin soon at 555 West 23rd Street in Chelsea.
Few rental properties have been constructed in the last decade in TriBeCa. This year, as in each of the last five years, roughly 400 units -- most of them loft condominiums carved from old industrial buildings -- will be produced in the neighborhood, according to Community Board 1.
The Worth Street building will join the Saranac, a 147-unit rental development at 95 Worth Street that the Zucker Organization of Manhattan completed last March. The developer said that project was leased in 10 weeks.
Both rental projects are in TriBeCa's easternmost fringe, hard against an area of government buildings. Judy Duffy, assistant district manager of Community Board 1, said these projects "are telling me people are desperate to live in TriBeCa no matter how far off the beaten track a location may seem to be."
Mr. Kushner said that when he contracted to buy the site 18 months ago, Mr. Wiener held a 70-year ground lease on it. The two became partners and were joined months later by Forest City Ratner, which had experience in securing approvals and developing in Manhattan.
The project is advancing at a time when Manhattan's rental market, while still strong, has cooled from its frenzied pace of the recent past, in part because of the volatile stock market and the failure of many dot-com firms, said Andrew S. Heiberger, president of CitiHabitats, a Manhattan brokerage firm.
Rents are dropping between 10 and 20 percent for luxury apartments, he said, adding that units not moving generally are studios priced above $2,200, one-bedrooms over $3,000, two-bedrooms above $4,000 and three-bedrooms over $6,000.
As for the planned Worth Street building, Mr. Heiberger said, "It's in a transitional area, so the less the neighborhood has to offer, the more price matters."
Average yearly rents for comparable units in TriBeCa are $52 a square foot, or $3,033 a month for a 700-square-foot one-bedroom, he said. At the Saranac the average was $55 a square foot, according to the Zucker Organization.
Mr. Mathrani said rents at 111 Worth Street are expected to be $52 a square foot. That means they will range from $2,166 a month for the smallest studio to $5,200 for the largest two-bedroom.
Despite the "negative press about the market," he said the project makes economic sense and its location will appeal to people who work in the surrounding office buildings.
The building, designed by Costas Kondylis of Manhattan, will be clad in beige brick and will feature decorative masonry detailing at its base. It also will be set back at the 14th floor, providing those units with terraces. Along with the parking garage, planned amenities will include a fitness center and children's playroom, and possibly a rooftop sun deck, Mr. Kushner said.

The Fine Art Of Discerning A Recession

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
The date was Aug. 21, 1990. The nation's last recession was already one month old, but the Federal Reserve's policy makers, gathered for one of their periodic meetings to set interest rates, did not realize that. "Those who argue that we are already in a recession I think are reasonably certain to be wrong," Alan Greenspan, the chairman, told his colleagues.
Spotting the arrival of the next recession -- after more than a decade of often booming growth -- is once again a matter of growing concern. 
 Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues did not recognize the existence of the 1990-1991 economic downturn until it was five months old, which is one reason they waited to cut interest rates. Now, with the evidence still pointing away from an actual recession, they face a similar test of how to respond as the economy slows.
Slow growth is not much fun. The prosperity of the last five years that has lifted nearly every family will gradually disappear for millions of people, and both consumers and companies will grow cautious in their spending and investing. That is already happening.
But a recession is downright painful. Unemployment rises rapidly, bankruptcies multiply, layoffs become commonplace and homes lose value. "When growth slows, people lose jobs, but those who don't find their real incomes growing," said Kenneth J. Matheny, senior economist at Macroeconomic Advisers in St. Louis. "In an outright recession, many more people feel the pain of unemployment and falling incomes."
A recession almost certainly has not arrived. By every measure, the gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the value of America's goods and services, is still growing, if not at the annual rate of more than 5 percent that prevailed last spring, then at 2 to 3 percent.
Still, recession is increasingly on people's minds. Federal Reserve officials, while expressing confidence that the economy is slowing to a soft landing rather than to a hard or recessionary one, nevertheless now say that the economy is decelerating more rapidly than they had anticipated. In sum, the risks of recession have risen.
The speed of the slowdown is worrisome. A sharp, rapid slowing in economic growth "can feel like a recession if it lasts long enough," Mr. Matheny said. In six weeks, his firm has cut its estimate of growth in the fourth quarter to an annual rate of 2.4 percent from 3 percent.
A decade ago, a 2.4 percent growth rate was considered by most economist to be relatively strong growth. But now 2.4 percent is thought to be insufficient to maintain full employment and to keep the nation's factories and offices humming at full capacity. Thanks to productivity gains, a healthy economy today is one that expands at a 3.5 to 4 percent annual rate, and perhaps even more.
Almost no one goes so far as to state that the economy is moving toward a recession or is in one, although Dick Cheney, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, toyed with the thought this week. A Bush administration would like to date the start of a recession, if one actually develops, from the final months of the Clinton administration, thus blaming the Democrats. And manufacturers, hit harder than anyone else by the slowing growth, have come close to using the "R" word.
"We have to have a reduction in interest rates of up to half a percentage point to assure that this slowdown does not turn into a major downturn," said Jerry J. Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
The Fed is not likely to accommodate the manufacturers soon. While growth has slowed, Mr. Greenspan pointed in a speech on Tuesday to strengths in the economy. The Fed's policy makers, at their next meeting, on Dec. 19, are likely to give up their stated preference for higher rates. But they are not likely to switch gears and lower rates as quickly as some of the nation's industrial barons would like. "We must be equally vigilant against the risk of either an extended period of growth unacceptably below potential, or a resurgence of inflation," Roger W. Ferguson Jr., the Fed's vice chairman, said in a speech Wednesday.
Still, the era of raising interest rates is now clearly over; starting in June 1999, the Fed raised rates six times, helping to produce today's slower growth. But there were other contributions, too.
Lenders have pulled back, raising interest rates and depriving some companies of credit. Capital spending is growing more slowly. Rising energy prices -- not only for oil, but for electricity and natural gas, too -- have hurt the economy more than expected and have also kept inflationary pressures alive. The sell-off of Nasdaq stocks and the flattening of other stock prices as corporate profits weakened has taken a toll. Inventory cutting, mostly in the auto industry, has shuttered factories. And the strong dollar has made exports more expensive, a blow in particular to basic manufacturers.
"The message from all the data is that there is a slowdown but not a recession," said Ian C. Shepherdson, chief domestic economist for High Frequency Economics.
But Mr. Shepherdson is a Wall Street forecaster. Mr. Jasinowski takes a more dour view. He defined a "major downturn" as one three-month quarter in which the economy actually contracts. The popular definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters in which the gross domestic product shrinks rather than grows. For a wide swath of manufacturing, that contraction is already occurring; the recession is here.
Manufacturing output is still rising, of course. From May through October, the latest month available, output grew at an annual rate of 3 percent. That was down from 7.8 percent in the first five months of this year, Mr. Matheny said. But take out the vibrant group of high-technology manufacturers who produce computers, communications equipment and semiconductors and a much different pattern emerges. The rest of manufacturing -- from automakers to textiles -- contracted from May through October, perhaps the first tiny step toward crossing the fine, hard-to-perceive line from slow growth to recession.

HEADLINE: On U.N. Dues, No U.S. Cover From Europe

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 7

 BODY:
The European Union made its position final today: Europe will not pay higher United Nations dues to offset any reduced payments by the United States.
"What is our bottom line is that we will not pay more," said Ambassador Jean-David Levitte of France, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union until the end of the year. The General Assembly finance committee, which Mr. Levitte addressed today, has until Dec. 22 to reach agreement on how, or if, the United States demand can be accommodated. 
 Europe's negative response throws the burden on the rest of the world to find a way to pay more if Washington is to be accommodated. Ideas are being discussed, but no firm plan has yet taken shape.
At issue are American demands to lower the percentage of the United Nations operating budget that Washington pays to 22 percent from 25 percent, and the peacekeeping assessment to 25 percent from 30 percent. Congress cut peacekeeping contributions in defiance of international agreements in 1995.
The United Nations has never recognized the move. Budgetary assessments are based roughly on a nation's share of the total world economy, with the American portion about 26 percent.
The Clinton administration did not fight Congress on these decisions, and accepted an agreement between Jesse Helms, a North Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat and ranking minority member of the committee, that essentially put conditions on American participation in the United Nations and tried to give Washington oversight of its budget and other affairs. Officials said that this was the only way to get any arrears paid.
For most of his 15 months as United States ambassador here, Richard C. Holbrooke has had to devote the bulk of his time to this issue in order to avoid what many feared would be a virtual break between the United States and the United Nations. A Republican-led Congress has set many conditions for paying a debt of $1.7 billion and for future contributions. Reducing the level of dues is the key demand.

HEADLINE: Rabbi Irving Koslowe, 80; Gave Rosenbergs Last Rites

BYLINE: By ARI L. GOLDMAN 

 BODY:
Rabbi Irving Koslowe, the Jewish chaplain at Sing Sing for 49 years, who in 1953 counseled the convicted spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and led them in their final prayers, died on Wednesday at Mount Sinai Hospital after a monthlong illness. He was 80 and lived in Mamaroneck, N.Y.
The chaplaincy at the state prison at Ossining was a part-time job for the rabbi, but it remained a central focus of his life from the time he was appointed by Gov. Thomas E. Dewey in 1950 until he retired last year. During all those years, Rabbi Koslowe visited the prison at least once a week, bringing with him a variety of visitors as well as Jewish newspapers, books, foods and items for holiday rituals. 
 "People ask me what I'm doing, bringing matzo ball soup to a bunch of killers," Rabbi Koslowe once told an interviewer. "But maybe we can make some change. Maybe we can bring some good in their life. Some of the guards would say I'm crazy, but I do what I can do."
In a ceremony when Rabbi Koslowe retired from the state prison system last year, the Jewish chapel at Sing Sing was renamed in his honor.
In addition to his prison duties, Rabbi Koslowe served as the rabbi of the Westchester Jewish Center, in Mamaroneck, from 1943 until 1987. In that time, it grew from a synagogue with 30 families to a center with more than 500 families.
Over the years, Rabbi Koslowe also taught psychology, criminal justice and pastoral counseling at Westchester Community College, Mercy College and Pace University.
From 1950 until the death penalty was abolished in 1963, Rabbi Koslowe witnessed 17 executions at Sing Sing. He spoke somberly about how he would spend the final hours with the inmate, leading him in the final confession, known in Hebrew as the vidduy, and the profession of faith, the sh'ma. In each case, he would tell the prisoner, "I'll be right by you." He would go into the execution chamber, stand opposite as the inmate was strapped into the electric chair, and stay until the end.
The Rosenbergs, who were charged with passing atomic secrets to the Soviets, were convicted of espionage and were executed on June 19, 1953. In a news program about the cold war shown last year on CNN, Rabbi Koslowe recalled that Attorney General Herbert Brownell called him from Washington with a last-minute plea that the Rosenbergs name co-conspirators. Mr. Brownell said that if the Rosenbergs gave him a name, a stay of execution would be considered, Rabbi Koslowe said.
The Rosenbergs refused. Julius was put to death. Rabbi Koslowe said he then returned for Ethel. "I came back and told her her husband was dead. Did she have anything to say to me, a name, to stay the execution? She said, 'No, I have no names to give, I'm innocent,' and she was far more stolid than he. She came right behind me, sat down and was executed."
Rabbi Koslowe never took a position on their guilt or innocence or on the appropriateness of the sentence. After the execution, he was involved in finding a foster home for the Rosenbergs' sons, Robert and Michael, who were eventually adopted by a family named Meeropol.
Michael Meeropol, now chairman of the economics department at Western New England College in Springfield, Mass., said in an interview that the Rosenbergs, who spent more than two years at Sing Sing before their execution, respected Rabbi Koslowe and enjoyed their time with him. He recalled interviewing Rabbi Koslowe for a book he and Robert wrote in 1975 called "We Are Your Sons: The Legacy of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg" (Houghton Mifflin, 1975).
"I asked Rabbi Koslowe if he thought my parents were religious, if they believed in God," Michael Meeropol wrote. (In news reports of the cold war era, the Rosenbergs were often portrayed as godless communists.)
Rabbi Koslowe responded: "I found them responsive at all times and respectful. I read some material about the fact that they had a disdain for religion. I read this in the newspapers. From my contact with them that was not apparent at all."
The rabbi recalled that the Rosenbergs regularly attended services in the prison synagogue, but he said he was not sure if it was for religious reasons or because it was a rare opportunity for them to be in the same room. But the motivation, he said, was not important.
The Meeropol book also contains letters the Rosenbergs wrote to each other in prison. In one, Julius wrote of Rabbi Koslowe: "Without doubt the Rabbi is a sincere, intelligent and learned man and the method he uses to integrate prayer with present circumstances and obtain uniform participation is very effective."
Rabbi Koslowe's Sing Sing congregation was never very large. The chapel's worn wooden pews and the carved ark that held the Torah scroll were donated by a synagogue that was being remodeled. Of the 50 seats, rarely were more than 10 occupied. Of the 2,400 prisoners at the prison in the early 1990's, Rabbi Koslowe estimated that 35 were Jewish. He was never unhappy about the size of the congregation, which he used to say was the only one in the world that did not mind losing members.
Rabbi Koslowe had a level of access at Sing Sing enjoyed by few others. "He had the run of the place," said his son Neil. "He never bothered to abide by the rules. He was there longer than any warden, any guard or any prisoners."
He became a consultant for the State Department of Correctional Services and was often called in to help during various prison disturbances, including the riot at Attica in 1971. He was a past president of the American Correctional Chaplains Association and editor of its journal.
Rabbi Koslowe graduated from Yeshiva University and its affiliated rabbinical school, the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary. He had a master's degree in education from New York University and a doctorate in sociology from Yeshiva University.
In addition to his son Neil, who lives in Silver Spring, Md., Rabbi Koslowe is survived by his wife, Marly; two other sons, Kenneth, of Petach Tikvah, Israel, and Mark, of East Brunswick, N.J.; a daughter, Shari Schechter of Miami Beach; 19 grandchildren; and 6 great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Pace of Borrowing By Consumers Slows

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Borrowing by consumers increased at a slower annual pace in October, a sign that Americans were more cautious about spending as the holiday season neared.
Borrowing through credit cards, auto loans and other means rose $16.6 billion in October, the Federal Reserve reported. Excluding a one-time adjustment for previously unreported debt, new borrowing rose $8.7 billion in October after a gain of $8.9 billion the month before. 
 That means Americans took on new debt at a 7 percent annual rate in October, down from the 7.2 percent pace a month earlier and 9.3 percent in the first nine months of the year. Higher borrowing costs and energy prices along with declines in stock prices caused buyer optimism to sink in October and November.
"Consumers are just tapped out," said Christopher Low, chief United States economist at First Tennessee Capital Markets in New York. The revisions, a result of adjustments in asset reporting by two large, unnamed lenders, suggest that banks and others "were going through their loan portfolios with fine-tooth combs," Mr. Low said.
The average number of workers filing new claims for jobless benefits rose last week to its highest in two and a half years, a separate Labor Department report showed. The four-week moving average rose 1,250, to 345,250. That is the most since mid-July 1998.

HEADLINE: The Problem Isn't the Kids

BYLINE: By Louis V. Gerstner Jr. and Tommy G. Thompson; Louis V. Gerstner Jr., chairman of I.B.M., and Tommy G. Thompson, governor of Wisconsin, are co-chairmen of Achieve Inc.

 BODY:
Yet another international comparison of math and science achievement has found American children falling behind -- news that Americans tell pollsters they are tired of hearing. It would be convenient to dismiss the disparities -- after all, the United States wouldn't trade economies with any of the 14 countries -- from small ones like the Slovak Republic and Slovenia to larger and more populous ones, like Japan and Canada -- whose eighth graders topped ours. But what's at stake is tomorrow's economy, not today's.
These results force us to ask whether today's middle schoolers will have what they need to earn decent wages and secure a more comfortable future, or whether they face life in an ever-shrinking pool of economic opportunity. 
 The new results, from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, in which 38 countries participated, show American eighth graders about where they were four years ago -- average, putting them on par with students from Bulgaria, Latvia and New Zealand. They came out ahead of those in 17 countries, including South Africa and Thailand.
It's especially troubling that four years ago, when today's American eighth graders were in fourth grade, as a group they ranked better -- well above the international math average on an earlier version of the same test, scoring behind their peers in only seven countries. The message here is extraordinary and irrefutable: Every day our public schools are open, the gulf between our children and the world's top performers grows wider.
The problem isn't the kids; it's what and how they are taught. What American schools consider eighth-grade math is barely sixth-grade math in countries like The Netherlands and Singapore. Most eighth-grade math exams in the United States emphasize arithmetic, computation, whole numbers and fractions -- topics that students in top-ranked nations are expected to master well before middle school. These countries' eighth graders are getting the fundamentals of algebra and geometry.
It is true that states across the country have raised academic standards and student achievement over the last four years, and we can find shining examples of success in virtually every school district. But far too few classrooms have been transformed. We need a national response.
The answer, however, is not to wait for a top-down federal solution or simply to spend more money without changes in teaching, learning and accountability. The states themselves must step up to the challenge, and they can do it best by working together to find and share the best classroom practices. Fifty blue-ribbon commissions and sets of proposals would waste more time and a lot more money. Besides, algebraic equations yield the same answers in New York as in Wisconsin.
Through a collaboration called the Math Achievement Partnership, 11 states, ranging geographically from Washington to North Carolina, are already pooling their resources and political capital to attack this problem. They are working with mathematicians and educators organized by Achieve Inc., the nonprofit organization, created by governors and corporate leaders, of which we are the co-chairmen.
The first step is using what we can learn from top-performing nations to agree on what our kids should know before high school. These expectations will be made public early next year. Next, the math partnership will develop more rigorous lessons in math, better training and support for teachers, and a common measure for comparing results annually, not every four years. The partnership is open to any state that wants to join.
We share a belief that states must govern their own educational enterprises. But with that authority comes a clear responsibility to act, and act promptly, when their systems fall short. Our children's well-being and our national competitiveness depend on it.

HEADLINE: New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce Names New Head

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Kathryn S. Wylde, a leader for two decades in the fields of housing and economic development, was named president and chief executive yesterday of the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce, the city's most prestigious business group.
The organization, which was founded in 1979 by David Rockefeller to formalize the public-private partnerships that had been forged during the city's fiscal crisis, is made up of about 200 top executives of major corporations and institutions. 
 Mr. Rockefeller, who is still active in the partnership, said that Ms. Wylde was the ideal choice to lead the organization. "Kathy has been one of the most effective members of the staff for over 20 years," Mr. Rockefeller said yesterday.
But although the partnership continues to play a significant role in education policy and housing, its critics say that in recent years it has lost its way and has failed to take an aggressive role in guiding city policy-making.
The announcement yesterday signaled that the directors of the partnership were eager to raise the profile of the organization, whose president for the last five years has been Robert R. Kiley, the former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Mr. Kiley is leaving to become commissioner of Transport for London, the agency that will oversee that city's troubled transportation system.
In addition to assuming the reins of the partnership, Ms. Wylde, 54, will retain her role as president of the New York City Investment Fund, a private fund that the financier Henry R. Kravis established in 1996 to stimulate job creation.
Since its inception, the $110 million fund has invested in more than 40 for-profit and nonprofit companies that are expected to generate more than 6,000 jobs in the city. Those companies include the Gun for Hire Production Center in downtown Manhattan, which provides temporary spaces and services to television and film producers, and Slice of Harlem, a company with three restaurants in the neighborhood.
The fund has also drawn on the volunteer services of dozens of prominent members of the financial community to identify industries with growth potential and to work with entrepreneurs to start and strengthen businesses.
It has also had some casualties -- most recently, when Urban Box Office, an Internet portal for fans of hip-hop culture, went out of business. Earlier this year, the fund dropped its goal of providing capital for local manufacturing, saying it was having trouble finding appropriate companies in which to invest.
Mr. Kravis said the further integration of the two organizations, which already operate from the same offices at 1 Battery Plaza and have many overlapping board members, would help restore "the vision that the partnership had when David Rockefeller set it up."
"It's time to take a fresh look at the partnership," Mr. Kravis said, "and see how we can make it even more effective."
The chairman of the partnership, Robert Catell, pointed out that the investment fund has extensive experience with high-tech industries and that bringing the two organizations closer together was a way of "moving the partnership into a new era."
A native of Madison, Wis., Ms. Wylde served as president of the partnership's housing affiliate from 1982 until 1996. During that time, the New York Housing Partnership created 13,000 units of privately financed housing, reintroducing home ownership in neighborhoods that developers and banks had abandoned years before. Among its projects was Melrose Court, the first condominium development in the South Bronx.
As she assumes the leadership of the partnership, Ms. Wylde said, she expects the organization to concentrate on a few key issues. One is likely to involve the feasibility of developing a biotechnology industry in the city with the cooperation of the major medical institutions.
"We need to bring a private-sector perspective and resources to the most important issues facing the city, but not get involved in every controversy," Ms. Wylde said. "The partnership needs to be judicious about how its leadership weighs in and where."
But Ester R. Fuchs, the director of the Barnard-Columbia Center for Urban Policy, said she hoped that the partnership would play a more active role in researching and influencing public policy matters. "If you can mobilize the business community," she said, "you can change any policy outcome that you want."

HEADLINE: California Sets Up 3 Centers for Basic Scientific Research

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Entering an arena where the federal government has largely shaped the nation's agenda, Gov. Gray Davis of California today announced the establishment of three major research institutions dedicated to nanotechnology, biotechnology, and telecommunications and computing.
The effort, which will create the California Institutes for Science and Innovation, will be underwritten by $300 million in state funds over four years and more than twice that amount from corporate sponsors. 
 The institutions, comprising joint ventures among campuses in the University of California system, are intended to increase the competitiveness of the state's economy by focusing on technology challenges from transportation to agriculture.
They will include these components:
*The California Nanosystems Institute, at the University of California at Los Angeles in collaboration with the University of California at Santa Barbara, which will focus on the development of extremely miniaturized technologies.
*The California Institute for Bioengineering, Biotechnology and Quantitative Biomedicine, at the University of California at San Francisco in collaboration with the University of California at Berkeley and the University of California at Santa Cruz.
*The California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology, at the University of California at San Diego in collaboration with the University of California at Irvine, whose work will include development of a more powerful, wireless Internet.
The governor said he would seek funds in next year's state budget for a fourth institute at Berkeley to focus on information technology.
The creation of the centers comes in one of California's longest peacetime economic booms. And it is an uncommonly ambitious effort for a state, rather than the federal government, to undertake and finance.
"Historically, since World War II the research agenda of the country has been determined by the federal government," said Robert Conn, dean of the Jacobs School of Engineering at the San Diego campus.
The research initiatives will try to replicate the legendary Silicon Valley entrepreneurial model, Governor Davis said in a telephone interview.
In the 1930's, Frederick Terman, then an electrical engineering professor at Stanford University, encouraged his students to start business of their own rather than move East to work for traditional electronics companies.
Two of his students who chose to stay were William Hewlett and David Packard, who created the company that became the electronics and computing powerhouse.
"It's my hope to replicate Silicon Valley," Governor Davis said. "The most important thing a state government can do to improve local economies is to support research universities."
He noted that corporations had easily exceeded his goal of obtaining two-to-one matching funds from private sources.
Corporate contributors to the centers include some of the biggest names in high technology. The Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology alone has raised $140 million from companies like I.B.M., Sun Microsystems, Qualcomm and Sony. Other contributors include Genentech and Bank of America to the bioengineering center, and Hewlett-Packard and Cisco Systems to the nanosystems center.
Douglas Henton, an economist who specializes in studying the region, said the state's investment was needed to catalyze the kind of economic chain reaction touched off in Silicon Valley. But, Mr. Henton said, it was only a first step.
"The fact that the governor is paying attention to these technologies is great," said Mr. Henton, president of Collaborative Economics, an industry and government consulting firm in Palo Alto, Calif. "The test will be whether the institutes create a culture of collaboration with industry to successfully transfer technology."
California is not the first state to finance basic research. In 1990, for example, Georgia created the Georgia Research Alliance; through last year it had invested $242 million in research and development at six universities matched by $65 million in private funds.
Other state-financed basic research activities have taken place in Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. But the California project dwarfs the others.
"In the past, states have put money into skills training and generally left it for the federal government to lead research activities," said Cheryl Fields, a spokeswoman for National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges in Washington.
Researchers at the California universities were enthusiastic about the open-ended nature of the research financing, saying the institutes could aim for basic-science achievements comparable to those of Bell Laboratories in its glory days.
"He's given us the resources," said Peter Rentzopis, a professor of chemistry at the Irvine campus and associate director of the Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology, said of the governor. "Now it's up to us to deliver."

HEADLINE: U.S. and Russia Ask Harsh Sanctions on Afghanistan

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 7

 BODY:
The United States and Russia asked the Security Council today to toughen and broaden sanctions against the Taliban government of Afghanistan, measures that would cut the country off from most contact with the world.
The common ground taken by the Russians and Americans in demonizing the Taliban follows their taking exactly opposite sides in the catastrophic civil war that followed the Soviet invasion of 1979. 
 A coalition of holy warriors, supplied by the United States, eventually drove Russian troops out. But a decade later, in a surprising reversal, the Russians are arming these very warriors because they are fighting Moscow's new enemy, the Taliban.
The agreement by the Russians and Americans on sanctions is also rare. They both are concerned about the Taliban's influence across Central Asia and beyond, concluding that the Islamic movement supports Muslim militancy and international terrorism. Both Moscow and Washington discount fears that the new sanctions could harden the Taliban's position and ruin prospects of a negotiated settlement of the Afghan civil war.
Sergey Lavrov, the Russian ambassador, told reporters today that the new measures would leave "ample room" for peace talks to continue, a point also made by American officials.
"The problem is that the Taliban never delivered on a single promise, be this to start the dialogue, be this to stop fighting, be this to treat women and girls properly, or any other demand from the Security Council to stop the support for terrorism," Mr. Lavrov said.
Russians accuse the Taliban of involvement in the war in Chechnya. The United States is focused on the sanctuary in Afghanistan of the Saudi-born financier of militancy, Osama bin Laden, who is wanted in the United States on charges of being behind the bombings of two American embassies in Africa in 1998.
Reaction from the Taliban was swift. In Afghanistan, a minister of the Islamic movement called Mr. bin Laden "a guest and the upholder of the Afghan holy war" and said the Taliban could not be forced to hand him over.
In New York, the Taliban's representative, who may be forced to leave the United States under the new sanctions, said the proposed measures had more to do with Russian policy in Central Asia than the situation in Afghanistan. He predicted that the country would close ranks against outsiders and become more defiant.
Under the Russian-American resolution, which is almost certain to pass in the next week or two, the Council would demand the closing of all Taliban diplomatic offices around the world and those of Afghanistan's national airline, Ariana. All flights to or from landlocked Afghanistan, except for relief missions and religious pilgrimages, would be banned.
A comprehensive arms embargo would be imposed on the Taliban, but not on the opposition army of former American-backed mujahedeen struggling to keep a foothold in about 5 percent of the country. To curb the production of heroin in Afghanistan, the world's biggest opium grower, the sale of a chemical used in the making of heroin, acetic anhydride, would be banned.
Current sanctions restrict some flights of the Afghan airline and block off any Taliban financial assets abroad.
The Russian-American resolution demands not only the surrender of Mr. bin Laden, whose financial assets would be frozen worldwide, but also the closing of all training camps for Islamic militants. Sanctions would not end until all conditions were met.
Russian and American diplomats, seeking Beijing's support, have told the Chinese that these camps also send fighters to Muslim areas of China. India accuses the Taliban of involvement in the war in Kashmir.
At the insistence of France, which is wary of imposing any more open-ended sanctions, like those on Iraq, the new measures would have to be reviewed after a year.
Abdul Hakeem Mujahid, the representative in New York of the Taliban, who have been denied the United Nations seat still held by the mujahedeen opposition, said that the actions would increase sympathy for the Taliban across the Islamic world.
"The U.S. and U.N. are claiming championship of human rights all over the world, and at the same time they are killing our people with hunger," he said. "Now they want to prolong the war. They encourage the opposition to fight against the central government."
"Iran and Russia will benefit most from the sanctions," he said. "The Russian federation does want instability in Afghanistan. The Russians want to bring military forces into the region, and put the economic burden of supporting the army on the Central Asians while controlling those countries. Iran wants pipelines from Central Asia to go through Iran, not Afghanistan, the shortest way."
"This will only increase the resentment of the people of Afghanistan," he said. "We had nothing against the United States. We fought together against Russians. Ironically, today the U.S. is working alongside Russia against the people of Afghanistan."
The Taliban generally get little support from Islamic world, compared with the chorus of defense that has arisen in recent months for the Palestinians. But today neighboring Pakistan, the Taliban's main arms supplier, also condemned the proposed sanctions.
Shamshad Ahmad, Pakistan's United Nations representative and a former foreign secretary, said the sanctions would "scuttle" efforts by a representative of Secretary General Kofi Annan to start negotiations between the Taliban and their armed enemies after two decades of civil war.
"We believe that any new sanctions will further isolate and insulate the Taliban, with whom the world has been seeking to engage constructively, so that their policies can be influenced and moderated," Mr. Ahmad told reporters today. He said the measures would "only aggravate the situation, in terms of disrupting all channels of communication between the international community and the Taliban."
He added that coming on top of a severe drought in Afghanistan -- one that the United Nations estimates could put upward of a million people at risk of starvation -- the harsher sanctions could drive more people out of the country as refugees. Tens of thousands of Afghans have fled hunger and fighting in recent months.
An American official said today that the United States would be talking to Pakistan about getting it to cooperate with the new sanctions, a crucial factor in determining whether the measures will have any effect. In Islamabad, government officials say that they will support sanctions only if they are applied to both sides in the Afghan civil war.
"As a matter of principle," Mr. Ahmad said, sanctions are always unjust, unfair and counterproductive because they never, never achieve the desired objectives. They only hurt innocent people."

HEADLINE: Clinton and Republicans Gain on Spending Accord

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
Congressional leaders met again today with President Clinton and said they had made modest progress toward a budget agreement that would permit the 106th Congress to finish its work and adjourn for the year.
After the hourlong session, Jake Siewert, the White House press secretary, said: "The meeting helped narrow some differences. But there are still significant differences, especially on education." 
 The basic dynamic appears unchanged. Mr. Clinton is seeking a major increase in spending on domestic programs, especially education, which includes money for school construction and financial aid to college students. Republicans will accept smaller increases, but have no desire to help Mr. Clinton enhance his reputation as the "education president." They say they can get a better deal if they wait for the next administration, which they hope will be headed by George W. Bush.
The most contentious of the spending bills provides money for education, labor and health programs in the current fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1. Mr. Clinton had been seeking $114 billion, an increase of $18 billion over last year.
After the meeting today, John P. Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, said the bill would probably emerge with a total of $107 billion.
Mr. Feehery said Congress and the White House also appeared to be inching toward a compromise that would grant legal status to a limited number of illegal immigrants and allow some of their close relatives to come to the United States. Mr. Clinton had been seeking amnesty for many more illegal immigrants.
Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, said Congress would almost certainly reach an agreement with the White House to increase Medicare payments to hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies and health maintenance organizations. Those payments were cut in 1997, and health care providers say the savings far exceed what Congress intended.
"The Medicare adjustments will be easily agreed to," Mr. Armey said.
Medicare provides health care for 39 million people who are elderly or disabled.
Congress had agreed to provide $30 billion of additional Medicare money over the next five years, but the administration wanted several billion dollars more. Mr. Armey said Republicans were willing to provide $1.7 billion more, to help rural hospitals, teaching hospitals, hospices and home health agencies.
The Medicare money had been part of a bill that would cut taxes and raise the minimum wage. Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, both Republicans, argued that the Medicare legislation should be removed from the tax bill and passed separately. Congressional leaders said they now expected to do just that.
But the White House is insisting that Congress also do something to help provide health insurance for people who have no coverage.
"There should be some way to increase coverage for the most vulnerable citizens in the context of doing something for the health care providers," said Mr. Siewert, the White House spokesman. "We're willing to be flexible about how we do that."
In a concession to Republicans, the Clinton administration said it would scale back its demand for an increase in Pell grants, which provide money to help low-income students attend college. Mr. Clinton had been insisting that the maximum grant, now $3,300, be increased to $3,800, but administration officials said that they could accept a $3,600 maximum.
Republicans on both sides of the Capitol said the tax bill was dead. The bill would have provided $240 billion in tax relief over 10 years. It would also have increased the minimum wage by $1 an hour, to $6.15 an hour, and provided tax credits and other economic incentives for business investment in economically depressed areas -- two measures that Mr. Clinton still hopes to rescue.
Mr. Siewert said, "It's unfortunate that Congress found time to raise its own pay, but could not find time to raise the minimum wage."
The community renewal measure was worked out in months of negotiations between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Hastert.
Mr. Armey said the weakness of the economy strengthened the Republicans' case for tax cuts.
"There's genuine concern about a recession," said Mr. Armey, a former professor of economics at the University of North Texas. "Throughout all the history of economic analysis, the best thing you can do at the onset of a recession is to cut taxes."
But, Mr. Armey said, Republicans figure they can get a better tax bill working with a Bush administration. "Governor Bush has a good tax package," he said.
The meeting today suggests that Republican leaders will keep negotiating with Mr. Clinton, at least for now, rather than pursue the confrontational strategy advocated by Tom DeLay of Texas, the House Republican whip, who said on Wednesday that he was ready for a showdown with the president.
Mr. DeLay wants to freeze spending in the current fiscal year at last year's levels for roughly one-fourth of the federal budget.
But Mr. Siewert said: "That's just not an acceptable solution. There are too many universities, too many students, too many schools all across the country that are relying on some sort of increase for education."

HEADLINE: Make a Wish, It's Bonus Time On Wall Street

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
Forget Christmas and Hanukkah, the most anticipated days of the year on Wall Street are spread over the next two weeks. That is when some of the biggest investment banks will tell their employees how big their year-end bonuses will be.
Once again, the numbers for most of them will be very big, more than most American workers can imagine receiving in a lump sum. On average, bonuses are expected to rise 5 percent to 15 percent from last year and some of the hottest deal makers will receive packages of cash and stock worth several million dollars. But for the first time in six years, investment bankers and traders are heading into bonus season with a sense of dread. 
 The stock and bond markets are in a slump and two big mergers have led to thousands of layoffs. With no rebound in sight, Wall Street executives are bracing for tough times even as they prepare to divide the spoils of what, in the end, is turning out to be their most profitable year.
"I've heard people say, 'We're going to pay a huge bonus in January but have a layoff in March,' " said Alan Johnson, president of Johnson Associates, which advises Wall Street firms on compensation. "There are a lot more serious concerns than there were a year or two ago: firms have overhired, the I.P.O. market is dead."
Mr. Johnson still says that bonuses, which account for the bulk of annual pay for most bankers and traders, will be at least 20 percent higher, on average, than they were last year. Firms set aside more money for bonuses in the first three quarters of the year than in all of 1999, so the payouts have to be considerably bigger, he said.
But Wall Street officials have been trying to douse such expectations in recent weeks, leading many of their employees to believe that they will be lucky to get a bonus even slightly larger than last year's. The consensus among recruiters and compensation consultants is that bonuses, on average, will be 5 percent to 15 percent bigger than they were for 1999.
At the Goldman Sachs Group, traditionally one of the most profitable firms in the industry, investment banking executives recently warned about the hazards of spending as though the good times would never end. People inside the firm said that total bonuses would be 15 percent to 20 percent higher than last year. A Goldman spokesman said that the firm would not discuss details of its pay practices.
Despite the sharp sell-off in technology stocks in April and a prolonged slump in the high-yield bond market, a prime source of Goldman's profits, the firm's earnings were almost 30 percent higher in the first three quarters of its current fiscal year than in the corresponding period a year earlier. The firm's expenses for employee compensation and benefits rose even more, about 33 percent.
Over all, the securities industry paid about $12 billion in bonuses at the end of 1999, according to the Securities Industry Association. It expects that number to be flat this year as overall industry pretax profits hit a record $22 billion.
"It's going to be a great year, but you have to understand that the trajectory is downward," said Frank Fernandez, the association's chief economist. "Firms are going to decide to be a little more frugal because the business outlook isn't as good as it was."
John Rogan, a managing director at Russell Reynolds Associates, a recruitment firm, said, "We have seen a readjustment of sights but bonuses being up 5 percent to 15 percent over last year is still impressive."
The variation in pay, though, is expected to be much wider than in recent years, with some bankers who specialize in the most active industry sectors, like telecommunications and technology, having their pay doubled or even tripled, while junk-bond traders and municipal finance specialists will have to settle for considerably smaller bonuses -- if they get any at all.
Employees at Goldman, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Lehman Brothers and a few other investment banks are scheduled to hear about their bonuses next week. At Lehman Brothers, managers were meeting yesterday afternoon to decide how the firm's profits would be distributed among employees.
Bonuses will come from the firm's profits but there is not necessarily a direct correlation.
"It's never been about taking this year's profits and divvying them up," one Wall Street recruiter said. In large part, this recruiter said, firms pay people as much as they think they must to keep them. In February and March, the competitive pressure was intense and the young bankers gained the upper hand, extracting new perquisites like concierge services, health club memberships and company-supplied laptop computers.
But the softening market and the acquisition of two midsize investment banks -- Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and J. P. Morgan -- removed much of that pressure. Chase Manhattan, which is buying Morgan, said it would lay off 5,000 workers; Credit Suisse First Boston said its acquisition of Donaldson would lead to 2,600 layoffs.
One reason for that sorting out is that firms have guaranteed so much pay to employees in the last few years. With the stock market bulling ahead and multibillion-dollar mergers occurring at a breakneck pace, firms waged a war for talent that sent wages spiraling. To compete, they locked in deal makers with multiyear, multimillion-dollar packages that defied the Wall Street tradition of minimizing fixed costs.
As the 1990's boomed on, two-by-fours (two years at $4 million a year) became three-by-fives.
Some firms are so flush that despite the downturn in the market, they are still spending heavily to lure people away from more established competitors. After Donaldson merged with Credit Suisse First Boston, the Swiss bank UBS hired away about 25 former Donaldson bankers who had just signed contracts to work for First Boston.
In the last two weeks, bankers have been buzzing with rumors about Deutsche Bank's costly poaching of Tony Whittemore, a telecommunications mergers banker, from the Salomon Smith Barney unit of Citigroup. Recruiters and some people inside Salomon said Deutsche offered Mr. Whittemore, 32, a three-year contract that would pay him at least $18 million.
Mr. Whittemore referred a call seeking comment to a Deutsche Bank spokeswoman, who would not discuss the contract.
But pay packages like that are more the exception than the rule these days, as many bankers suddenly are clinging tightly to their jobs.
"We are hearing from people for the first time in years that they are happy just to have a job," said Cynthia Remec, president of her own recruiting firm.
She added, "They know that things are going to get rocky, and they want to position themselves in the safest place possible to ride out the storm."

HEADLINE: Shop and Home Ec Revived As New Jersey Requirements

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE 

 BODY:
Confronted by educators who argued that car repair and cake decorating were as important as an appreciation of Picasso, the New Jersey Department of Education agreed to suspend new requirements that eliminated shop classes and home economics in favor of ones in visual and performing arts.
The education commissioner, David C. Hespe, sent a letter to superintendents yesterday saying that students could take courses like woodshop or metalworking to satisfy requirements in visual or performing arts, at least for the next two years. 
 Defenders of the so-called practical arts courses cried victory.
"I think we have sent a very, very clear message that you messed up," said Assemblyman Joseph R. Malone 3rd, a Republican from Burlington. "It just boggles my mind. The state board was sending a message that people who work with their hands are less valuable, less valued, than people in other areas.
"It smacks of elitism, it smacks of discrimination, it just really put into focus what people have thought for years, the impression that the state board of ed is a bunch of people sitting around with teacups and crumpets making decisions about schoolchildren in New Jersey without any regard for what the realities are."
The requirement to take five credits in the visual and performing arts in high school was part of new state graduation standards passed in 1996 after about two years of hearings and meetings around the state. Before that, the practical arts -- broadly speaking, home economics and shop classes -- had also been a requirement. The new requirements were to take effect in the academic year that began in September. The state had suggested that students could satisfy the new requirements by learning the exercise technique of Pilates or organizing and staging a chamber music recital.
Assemblyman Malone proposed a new bill reinstating the practical arts requirement after hearing complaints from teachers and principals.
"Not every student is or should be a college-bound student," said Karen Joseph, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Education Association, the state's largest teachers' union. "We so often hear people say, 'I tried to get an electrician and I couldn't get one,' and when they finally do, they say, 'I was astounded at the cost.' Supply and demand is a very basic element at all this. Practical arts have their place in our society, and we should not diminish their importance."
Getting rid of practical arts courses might increase the dropout rate, some educators worried.
"We have kids who come to school only because there's home economics classes," said Chuck Stein, assistant executive director of the New Jersey Principals and Supervisors Association. "The same thing can be said of woodshop or metal shop."
The Department of Education, he said, seems to think there is no artistic value in practical arts, apparently believing bad stereotypes about shop. But the range of courses, he said, includes ice sculpting, cake design and woodcarving. "These are artistic things and things kids really get into," Mr. Stein said. "We don't want them deprived of it."
Toni Kovak, who teaches culinary arts at Freehold Regional High School, wore a chef's uniform to the State House yesterday to defend her profession. "Eliminating practical arts for graduation requirements will eventually hurl our educational system back into the 1950's," she said. "We'll be segregating our elite students to pure academia with no life skills and our 'imperfect' children to a quasi-vocational setting with limited academic options."
The state, however, says that its graduation requirements in all courses add up to 100 credits. Most high schools require 120 credits for graduation, so students have room for courses that the state does not require, and schools can individually decide to require practical arts.
Some educators, though, said that if the courses were not required, students would not take them, and local boards of education might eliminate the offerings. That insecurity would make it hard to attract teachers.
Commissioner Hespe suspended the requirements until at least the 2002-3 school year. In the meantime, he said he would review the requirements next year, as part of a five-year process required when the state originally passed the new graduation requirements. He appointed Assemblyman Malone to head a committee to explore whether practical arts should be required.
"We have acted very quickly to the issues that have arisen," Mr. Hespe, somewhat beleaguered, said yesterday. "Do we know there are passions out there? Certainly we do."
But there were passions on the other side, too. "We've been ridiculed in the press, been accused of being frilly, artsy people, of being elitist," said Marete Wester, executive director of the Alliance for Arts Education. "We, too, reach marginalized, at-risk students. We need creative skills. We need people who can think differently."

HEADLINE: Take My Money. Please.;
Good Service Is Relative at Holidays

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
In terms of good service, Wednesday morning began with promise. The guy from the laundry actually brought my bag up to my apartment instead of making me go down to the lobby in my bathrobe to pick it up -- something I normally tolerate, because at least this laundry does not lose socks.
Service, be it from laundries, supermarkets, bank tellers or store clerks, is a highly subjective concept. What one person regards at doting, another views as gnatlike hovering. One friend is terribly galled when cashiers toss her shopping bag on the counter like so much cabbage, something many people would not even notice. Some want delivery, others covet selection. Most desire civility. 
 It is no secret that good service in Manhattan retail stores is often as rare as discounted Prada, especially during the holidays. Lines are long, gift wrapping is often done begrudgingly and sales clerks are often young and inexperienced, and prefer sharing tidbits about their love lives with one another to ringing up sales.
But the holidays are not about Macy's and Toys "R" Us alone. There is gift wrap to be purchased, dinner to pick up on the way home. Sometimes, the attempt to make the most mundane of purchases -- a box of tissues -- is the one that sends a crazed shopper over the edge. So my mission was thus defined: spend the entire day shopping, both for holiday and basic needs, and see how service is shaping up this season.
For fortification, I started with breakfast at the French Roast Cafe on the Upper West Side with my friend Deb. Eggs, coffee and check came in a timely fashion. So there was a piece of parsley on Deb's water glass, what can you expect from a 24-hour restaurant?
Rushing through the cold air, I tried to stop at Starbucks on Broadway and 87th Street for a coffee to go. The line, as usual, was out the door, the baristas -- those charged with making the hot drinks -- moved in a sluggish manner paradoxical to their product. Regular coffee is self-serve, but still one must wait in line with those getting exotic concoctions to pay. Note to Seattle: Expect strong competition from the deli in a recession.
I fled, without a coffee, to Zany Brainy, a toy store near 89th Street.
There I happened upon a large sale rack of toys made by Noodle Kidoodle, the name of this store before it was acquired by Zany Brainy last spring. I loaded up.
I waited in a short line. A clerk chatted on the phone. I waited some more. The conversation finally wound down, and she agreed to let me pay. I then headed to the back to gift wrap, where I was informed that the Noodle Kidoodle toys were ineligible for wrapping. I could have the paper, but would not be permitted to enjoy the actual service of having these items encased in it. "I don't see the logic in it," admitted the clerk, "it is just what the manager said." She decided to thwart the store's attempt to give bad service by wrapping everything anyway.
Next stop, Radio Shack, where I was to procure a microphone for my teenage cousin, Myles. (Something about rapping along with his music, but that's his mother's problem.) It was there that I experienced a common Radio Shack problem: the sale item was "sold out."
The gentleman behind the counter retreated to the back and came back with a large pile of microphones, all roughly the same price, for my inspection. So what was the difference between them? "Um, well," he began, adding some furious blinking. He turned one box over and began to read aloud from its side.
It dawned on him that I found this insufficient, and he called for a fellow clerk, who explained that one was more powerful. Anticipating an exchange, I bought it and moved on.
The General Store is a small toy store on Broadway, and I decided to pick up a few special things. One of the young women offered to wrap my gifts in pretty purple tissue, while the other obsessively played "Oh! Susanna" on a set of chimes. This might annoy some, but I find it refreshing when people are enthusiastic about what they are selling.
I entered Duane Reade with a simple mission, to buy Kleenex and face soap without getting hurt. This is often a difficult task, and this day was no exception, as I tried to dodge stock clerks pushing huge dollies of merchandise, expecting me to get out of their way. Loaded down with shopping bags, my tissue boxes and soap teetering between my chin and forearms, I got in line.
A clerk appeared behind the counter and, never looking up, waved her fingers furiously at me, which I translated as some prelingual gesture of summoning one to pay. Without making eye contact, she rang me up, slapped my change and shopping bag on the counter and walked away while yelling over her shoulder at the man behind me, "She's open."
A harried woman rushed in, and asked for a common brand of diaper pail liners. She was greeted with a blank stare, and was finally told that the store did not carry them. I suggested she try a store near 80th Street. The clerks, apparently perceiving her request as akin to one for bread in Communist Moscow, did not appear to care. "It just seems like a lot to walk six blocks when you are already up here," the customer said, defeated.
I headed down to SoHo, where I intended to buy pants and have lunch. I became dangerously enticed by the Stork Club, a tiny store on Sullivan Street that sells very expensive children's clothing. Just looking. Really. But the sales clerk, Ti, began to point out the merits of $50 knit hats. ("The kids love them!")
My hand was literally on the door to leave, but Ti would not be defeated. "These jeans are really cute," she said in a gentle, coaxing voice usually reserved for massage therapists. "You can always bring them back and we will make them with whatever color trim you like in the right size." How I walked out of there with a pair of $70 pants for a 4-year-old is pure testament to Ti.
Off to the Cub Room Cafe for lunch, and then to Dean & Deluca. In each place, I was treated with blase but speedy service. That is fine with me. This is not Ames, Iowa. I do not need to know my waiter's name, or witty banter. I want my food in a timely manner and to be allowed to move on.
Moving on, in this case, meant walking down Prince Street to Agnes B., a specialty store, where I grabbed several pairs of pants. Tags were hard to find, and I needed help understanding the sizes. This proved difficult, because either the pasta I ate for lunch had rendered me invisible, or the saleswomen believed it was a mere coincidence that they were simultaneously in the store with me, a customer eager to unload money.
I suddenly felt vaguely fat and in need of a haircut, and I went to brave the pants. When I poked my head out of the dressing room to request another size, the saleswoman, a tad annoyed, hauled herself up from the floor, where she was squatting and eating udon noodles, to procure more clothes.
I implore: Is there a woman out there who, when actually confronted with pants that fit, would not immediately purchase five pairs? I made the point that I was more than happy to do just that, and the saleswoman made a perfunctory look around the store for more pants. She did not have much. I wandered over to the cosmetics counter, and she walked away. Um, could I have this lipstick? Somewhat annoyed, she informed me that I was getting the last one, perhaps reserved for a younger/thinner/hipper self-service customer.
Ti, Agnes B. needs you!
Moving uptown to Bloomingdale's. First stop, the coat department. It has been years since I bought a winter coat, and today was to be the day. The fact that I was lying on my back to get a better peek at the tags might have been a signal of my seriousness. Two clerks were chatting about their evening out. "I should come to your house and help you dress!" "Yeah you should!" "Yeah!"
I called out from a rack: "Where is this coat?" and gestured to a short navy wool jacket. One of the women waved her hand toward the center of the room. "Over there, sweetheart." Like her, I could not be bothered.
Over to the cashmere sweaters, where I plowed through the piles in search of my mother-in-law's size. I grabbed a pedicure kit for no one in particular, and two pairs of jeans, seized by this feeling that the store was closing in around me and I had to get all I could. I proceeded to the counter, where a woman named Denise informed me that she would give me 20 percent off if I agreed to pick my things up on Thursday, when the markdowns officially would begin. Three cheers for Denise!
Off to Saks Fifth Avenue, where I once again tried to buy a coat. I found one, and a room full of saleswomen clucked with approval. One of them, Daisy, tried to ring me up, but she could not see. Turned out she had picked up a co-worker's glasses. She put on the proper pair and beamed.
I ran downstairs to buy my mother-in-law a tree ornament. I quickly found it, but then was stuck waiting in line for 20 excruciating minutes, flanked by the mobs, as I waited to pay. One clerk rang up, the other wrapped. God help them both, working this crowd, but they could not have been slower if they were paid by the minute.
The last stop was back on the Upper West Side, at Fairway Market, where I picked up dinner. Great prices and fine produce aside, I find that Fairway often expresses contempt for its customers by refusing to put signs in the aisles so that they can find things.
"Where is the nutmeg?" I inquired of one man, who punted the question to a co-worker, who had no idea and asked yet another man, who was stocking seltzer. He looked at me gravely. "Oh, we don't have any of that." I ambled over and found a giant rack of it. Pity the fool who wanted to make a sweet potato pie that night.
Spotty service, decent chicken, short walk. It isn't perfect, but hey, this is New York. I'll take it.

G.M. to Cut Production By 14.5% in First Quarter
General Motors announced a big slowdown in factory production while Chrysler asked its suppliers to cut their prices by 5 percent on Jan. 1, further signs that Detroit is struggling with an abrupt weakening of auto sales and ballooning inventories of unsold cars.
G.M. said that it would produce 14.5 percent fewer vehicles in the next three months than it did in the first quarter of this year. Its shares fell 69 cents, to $51.38. Ford had already announced that its output would be down 10 percent. And while Chrysler has not disclosed its first-quarter production plans, it is also expected to make fewer cars by eliminating overtime and by not operating some factories at all for a week or two at a time.

Senate Approves Bankruptcy Bill
The Senate approved a major overhaul of the nation's bankruptcy laws, passing legislation by an overwhelming margin that makes it harder for people to seek legal protection from payment of their debts. But the bill's prospects for becoming law are uncertain at best because Congress may not get the opportunity to override President Clinton's threatened veto before lawmakers adjourn for the year.

HEADLINE: Jets Circulate Plan for Football Stadium Linked to the Javits Center

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
The New York Jets have quietly begun circulating detailed architectural plans as they seek support for a 75,000-seat football stadium on the West Side of Manhattan that would convert into an annex of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and transform into an even larger sports bowl should the city lure the Olympics in 2012.
The plans, which include a retractable roof and a "turf farm" for sunning removable sections of natural stadium grass, seek to forge a political compromise between two forces whose rivalry has helped thwart development in the area: Gov. George E. Pataki, who wants an expansion of the Javits Center, and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who wants a stadium. Since the state owns the land and the city controls the zoning, neither man can do what he wants without the other. 
 Jets officials, who have not said who will pay for what is widely considered to be a $1 billion project, are hoping their plans can finally bring the two sides together. They are also promoting the project to the city's business and opinion leaders as "not a stadium," even while saying it would be a good place for the Super Bowl. Instead, they are casting it as a more politically palatable convention center expansion that may not enrage community groups on the Upper West Side.
They also say that their stadium is "complementary" with the larger plans of their friends at NYC 2012, the local Olympic committee that desperately needs a stadium to bring the summer games to New York. "What we've accomplished so far is Step 1 of a 2,500-step process," said Jay Cross, the president of Jets Development, the new subsidiary that is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars searching for a home for the football team that now plays unhappily in the New Jersey Meadowlands. The Jets played at Shea Stadium in Queens for 21 years before moving to the Meadowlands in 1985.
What the Jets have not accomplished so far is the conclusive approval of Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Pataki and Robert E. Boyle, the chairman of the Javits Center. Yesterday, Mr. Boyle reacted with exasperation to the Jets' plans. If Mr. Cross, a Canadian, "thinks that's an expansion of the Javits Center," Mr. Boyle said, "he needs to spend more time in New York." He added that "if they're trying to make a stadium into a convention center, or a convention center into a stadium, that's dead on arrival."
Nonetheless, the governor continues to say that he is open to any plan that expands the Javits Center, which is widely derided as an out-of-date, second-class building unworthy of its city. The mayor, who saw an early version of the Jets' plan in September and would like to leave behind a major sports stadium as a legacy of his era, has, to no one's surprise, embraced the plan.
"We thought it was an impressive design," Deputy Mayor Anthony P. Coles said this week.
Under the Jets' plan, conceived by the New York City architectural firm of Cooper, Robertson & Partners, the stadium would sit across the street from the Javits Center and stretch over the West Side rail yards, from 30th Street to 34th Street along the Hudson River. For big trade shows, Mr. Cross said, the stadium could be converted within 24 hours to exhibition space and connected to the Javits Center by a footbridge over 34th Street.
Such a plan, Mr. Cross said, would enlarge the Javits Center from its present 800,000 square feet of meeting and exhibit space to 1.1 million square feet, including a new 45,000-square foot ballroom.
Although Mr. Boyle welcomed those plans, it was more important to him, he said, that the convention center expand at least two blocks north, from 39th Street to 41st Street.
Like Mr. Boyle, some economists have questioned the viability of stadium-cum-convention centers. Among them is Robert A. Baade, an economist at Lake Forest College in Illinois who has written extensively about such projects. "A stadium is not an optimal space for either trade shows or conventions," Professor Baade said in October.
Mr. Cross acknowledged the skepticism. "All of those people are quite correct in what they're saying," he said. "But what we're proposing has never been done before. It would be a no-compromise building," which he said means installing a "lighting grid" in the stadium that would optically lower the ceiling and transform it from a "cavernous space" to a more human-scaled area better suited for conventions.
The exterior of the stadium, Mr. Cross added, would be "airy" and "glassy" and surrounded by a large public plaza on the banks of the river.
"We see this as a building," Mr. Cross said. "We don't see this as a concrete bucket where people are going to sit and watch sports."
Although Mr. Cross said it would be ideal to extend public transportation to the area -- the Olympics plan calls for the extension of subway and railroad service -- it was not critical, he said, to the development of the stadium.
Studies commissioned by the Jets have found, he said, that traffic for Sunday afternoon or Monday evening football games would not be worse than it is during normal business hours.
Community groups have countered that such traffic would make the neighborhood unlivable.
Mr. Cross, who developed the $240 million, 20,000-seat American Airlines Arena in Miami for the Miami Heat, was hired by the Jets last summer. He met with city and state officials in September, when he showed them early drawings by Alex Cooper, the co-architect for the master plan for Battery Park City. Since then, Mr. Cross has hired additional architects who have expertise in sports stadiums and convention centers.

Intel Joins Industry Dirge as It Lowers Its Financial Projections

BYLINE: By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7

 BODY:
The Intel Corporation, the world's largest semiconductor maker, cautioned investors today that its revenues this quarter would fall short of projections. The company became the latest addition to the growing list of companies that face troubles in the lethargic market for personal computers.
Blaming order cancellations by large customers and general slowdowns in the world economy, Intel said it expected revenue for the fourth quarter to be flat from the previous quarter, when revenue totaled $8.7 billion. The company had projected growth of 4 to 8 percent. 
 Holiday sales have historically propelled computer companies and chip makers to a strong fourth quarter, but this year Intel joined Gateway, Apple Computer and Hewlett-Packard in acknowledging sharp slowdowns in PC sales.
"The back part of the dog is acknowledging what the front part of the dog has been seeing for a long time," said Andrew J. Neff, a senior managing director with Bear, Stearns.
Intel fell $1.81, to $30.50, in extended trading before rising to $32.63. During regular trading, the shares had gained 56 cents. Intel shares have fallen 57 percent since August.
Intel, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., had warned of weakening demand in Europe as early as September. But in a conference call with analysts today, Intel executives said they saw slowed growth in all market sectors, across the world.
"Economies worldwide appear to be slowing more quickly than we had anticipated," said Sean M. Maloney, senior vice president and director of sales and marketing for Intel.
Analysts had been expecting earnings of 42 cents a share for the current quarter, which ends Dec. 31, up from 35 cents a share in the period a year earlier, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
As computer sales slow, the companies that make computers place fewer orders for the semiconductors that power them.
"The PC industry has moved from being a growth business to being a cyclical growth business, partially as a result of its size," Mr. Neff said. "It's much more responsive to economic forces than it was earlier in its life cycle."
Ashok Kumar, an analyst who covers the semiconductor industry for U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray, said Intel's revenue would grow only 2 percent from the period in 1999 if this quarter's revenue was flat compared with the third quarter.
"I was hoping for some silver linings, that they could pull off something in Europe," Mr. Kumar said. "Clearly that didn't happen."
Intel stuck with its projections of 63 percent for gross margins, largely because the company spent less than expected.
The company said expenses, excluding special charges, would remain flat at $2.3 billion, compared with a 6 to 8 percent increase previously projected.
The woes also hit Microsoft, which lost $19 billion in market share today after Rick G. Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs, lowered quarterly sales and earnings estimates, "given the preponderance of evidence of sluggish retail PC demand."
Microsoft stock fell $3.56, or 6 percent, to $53.13.
Acknowledging that consumer computer sales account for only 10 percent of Microsoft's revenues, Mr. Sherlund cut his revenue expectations by $125 million, to a range of $6.775 billion to $6.8 billion, an 11 percent increase over the period last year. Mr. Sherlund reduced earnings estimates 3 cents, to $1.88, which is slightly below what Microsoft forecast in its most recent guidance on Oct. 18.
Roger McNamee, a co-founder of Integral Capital Partners and Silver Lake Partners, private investment firms based in Menlo Park, Calif., wondered why the decline in PC growth had taken investors by such surprise.
"In some ways, the greater surprise is that it took so long for this deceleration to happen," he said.
Adding to the gloom today was a report by the International Data Corporation, a leading market research firm, which forecast domestic annual PC sales growth for 2000 of 12.2 percent, half of the 1999 total. International Data, of Framingham, Mass., also lowered its sales estimates for the current quarter, projecting 15.8 percent growth compared with estimates of 17.1 percent made three months ago.
Loren Loverde, director of the firm's sales tracking program, attributed the soft market to reduced desire by consumers to spend money because of a dropping stock market and rising oil prices. I.D.C. did see some hope overseas, he said, but the United States drives global sales, with 37.5 percent of the world market.
While it agreed on slowed growth in the domestic market and Europe, International Data saw bright spots where Intel did not. Intel said Asian markets had slowed below expected levels, despite brisk sales in Japan and China, but International Data forecast Asian growth of 33.4 percent in the fourth quarter. And though Intel cited slowdowns in notebook computer production in Taiwan, International Data said notebook sales in the United States, Western Europe and Asia all exceeded expectations. The firm expects growth in notebook sales of 32 percent in the quarter.
"We are concerned about the dip in the fourth quarter, but we think we have other areas of strength," Mr. Loverde said.
But Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J. P. Morgan, said he would not be surprised to hear more computer makers express caution in the coming weeks.
"I think we're going to get a lot of bad news out of these stocks before Christmas," Mr. Kunstler said.

HEADLINE: Senators Back Major Overhaul Of Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7

 BODY:
The Senate approved a major overhaul of the nation's bankruptcy laws today, passing legislation by an overwhelming margin that makes it harder for people to seek legal protection from payment of their debts. The vote was 70 to 28.
But the bill's prospects for becoming law are uncertain at best because Congress may not get the opportunity to override President Clinton's threatened veto before lawmakers adjourn for the year. Even so, it is unclear whether an override, which would require a two-thirds vote, would succeed. 
 The legislation, a compromise hammered out by House and Senate negotiators, was adopted by voice vote by the House on Oct. 12, and enjoys broad bipartisan support in that chamber, as well as from credit-card companies, banks and retailers.
An earlier version of the bill passed the House last year by a veto-proof margin of 313 to 108.
The bill imposes new income requirements on those in bankruptcy who wish to get a fresh start by making use of the debt-forgiveness provisions of the law.
The White House, civil rights groups and consumer advocates criticized the measure because it would allow anti-abortion protesters to avoid court judgments over illegal protests by seeking bankruptcy protection, and because it failed to end exemptions available in Florida and Texas that allow people with large homes to avoid forfeiting them when filing for bankruptcy.
Today's vote added a twist to the contentious year-end budget negotiations between President Clinton and the Republican-controlled House and Senate in this unusual lame-duck session.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican who sponsored the bill, called on the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, to keep the Senate in session long enough to allow the bill's supporters to mount an override vote. Mr. Lott's aides said it was too early to tell when the session would wrap up.
In a sign of the White House's resolve to avoid an override threat, Mr. Clinton and his chief economic adviser, Gene Sperling, called about 10 Senate Democrats today to lobby them to reverse their votes in favor of an earlier version of the bill, approved in February, 83 to 14.
Mr. Sperling, in a telephone interview after the vote, said the administration was "disappointed that the president's repeated efforts to find a more balanced bill were rejected."
But he expressed confidence that the administration could persuade enough Democrats who voted for the bill today to switch their positions in a veto override situation, and back Mr. Clinton.
Since 1990, the rate of personal bankruptcy filings has increased by almost 100 percent, Mr. Grassley said. After dropping last year, the number of filings is back up again this year. The nation's largest banks, credit-card companies and retailers support the legislation as a way to crack down on those who are taking advantage of bankruptcy laws to skip out on mountains of debt.
"This becomes a financial management tool for some," said Mr. Grassley, who added that the legislation amounted to the biggest change in bankruptcy laws since 1978.
The bill generally provides that anyone able to make $6,000 to $10,000 in payments over five years would not be able to file for protection under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code, which enables them to have many kinds of debt forgiven.
"Businesses will no longer have to swallow nearly $40 billion in bankruptcy losses, losses that can wipe out revenues, economic growth and job creation," Thomas J. Donohue, president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement.
But the measure offers an exception to people who earn less than the median income in their region. For instance, supporters of the bill say an American family of four with an annual income of less than $51,000 would be able to have some debts forgiven.
Women's groups and consumer advocates opposed the measure, saying it is too harsh and inflexible.
"This does not meet the standard of fairness," Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, said.
The measure, for example, would restrict, but not eliminate, exemptions that allow a person entering bankruptcy to shield an unlimited amount of money from creditors by investing it in an expensive house.
Under the bill passed today, the "homestead" exemption would be capped at $100,000 if the home was bought by the debtor in the two years before filing for bankruptcy. But home purchases before that would continue to be exempt from bankruptcy proceedings.
The lame-duck session revived the bankruptcy bill from the legislative graveyard, at least for now. But here is why the bill's prospects are so murky. Mr. Clinton has 10 days, not counting Sundays, to sign the bill once it reaches his desk. Republican aides said they would try to deliver the legislation to the White House either late tonight or Friday.
The president can kill the bill if it goes unsigned and Congress adjourns within that 10-day period. This is called a "pocket veto," and is politically preferable for Mr. Clinton and Senate Democrats who might switch their votes in an override.
But if Congress is still in session after 10 days, Mr. Clinton would have to veto the bill or else it would become law with or without his signature. Just getting to this veto threshold would be "a long shot," said Edward L. Yingling, the chief lobbyist for the American Bankers Association. "Those who voted for the bill today are pretty well committed."
Mr. Yingling said supporters would mount a furious lobbying campaign to pressure Democratic backers to override Mr. Clinton's veto.
In today's vote, 53 Republicans and 17 Democrats voted in favor; 28 Democrats voted against. Senator Peter G. Fitzgerald, Republican of Illinois, voted present.

HEADLINE: Two Primary Figures Emerge in Bombing of the Cole

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER with JOHN F. BURNS 

 BODY:
Yemeni officials have told the Clinton administration that they have identified two key figures in the October bombing of the destroyer Cole, and intelligence officials say they believe that at least one of them is associated with the organization controlled by Osama bin Laden.
A senior Yemeni official said yesterday that the man who ran the Cole bombing was Muhammad Omar al-Harazi, a Yemeni-born Saudi. 
 American officials said yesterday that they believe that Mr. Harazi -- who is known to Washington as Abdul Ali-Nashiri or Abdul al-Nassir -- was connected with the 1998 bombings of two American embassies in Africa, in which more than 200 people died.
One intelligence official identified Mr. Harazi as an explosives expert who works for al Qaeda, Mr. bin Laden's group accused of international terrorism.
From the onset of the Cole investigation, Yemeni and American investigators have said that a prime suspect as the mastermind of the bombing is Mr. bin Laden, a Saudi exile who is living in Afghanistan. But one Yemeni official cautioned that the links to Mr. bin Laden fell far short of establishing that he had played any direct role in the attack.
The official noted that thousands of militant young Arabs had trained and fought in Afghanistan, many under the direction of Mr. bin Laden.
"Just about everybody who went to Afghanistan is linked in some way to bin Laden," the official said. "But if you're asking, can we prove that bin Laden was responsible for the attack on the Cole, the answer is, no, we can't, at least not yet."
American and Yemeni officials identified another key figure in the plot as Jamal al-Badawi. Officials said he was in custody and was providing much of the information about the Cole bombing, in which 17 sailors died.
American officials said Yemeni officials have also reported telephone records showing contacts before the Cole bombing between suspects in the attack and members of al Qaeda.
American officials said that another suspect in custody told Yemeni officials that he was paid about $5,000 by an associate of Mr. bin Laden to help pay for the bombing of the Cole and to videotape the attack. American officials said that a further link to Mr. bin Laden had been established when Mr. Badawi told Yemeni investigators that he was trained in Afghan camps run by Mr. bin Laden and that he had fought with Mr. bin Laden's forces in Bosnia.
Mr. Badawi had previously been identified by Yemeni officials as having helped to procure the fiberglass skiff that was used to carry at least a third of a ton of high explosives in the attack on the Cole, which blew a 40-by-60-foot hole at the ship's waterline, causing what the Navy has estimated at $240 million in damage.
Much of the information about the links between Mr. bin Laden's organization and the Cole bombing was first reported last night by ABC News.
On Wednesday, Prime Minister Abdul Karim al-Iryani told The Associated Press that the ship bombing had reached far beyond Yemen, involving what he called "international terrorist elements."
Mr. Iryani identified these elements as so-called "Arab Afghans," Arabs who fought in the guerrilla war against Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980's and subsequently spread out across much of the world in a loosely linked terrorist network.
The latest disclosures come as the Clinton administration is mounting a campaign to broaden and toughen economic and political sanctions against the Taliban government of Afghanistan, where Mr. bin Laden has been living since 1996.
The United States and Russia asked the United Nations Security Council yesterday to approve new measures that would cut the country off from most contact with the rest of the world, except for relief workers.
The Taliban spokesman in New York reiterated the ruling group's position that Mr. bin Laden was a "guest and the upholder of the Afghan holy war." Afghanistan, he said, would not be pressured into expelling him.
The Clinton administration has been careful not to assign blame for the bombing of the Cole to Mr. bin Laden or his organization, saying that the investigators have not found a smoking gun that directly links the bombing to either the Saudi millionaire or his militant Islamic network.
For their part, Yemeni officials were even more cautious about whether Mr. Harazi had present or past links with Mr. bin Laden.
Mr. Harazi, the man named as the main organizer of the attack from within Yemen, was born in the Harazi mountains, about 60 miles west of Sana, the Yemeni capital. Like many thousands of people in this poverty-stricken country, including Mr. bin Laden, the Harazi family migrated to Saudi Arabia, where Mr. Harazi gained his citizenship.
Officials in the Federal Bureau of Investigation say that Mr. Harazi has been identified as having inspired or directed several terrorist attacks on American targets over the past decade.
Mr. bin Laden has been indicted in one attack against Americans, the 1998 bombings of the embassies in East Africa. A federal trial of alleged conspirators in the embassy bombings is scheduled to begin in Manhattan in early January.
The telephone records and other links emerging between the suspects in the attack on the Cole and those associated with the East Africa bombings are likely to increase the administration's determination to take tougher action to close down the sanctuary that Afghanistan has provided to Mr. bin Laden and his group, and to other Muslim militants.
A former counterterrorism official in the Clinton administration said it was important not to assume the White House would endorse military action against Mr. bin Laden or the Taliban if direct evidence of firm links continues to mount.

HEADLINE: Budget Is Victory for Argentine President

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Dec. 7

 BODY:
President Fernando de la Rua won a badly needed victory today when the opposition-controlled Senate approved his budget and paved the way for a large rescue package backed by the International Monetary Fund.
The vote followed weeks of wrangling in Congress in which the government made several concessions, including dropping $600 million of $700 million in spending cuts it originally requested. 
 The 2001 budget does not offer a new direction for a government that has been largely unsuccessful in jump-starting an economy stuck in a two-year-old recession. It will continue to have a $6.5 billion deficit next year, assuming the economy grows 2.5 percent as officials project, precisely the same deficit as this year.
But the fact that the government persuaded the opposition in record time to go along with its budget calmed investors and economists who feared that President de la Rua might have been crippled by a bribery scandal that led to the resignation of his vice president and the revamping of his cabinet two months ago. A poll released today showed that the president has an approval rating of just 7 percent after a year on the job.
"It is a mediocre budget in economic terms because it does not cut in areas where you have mismanagement," said Martin Redrado, chief economist at Fundacion Capital, "but the I.M.F. will be happy because it shows the government has the capacity to deliver."
Opposition senators, many of whom are under siege because of allegations they took bribes to pass a new labor code earlier this year, apparently decided they could not risk killing the budget and taking the blame if a bailout by the I.M.F. fell through.
The government and the I.M.F. have been negotiating for weeks to put together a lending package designed to remove the specter of a possible default next year that has dried up international capital markets and pushed up interest rates.
News reports in the Argentine press have suggested that an I.M.F.-led loan package of $25 billion to $30 billion could be announced as early as this weekend. But American officials say that total includes previously committed loans, and the amount of new lending is likely to be a good deal less and spread out over many months. I.M.F. officials have told Argentine officials they want to see a credible budget and a phasing out of the state pension fund system.
The new budget obliges the government to reduce its deficits to zero by 2005, and limits future outlays to provincial governments known for corruption and inefficiency.
President de la Rua recently sent to Congress a pension reform bill that would increase the retirement age of female workers to 65 from 60, reduce minimum payments and oblige new state workers to enter the private pension system beginning next year. The plan faces tough sledding in Congress, although it may still be instituted by a presidential decree.
The Senate passed the budget by a vote of 39 to 4 in the predawn hours, and then added a few amendments this afternoon to save subsidies for tobacco farmers and energy subsidies for the frigid provinces in southern Patagonia. Those additions are likely to be approved by the lower house in coming days.
In recent days, as it became apparent that the budget would pass, the Argentine stock market recovered some of its recent losses and government officials have spoken with increasing optimism about the future.
"The Argentine economy is going to grow a lot faster than people expect," the economy minister, Jose Luis Machinea, told a bankers association as the Senate debated the budget. "An era of prosperity is coming for Argentines."
After economic performance fell by 3.2 percent in 1999, the economy this year is expected to grow by a mere one-half of 1 percent. Unemployment has crept up to nearly 16 percent.
The Argentine economy has suffered from several factors out of the country's control. International prices for its main agricultural products have been depressed for more than a year, while its manufacturing exports have lost markets since the Brazilian real was devalued in January 1999 and as the European euro has declined in value.
Critics have argued that Argentina needs to drop its policy of pegging the value of the peso to the dollar to boost exports. But government officials insist that they will continue the policy, rather than risk the kind of capital flight and bankruptcies that accompanied devaluations in the past.

HEADLINE: The Business of Baseball Is . . . Business

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Baseball's Unfair Economics" (editorial, Dec. 5): 
 You mention the opposition that the proposed increased revenue-sharing from high- to low-earning teams may bring from the players and the owners, but you omit the opposition that it may bring from fans.
Yankee fans are willing to pay high ticket prices and high concession-stand costs because they believe that they will have a quality product on the field every year. Fans in Minnesota may pay half the price for tickets and lower concession-stand costs, so they receive a lesser product on the field.
Is it fair to a Yankee fan to take his high hot-dog cost and build a better team in Minnesota for its fans? If baseball is to thrive as it has for the last few years, something must be done about this imbalance, but it is equally important to consider the fans.

HEADLINE: 2 Automakers Act on Weakening Sales

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 7

 BODY:
General Motors announced a big slowdown in factory production today while Chrysler asked its suppliers to cut their prices by 5 percent on Jan. 1, further signs that Detroit is struggling with an abrupt weakening of auto sales and ballooning inventories of unsold cars.
G.M. said that it would produce 14.5 percent fewer vehicles in the next three months than it did in the first quarter of this year. Ford announced last Friday that its output would be down 10 percent in the next three months. And while Chrysler has not yet disclosed its first-quarter production plans, it is also expected to make many fewer cars in January, February and March by eliminating overtime and by not operating some factories at all for a week or two at a time. 
 G.M. had a 104-day supply of unsold vehicles at dealerships and in transit at the end of November, the company's largest supply since the last recession, when G.M.'s inventory peaked at 106 days in January 1991, said Haig Stoddard, the manager of industry analysis at Ward's Automotive, an auto industry data service. Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler A.G., had a 78-day inventory on Nov. 30 and Ford had an 80-day inventory, he said.
Automakers try to keep a 60-day supply in the field so that each dealership has an adequate selection of models in a variety of colors and with various options. Ward's, the industry's main source of inventory data, is still gathering data on how much inventory foreign automakers had on Nov. 30, Mr. Stoddard said.
Sharp declines in auto production are beginning to produce ripples across the Midwest and on Wall Street. G.M. and Ford are the world's two largest manufacturing companies by a wide margin, each accounting for slightly more than 1 percent of the nation's economic output, while Chrysler accounts for nearly another percentage point. The Chicago branch of the Federal Reserve estimated a few years ago that the auto industry directly or indirectly accounted for a quarter of the combined economic output of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana.
Delphi Automotive Systems, the world's largest maker of auto parts, announced last Friday that it was laying off 1,700 workers indefinitely because of reduced demand from assembly plants. The Visteon Corporation, an auto parts giant spun off last summer by Ford, warned on Tuesday that it would earn only 35 cents a share in the fourth quarter. Excluding one-time gains, the company's prediction was 70 percent lower than analysts were expecting, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
Rick Wagoner, the chief executive of G.M., told Reuters at the end of a luncheon at Boston College today that the entire auto industry needed to produce fewer vehicles.
"What we're all going to have to do is ratchet back production capacity, and that's painful," Mr. Wagoner said. "Once you swallow that, then you hopefully reach a steady state and lower level of production across the board."
G.M. said it would build 1,301,000 vehicles in the first quarter, down from 1,521,000 in the quarter a year earlier. G.M. also reduced its forecast today for production in the current quarter by 5,000 vehicles, to 1,373,000.
This has been the best year ever for auto sales, and even November was a fairly strong month by historical standards. But automakers have achieved those sales with larger rebates and other incentives, and these discounts are now cutting so deeply into profits that manufacturers are deciding to reduce output instead.
Diane C. Swonk, the senior vice president and chief economist at the Bank One Corporation in Chicago, said that she still saw little cause for concern. "We're in an economy that's downshifting from 110 miles per hour to 60 miles per hour," she said. "As you downshift, manufacturing takes it on the chin."
Automakers seeking quick financial improvement have relied for decades on asking suppliers to cut their prices. Before being acquired two years ago by Daimler-Benz A.G. of Germany, the Chrysler Corporation had experimented with a partnership in which it tried to reduce costs in its assembly plants and at suppliers at the same time by sharing information, instead of demanding lower prices for auto parts. But that partnership appeared tattered today as Chrysler informed suppliers that if they wanted to win future contracts, they should cut prices by 5 percent on Jan. 1 and seek an additional reduction of 10 percent over the next two years.
"We are in a difficult business situation, and we know the only way to initiate change effectively is by working together," said Dieter Zetsche, a longtime Mercedes executive who became Chrysler's president last month. "The true test of a strong relationship is measured during times such as these."

HEADLINE: A Sense of Disbelief and Obligation to One's Family

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY 

 BODY:
The number is almost unfathomable to Bukuru Benoit, a Food Emporium deliveryman who arrived in New York from Burundi nearly penniless six years ago. He is reluctant to broach the subject, to muse about how he would spend it, to even say, "$30,000."
It's not that he feels undeserving; he believes he is owed that much or more. It is, rather, a matter of disbelief, almost skepticism, about someday soon having a check for more money than he thought he would ever see all at once, for an amount it would take three years to earn by shuttling groceries around the Upper West Side. 
 Mr. Benoit, 34, is one of about 100 deliverymen to whom the Food Emporium supermarket chain has agreed to pay $3 million in back pay under a settlement announced yesterday. The deliverymen, most of them immigrants from West Africa, accused Food Emporium of wage violations because they worked long hours, six or seven days a week, for half the federally mandated minimum wage.
So they lived five, six or more to an apartment, eating home-cooked rice and beans and doing without all the amenities they thought they could earn in the "country of opportunity," as Mr. Benoit called the United States.
Despite word of the settlement, Mr. Benoit and his co-workers at the Food Emporium on Broadway and 68th Street were not gloating yesterday and had no plans to quit their jobs or quickly spend the money. Rather, there was just a muted sense of relief.
"My family does not have something to eat," Mr. Benoit explained. "For me to have things here means they would not have anything. This money would make me happy, but it will be sent first to my family."
Mr. Benoit left Burundi on a mission, he said, not only to make a better life for himself, but to earn enough money to ease the hardships endured by his mother and other family members. Tribal factions had ripped apart his homeland's economy, he said, leaving factories closed and many of his countrymen dead. Mr. Benoit said he felt obligated to help them before he helps himself.
Batchili Charles, 30, a native of Congo who lives in the Bronx, agreed that his share of the money would not go toward consumption for consumption's sake. "I don't think the money is going to reflect on my actual life," he said. "It will just give some relief."
So no shopping sprees? What about a more spacious apartment?
"The first priority for most of us is family," Mr. Charles said. "Many of us also want to go to school. The problem has been not having money to get training to get better jobs. To study computer science, that is my dream."
Marcel Mweze, 31, agreed. "I want to do any training that can help me to have any skill, any nice job in America," he said.
Mr. Benoit said that he and many of the others had accepted the working conditions because they did not have a choice.
"It was not enough money to live on, but I only had one friend in New York and I had to do something for myself," Mr. Benoit said, his words a soft-spoken mix of French and English. "We lived in one house, five or six people."
"The situation was very bad," he said. "But I believe I will be happy soon."

Firebrand Considers the Post-Whitman Era

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
BUSTER SOARIES knows very well that the things he's been saying in his sermons and speeches sound raw. Going on about black street gangs and drug dealers and wife beaters is a risky thing for someone who is both a Baptist minister and, as New Jersey's secretary of state, the highest-ranking black person in the administration of Gov. Christie Whitman.
But the Rev. DeForest B. Soaries Jr., or Buster to everyone in the State House, is convinced that the time is overdue for an attack on the faults in the black community while simultaneously holding the white majority's feet to the fires of justice. So there he was at Shiloh Baptist Church in Trenton recently, jolting about 600 black middle school boys with a dose of reality as he sees it: 
 "If being black means taking drugs and beating on your girlfriend, I don't want to be black," he roared as the boys watched, transfixed. "And if being white means paying your bills and using proper language and having a nice house, call me white!"
Back in his corner office in the State House, Mr. Soaries, 49, says he has been misunderstood and called a traitor for working for a white, Republican administration. But his habit of blunt speaking has not abated when it comes to minority concerns aboutthe racial-profiling scandal that is rocking the state. As state officials reluctantly disclosed recently that they had been aware of the practice in some form for years, Mr. Soaries stepped forward as the only member of the administration to condemn the state police and to demand change. Being a lightning rod is not a new experience to him, however.
When Mr. Soaries was 19, he was kidnapped and threatened with death by a gang of black drug dealers on the Rutgers University campus in New Brunswick, where he was a sophomore. The level of drug use among African-Americans dismayed him, and he and his growing network of friends and contacts had been putting pressure on the police and the university to crack down. The experience left him with one big thought.
"I think it cured me of ever falling into the trap that all blacks are good and all whites are bad," he said. "It was an inoculation, and it cured me from seeing the world in all racial terms."
Mr. Soaries ended his speech at Shiloh on another point, that racism is as real as the police officer who stops minority drivers -- he himself has been pulled over -- because of race.
For all the economic progress New Jersey has enjoyed in the seven years Mrs. Whitman has been governor, he said, members of minorities "live in a state where if you look in your rear-view mirror and it's the police, you're nervous if you're black." That problem will be solved, he said, only when New Jersey elects its first minority governor. Someone who would protect the progress minorities have made, who is not afraid to criticize ills within the minority community. Someone like him.
I WANT a minority governor," Mr. Soaries said as he ended his speech at Shiloh Baptist. "I want a governor who looks like me!"
The quest for justice has carried Mr. Soaries from a childhood in segregated Montclair to the Urban League, to the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Operation PUSH and then to a doctorate in divinity and his own pulpit at the First Baptist Church of Lincoln Gardens, in Somerset. Along the way, he collected the names and contacts that help move public policy, and the policy he wants to move now is for a different kind of governor.
"My position is that I want a minority governor," he said at a news conference at the State House on Wednesday. "This state has a festering cancer of racism and sexism in a state agency that cannot be allowed to exist." Since none of the candidates he favored had offered to run, he would consider it himself.
Isn't making race the test for the next governor a kind of profiling in itself? Mr. Soaries, who recently switched from independent to Republican, was not biting. "Let's talk math, not race," he said. "If you sell hot dogs and you ignore one-third of your market, you're destined to fail."
What the state needs now, Mr. Soaries said, is a governor with better instincts on racial issues.
"My position is that it's going to take someone who has a high racial I.Q.," he said. "It's going to take someone whose background includes reaching people across racial lines, and it's going to take someone who lives in close proximity to people in the gap."
"The gap" is one of Mr. Soaries's favorite terms. He uses it to describe the space between the rich and the poor, the protected and the persecuted, the hopeful and the hopeless. The gap runs from Newark past his window in Trenton, on through Camden and into Vineland. Mr. Soaries patrols it every weekday from his State House office, every Sunday from his pulpit, and the rest of the time at home, where his wife, Donna, cares for their 11-year-old twins, Martin and Malcolm.
"The one show they like that creates a challenge to me is the W.W.F.," Mr. Soaries said, touching on the fake agony of Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation. "I've got to personally work on finding some redemptive value in the W.W.F., and I believe we may be able to develop a literacy program, based on W.W.F. images and personalities." A pause. "I'll have to call Vince McMahon about that."
