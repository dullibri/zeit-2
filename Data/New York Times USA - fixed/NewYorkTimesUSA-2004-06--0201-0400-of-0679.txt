HEADLINE: Reagan's Optimism, And His Flaws

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Thanks to Paul Krugman for his measured June 8 column about Ronald Reagan, ''The Great Taxer.'' Over the last few days since Mr. Reagan's death, I have felt as if I were living in a veritable twilight zone of national denial over his deeply flawed economic and foreign policies. 
 I know that it is customary to think and speak well of one who has just died, but the effusive outpouring of uncritical praise from the media has felt more like self-delusion than simple heartfelt sympathy. It is both refreshing and reaffirming to read a column that deals fairly and frankly with Mr. Reagan's legacy, giving credit where it is due but holding fast to reality, and telling the truth as it needs to be told.
 The smiling, optimistic air that has been so often cited as an inspiring attribute of Mr. Reagan helped foster and feed a culture of denial in the 1980's that ignored great social and economic disparities in our country. That denial continues, and the disparities have grown.

HEADLINE: Between 2 First Families, A Complicated Rapport

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8 

 BODY:
George H.W. Bush has been generous this week in his praise for Ronald Reagan, the man who in essence made him -- and by extension, perhaps, his eldest son -- president of the United States.
 ''He was a wonderful man, a wonderful, warm human being,'' the former president said Monday on the NBC News television program ''Today,'' recounting his eight years as Mr. Reagan's vice president. A few minutes later, Mr. Bush was on CBS's ''Early Show'' with similar sunny recollections. ''He was so darn kind to me, and also to Barbara,'' Mr. Bush said. 
 But like all relationships between American presidents and vice presidents, and for that matter between political wives, the truth about the Reagans and two generations of Bushes is more complicated. Although each side is offering nothing but tribute to the other during this week of Reagan nostalgia, over the past quarter-century the relationship between the families has been strained for periods by political ambition, social resentment and a lack of chemistry between two formidable first ladies.
 None of that is evident in the public words of mourning this week from the current president, who has used Mr. Reagan's presidency as a model for his own. And yet he scarcely knew the man himself, Reagan advisers say. When Mr. Reagan was president, the younger Mr. Bush would come by the vice president's office to see his father, telling stories with his cowboy boots on the table -- and watching Mr. Reagan from afar.
 When asked in an interview with Tom Brokaw the other day about his best memory of Mr. Reagan, the president came up with a public rather than a private moment. ''I'd just gotten out of college in '68, and I went to a Reagan rally in Jacksonville, Fla.,'' he told Mr. Brokaw, recalling that Mr. Reagan had ''electrified the crowd'' and that there had been something ''unbelievably charismatic about him.''
 The intense personal emotions came from Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush, one of Hollywood, the other from the blue-blooded precincts of the East Coast. Both were fiercely protective of their husbands.
 ''Bush and Reagan had a very amiable relationship, and he had access to anything Reagan had, but Mrs. Bush felt she had been slighted by Mrs. Reagan,'' said one former Reagan adviser who knows both families. 
 The Reagans, who moved in a circle of old Hollywood friends but were still an intensely private couple, never had the Bushes in for dinner in the private quarters of the White House, Republicans recalled. 
 ''It's hard being second lady,'' said a person who worked for both the Reagans and the elder Bushes. ''And Barbara Bush did a hell of a good job at it. She stayed back and was deferential. But what I've found is that the wives of political people have long memories. They tend not to forget.''
 The relationship between the families dates from the 1980 campaign, when Mr. Reagan and George H.W. Bush were political rivals running for the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Bush accused Mr. Reagan of promoting ''voodoo economics,'' a charge that so angered Mr. Reagan that he later did not want Mr. Bush on the ticket with him. But when a plan for a ''co-presidency'' with former President Gerald R. Ford fell apart at the party convention, Mr. Reagan and his aides turned to Mr. Bush as one of the only men left standing, according to accounts from Richard V. Allen and other Reagan advisers at the time.
 Once in the White House, Mr. Bush established himself as the deferential second fiddle who rarely disagreed directly with the boss -- at least once even to the exasperation of Mrs. Reagan. In her autobiography, ''My Turn,'' Mrs. Reagan recalled Mr. Bush's telling her that Donald Regan, Mr. Reagan's chief of staff, should be fired. Mrs. Reagan then recounts this scene:
 ''I agree with you,'' I said, ''and I wish you'd tell my husband. I can't be the only one who's saying this to him.''
 ''Nancy,'' he said, ''that's not my role.''
 ''That's exactly your role,'' I replied.
 Mrs. Reagan then concludes, ''But as far as I know, George Bush never spoke to Ronnie about Don Regan.''
 By all accounts, Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush enjoyed each other's company, and kept up with weekly White House lunches just as the current president and Vice President Dick Cheney do now. ''I remember the stories my dad would tell of his great sense of humor,'' the younger Mr. Bush told Mr. Brokaw. ''He had a wonderful Irish sense of humor -- keep people off guard by being humble and funny.''
 But Republicans also say Mr. Reagan kept a genial remove from Mr. Bush, just as he did with so many friends and staff members. Mr. Reagan seemed to need only his wife, they say. ''He was seldom one of the boys,'' said an adviser to both Mr. Reagan and the first President Bush. ''At the end of the day, Reagan stood alone with Nancy.''
 Mr. Reagan nonetheless campaigned hard for Mr. Bush in 1988, when his understudy was running for president again. After Mr. Bush won, Mr. Reagan, on his last day in the White House, left a note for his successor in the Oval Office on stationery with the printed heading ''Don't Let the Turkeys Get You Down.''
 Still, the note was only six sentences long, a model of economy. ''George, I treasure the memories we share and wish you all the very best,'' Mr. Reagan wrote in part. ''You'll be in my prayers. God bless you and Barbara. I'll miss our Thursday lunches.'' 
 On Friday, both President Bushes will speak at the funeral service for Mr. Reagan at Washington National Cathedral. Republicans note that it was the son, not the father, who sought to absorb the legacy of Mr. Reagan's presidency. 
 ''I think the name is Bush, but he is a true Reaganite,'' said Kenneth M. Duberstein, Mr. Reagan's last chief of staff, speaking of the current president. ''It's bold strokes and primary colors, not pastels.''

HEADLINE: Critics See a Reagan Legacy Tainted by AIDS, Civil Rights and Union Policies

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER and ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 8 

 BODY:
Despite Ronald Reagan's personal popularity, his domestic agenda was in many ways bitterly polarizing. Then, as now, conservatives hailed his tax cuts, his stirring defense of traditional values and his commitment to getting government ''off the backs'' of the American people.
 But many liberals and progressives see his domestic legacy very differently, particularly on AIDS, civil rights, reproductive rights and poverty. Though clearly sympathetic to Mr. Reagan's family, they are still angry over his policies, which they assert reflected the unbridled influence of social conservatives. 
 Matt Foreman, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, posted an open letter on his organization's Web site this week, addressed to a friend and fellow gay rights advocate who died of AIDS. ''I have tremendous empathy and respect for Mrs. Reagan, who lovingly cared'' for her husband ''through excruciating years of Alzheimer's,'' he wrote. ''But even on this day I'm not able to set aside the shaking anger I feel over Reagan's nonresponse to the AIDS epidemic or for the continuing anti-gay legacy of his administration.''
 Advocates for people with AIDS have long asserted that Mr. Reagan's lack of leadership on the disease, which was first reported by the Centers for Disease Control in 1981, significantly hindered research and education efforts to fight it. His surgeon general, Dr. C. Everett Koop, wrote later that ''political meddlers in the White House'' had complicated his work on the disease, and that ''at least a dozen times I pleaded with my critics in the White House to let me have a meeting with President Reagan'' on AIDS in the mid 1980's.
 Mr. Reagan did not make extensive public comments on AIDS until 1987.
 In an interview, Mr. Foreman declared: ''That history can't be forgotten. I owe it to the people that I lost not to forget it, not to pretend like it didn't happen.''
 Gary Bauer, Mr. Reagan's domestic policy adviser for the last two years of his administration, countered that spending on AIDS research rose under Mr. Reagan. Moreover, he said, because of Mr. Reagan's strong belief in cabinet government, the president largely ceded the job of speaking out on AIDS to Dr. Koop and the secretary of health and human services.
 In general, a hallmark of Mr. Reagan's domestic policy was an effort to slow or reverse the growth of the federal government. He and his first budget director, David A. Stockman, repeatedly tried to trim health, education and social welfare programs that had been expanding for decades, and they achieved much of what they proposed.
 ''A big part of Reagan's agenda was the devolution of social policy'' from the federal government to the states, said John L. Palmer, a scholar of the Reagan years.
 But many liberals say that Mr. Reagan broke with the New Deal notion that government could -- and should -- be an instrument of social equity.
 Representative Barney Frank, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts, said: ''He really did turn away from the notion that there was a positive role for government. When he said in his first inaugural, 'government is not the answer to our problems, government is the problem,' he really meant it.''
 Mr. Reagan also argued that the government better served the poor by assuring strong economic growth than by distributing social welfare benefits. He said he had no objection to financing benefits for the ''truly needy'' -- those who could not work because of age, illness or disability. But he staunchly opposed cash assistance for people who could work.
 Michael J. Horowitz, a neoconservative who worked in the Reagan White House, said that by combining a conservative ideology with an affable personality, Mr. Reagan ''shattered the caricature of conservatives as less caring and more mean-spirited than liberals.''
 But Nancy Amidei, who was then director of the Food Research and Action Center, an advocacy group for the poor, said Monday, ''President Reagan's policies may not have been intended to be mean-spirited, but in many cases, the effect was to hurt low-income people who couldn't work or who had low-paying jobs.''
 President Reagan infuriated labor unions in 1981 when he dismissed thousands of air-traffic controllers who had gone on strike and then defied an order to return to work. But former administration officials say Mr. Reagan did not regret his action. Indeed, they say, the dismissals showed people in foreign capitals that Mr. Reagan was a person of substance who was not to be trifled with.
 The ascendancy of the Reaganites also moved the Republican Party to a staunchly anti-abortion stance, including endorsements of a constitutional amendment that would outlaw abortion, the appointment of anti-abortion judges and new restrictions on family planning programs that involved abortion services.
 That anti-abortion movement is today a leading force against embryonic stem cell research, which Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, called a ''sad irony.'' Nancy Reagan has become a leading voice urging the expansion of such research, which involves the destruction of human embryos, but is considered promising for treatment of many diseases.
 Similarly, Mr. Reagan's policies on civil rights were bitterly divisive, as reflected by Mr. Reagan's strikingly low share of the black vote, 11 percent in 1980 and 9 percent in 1984.
 In 1988, Mr. Reagan vetoed a bill to extend the reach of federal civil rights laws; he asserted it would ''unjustifiably expand the power of the federal government'' in the affairs of private organizations. Congress overrode his veto.
 The Reagan administration also maintained that it was legally required to grant tax exemptions to racially discriminatory private schools. The Supreme Court rejected that contention in 1983. Another move that earned Mr. Reagan the enmity of the civil rights movement was his resistance to economic sanctions against the white minority government of South Africa.
 Mr. Bauer asserts that Mr. Reagan's record has been distorted. But Julian Bond, chairman of the N.A.A.C.P., said, ''Everyone wants to extend sympathy to his family, but when you remember the actual record, it's a very, very different story.''

HEADLINE: The Resolution's Weakness

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE. 
E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In his eagerness for the approval of the Shiite religious leader -- and driven by desperation to get yesterday's unanimous U.N. resolution in time for the G-8 meeting -- President Bush may be double-crossing the Kurds, our most loyal friends in Iraq.
 Not a single U.S. soldier has been killed in the area of northern Iraq patrolled by the pesh merga, the army of Kurdish Iraqis who have brought order to their region. Savaged by Saddam's poison-gas attacks in the 80's, Kurdistan was abandoned by the first President Bush to Saddam's vengeance after the first gulf war. When our conscience made us provide air cover in the 90's, the Kurds amazed the Middle East by creating a free, democratic mini-state within despotic Iraq. 
 These Kurdish Sunni Muslims -- an ancient ethnic group, neither Arab nor Turk -- are one-fifth of Iraq's population. They cheered our arrival and set aside old dreams of independence, asking for reasonable autonomy in return for participating enthusiastically in the formation of the new Iraq.
 In February, the Iraqi Governing Council, which included all religious and ethnic groups, hammered out its only memorable work: a Transitional Administrative Law, which laid the groundwork for a constitution to be adopted later by elected officials in a sovereign state. Most important for Kurds, who have long been oppressed by an Arab majority, it established minority rights within a federal state -- the essence of a stable democracy. 
 But as the U.N. resolution supporting that state was nearing completion, the Shiite grand ayatollah, Ali al-Sistani, suddenly intervened. He denounced the agreed-upon law as ''legislated by an unelected council in the shadow of occupation.'' He decreed that mentioning it in the U.N. resolution would be ''a harbinger of grave consequences.''
 The U.S. promptly caved. Stunned Kurds protested in a letter to President Bush that ''the people of Kurdistan will no longer accept second-class citizenship in Iraq.'' If the law guaranteeing minority rights was abrogated, Kurds would ''have no choice but to refrain from participating in the central government, not to take part in the national elections, and to bar representatives of the central government from Kurdistan.''
 Massoud Barzani and Jalal Talabani, the Kurdish leaders, appealed to Bush's sense of loyalty: ''We will be loyal friends to America even if our support is not always reciprocated. . . . If the forces of freedom [do not] prevail elsewhere in Iraq, we know that, because of our alliance with the United States, we will be marked for vengeance.''
 I ran this pained appeal past John Negroponte, who will move from his post as our U.N. representative to be our ambassador to the new Iraq, at his farewell lunch yesterday. He pointed to a line in the preamble to the U.N. resolution welcoming an unspecified commitment ''to work towards a federal, democratic, pluralist and unified Iraq, in which there is full respect for political and human rights.''
 Fine ''preambular'' words, but outside the action section of the resolution. That eviscerates the protective law, just as Sistani demanded.
 Why do we take our proven allies for granted? The conventional White House wisdom holds that the Iraqi Kurds have no place else to go. It's an article of faith that if the Kurds tried to break away and set up an independent Kurdistan, with oil-rich Kirkuk as its traditional capital, Turkey, on its border, would never permit it -- lest murderous separatists among its own Kurdish population of 12 million get a new lease on death.
 Iraqi Kurds blundered last year in letting old grudges prevent Ankara from sending 10,000 troops south to help the coalition police Iraq. But since then, Kurdish leaders have gone all-out to establish economic and political relations with ''our friends to the north.''
 A Turkish construction company is building a $40 million airport in Sulaimaniya, and Kurds have been steering contracts to Turkish engineers to study sports stadiums and tunnels through the mountains. Despite grumbling from some anti-Kurdish generals, Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been responsive. The influential Ilnur Cevik of the Turkish Daily News urges ''more attention to Iraqi Kurdish sensitivities'' and asks: ''Do the Arabs realize what they are getting into?''
 Our Kurdish allies will do their bit to hold Iraq together. But in appeasing the south, don't push the north too far.

HEADLINE: Antennas Sprout, and a Bronx Neighborhood Goes Online

BYLINE: By KRISTEN FOUNTAIN

 BODY:
ANTENNAS are quietly sprouting on top of apartment buildings in the South Bronx. The gray tubes mounted on thin steel poles are barely visible against the jutting brick and stone of the dense urban skyline. But for hundreds of residents in this low-income neighborhood, they represent a significant change.
 The antennas are a central component of a local area network being installed by the Mount Hope Housing Company, a community development organization numbered among many groups across the country that are starting to exploit wireless technologies to provide tenants with affordable high-speed Internet access. 
 Founded in the mid-1980's to refurbish blocks of condemned apartment buildings, Mount Hope Housing now manages 1,250 units in 32 buildings within a half-mile radius. When the project began last year, the only broadband connection was a T1 line into a single basement housing a community computer lab and the group's administrative offices.
 ''In other places, it's more typical to be wired up, but here it's just not,'' said Shaun Belle, president of Mount Hope.
 Mount Hope administrators hope that by installing antennas on the rooftops, they can build a network allowing households across the neighborhood to share the Internet for as little as $7 a month apiece, a cost that would be folded into rent bills the way water and heating charges are. Their plans combine both wired and wireless service, with cable inside every building to move data to and from the apartments and equipment that transmits through an antenna on the roof. The signals are picked up by a central antenna linked by fiber-optic cable to the existing T1 high-speed line.
 So far, the equipment and wiring have been installed in six buildings. Rent money paid for the $150,000 installation -- the bulk of it going to the internal wiring -- but the group is seeking state and city funds to double the coverage over the next year. Tenants in two-thirds of the 180 apartments in the wired buildings are hooked up to the network and are being introduced to the high-speed service in small training classes run by One Economy, a national nonprofit organization focused on bringing the Internet to underserved areas.
 The sessions focus on how to seek help from Internet resources for everything from homework and finding employment to making payments and keeping in touch with relatives. ''This is not just for the tech-savvy teenager,'' Mr. Belle said. ''We want the whole family to take advantage of it.''
 Lydia Almeyda, a Mount Hope resident who got her apartment hooked up under the program, says her children are using the connection. Her 14-year-old son, Jeffrey Rodriguez, for instance, uses the Internet to get help with his homework and to follow the Yankees. But Ms. Almeyda needed training. ''I want to learn about the computer for me,'' she said at a recent session. 
 About half of the Mount Hope households have computers, according to a survey of residents. Those that do not will be able to purchase inexpensive PC's from Per Scholas, a Bronx company that collects and refurbishes used computers.
 Efforts to make Internet access available to poor Americans have generally focused on programs to wire libraries and schools or create centralized computer centers for housing projects. But increasingly, agencies and organizations that serve low-income areas are seeking ways to bring access to individual homes.
 Randal Pinkett, whose company Access One, a spinoff of One Economy, was hired to install and maintain the network for Mount Hope, said that access within the home is essential if people are truly to take advantage of the Internet.
 ''We're used to paying bill in our pajamas or doing searches after dinner,'' he said of home Internet users. ''To be a meaningful part of our lives, it really has to be in the home.''
 Mount Hope managers chose to run wires to each apartment to improve reliability. Even with a complex and expensive series of repeater antennas, it is difficult to ensure that signals would make it through all the walls of an apartment building. However, using a wireless system to link the buildings saved money and time, they said.
 Other groups are forgoing wires altogether. In Boston, for example, the Community Technology Centers' Network is managing a project that uses networking equipment and antennas to share a T1 line among apartments in three large buildings and dozens of townhouses. 
 In other cities, community development groups and housing authorities are contracting with private companies that offer so-called fixed wireless services, using transmitters that can handle heavy data loads and have a range of many miles. DetroitConnected, a project initiated last fall and led by the University of Michigan School of Social Work, expects to offer fast Internet access to low-income downtown Detroit households through a local fixed wireless company, Gigatrans, for less than $10 per month.
 Garrett Myers, who is coordinating that program, , said that although the spread of high-speed access was encouraging, inexpensive computers and training were essential. ''If we could wave a magic wand and put wireless everywhere, it wouldn't really do very much,'' he said. ''Many people here need Computers 101. You need up-to-date hardware, software, technical support and teachers. Then you need bandwidth.''

HEADLINE: Sales of Chips Predicted to Set Record in 2004

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 9 

 BODY:
The nation's leading semiconductor trade group said Wednesday that chip sales this year would set a record as the economy improves and demand for personal computers and cellphones continues to climb. 
 In its midyear report, the group, the Semiconductor Industry Association, projects that worldwide sales of semiconductors will grow to $214 billion this year, surpassing the $204 billion record set in 2000. 
 The group forecasts that worldwide chip sales this year will increase nearly 29 percent over 2003; last fall, it projected growth of 19 percent this year. 
 ''The industry is experiencing substantially stronger-than-expected growth in 2004,'' said George M. Scalise, president of the association, which is based in San Jose, Calif. He said the chip industry was benefiting from growth in many areas, including personal computers, electronics, cellphones, telecommunications equipment and even automobiles. Strong demand for equipment used for wireless Internet connection is also contributing to growth in chip sales.
 ''The current cycle appears to be one of the more balanced cycles in the history of the industry, with growth coming from a very broad range of applications and in all geographic regions,'' Mr. Scalise said.
 The association's report comes just a week after Intel narrowed its revenue forecast for the current quarter to the upper end of its earlier range, citing surprisingly strong sales of cellphones and other electronics products. 
 In more good news, capital spending for telecommunications is expected to grow 5 to 10 percent in 2004 -- the first increase since 2000, the association said.
 John Greenagel, a spokesman for the association, said much of the growth in sales was coming from China, which makes up 15 percent of the chip market. Chip sales in the Asia-Pacific region have grown to 40 percent of the worldwide total.
 Personal computer sales continue to account for the biggest portion of sales, representing roughly 30 percent of the chip market. They are expected to increase 13 percent in 2004, compared with the association's November 2003 forecast of 11 percent.
 The growth is being driven not just by an increase in the number of devices sold but also by the rising number of chips used in digital electronics. Digital video recorders, for example, have four times the semiconductors of DVD players, and are selling at three times the rate of 2003. Similarly, the semiconductor content in cars is increasing about 10 percent a year. 
 Looking ahead, the industry association projects a compound annual growth rate of 10.4 percent from 2004 through 2007, though sales are expected to decline in 2006 and then rebound in 2007.

HEADLINE: With Potential for a Harsh Summer, Basic City Services Become the Priority

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, June 4 

 BODY:
Maj. Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, the American commander responsible for security and reconstruction here in the Iraqi capital, is warning of a long and violent summer.
 Power blackouts are likely as temperatures climb toward 120 degrees. The central government to be installed June 30 is expected to be a target of attack. And it is not even certain who will then pay the Iraqi security forces. 
 ''This is going to be a hard summer,'' said General Chiarelli, commander of the First Cavalry Division. ''But, yeah, I am an optimist. We're making some progress. We'll all get through this together.''
 General Chiarelli (pronounced ki-REL-lee) said he had created a campaign that expanded far beyond a combat perspective. He has borrowed substantially from the political science classes he taught at West Point.
 Showing Baghdad residents how to conduct a free and fair election, in advance of the national balloting, is an important part of the mission, he said. Winning hearts and minds is out of the question; instead, he said, the goal is to win the consent of a majority of the people.
 That is why General Chiarelli has proposed conducting a test run of elections for district advisory councils across Baghdad in October, even though he expects foreign diplomats and the United Nations to object, wanting to stick to the official, national electoral election plan for January. 
 ''It's our belief that we should kick off the elections as early as we can, to push ahead with the whole concept of voter education, getting Iraqis to understand all about the electoral process,'' he said. ''Whether or not we'll be allowed to do that, I can't tell you.''
 Early elections across Baghdad's municipal districts ''give us a great opportunity to do a rehearsal'' ahead of nationwide voting, he said. That is especially pertinent in the capital, which has a population of about 6.5 million but no reliable system for registering voters; nor has it built the required 2,200 polling stations.
 Like any local ward boss, General Chiarelli understands the importance of city services, and he has been pushing projects to improve water, electricity, sewage and solid waste disposal.
 ''We had a great sewer opening the other day,'' he said. ''I never thought I'd know so much about sewers. I had desires of leading tank formations, but that's not going to happen here.''
 Instead, he spent last Thursday at a meeting with Baghdad's new mayor to go over the division's program of urban infrastructure projects. Even before the First Cavalry Division had deployed to Iraq from Fort Hood, Tex., General Chiarelli ordered his soldiers to spend time with officials in nearby Killeen to learn about water supplies and sewers, electrical grids and landfills.
 General Chiarelli arrived in April to take over the security mission in Baghdad from the First Armored Division, and he now commands more than 25,000 troops here. Their terrain includes the impoverished Sadr City district, where there is a strong base of support for the rebel Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr.
 The solution to the security threat in Baghdad cannot be found solely in military strength, General Chiarelli said, so his planning focuses on ''building constituencies.''
 ''Money is ammunition in this country, but it's got to be money spent in the right way,'' he said. ''Where is the infrastructure worst? In Sadr City. Where are we doing the most fighting? In Sadr City.''
 In that district, the garbage is piling up, residents are lucky to have electricity for eight hours a day, and drinking water is also in short supply. The district was designed for 300,000 residents, but now holds more than 2 million.
 General Chiarelli and other officers assigned to reconstruction expressed concern that city services would not be equally distributed under the new government if the corruption of the Saddam Hussein era returned. 
 ''Will we have an equitable distribution of electricity?'' he mused. ''I think it's pretty clear to everyone that we're going to have some bad times this summer with electricity. We're bringing on additional generation, but I doubt it can keep up with demand.''
 Baghdad will soon be the site of a large new American diplomatic mission, and the United Nations is expected to re-establish some kind of presence here for officials assisting in the transition.
 Among many senior American commanders, the transition to a new government has raised concerns about how soon the new Iraqi leadership will be able to manage tasks like paying the new Iraqi Civil Defense Corps.
 ''I worry that we're going to roll around to the first of July and there will be a glitch in the funds and there will be a bunch who don't get paid for a week or, even worse, miss a month's pay,'' General Chiarelli said.

HEADLINE: Wholesalers' Inventories Show Unexpected Decline for April

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Inventories at American wholesalers unexpectedly fell 0.1 percent in April, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. It was the first decline in eight months, as demand for pharmaceuticals, imported automobiles and other goods outpaced supplies.
 Sales at distribution centers, warehouses and terminals rose 0.8 percent in April after a 2.9 percent gain that was the largest in more than nine years. That brought wholesale supplies to a record low of 1.12 months' worth. 
 The dwindling stockpiles at wholesalers as well as factories suggest that companies may have to step up production and keep adding workers. Companies had been caught with too much inventory on their hands in the 2001 recession, leading them to be cautious about stockpiling during the current expansion.
 ''Any attempt to rebuild inventories should translate into increased production, which in turn can only help employment and weigh in on the plus side'' for gross domestic product, said Dana Saporta, an economist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J.
 Stockpiles at wholesalers had been expected to rise 0.5 percent after a 0.6 percent gain initially reported for March, according to the median forecast of 36 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
 Total inventories fell by $156 million in April. The biggest declines included pharmaceuticals at $812 million and automobiles at $262 million.
 Wholesale auto inventories, reflecting mainly imported cars, dropped 1 percent as sales rose 1.2 percent. The increase in sales came during a month when purchases at all auto dealers dropped 1.8 percent, suggesting that automakers suffered the brunt of the decline. 
 Also yesterday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that it was delaying today's scheduled release of the Producer Price Index, a measure of inflation. ''B.L.S. staff are working to resolve unexpected difficulties in calculating the index this month,'' the bureau said in a statement, saying the data would not be available before June 15. The release of the monthly index has been delayed several times this year.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Senior Exams Are Too Basic

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

 BODY:
A study of high school graduation exams, rites of passage for more than half the nation's secondary school students, shows that they largely test material taught in the 9th and 10th grades. Such material, the study said, is often taught at the middle school level in other industrialized countries.
 The study found that the tests measured very basic material and skills, insufficient for success in university courses or in jobs paying salaries higher than the poverty level, currently about $18,000 for a family of four. 
 The study, by Achieve Inc., a nonprofit organization created by state governors and business leaders, analyzed high school exit tests in mathematics and language arts from six states, and writing tests from four of the states. The states were Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio and Texas. 
 Mike Cohen, president of Achieve, said the report found that the tests were not ''not pegged at a very demanding level.'' He said states should gradually improve instruction and raise the minimum standards for graduation.
 The exams have met with opposition, and some states, like Arizona, have been forced to postpone plans to attach consequences to the results of the exams. Testing experts generally warn against making important academic decisions on the basis of a single test. And while the research is inconclusive, some studies have suggested that the tests may contribute to higher dropout rates.
 Matthew Gandal, the executive vice president of the organization, noted that exit exams were frequently attacked as unfair. ''We think it's the opposite,'' he said. ''It's unfair not to expect students to learn what's on these tests. By the time they graduate, if they haven't learned what's on these tests, they'll be really unprepared, and by then it's too late. They won't be able to go to college or to get jobs with which they can support a family.''
 The study also compared the material tested with benchmarks from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, concluding that in math, the skills tested on high school exit exams in the United States are taught in middle school in many other countries.
 Lisa Graham Keegan, the former commissioner of education in Arizona, said she had begun looking into high school graduation exams, but on the first administration of a test found that 84 percent of the students had failed. Arizona has continued giving the exams, but will not require them for graduation until the spring of 2006.
 ''Obviously, the biggest barrier is not politics, it's reality,'' said Ms. Keegan, who now runs a conservative nonprofit organization called the Education Leaders Council. ''We don't teach this content well, and any barrier exam you put up right now doesn't mean that kids are going to learn that material.''
 Ms. Keegan said that before these exams could be fairly imposed on high school students, schools needed to ensure that they were actually teaching the material, an elementary step that she said surprisingly eluded many school systems. She praised the report, however, for highlighting the quality of the exams and grade-level standards. 
 The report came under attack from FairTest, the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, which opposes what it calls ''one size fits all'' exit exams. Bob Schaeffer, public education director for the organization, said that Achieve's reports invariably called for raising the academic bar for students. 
 ''It sounds like the latest installment from the 'Chicken Little, the Sky is Falling' crowd,'' Mr. Schaeffer said, adding that the group frequently tied reports of poor academic performance to dire predictions for the American work force and economy. 
 ''All judgments about where to set the bar, where the cutoffs should be, and how much students should learn at any grade level,'' he said, ''are inherently subjective and political.''

HEADLINE: Guggenheim Museum Seeks to Restore Its Most Valuable Asset: Itself

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
After 45 years the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Frank Lloyd Wright's soaring spiral that has become one of Manhattan's greatest tourist attractions, will undergo a major facelift. And while it has good bones, like many Wright buildings the Upper East Side landmark is plagued with cracks, leaks and corroding surfaces.
 ''The care and preservation of the Frank Lloyd Wright building has been a priority for us,'' Thomas Krens, the museum's director, said.
 Calling it ''the most important piece of art in the collection,'' Peter B. Lewis, a Cleveland-based philanthropist, chairman of the museum's board and a trustee since 1993, has pledged to match trustee gifts three to one for the project. 
 So far the Guggenheim has raised $20 million from Mr. Lewis and a group of trustees. Museum officials say they need at least $5 million more and are hoping for support from the city and state as well as private donations.
 The building on Fifth Avenue at 89th Street will remain open during the restoration, which is expected to take two years. In addition to removing nine coats of paint, right down to the building's structure, to properly fix its cracking surface, the project also includes repairing the sidewalk, with its metallic rings set into concrete. Inside the building, the terrazzo floor in the main rotunda will also be restored, and the climate control and security systems updated.
 Since it opened in 1959, drawing huge crowds and controversy because of its design, the building, with its spiraled interior rising 96 feet, has been the primary reason many people go to the Guggenheim. A Gallup poll taken in early 1960 showed that nearly 4 out of every 10 visitors (38 percent) said they came to the Guggenheim specifically for the building; 53 percent said they came to see both the building and the collection, and only 5 percent said they came just for the art. 
 Today's audiences are much the same, museum officials say. After the Sept. 11 attacks, when tourism to New York plummeted, so did the Guggenheim's attendance. Although it fell more than 50 percent in October 2001, the overall decline in the fourth quarter was only 17 percent.
 Museum surveys show that for the 900,000 to 1,000,000 people who visit every year, the building consistently ranked over the art as the reason for visiting. Architecture buffs say the Guggenheim is Wright's most visited building and his only major commission in New York City.
 Neither the building's design, which was commissioned by the Guggenheim in 1943, nor its construction, which was completed in 1959, went smoothly. The only builder Wright could find to execute his drawings economically was a man whose expertise was in constructing parking garages and freeways. The building's outer wall was made by spraying layers of gunite (a mixture of sand and cement commonly used to line swimming pools) from within the building, through steel reinforcements, against pieces of plywood that were molded into the building's shape. Every few years the exterior is patched and painted, but the cosmetic touches camouflage far deeper problems.
 In extremely cold weather, moisture from the skylights and windows that have not been sufficiently insulated drips down on some interior walls. Long, stuffed tubes of absorbent material, giant sponges that resemble blue sausages (the museum calls them socks), are placed along perimeter floors to absorb condensation. In the rotunda, some socks have been discreetly tucked behind paintings hung on brackets away from the walls. The museum has also had to deal with leaking pipes. 
 Earlier this year the museum hired Swanke Hayden Connell Architects, a Manhattan firm perhaps best known for restoring the Statue of Liberty, to assess the condition of the building. A feasibility study will be presented to the museum this week. Gwathmey Siegel & Associates, Manhattan architects, has also been consulted. No stranger to the Guggenheim, Gwathmey Siegel renovated the interior of the building in 1992 and added a 10-story tower loosely inspired by Wright's original drawings. 
 For 16 years under Mr. Krens, the Guggenheim has focused on forging an international network of museums. It now has locations in Venice, Berlin, Las Vegas and Bilbao, Spain, along with partnerships with the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, and the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. 
 Mr. Krens has set his sights on building other Guggenheims around the world using world-class architects as part of the attraction, as he did with the Guggenheim Bilbao, by Frank Gehry. In the planning stages is a $130 million museum on Maua Pier in Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro, by the Paris architect Jean Nouvel. A feasibility study was completed last fall for a Guggenheim Taichung in Taiwan, designed by the Iraqi-born architect Zaha Hadid.
 The New York restoration is the beginning of what the museum hopes will be a larger capital initiative. The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, which owns the museum, is considering creating new amenities like public access to the rotunda roof. Much like the Metropolitan Museum of Art's popular sculpture roof terrace, the roof of the Guggenheim has stunning views of the city and could be transformed into a sculpture garden.
 Also under consideration is converting offices on the ninth floor of the Gwathmey Siegel tower into a restaurant and relocating those offices to SoHo, where the majority of the staff now work. The foundation is also considering reinforcing the Gehry-designed canopy on the museum's fifth floor. (In 2001 the New York City Landmarks Commission gave the museum a six-year permit for the structure, a large stainless steel sculptural form that sits above the museum's sculpture terrace.) Charles Gwathmey said yesterday that in addition to the restoration of the facade, his firm plans to be working on designing these future projects. 
 Since joining the museum's board 11 years ago, Mr. Lewis has been the institution's biggest donor. This is the fourth major gift he has made to the Guggenheim, bringing his donations to more than $77 million.
 The addition of two real estate developers to the board -- William Mack, founder and managing partner of Apollo Real Estate Advisers, and Stephen M. Ross, founder and chief executive of the Related Companies -- in October has helped provide the expertise for restoring the Wright building. The Guggenheim is expected to begin a capital campaign drive in the fall not only to raise money for the facade but also to create an endowment earmarked for building maintenance. 
 Before any work begins, however, the plans will be presented to Community Board 8 and will need to be approved by the New York City Landmark Preservation Commission.

HEADLINE: Ties to Rowland Helped Developer, Panel Is Told

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY and ALISON LEIGH COWAN

DATELINE: HARTFORD, June 9 

 BODY:
A day after examining the sale and rental of Gov. John G. Rowland's Capitol Hill condominium at higher-than-market rates, the Connecticut House committee investigating whether he should be impeached reviewed what its lawyer called ''specific interactions'' related to state business between the governor and the developer who arranged the condo deals. 
 The lawyer, Steven F. Reich, walked the committee through a series of transactions suggesting that the developer, Robert V. Matthews, found success working with state agencies because of his personal relationship with the governor.
 Mr. Reich described an appearance by the governor at a celebratory dinner Mr. Matthews and his bankers held when they secured a $16 million loan after receiving a state guarantee. Mr. Reich also described a meeting of the Connecticut Development Authority in which a board member changed his vote so that one of Mr. Matthews' projects would win state financing, after learning Mr. Matthews and the governor were friends. And he told the committee about a phone call the governor made from a Waterbury golf course to a Pennsylvania company that Mr. Matthews wanted to move to one of his properties in Connecticut. 
 ''The specific interactions were more instructive than merely looking at the overall dollars,'' Mr. Reich told the 10-member bipartisan House Select Committee of Inquiry, hearing its second day of public testimony.
 Mr. Rowland, a Republican in his third term, also faces a parallel federal investigation into his conduct relating to gifts and benefits he received from people working for and doing business with the state.
 In the hearings on Wednesday, lawyers for the governor repeatedly suggested that the committee's investigator, Andrew B. Melnick, knew little about the relationship between the governor and Mr. Matthews. They have cast it as a friendship and Mr. Matthews as a generous man. They also restated objections to the fact that some of Mr. Melnick's testimony was based on interviews conducted by his colleagues, not him, and they complained that they are not able to cross-examine many of the witnesses who gave information to investigators.
 The celebratory dinner, at the Goodwin Hotel in downtown Hartford in April 1997, came four months after the Connecticut Development Authority initially tabled a request for a loan guarantee by one of Mr. Matthews' companies, Fabricated Metal Products. The next month, however, the authority approved a modified version of the request after board members were told Mr. Matthews and the governor were friends, according to testimony Wednesday. One Development Authority member, Richard T. Mulready, said in an affidavit introduced Wednesday that during a break in the authority's meeting that he met with two other board members -- the chairman, Arthur Diedrick, and Paul Silvester, who was representing the treasurer's office. 
 ''We discussed the fact that the governor wanted to get this deal done,'' Mr. Mulready said.
 Mr. Mulready, who had questioned the proposal, said he decided to change his vote ''to accommodate the governor.'' Without his vote the project would not have been approved.
 An investigator for the committee, Andrew B. Melnick, said Mr. Mulready confirmed information investigators obtained in a phone interview from Mr. Silvester, now in federal prison in Florida after he pleaded guilty to racketeering and money-laundering charges.
 By the time of the April dinner, Mr. Matthews had returned to the Development Authority and his bankers at Norwest to seek financing on behalf of another company, New Haven Manufacturing.
 Potential connections between the events confused some members of the House committee Wednesday. So Mr. Reich offered one scenario to explain what impact the governor's appearance at the dinner might have had on the bankers from Norwest.
 ''The purpose of having the governor come to the celebratory dinner for the prior financing was in essence to impress the Norwest bankers and persuade them to extend the additional $8 million financing,'' Mr. Reich said.
 ''That is an inference you could draw,'' he said.
 Mr. Melnick testified that one attendee at the dinner said the governor ''gave assurances'' that the state would make the second loan.
 ''The state will take care of its part,'' the governor was quoted as saying.
 Norwest committed to the $8 million loan on May 22, conditioned on the state's lending an additional $1.15 million. On June 18, the Connecticut Development Authority approved its piece of the loan.
 One committee member made a link between the June vote of the Development Authority and evidence presented the day before.
 ''The sale of the condo in D.C. was also in June of '97?'' asked William A. Hamzy, a Republican from Terryville.
 ''Yes,'' Mr. Reich responded.
 ''The same time that the C.D.A. approved the 1.15 million?'' Mr. Hamzy asked.
 ''Six days before it,'' Mr. Reich said.
 Other testimony indicated that Mr. Matthews also tried to use his ties to the governor to get $10 million in state money that would help lure Pinnacle Foods of Pennsylvania to a building he owned in New Haven. On October 6, 2000, while playing golf with Mr. Matthews in Waterbury, Mr. Rowland talked by phone with Michael D. Queen, a Pinnacle executive.
 There are at least two versions of that call.
 In a 2002 deposition that Mr. Matthews provided in a lawsuit, he said the governor had said, ''We need all the jobs we can in Connecticut. We would love to have you move here, and have a nice day.''
 Mr. Queen, however, in a deposition in the same litigation, said the governor had said that Pinnacle ''was in good hands with Bob Matthews, and he could get the job done for us.''
 Mr. Queen said he also recalled the governor saying ''that he looked forward to, you know, working with us and getting the project completed.''
 On April 6, 2001, economic development officials notified Pinnacle in writing that they could only offer $2 million, not $10 million. The deal fell apart. The letter arrived the week the governor was vacationing as a guest at Mr. Matthews' house in West Palm Beach. The governor later paid a fine and restitution for taking the free lodgings.

Loans, Taxes and Friends in High Places

The Connecticut House Select Committee of Inquiry, which will determine whether to recommend the impeachment of Gov. John G. Rowland, heard public testimony or sworn statements yesterday from the following people:

Richard T. Mulready a member of the Connecticut Development Authority. An affidavit was introduced in which he described a meeting of the development authority where he changed his vote so that one of Robert V. Matthews's projects would gain state financing. The reversal came after he learned Mr. Matthews, a developer, and the governor were friends.

Martin C. Lippe, right, a forensic accountant hired by the committee. In testimony, he compared the governor's 1996 federal income tax return with the governor's statement of his income on a 1996 loan application.

Andrew B. Melnick investigator for the committee and a former Manhattan assistant district attorney. He testified about loans and loan guarantees Mr. Matthews won through the Connecticut Development Authority. He also spoke about a phone call the governor made to lure to the state a Pennsylvania company, Pinnacle Foods. Mr. Matthews wanted to lease office space to Pinnacle.

Michael D. Queena Pinnacle executive. Information from a deposition he gave in a 2002 civil suit was introduced. It gave his account of the phone call Mr. Rowland made to Pinnacle.

Robert V. Matthewsa Connecticut real estate developer. Information from a deposition he gave in a 2002 civil suit was introduced. It gave his account of the phone call to Pinnacle.

HEADLINE: Now, a Great Leap Forward in Luxury

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 9 

 BODY:
Wearing a white car-racing T-shirt, black plastic cargo pants and silver Nike running shoes, James Wang, a 27-year-old developer of golf courses and luxury homes, stepped forward on Wednesday as one of China's first two buyers of the Maybach 62, a 20-foot ultraluxury sedan marketed as ''the private jet of the road.''
 At the opening day of the Beijing auto show, Mr. Wang ambled onto a stage with four much older DaimlerChrysler executives in dark suits to accept a crystal model of the keys to a silver Maybach that had already been delivered to his home.
 In a brief interview before the ceremony, Mr. Wang said that he had bought the car for the equivalent of $900,000, including taxes, and had chosen it because he liked both the driving performance and the comfort of the rear seats. 
 ''The reclining seat is like first class in an airplane,'' he said.
 In a country that is still officially Communist, Mr. Wang was vague about how he could afford a car that costs the equivalent of 1,200 years' wages for a typical Chinese factory worker. He said that he was a Chinese citizen who grew up in Beijing, and that his parents had sent him to San Francisco State University, where he owned and drove a succession of Mercedes cars, always silver.
 Mr. Wang's riches are one sign of the powerful economic boom that has gripped China, pushing up property values in many major cities. His purchase also highlights how a few Chinese families have accumulated extraordinary wealth, which has led to some nervousness among the rich themselves and some concern among China's leaders about the potential for a political backlash over sharply widening inequality. 
 Indeed, even as Mr. Wang accepted his Maybach key in person from Peter Honegg, the president of Mercedes-Benz China, the buyer of the second Maybach sent a crisply dressed young man who refused to identify his employer.
 Sales of luxury cars have taken off even though China has some of the world's highest car prices. Beyond the basic cost, buyers here pay a 17 percent value-added tax, an additional consumption tax of up to 8 percent and, for imported models, a 32 percent tariff.
 And while Mr. Wang may not be the typical car buyer in China these days, he is just the kind of newly minted multimillionaire that the world's luxury auto manufacturers are all eagerly chasing.
 About 40 yards from the Maybach exhibit, Werner Mischke, the chairman of Automobili Lamborghini Holding, a subsidiary of Volkswagen's Audi unit, was standing between a black $350,000 Lamborghini Gallardo and a yellow $460,000 Murcielago. 
 He described signing papers this week to open dealerships in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
 ''Chinese people love brands and have a good feeling about luxury, about extreme luxury,'' he said.
 Ferrari announced last Saturday that it would open a string of dealerships across China. Aston Martin, the Ford Motor subsidiary that has supplied cars for many of the James Bond movies, said on Wednesday that it would enter the Chinese market next year. 
 Near the Lamborghini exhibit, it displayed an Aston Martin Vanquish with fake machine guns and rockets mounted on the front; the sports car is expected to go on sale here for more than $400,000 -- spy gear not included.
 In another hall stood the 760Li, BMW's most expensive model, which costs $250,000 here, including taxes. China accounted for more than a third of worldwide sales of the model last year, far more than any other country, said Andreas Kunz of BMW, the chief Beijing representative of the German automaker.
 Many of the buyers of such cars are making fortunes in real estate. Construction cranes have punctuated the skylines of Chinese cities for two decades, but in recent months they have become even more numerous, lining major highways even in second-tier cities like Nanjing.
 A variety of jests circulate here these days about how every other Chinese adult seems to be a real estate agent, or that property speculators with pocket calculators have supplanted the blue-collar toilers celebrated in Mao's era as the nation's model workers.
 Mr. Wang fits the bill. After graduating from college, he returned to Beijing and became a developer, a skill, he said in English, that ''I learned from my dad.'' 
 He declined to discuss his family in detail, saying that he only wanted to talk about his love of cars. He owns a Porsche 911 and a Subaru with an engine powered up to more than 500 horsepower.
 Asked why a young driver with a taste for fast cars would spend nearly $1 million for a boulevard cruiser bigger than many American limousines, Mr. Wang replied that his chauffeur would drive the Maybach and that he planned to share the car with his family.
 After the ceremony, faced with a crush of Chinese reporters with lots of questions, Mr. Wang fled up a staircase with the help of Maybach employees.
 For all the wealth apparent here now, however, there are hints that the boom may not last. Alarmed by a recent acceleration of inflation, Chinese regulators have begun urging banks to lend more cautiously, especially for real estate, and have imposed land-use restrictions.
 Heavy bank lending has helped sustain the boom so far, even though actual property prices and rents have been falling. Jones Lang LaSalle, a big real estate consulting firm, calculates that rents and prices for luxury apartments in Beijing fell about 8 percent in the 12 months through April.
 More than a quarter of these apartments are vacant. Yet as projects under way are completed, the total number of luxury apartments here is expected to rise to 27,000 by the end of next year, up from 17,000 now. 
 A few auto executives are starting to become nervous. 
 ''The real estate side is definitely slowing down, and that will affect everybody,'' said Bill Begg, the general manager of Ford Motor's Land Rover and Jaguar subsidiaries in China.
 Li Ying, the president of a BMW dealership in Beijing, said that quite a few potential customers had become nervous about their businesses in the last month, making them more reluctant to buy. 
 ''Some people say May is black May,'' she said.
 But Mr. Wang, echoing the bullishness of many business executives here after two decades of almost continuous rapid economic growth, said that, ''in Beijing, it's still a growth market for real estate.''
 For Mr. Wang, the purchase of a Maybach is the fulfillment of a dream that began four years ago, when he started reading in automotive magazines that DaimlerChrysler had set out to design the most luxurious car the world had ever seen. After test driving the Maybach, Mr. Wang said, he concluded the company had met its goal and that he had to own one.
 Behind the stage minutes before the ceremony, Karin Hoo, a Maybach ''personal liaison manager'' from Hong Kong, fussed over Mr. Wang, whose shirt was decorated with three Nissan race cars and a prominent Nissan racing logo. 
 Ms. Hoo said with a sigh that she wished she had brought a T-shirt with a Maybach logo for him to wear. 
 ''It's famous,'' Mr. Wang said, slouching in a leather chair. 
 ''And personally, I like this car better than a Bentley or a Rolls-Royce.''

HEADLINE: The earning power of women has really increased, right? Take a closer look.

BYLINE: By Jeff Madrick. 
Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine, and he teaches at Cooper Union and New School University. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
THE great defense against stagnating male wages in America over the last few decades has been the two-worker family. No doubt many women want to work to fulfill their own goals and gain financial independence. But consider the monetary advantages. The latest data show that the median income of two-worker families was nearly $71,000. If only the husband worked, the median family income was $41,000. 
 In the meantime, women's wages have been rising substantially over this period. Forty years ago, the Census Bureau reports, women made, on average, 59 percent of what men made. Now they make 77 percent. This is surely gratifying. 
 Small wonder the proportion of two-worker families has soared in America, to 62 percent of all married couples, from 39 percent in 1970.
 But valuable new research by two economists, Stephen J. Rose and Heidi Hartmann, shows that such measures substantially overstate what women earn over time. A big reason, almost always overlooked, is that women work far fewer hours than men on average and often drop out of the work force for years at a time. Usually they do so for child-rearing and to tend to the family. The traditional, widely trumpeted measures of the gender wage gap track only those women who work full time for a full year -- at most about half of working women in any single year. 
 So Mr. Rose, senior research economist at ORC Macro, a social and economic research firm, and Ms. Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women's Policy Research, decided to study actual earnings histories of men and women over 15 years. They analyzed the in-depth interviews of the University of Michigan's Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which keeps track of a representative sample of workers. 
 The researchers compared the earnings of men and women from 1983 to 1998 in the prime work years between ages 26 and 59. 
 What they found was nothing like a closing of the pay gap to 77 percent. Over that period, women on average earned only 38 percent of what men did. Adding it up, the researchers found that the average woman earned $273,592 over 15 years, compared with $722,693 for men (in 1999 dollars).
 Fewer work hours account for much of the difference. It turns out that fewer than half of women earned income in all 15 years but 85 percent of men did. About 30 percent of women did not work at all for four or more years . By contrast, only one man in 27 was out of work so much. 
 Thus, a snapshot of the median income of two-worker families in any given year exaggerates the financial advantage to the family of the working spouse. Some combination of social mores, necessity and, arguably, parental instinct drives spouses, typically wives, to stay home and tend to the family. Married women with children usually work less than unmarried women. 
 But hours alone do not account for the discrepancy in pay over time. The economists' analysis turns up continuing evidence of gender segregation. A far higher proportion of females have had jobs that pay at the bottom of the income scale, and fewer of them climb to jobs of higher quality. Even when they are well educated, women predominantly take different kinds of jobs from those men do -- jobs that usually pay less. 
 For example, Ms. Hartmann and Mr. Rose divided jobs into three categories: elite, good and less-skilled. Among the relatively elite professional jobs, women were mostly teachers, nurses and social workers. Men were mostly business executives and scientists. 
 The middle level for women included secretarial positions, but for men it was typically well-paid blue-collar jobs. 
 In each tier, the researchers find, salaries are higher for the male-dominated categories than for the female categories, even though the educational requirements are similar. 
 Ms. Hartmann and Mr. Rose argue, most disturbingly, that these tendencies are self-reinforcing. Because wives usually earn less, they are more likely to give up their jobs to do child care. 
 Women also often take low-paying temporary or part-time jobs that provide few benefits so they can be home for the family. This in turn creates a labor pool that business can consistently exploit, encouraging companies to orient their operations to use such low-paid workers rather than create better jobs. 
 And many researchers have found that there is a statistical bias against women in the work force because employers assume there is a probability that they will drop out for family reasons. This often leads to underinvestment in women's careers and a tendency to hire them for dead-end jobs. 
 There are encouraging trends. Women are increasingly better educated. Government policies against discrimination have had success. And a service economy reduces the advantage men once had doing heavy labor in a manufacturing economy. 
 Yet problems persist. They amount to a bona fide example of inherent prejudice in the labor markets, and effective public policies are called for. 
 First, stronger government programs to encourage paid family leave and more flexible hours will enable women to maintain long-term careers. 
 Second, the nation needs a serious commitment to quality day care for all as well as to the high-level personnel required for such work. 
 Third, Ms. Hartmann and Mr. Rose believe that there should be more federal support for discrimination oversight agencies, notably the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Office for Federal Contract Compliance Programs. They argue that regular audits of large corporations for discrimination against women would be valuable. 
 Such policies are often seen as costs to the nation, even by traditional liberals. But they would be likely to raise the nation's productivity by fully exploiting and enhancing the talents of women, and improving family life and the development of children. There is evidence they do just that in Europe and Scandinavia. 
 Fourth, I believe, research is required into correcting subtle forms of prejudice in the early school years that encourage women to take jobs that pay less. 
 Given the self-reinforcing nature of the problem, one would think that such issues would be red meat for a presidential election year. But the presidential candidates address these matters only in passing. Perhaps we also need more research into why this is so -- a place to begin might be to take note that the presidential candidates are men.

HEADLINE: At Summit, Police and Delegations Outnumber the Demonstrators

BYLINE: By ARIEL HART

DATELINE: SAVANNAH, Ga., June 9 

 BODY:
It is not just that the protesters are outnumbered by reporters and police officers. They are even outnumbered by the world leaders and aides who are taking part in the Group of Eight summit meeting that began Tuesday. 
 On Day 2 of the conference, at the site in Forsyth Park here set aside for demonstrations by an expected 5,000 protesters, the Savannah alternative rock band Vermillion X entertained a couple dozen people, most of them local residents, who came just to hear the band. During an ''open mic'' session earlier, a tape played as an empty stage faced the vast, mostly empty, field. The highlight of the afternoon was a spontaneous, uneventful walk by perhaps 40 protesters. Organizers said an environmental protest closer to the conference on secluded Sea Island, 80 miles from here, drew 200 people. 
 ''I didn't really expect there to be many people here,'' said Bernardo Issel, a demonstrator from New York. ''Partly because of the isolated location, and partly because of the difficulty people had in getting permits and everything. I think people were just discouraged.''
 Protest organizers cited many reasons for the low turnout, including the much-trumpeted assemblage of 20,000 federal, state and local law enforcement officers and the decision by some leading groups to stay away. Demonstrators had to choose between Brunswick, the site of the environmental protest, or Savannah, near the reporters' center on Hutchinson Island.
 Since the 1999 World Trade Organization conference in Seattle, such meetings ''have been increasingly taken away from anywhere we can get near,'' said Mike Dolan, a principal organizer of protests at the 1999 conference, where violence erupted between police officers and demonstrators.
 Mr. Dolan also pointed to decisions by groups like Public Citizen and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to stay out of the Group of Eight protests to save resources for the national political conventions this summer.
 ''We're all very stretched and working hard on the election,'' said Thea Lee, chief international economist at the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
 Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, added that the Group of Eight's recent concentration on issues like nuclear proliferation rather than economic pacts had made it ''not such an interesting target.''
 Mr. Dolan, for his part, is looking forward to the Republican convention. ''You will probably see something of a turnout in New York that will be memorable,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall as Investors Reconsider Interest Rate Outlook

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday after three days of gains as investors dealt with the possibility of interest rates rising higher than expected when the Federal Reserve meets later this month.
 The Dow Jones industrial average declined 64.08 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,368.44. The broader gauges were also lower. The Nasdaq composite index fell 32.92 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,990.61. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 10.85 points, or 1 percent, at 1,131.33. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks stocks of smaller companies, was down 9.33, or 1.6 percent, at 568.58. 
 The slide came a day after the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said the central bank was prepared to do whatever was necessary to ensure sustainable economic growth in the face of rising inflation and energy prices. The unusually direct statement led some on Wall Street to believe the Fed would raise rates as high as half a percentage point at its June 29-30 meeting, rather than the 0.25 percent the market has been expecting.
 ''Equities kind of shrugged it off yesterday; today it seems like folks are saying: 'Is inflation an issue? How far will the Fed have to go? How long will this tightening last?''' said John Caldwell, chief investment strategist for the McDonald Financial Group. ''Higher rates certainly will have an impact. That will be a juggling act for the stock market over the next six months.''
 Oil prices remained in the spotlight yesterday, as United States inventory data showed a rise in the amount of crude and refined fuel products in storage last week. The news had little impact on the market, however. Crude futures, which have fallen in four of the last five sessions, settled higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 26 cents, to $37.54 a barrel.
 Coca-Cola, a Dow component, was down 85 cents at $51.76; the No.2 executive, Steve Heyer, announced plans to step down after he was passed over for the top job. Mr. Heyer, the president and chief operating officer, will leave after a transition period of several months.
 Fortune Brands, the maker of products including Jim Beam bourbon, Titleist golf equipment and Moen faucets, fell 41 cents, to $74.20, after it raised its forecast for the current quarter to the top range of analysts' expectations.
 Smithfield Foods, the nation's largest hog producer and pork processor, was down $1.16 at $29.05 after reporting sharply higher quarterly earnings, largely because of expanded operations and rising prices.
 Decliners outnumbered advancing shares more than 3 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume came to 1.27 billion shares, compared with 1.19 billion shares traded Tuesday.
 Some investors may have been taking a cautious approach ahead of the Labor Department's monthly report on producer prices, an important inflation gauge.
 The Producer Price Index, which measures prices of goods before they reach store shelves, was to have been released today, a day earlier than scheduled, because most financial markets will be closed tomorrow because of the funeral of former President Ronald Reagan. But government officials announced late yesterday that the report for May would be postponed until at least Tuesday because of difficulties in calculating the measure. 
 With so much uncertainty, it seemed that many investors were inclined to stay on the sidelines, and volume was low. Such a day ''can't be used as any indication of a trend,'' said Neil Massa, an equity trader with John Hancock.
 ''It just seems like the start of the summer doldrums,'' he said. ''I think once the end of the month comes, we can start to move forward. Until then we'll be trading sideways.''

Treasury Prices Decline
By Reuters
 Treasury prices slipped yesterday as traders' fears that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates more rapidly than anticipated offset strong results from an auction of new five-year notes.
 By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note declined 11/32, to 99 18/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.81 percent, from 4.76 percent on Tuesday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of five-year notes:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
Price: 99.955
High Yield: 4.010
Low Yield: 3.882
Median Yield: 3.960
Total applied for: $43,695,718
Accepted: $15,000,016
Noncompetitive: $166,718
Interest set at: 4%

The five-year notes mature June 15, 2009.

HEADLINE: The Trouble With Testing

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Richard P. Mills, the education commissioner for New York State, has suggested that the statewide decline in the fourth-grade test results could be linked to tough economic times (''City Test Scores of 3rd Graders See 10,000 F's,'' front page, June 4).
 If external factors like socioeconomic conditions, which lie far beyond the reach of teachers and schools, can have such an adverse effect on test scores, isn't that reason enough to question the use of such tests as the sole measure of student achievement or of teacher or school quality?

HEADLINE: Who Should Pay for Presidential Posterity?

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
EVEN before Ronald Reagan built his library on a California hilltop, where thousands of mourners filed past his coffin this week, taxpayers' costs of maintaining presidential libraries had become a political issue. A 1986 law, supported by Mr. Reagan, required the private foundations that built future libraries to set up endowments to defray the costs of upkeep. 
 But the law has done little to ease taxpayers' burden. The George H. W. Bush library, in College Station, Tex., costs over $3 million a year to operate. But its $4.5 million endowment -- the first endowment required under the 1986 law -- produces income of less than $200,000 per year, according to an official of the National Archives and Records Administration, which owns and runs 10 presidential libraries. 
 Under a plan that the archives administration turned over to Congressional leaders last month, the endowment for the $175 million Clinton library is $7.2 million. It would pay about $300,000 of what is expected to be more than $4 million in upkeep costs in its first year of operation, said another archive official, Sharon Fawcett, deputy assistant archivist for presidential libraries. 
 That is less than one-tenth the cost of operating the building. The archives will pick up the rest of the costs of maintenance for the library and museum. Entry fees will be used for public programs.
 The reasons for the shortfalls are partly financial (interest rates are low), partly political (the law didn't require large enough endowments) and partly architectural (libraries are getting grander).
 At the time the bill was passed, the late Senator Lawton Chiles, a Florida Democrat, complained that the costs of operating the facilities had ''ballooned'' from $64,000 in 1955 to about $15 million in 1985. Last year, though, the presidential libraries under federal control cost nearly $42 million to run.
 When the 1986 law was being debated, Representative William Clinger, Republican of Pennsylvania, said it would ''drastically reduce the enormous costs associated with maintaining the presidential library facilities.'' Congress even considered the possibility that the income from a library's endowment could exceed the operating costs and create a surplus.
 The law required that the foundations raise an endowment equal to 20 percent of the cost of building the federal portion of the project. 
 The endowment for the $83 million Bush library is less than $4.5 million. The law was amended last year to double the endowment for the libraries of presidents elected after George W. Bush.
 Yesterday, Senator Byron L. Dorgan, author of the 2003 amendment, said in an interview that ''the costs are growing dramatically as libraries become larger and larger.''
 He continued, ''I think the libraries are wonderful resources for the American people, but I think there need to be some reasonable limits on how much burden the American taxpayer is expected to bear.''
 He added of the increase in endowment that ''40 percent was what I thought we could get done.'' 
 Back in the 80's, Senator Chiles tried unsuccessfully to require former presidents to contribute earnings from their memoirs to their libraries.
 Asked what Mr. Clinton had contributed to the library, Skip Rutherford, the president of the Clinton foundation, said, ''Sweat equity.'' 
 In an e-mail response to questions, Mr. Clinton's press representative, Jim Kennedy, said the former president had made personal gifts to the foundation and ''on a number of occasions, he has asked that in lieu of being paid for a speech, the funds should go to his foundation.''
 Mr. Rutherford said the library was an overall benefit to the country.
 ''This is a great deal for the government,'' he said. ''How often does someone build a building and give it to the taxpayers with an endowment?''
 Presidential libraries are invaluable to scholars, said Robert A. Caro, who won the Pulitzer Prize last year for the third volume of his biography of Lyndon B. Johnson. ''They are becoming a very significant repository of our memory,'' he said.
 ''It's true that they have become vast public relations enterprises,'' he said, ''but, for scholars, there is almost nothing you can't find there, if you are willing to look hard enough.''
 Since Herbert Hoover's 4,000-square-foot library opened in West Branch, Iowa, in 1962, presidential libraries have grown considerably. Mr. Clinton's is 40 times bigger than Hoover's was at that time.
 Senator Chiles had hoped to cap the size of presidential libraries. The law contains a substantial financial penalty for buildings larger than 70,000 square feet. Yet under the plan presented to Congress last month, no penalty will be charged for the much larger Clinton building.
 That's because the Clinton foundation plans to retain about half of the building, including the gift shop, cafeteria and meeting rooms and an apartment on the top floor. The government will take title to the archives and museum, which total some 69,000 square feet -- just under the 70,000 square-foot cutoff -- and will run the mechanical spaces and public restrooms.
 Congress can object to the Clinton library plan and prevent the archives administration from taking possession. But Ms. Fawcett, who has been with the archives administration for 35 years, said, ''There is a very strong possibility that we will hear nothing from Congress.'' 
 ''There are a lot of members of Congress who would like to be president someday,'' Ms. Fawcett suggested, ''and they want to have their own presidential libraries.''

HEADLINE: Archive Architecture: Setting the Spin in Stone

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark. 

 BODY:
EVERY day, a worker climbs to the roof of the Clinton Presidential Center here and hoists three seven-foot-high numbers onto a steel frame. The numbers tell drivers on Interstate 30, just west of the site, how many days remain until Nov. 18, when Bill Clinton is expected to open the $175 million project that embodies his postpresidential ambitions.
 Millions of people pass by that sign every year, Skip Rutherford said. And as president of the nonprofit William J. Clinton Foundation, which is overseeing the construction, Mr. Rutherford figures that 300,000 or so of them will want to visit the 11th, and by far most expensive, of the nation's presidential libraries. The runner-up, the library built for the first President Bush in College Station, Tex., cost about half as much to construct.
 The Clinton center, at 152,000 square feet, far exceeds the 70,000-square-foot guideline included in a 1986 law on presidential libraries. But that ''one size fits all'' approach did not anticipate the fact that Mr. Clinton, who served two terms in the age of computerization, has a far larger collection of documents -- 90 million -- than any president before him. Nor could it have accounted for the fact that Mr. Clinton, the youngest ex-president since Theodore Roosevelt, is determined to make a splash. 
 Polshek Partnership Architects of New York designed the museum in the shape of a bridge. The center will also include a park, archives and a public policy school named for Mr. Clinton. If the exhibits (including Hillary Rodham Clinton's inaugural gowns and a description of the Monica Lewinsky affair) aren't enough, the possibility of seeing the 42nd president might be: Mr. Rutherford said Mr. Clinton expects to spend 7 to 10 days a month in a glass-walled penthouse. Its floor-to-ceiling windows will be visible not only from the grounds of the museum but from downtown Little Rock (and from the condo of two Friends of Bill, Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen, across the freeway).
 ''I fully expect that when the president is here, he'll be going downstairs and giving tours to some old lady from Des Moines,'' Mr. Rutherford said. With Mr. Clinton's memoir, ''My Life,'' due from Knopf on June 22, Mr. Rutherford expects the former president to resume active fund-raising for the library, which began early in his second term.
 ''I'm starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel, and it's not a freight train,'' he said of his seven-year fund-raising effort.
 But the tunnel keeps getting longer. Mr. Rutherford's latest estimate of the overall cost is $175 million (about half of it in building costs), up from $125 million in 1999. He will have to deliver a $7.2 million endowment to help pay the federal government's cost of upkeep. The presidential libraries are built with private money but, except for the Nixon library, they are run by the National Archives and Records Administration. That agency estimates that it will cost over $4 million to operate the Clinton library in its first year.
 After rejecting several sites that would have been easier to build on, Mr. Clinton chose a 28-acre abandoned warehouse area across the freeway from downtown, with the aim of creating a vast urban renewal project. Already, according to Little Rock's city manager, Bruce Moore, the Clinton library has brought almost $1 billion in private investment to the area around it. Barry Travis, chief executive of the Little Rock Convention and Visitors Bureau, said a study commissioned by the bureau found that ''if the library attracted 150,000 to 300,000 visitors a year, we calculated there would be from $8.6 million to $17.5 million in direct tourism expenditures, and that doesn't include any other types of economic development that the library might spawn.'' The 11 existing presidential libraries, counting the Nixon library, average about 150,000 visitors a year each.
 The city of Little Rock will maintain the park around the library (designed by the landscape architect George Hargreaves), and may turn an abandoned railroad bridge next to the building into an additional attraction. The city had to acquire 11 parcels of land for the center, but a real estate developer, Eugene Pfeifer III, refused to sell his parcel. When the city condemned Mr. Pfeifer's land, he sued. The Arkansas Supreme Court rejected his claim in 2001, but not before the suit (which had left the final dimensions of the site in doubt) delayed the completion of architectural drawings.
 Now Mr. Rutherford is planning a lavish opening weekend after the November election so Mr. Clinton and President Bush can comfortably share the stage. All the other living former presidents -- Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush -- are also invited. ''Getting it built can be very political,'' Mr. Rutherford said, ''but in the end everyone comes together.''
 Most presidential libraries are in traditional styles. (The Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace, in Yorba Linda, Calif., is building an ornate replica of the East Room of the White House, which will be available for weddings and bar mitzvahs.) The Kennedy library, by I. M. Pei, and the Johnson library, by Gordon Bunshaft, are more modern but present forbidding facades.
 The Clinton center design, by the same architects who designed the Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, has a similarly luminous appearance. Richard M. Olcott, a partner in the firm who collaborated with James S. Polshek on the project, said he presented several schemes to Mr. Clinton, but as soon as he mentioned the bridge idea, ''there was no turning back.''
 Mr. Olcott recalled the moment: ''President Clinton said, 'It's a bridge to the 21st century,' and several aides in the room groaned. And he said, 'No one ever liked my bridge to the future -- except me and the voters.' ''
 But the ''bridge'' stops short of the Arkansas River. ''The Secret Service nixed that -- the concern was that a ship with explosives could pull up underneath,'' Mr. Polshek recalled. ''But when you get to the end of the building, you'll feel like you're out on the river.''
 The building's biggest surprise may be the apartment built for Mr. Clinton on its roof. The Clinton, Bush and Reagan libraries all have presidential apartments, but they are out of public view. Mr. Clinton's 2,000-square-foot residence is a kind of Modernist glass box -- like Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House on the roof of a much larger building.
 Such openness might seem an odd choice for a person who requires round-the-clock Secret Service protection. But Mr. Clinton likes attention: one Little Rock taxi driver, George Coleman, remembered seeing him standing on a street corner after he lost a race for governor. It was as if he were ''waiting for somebody to come over and shake his hand,'' Mr. Coleman recalled.
 Mr. Clinton was born 100 or so miles away in Hope; the first house he lived in, which belonged to his grandparents, is now open to the public. Another of his childhood homes in Hope was offered for sale on eBay this spring, but the auction was derailed because some fake bids were submitted. The owners of that three-bedroom house, Gary and Javonna Johnson, have put it back on the market for $100,000, Mr. Johnson said. Another Clinton boyhood home, in Hot Springs, Ark., was badly damaged in a fire earlier this year. None of those houses is as glamorous as Mr. Clinton's new cabin in the sky. Referring to a huge terrace outside the apartment, Mr. Olcott, the architect, said, ''I expect him to be chipping golf balls into the river.''
 Outfitting the apartment has been left to Kaki Hockersmith, the Little Rock decorator who has designed dozens of rooms for Mr. Clinton, starting in the Arkansas governor's mansion. Most have been in traditional styles, with heavy draperies and richly colored upholstery. But Ms. Hockersmith said she was hoping to push Mr. Clinton in the direction of modern design, to pick up on the themes established by the building.
 Mr. Polshek's allies included Chelsea Clinton, who visited the firm's addition to the Cantor Center for Visual Arts at Stanford while she was an undergraduate there, and, Mr. Clinton said, ''loved it.''
 ''That made me even more comfortable with picking Jim,'' he said, adding that the family held his daughter's graduation party at the Cantor Center.
 Mr. Clinton said he and Mr. Olcott talked about modeling the building on the library of Trinity College, Dublin, which he recalled from travels during his days as a Rhodes scholar. That building consists of a series of alcoves framed by columns, and Mr. Olcott responded with a 240-foot-long colonnaded museum space that will hold installations by Ralph Appelbaum Associates, a New York exhibitions designer.
 Those exhibits will include some of the foundation's 80,000 artifacts, including a 1967 Mustang like one driven by Mr. Clinton as a young man, along with 50 saxophones. At a version of the White House cabinet table, it will be possible to learn about Clinton administration policies while sitting in the appropriate cabinet secretary's chair.
 But the piece de resistance may be the museum's oval office, which is situated so that light will stream through its windows, creating a verisimilitude lacking in the other post-presidential ovals, which are generally enclosed in windowless museum spaces.
 Inside, Ms. Hockersmith is recreating everything that was in Mr. Clinton's office, including the dark blue rug with 50 white stars that she designed in 1992. There will be a cast of Rodin's ''Thinker,'' a reproduction of a painting by Childe Hassam and copies of things like paperweights and the photos that stood on Mr. Clinton's desk.
 Rett Tucker, a Little Rock real estate agent, said the value of land around the center has more than doubled since the Clinton project was announced. Mr. Moore, the city manager, said the Clinton library set off a building boom that is to include a new headquarters for the Heifer Project International, a Little Rock charity that provides livestock to help poor people become self-sufficient.
 What people can't see at the museum, they may be able to see elsewhere in Little Rock -- a city obsessed with Clintoniana.
 The lucky few may be invited to Ms. Hockersmith's palatial home in the Edgehill neighborhood, which is filled with photos of the Clintons and where the fabric on the sofa cushions is the one Ms. Hockersmith used at the White House. At her home, drinks are served in glasses with the seal of Camp David -- purchased in the gift shop there, she pointed out.
 The Holiday Inn Presidential Center has filled its lobby with Clinton memorabilia (including ''autographed'' photos of the presidential pets Socks and Buddy). The hotel has recently changed the name of its restaurant to Camp David. All over town, taxi drivers are dusting off their Clinton anecdotes.
 The cabdrivers may be free to embellish, but the museum -- with its millions in government financing -- will be held to a higher standard. Mr. Rutherford said Mr. Clinton meets regularly with the exhibition designers, reviewing how his legacy will be presented. But the exhibitions, Mr. Rutherford said, ''are still a work in progress.''
 Robert A. Caro, the Pulitzer-Prize-winning biographer, pointed out that on opening day, libraries of this sort tend to reflect a former president's own view of history. Over time -- and under the control of federal archivists -- the depiction tends to become more balanced.
 At the Johnson library in Austin, Tex., ''the first director viewed it as a place to present the Johnson presidency in its most favorite light,'' Mr. Caro said.
 ''Mortality takes its toll,'' he added, ''but the papers remain.''
 The National Archives and Records Administration will have final say over the exhibitions. ''We don't expect exhibits to make the president look bad,'' said Sharon Fawcett, the agency's deputy assistant archivist for presidential libraries. ''But we do expect to have a clear statement of facts, and acknowledgment that there are two sides to the story.''
 If not, she said, ''we don't have to accept the building.''

HEADLINE: Labor Demands Cast a Rich Mayor In a Miserly Light

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
Each June, labor protests are to New York City as dogwood blossoms are to the rest of the Northeast; spring would seem a bit empty without them. 
 A confluence of labor actions this week -- three-day strikes held by day care workers and home health aides, and a protest that drew tens of thousands of firefighters, police officers and teachers outside City Hall -- underscored the unusually painful headache that unions present to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. 
 In a week in which Mr. Bloomberg saw his approval figures edge above 50 percent, the labor strife provided a stark reminder that the mayor has a deeply antagonistic relationship with large swaths of unionized workers. The unions, in turn, have found a sharp knife to insert in Mr. Bloomberg's weakest spot -- his image as a wealthy and impervious Daddy Warbucks unsympathetic to the wage demands of the home health worker making $7 an hour or the patrol officer making $37,000 a year. 
 During the rally on Tuesday, the head of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, Patrick J. Lynch, bellowed: ''We are not asking to be rich like you, Mr. Mayor. All we're asking for is to make our lives better for our families.''
 While few New York voters are likely to cast their vote on the basis of a few labor protests, the demonstrations do symbolize what increasingly appears to be the central, if not singular, impediment to Mr. Bloomberg's re-election bid. 
 The fact is that millions of New Yorkers, whether they have gotten over their higher taxes or have learned to do their smoking on the street, still insist that the mayor's wealth separates him spiritually from the rest of the city. And unions give those sentiments a voice. 
 ''The whole situation is unique,'' said Josh Freeman, a professor of labor history at Queens College. ''To have a billionaire as mayor is a very unusual situation, and I think there have been some efforts to get at the mayor on this populist ground.''
 Yesterday, day care workers at 350 centers that serve more than 30,000 low-income children began a three-day strike, an action that started a day after the huge labor protest demanding raises for police, firefighters and teachers. Each group is negotiating with the city against the backdrop of a recently ratified contract between the city and its largest labor union, District Council 37. Under that agreement, workers would receive a $1,000 one-time cash payment instead of a raise the first year of the contract, a 3 percent raise in the second year and 2 percent the third. The Bloomberg administration believes that contract sets the pattern for agreements with the other unions, though the other unions have dismissed those terms as insufficient. 
 Mr. Bloomberg is in a particularly difficult situation with teachers and day care workers. The latter, who care primarily for children of the poor, have been without a contract since April 2000 and without a raise since December 2000, and are among the city's lowest-paid workers. They are not municipal workers, but their employers are heavily financed by the city, and their plight draws attention to the sorts of economic disparities that Mr. Bloomberg's opponents may seize on once the election draws closer.
 The negotiations with the teachers may become more complicated because a recent court decision declared that the city was entitled to more state education funds from Albany. The teachers, naturally, feel that part of any increase in funds should end up in their paychecks. This is not lost on the administration. ''That is a real issue,'' one official said.
 Mr. Bloomberg, who takes pains not to attack his adversaries publicly, has derided unions either gently, by suggesting that they stop protesting and start bargaining, or more pointedly, as he often does with Mr. Lynch, the police union official with whom he has a deeply frosty relationship. 
 ''We have gone from a cold war to hot war,'' said Randi Weingarten, the president of the teachers' union, who said Tuesday's protest was the largest gathering of union members at City Hall in recent memory, something that political experts and Bloomberg officials do not dispute.
 ''There is some talk about his wealth,'' she said. ''But John F. Kennedy certainly was wealthy, but there was a connect there with the people. I have no idea why Mayor Bloomberg doesn't have that.''
 Edward Skyler, the mayor's press secretary, said the mayor was not concerned with union leaders waging a class-based attack. ''The public is going to judge the mayor on his record, not on somebody's else's rhetoric,'' he said.
 Many labor leaders have been extremely frustrated by their inability to influence Mr. Bloomberg at the bargaining table with a promise of an endorsement in 2005, administration and union officials said. Mr. Bloomberg squeaked to victory in 2001 with just a single union backing him.
 The mayor does have a better relationship with the private-sector unions, like the union that represents hotel and restaurant workers and construction trade groups.
 ''Initially our relationship was not that good,'' said Edward J. Malloy, president of the Building Construction Trades Council, but, he added, there are ''a lot of projects slated for the West Side, which brings in a lot of tax revenue that supplements the operational budget of the city and benefits all city workers.''

HEADLINE: Bloomberg's Approval Rating Is Up, Poll Shows

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
Half of New York City voters approve of the way Michael R. Bloomberg is handling his job, the mayor's highest rating in two years, according to a new poll.
 The Quinnipiac University poll of 1,226 registered voters found that 50 percent approved of Mr. 
Bloomberg's performance and 38 percent disapproved. That is an improvement in his approval rating of 3 percentage points since March and 19 points since last July, when the same poll found that 60 percent of voters disapproved of his performance.
 ''Mayor Bloomberg has been on a steady climb back to the approval numbers he enjoyed when he was the new guy in City Hall,'' said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute.
 The poll, conducted last week, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. It also showed that Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican, continues to lag in support among blacks and Hispanics, although his numbers there are improving. His approval rating was 60 percent among whites, 38 percent among blacks and 39 percent among Hispanics.
 The low point in Mr. Bloomberg's approval ratings was last July, which coincided with a city budget crisis that resulted in an 18.5 percent property tax increase and deep spending cuts. This year, the mayor has benefited from an improving economy, a falling crime rate and wide support of his proposed $400 property tax rebate for homeowners.
 Pollsters also found that Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire, continues to suffer from the impression that he cannot relate to average New Yorkers. Fifty-two percent of voters said they do not believe he cares about their needs and problems.
 Edward Skyler, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, said the overall poll results showed that ''the mayor is leading the city in the right direction.''

PERSON: Earle I. Mack

HEADLINE: For Developer With Arts Habit, On to Diplomacy

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES

 BODY:
AMONG the Bush campaign's big contributors, Earle I. Mack may be one of only a few who subscribe to the left-leaning Harper's Magazine and enjoy the assaults on the administration by its editor, Lewis H. Lapham.
 ''Many of things he writes I don't agree with,'' Mr. Mack said, seated in his Manhattan living room. ''But he is very funny and humorous. He is quick and amusing.'' 
 And here is the conundrum that is Earle Mack. Although he is a developer who has used his money and influence to help Republican politicians, he seeks out the company of people who sometimes have an uneasy relationship with conservatives and businessmen: artists, performers and writers.
 Mr. Mack, 67, has been active in promoting the arts in New York State, and he spoke of hanging out when he was younger at Elaine's, the Upper East Side literary haunt. But asked why he gravitated to a world that was not his own, he bristled.
 ''Arts and culture are my world,'' he said. ''I feel at home among the intellects of writers and directors.''
 Mr. Mack's world will grow even larger today, when he is scheduled to present his credentials as the new ambassador to Finland, at a ceremony in that country. The job is a political appointment for Mr. Mack, who has given several hundred thousand dollars to President Bush and the Republican Party. 
 Mr. Mack recently gained attention after he flew Gov. George E. Pataki and his wife to the Caribbean on his private jet in November, a trip that drew scrutiny because Mr. Mack does business with the state. The governor said he had reimbursed Mr. Mack, but his office has refused to release documents detailing how much he paid. The governor is required under the state ethics law to pay Mr. Mack for the cost of two first-class airline tickets, and the state Ethics Commission said Mr. Pataki had followed the reimbursement rules. 
 Mr. Mack is a major shareholder of the Mack-Cali Realty Corporation. In December, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, whose board is appointed by the two states' governors, approved a rail link that benefits the $1.3 billion entertainment complex in the New Jersey Meadowlands that Mack-Cali is helping develop. 
 Mr. Mack deflected questions about his business and politics, and he prefers to remain behind the scenes. Still, his name appears occasionally in society columns or in thoroughbred horse-racing news. He has horses in New York, Kentucky, Europe and South America -- though when asked how many he owns, he dismissed the question with a terse ''I haven't counted recently.''
 Mr. Mack grew up amid wealth and privilege. His grandfather, Philip Mack, who immigrated from Russia at the turn of the 20th century, founded a construction and demolition company. Mr. Mack's father, H. Bert Mack, expanded the business, carrying out huge demolitions in Manhattan that cleared the way for buildings like the United Nations headquarters.
 While he attended Drexel University, Mr. Mack worked summers for his father in the lumber yards or on construction jobs. Later, he took a job in the business before he and his three brothers built the Mack Company, amassing a huge empire in commercial and industrial development in New Jersey and New York. The company merged with Cali Realty Group in 1997 to form the Mack-Cali Realty Corporation, which has a market capitalization of nearly $5 billion.
 Mr. Mack's long involvement with conservative causes includes support for the Likud Party in Israel. He is chairman emeritus of Cardozo Law School, where he played host last fall to Israel's former prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
 BUT much of Mr. Mack's clout has been used on behalf of culture. He has served on the boards of several dance companies, and from 1996 to 1999, he was chairman of the New York State Council on the Arts, helping win budget increases for the arts. ''It was a tough fiscal period, and I had to make the compelling argument that arts are an engine for economic growth,'' he said.
 ''I have always had a great love for creativity, but I had a knack for business.'' he added. ''I love music. I love the creativity in filmmaking. I have always recognized the creative elements of great directors.''
 He produced and co-directed a 1977 documentary about ballet called ''The Children of Theater Street,'' which was nominated for an Oscar. In 2001, he helped produce a Broadway revival of ''Judgment at Nuremberg'' with the National Actors Theater.
 ''This is psychic income for me,'' he said. ''I feel I am doing the right thing.''
 Mr. Mack spent two weeks at the State Department recently, taking a kind of Ambassador 101 course for political appointees. His wife, Carol, and their two children, Beatrice, 11, and Andrew, 13, will move with him to Finland. Since his confirmation last month as ambassador, he has been meeting with Finnish diplomats in Washington and New York, as well as ''looking at the issues, the geography and studying the habits and traits of the people.'' On the lapel of his suit coat was a pin linking the American and Finnish flags. 
 He will find, diplomats at the Finnish Embassy in Washington said, that the Finnish public is overwhelmingly against the war in Iraq -- an issue Mr. Mack dodged with diplomatic tact.
 ''We share common goals in business, culture and the arts,'' he said.

HEADLINE: World Leaders Get a Glimpse of America's High Life

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: SEA ISLAND, Ga., June 9 

 BODY:
Ronald Reagan wanted to show off America's colonial traditions, so he held the 1983 summit meeting of leading industrial nations in Williamsburg, Va., on the streets Jefferson once walked. Seven years later, George H.W. Bush took his counterparts to noisy Houston, and Bill Clinton tried Denver to give the world a mile-high view of the booming American West and American Indian tradition.
 But when President Bush needed a place to repair alliances that have been strained to the maximum degree, he chose this playground of the Southern rich, with its glorious ''cottages'' and expensive golf resorts. Sea Island is part of a chain of barrier islands with a rich history as a place where freed slaves established themselves as landowners after the Civil War. These days it is not much of a place to experience average America, but it is a fine locale to shut out the rest of the world, view conspicuous architectural consumption and walk beaches that have little or no public access. 
 The islands also gave birth to Gullah, the English dialect developed by African slaves, and at the opening dinner on Tuesday night, a group of Sea Island singers entertained the leaders in that rapidly vanishing language.
 It may be hot and steamy, but the place runs deep in the hearts of the Bush family. President Bush, making small talk with a reporter on Wednesday as he waited for the arrival of leaders from the Middle East and Turkey, said he had never been here before but that his mother and father had. ''Honeymoon,'' he said, smiling, adding that he thought they had been back since. And it was the perfect place for Mr. Bush to take his new 21-gear mountain bike with ''the wide tires,'' he reported after an early morning spin around the golf course. (''Good way to get the heart rate up,'' he said.)
 Politicos could argue that any place that oozes privilege, elitism and championship golf should be avoided during an election year. But what is good for honeymoons turned out to be good for security. The Secret Service shut down the entire island, erecting fences by the causeway, patrolling the coast with Navy and Coast Guard vessels and keeping military jets overhead. Residents were allowed to stay as long as they got security-clearance cards, but the abundance of fabulous summer homes meant plenty of places to rent for leaders, staff members and even reporters. 
 A confession: the print ''pool'' reporters -- one from a newspaper, one from a magazine -- luxuriated in their own seven-bedroom house, fully equipped with a formal library, a sunroom with a jukebox, and, true to their duty, a small pool.
 Re-elected or not, this is Mr. Bush's one and only opportunity to act as host; America's turn does not come around again for another eight years.

Limited Horsepower
 If environmentalists could have gotten onto Sea Island this week -- and they couldn't -- their hearts might have been warmed by sight of the world's most powerful leaders tooling around in nonpolluting golf carts. In fact, this was the golf cart summit meeting.
 When President Bush stood at the entrance of the local beach club on Wednesday to greet the leaders, there were no motorcades of bulletproof black limousines. Instead, most of the leaders drove past the manicured lawns in their own little carts, popping out to shake hands. But there were definite stylistic differences.
 Mr. Bush seemed to love cruising about in a red-white-and-blue number, one that his staff boasted could hit 25 miles an hour. Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany, eager throughout this meeting to repair a wounded relationship, was another cart enthusiast, with a golf shirt to match. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain rode for a while, then walked.
 But the picture of the day came after lunch with Middle Eastern leaders. Mr. Bush bundled the new president of Iraq, Ghazi Ajil al-Yawar, into his high-speed cart and zipped off, the sheik's headdress flying in the wind. Mr. Bush was waving to the photographers, clearly enjoying the freedom. The new Iraqi president was holding on for dear life, a metaphor, one administration official later acknowledged, for his new job.

Flirtation with Openness
 When it comes to journalists, the Bush administration does not have an open-door policy. White House reporters frequently despair of having their telephone calls returned by administration officials, senior or otherwise, and arranging sit-down interviews with crucial policy makers can require lengthy negotiation. On trips outside of Washington, reporters can go days without setting eyes on any of Mr. Bush's top aides, who keep well away from anyone who might ask an awkward or even routine question.
 So imagine the surprise of the White House press corps when it arrived in Georgia for the summit meeting and found that the administration was offering up a veritable buffet of officials for interviews. By e-mail, reporters were invited to go online to request interviews with many of the administration's most senior policy makers.
 To some degree, the White House delivered. John R. Bolton, the under secretary of state for arms control and international security, gave interviews to many news organizations, and Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, gave some television interviews. All five television networks carried interviews on Wednesday morning with Laura Bush. Alas, a number of the other officials appeared before reporters only on the condition, imposed by the White House, that they not be identified by name. Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, never appeared before the vast majority of journalists, who never got any closer to the summit than the International Media Center in Savannah, 80 miles away, but he did stop by the White House press room on Sea Island, giving shoulder and neck massages to reporters.
 Naturally, correspondents more accustomed to the brush-off than a massage, viewed the outbreak of openness with skepticism if not cynicism. Asked at a news briefing if the officials were being made available because it was a good moment for Mr. Bush on Iraq, Jim Wilkinson, the head of communications for the National Security Council, replied, ''We're a host of the summit, and we have thousands of reporters here, many from the international community, and we feel a special responsibility to try to ensure as much access as possible to as many reporters as possible, with subject-matter experts.''
 There was no word on whether that policy will be applied when Mr. Bush and his entourage return to Washington.

HEADLINE: Bush, on 'a Special Day,' Greets New Iraqi Leader

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: SEA ISLAND, Ga., June 9 

 BODY:
An emotional President Bush met Wednesday for the first time with the newly designated interim president of Iraq, Sheik Ghazi Ajil al-Yawar, telling him, ''I never thought I'd be sitting next to an Iraqi president of a free country a year and a half ago.''
 Mr. Bush said it was a ''special day'' for him, and after 15 months in which Americans have been fighting and dying in Iraq, it provided a powerful moment of symbolism for him to sit side by side, before the United States and the world, with the man who now holds a title last held by Saddam Hussein.
 ''I'm glad you're here,'' Mr. Bush said to President Yawar, who replied by thanking the president and the American people ''for the sacrifices of the brave men and women of the United States'' in deposing Mr. Hussein. 
 ''We're determined to have a free, democratic, federal Iraq, a country that is a source of stability to the Middle East, which is very important for the rest of the world,'' President Yawar said.
 The meeting came during a gathering of leaders from the eight big industrial and military powers here, which Mr. Bush hoped to turn into a celebration of Iraq's return to the fold of the international community. 
 But only a day after the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously for a new resolution backing a transfer of sovereignty to Iraq, the administration was confronting threats by the Kurds in the north of the country to withdraw from the Iraqi state in a dispute over what law would govern the nation after June 30. And Mr. Bush's hopes of encouraging NATO to take a broader role in Iraq ran into stiff opposition here from President Jacques Chirac of France.
 In an effort to use the apparent progress in Iraq as a springboard to addressing the broader roots of terrorism, Mr. Bush had lunch at a golf resort here with the leaders of several Middle Eastern nations and Turkey, promoting a new plan to promote the development of democracy in the region. 
 Although leaders of some of the biggest and most influential Middle Eastern nations chose not to come here for the formal unveiling of the initiative, administration officials insisted they would eventually, if reluctantly, join with Mr. Bush's efforts to use the establishment of a new government in Iraq to change the political culture of the region. 
 During a busy day of meetings, ceremony and high-level socializing in this exclusive beach resort, Mr. Bush, Mr. Chirac and their counterparts from Britain, Germany, Russia, Italy, Canada and Japan also called for a new push for a world trade agreement. 
 They agreed on a one-year moratorium on the international sale of nuclear technology that could be used to produce fuel for a bomb, and said they ''deplore'' Iran's unwillingness to cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency's investigations of its nuclear program. With an eye on two emerging economic powerhouses, they discussed whether to expand what is now the Group of Eight nations by inviting China and India to join.
 The atmosphere was generally cordial and the leaders appeared genuinely intent on leaving their divisions over Iraq behind them. But there were flashes of tension. A day after American officials suggested that Europe still had a lot of work to do in helping to ensure a rebound in the world economy, Mr. Chirac pointedly noted that among the biggest economic risks facing the world were the big budget and trade deficits run up under Mr. Bush in the United States.
 Mr. Bush had never before met President Yawar, who was chosen for the post by the United Nations adviser for Iraq, Lakhdar Brahimi, with American assent. But from the moment he shook President Yawar's hand at lunch at a golf club here -- part of a broader meeting with Middle Eastern leaders, from Afghanistan to Bahrain to Jordan -- it was evident that Mr. Bush saw this as an emotional culmination of his 15-month-long venture in regime change. It is, as one of Mr. Bush's own senior aides conceded Wednesday, an experiment whose outcome is impossible to predict.
 ''The Iraqis are now about to have sovereignty,'' the official said after sitting in on the meeting. ''One thing we have to do is step back and let Iraqis solve some of these problems on their own.''
 First among them is a dispute over whether the transitional administrative law -- a temporary constitution -- will apply after June 30. Mr. Bush's senior aide indicated, with little conviction, that it probably would. But the official noted: ''You'll see a lot of ups and downs about what the structure will look like. I would not be surprised if there is some drama.''
 The drama continued here, among fractious allies trying their hardest to show some measure of solidarity. There were clear differences over the role of NATO in Iraq at a time when Mr. Bush is under pressure at home from, among others, Senator John Kerry, his presumptive Democratic opponent in the presidential race, to show some progress in encouraging other nations to take up more of the military burden in Iraq.
 For the last week, administration officials have played down the possibility that European nations would agree to send more troops, either on their own or through NATO. But after having breakfast with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, Mr. Bush said Wednesday that he was hopeful of expanding NATO's current role in Iraq somewhat.
 ''A lot of NATO countries are not in a position to commit any more troops -- we fully understand that,'' Mr. Bush said. ''But I do think NATO ought to stay involved, and I think we have a good chance of getting that done.''
 But Mr. Chirac said later that it was not part of NATO's mission to be in Iraq, and he said he had reservations about using NATO to support the multinational force there unless it was requested to do so by the Iraqi government.
 ''I don't think it's part of NATO's role to intervene in Iraq,'' Mr. Chirac told reporters. ''Nor do I have the feeling that it would be appropriate or well understood.''
 Of the 26 NATO members, 15 have sent troops to Iraq, and NATO provides support services for Poland's troops there. The United States continued to press other nations to agree to a substantial reduction in Iraq's debt, but got no firm commitments from the other G-8 members, some of whom are also pushing for stepped-up debt relief for African and other poor countries.
 The statement by the leaders on encouraging democracy in the Middle East also reflected unease among some European leaders that the G-8 should not be seen as lecturing Middle Eastern countries or losing sight of the importance of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
 The final document included a statement that resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was an important requirement for progress, but also a statement, sought by the United States, that ''regional conflicts must not be an obstacle for reforms.'' One senior official said the document had undergone major changes, but rejected the notion that the American proposal was watered down. ''There were just lots and lots of words added'' by the Europeans, he said, about the need to address the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.
 The final statement included the phrase that each nation ''will reach its own conclusions about the pace and scope of change,'' but emphasized that ''distinctiveness, important as it is, must not be exploited to prevent reform.''
 In an effort to ensure that the effort does not wither away, the G-8 plan called for the creation of a ''Forum for the Future,'' an organization that will bring the nations of the region and the G-8 countries together for regular discussions about their progress and meetings with business leaders and nongovernmental pressure groups. The first meeting will be this fall, the statement said.
 The harsh wording about Iran's nuclear program reflected a growing disenchantment among Germany, France and other European states, officials said, about what Iran might be hiding from international inspectors. Mr. Bush is trying to form a solid core of nations to confront Iran at a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency next week. Last week, Russia -- a supplier of nuclear technology to Iran -- agreed to become a member of Mr. Bush's year-old Proliferation Security Initiative, a loose grouping of nations that have agreed to intercept illegal shipments of chemical, biological or nuclear materials, and administration officials promoted that as a way of hemming in Iran and North Korea.
 The one-year moratorium on shipments of nuclear technology to countries that do not now reprocess plutonium or enrich uranium amounts to a holding action while Mr. Bush seeks to negotiate new limits on the spread of such technology. But he wants to do so without renegotiating the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, a step one of his senior aides said would lead to a ''quagmire.''

HEADLINE: White House Shuns Role on Textile Quotas

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9 

 BODY:
More than 130 Republican and Democratic members of Congress asked President Bush on Wednesday to persuade the World Trade Organization to delay the phase-out of a global quota system on textiles and garments.
 The administration swiftly rejected the request, which would mean breaking a 10-year-old global agreement to end the quotas on Jan. 1, 2005.
 Ending the quotas could lead to a wide-ranging realignment of the industry and spell disaster for textile and apparel industries in dozens of nations, including those in the United States, according to officials of the American textile and apparel manufacturing industry.
 Textile industries that were established in poor countries to take advantage of special quotas given by the United States or Europe are among those that the officials said would be threatened by the loss of special access to those huge markets. 
 Industry officials said that China and India could swamp the global market once quotas are lifted, destroying as many as 30 million jobs around the world and putting some of the world's poorest nations at risk. 
 In a letter to Mr. Bush, the 29 senators and 88 members of the House pointed to China as the biggest threat, accusing it of ''unfair trade practices to heavily subsidize its exports.''
 ''The U.S. textile sector, still the largest manufacturing employer in the United States, stands to lose almost 650,000 jobs,'' the letter stated.
 But neither the W.T.O. nor the administration has endorsed the idea of revisiting the quota issue, and no country has agreed to raise it at the W.T.O.
 The agreement to end the quotas was reached at the 1994 round of global trade talks in Uruguay and administration officials have pointed out that the developing nations asked for relief from the textile quotas during those talks.
 Christopher Padilla, a spokesman for the office of the United States trade representative, said that the ''United States will abide by its international obligations that were negotiated more than a decade ago to phase out remaining textile and apparel quotas at the end of the year.''
 Instead of fighting the quotas, the administration has been helping prepare the American industry for the new competition once the quotas are removed, Mr. Padilla said.
 Recent bilateral and regional trade agreements have required nations to use American yarn and fabric if they want the benefit of duty-free access to the market in the United States. 
 But a new international coalition of textile and apparel industries and labor associations from 45 countries is asking the World Trade Organization to hold an emergency session next month to delay lifting the quotas. 
 Developing nations as diverse as Bangladesh, Mexico and Turkey are scrambling to devise some strategy that would preserve their textile industry without running afoul of global trade rules.
 ''We need fair trade so the global economy can be disciplined,'' Ziya Sukun, a representative of the Turkish textile and garment exports associations, said in a telephone news conference on Wednesday with American industry representatives. 
 ''This is not protectionism but a fight against a monopoly by China,'' he said.
 Mr. Sukun and lawmakers in the United States complained that China's unfair practices included currency manipulation, direct state subsidies and rebates on export taxes. 
 Brenda A. Jacobs, the Washington trade counsel for the United States association of importers of textile and apparel, said that the predictions of disaster were greatly exaggerated.
 ''China is not going to take over; that is a gross overstatement,'' Ms. Jacobs said. ''Some people are afraid of competition but the fact is they have had 10 years to adjust.''
 A coalition of American, Canadian and European retailing, importing and consumer associations -- called the Group of 18 -- is campaigning against any extension of the textile quotas and against a special global trading session.
 ''The end of textile and apparel quotas was an essential concession by the developed countries to the developing countries, clearly providing the justification for developing countries to accept new international rules and disciplines,'' the group said. ''Efforts now to disregard this grand bargain raise grave concerns about the future of the international trading system.''

HEADLINE: BUSH BACKS OFF RULE THAT EASED PHONE LINE FEES

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9 

 BODY:
In a move that critics say could lead to higher telephone rates, the Bush administration on Wednesday sided with the four regional Bell companies in a court case over the fees they charge their rivals for access to their networks.
 The administration's decision, which could affect the phone bills of nearly 50 million customers across the country, was a significant policy reversal in a case making its way to the Supreme Court.
 Justices are being asked to review an appeals court decision that struck down a set of regulations requiring the Bell companies -- Verizon, SBC Communications, BellSouth and Qwest Communications -- to make their networks available to rivals at heavy discounts. The appeals court decision will take effect next week unless the Supreme Court intervenes. 
 The solicitor general, on instructions from the White House, dropped out of the case on Wednesday after unsuccessfully trying to defend the regulations in the appeals court. The decision substantially reduces the chances that the Supreme Court will accept the appeal, particularly because the Federal Communications Commission, which had been pressured by the administration, also reversed course and said it had decided not to pursue an appeal either.
 Both sides in the matter agree that if the Supreme Court does not alter the appeals decision, a central element of the landmark Telecommunications Act of 1996 will effectively be repealed. The act requires the Bell companies, which have long been criticized for holding near-monopoly positions in local markets, to make valuable pieces of their networks available at low rates to both small and large rivals, enabling them to offer cheaper service than they otherwise might.
 It is a matter of debate how much the decision will affect phone rates in a rapidly changing market where prices have fallen sharply in recent years, in part because of increased competition but also because of new technology that allows cheaper phone service.
 Mark Cooper, research director of the Consumer Federation of America, said that the elimination of the regulations could ultimately lead to higher rates for 19 million consumers who get phone service from competitors to the Bells and an additional 30 million who have discounts from the Bells in response to competition.
 The rivals of the Bells -- notably AT&T and MCI -- joined in denouncing Wednesday's decision. They said that if the Supreme Court did not extend the regulations and hear the appeal, there would be higher telephone rates in local markets beginning later this year or in 2005. 
 ''The results of this decision will be especially harmful,'' said James W. Cicconi, general counsel at AT&T. ''Failure to appeal this case could do lasting damage to the entire competitive telecom industry -- and will lead inevitably to higher prices and fewer choices for Americans.''
 MCI issued a similar statement and indicated that the decision might ultimately force it to pull out of some markets.
 The Bell companies counter that the local markets are significantly more competitive than when the regulations were adopted and that the plans by many different companies to offer telephone service over the Internet will help keep costs down.
 Although the Bells said they had no intention of immediately raising the wholesale rates they charge other telephone companies for access to networks, they indicated they could impose increases by the end of the year. They maintained, however, that their largest competitors in the local marketplace -- AT&T and MCI -- could easily absorb such increases.
 ''I read the AT&T press release and it is completely unfounded,'' said James D. Ellis, general counsel at SBC Communications. ''You talk about crying wolf and inciting people. What they said is completely unfounded.''
 Mr. Ellis said that AT&T had been able to reap high profit margins by making use of the Bell networks cheaply, and thus could handle what he called modest increases in the wholesale rates it would be charged by SBC and the other Bell companies. AT&T executives disputed his contention.
 The administration's announcement followed fierce lobbying and aggressive tactics; each side has raised millions of dollars in campaign contributions for the president and the Republican Party. Before the decision, rivals of the Bells said they had told the administration that if it did not side with them in the dispute they intended to run television advertisements in swing political states accusing the White House of being responsible for higher telephone rates. For their part, the Bell companies pledged not to raise rates before the election in November.
 Government officials and industry executives with close ties to the administration said that President Bush received sharply conflicting advice from his aides. They said that senior White House economic advisers had urged Mr. Bush to drop the case because the local markets were adequately competitive, while the political advisers, including Karl Rove, had recommended that the administration file an appeal to the Supreme Court.
 A few hours after the announcement, the F.C.C. indicated that it would not appeal the decision either. In March, three of its five commissioners said that they would vote to instruct the agency's general counsel to file an appeal with the Supreme Court.
 But the lone Republican in the majority, Kevin J. Martin, issued a statement late Wednesday afternoon saying he had changed his mind.
 ''Because the solicitor general decided not to support the F.C.C.'s appeal, I no longer support appealing the D.C. Circuit's decision,'' Mr. Martin said.
 Mr. Martin, a Republican who is a former White House official and whose wife works for Vice President Dick Cheney, did not return a telephone call Wednesday seeking comment. Last year, he broke ranks with the agency's chairman, Michael K. Powell, and its other Republican commissioner, Kathleen Q. Abernathy, over the phone rate regulations, supporting the rivals of the Bells. 
 The companies and state regulators that lost the case at the appeals court have until the end of June to file their appeal with the Supreme Court. They have indicated their intention to petition Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist this week to block the order that strikes down the regulations next Tuesday.
 The regional Bell companies, which for years have fought in the courts and Congress to repeal the rules, said that the elimination of what they consider an onerous pricing structure will prompt them to pour additional capital investments into their networks, which could improve service and extend it to underserved areas.
 ''In addition, we have offered our wholesale customers an opportunity to lock in today's rates until the end of the year and set stable rates through 2007 by negotiating and signing a new long-term agreement with us,'' said Herschel Abbott, a top lobbyist at BellSouth.
 But some senior Republicans and Democrats in Congress attacked the announcement, as did Michael J. Copps, a Democratic member of the F.C.C.

HEADLINE: Favoring Tax Cuts and Tolerating Deficits

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9 

 BODY:
In domestic policy, President Ronald Reagan's most lasting legacy is the philosophy dominant in the White House today that tax cuts are the proper tonic for whatever ails the economy and that large budget deficits are not necessarily harmful.
 But one of the guiding principles of Mr. Reagan's tax policy, simplifying the tax code by eliminating narrow tax breaks, was abandoned by subsequent presidents of both parties who preferred to use tax preferences to meet various social and economic goals and satisfy special interests.
 In his 1980 campaign, Mr. Reagan promised to reduce taxes, increase military spending and balance the budget mostly by eliminating waste, fraud and abuse in the government. 
 The first two promises were achieved in his first term. In 1981, Congress approved a 25 percent reduction in income taxes and an increase of at least one-third in the military budget.
 But while some government programs were eliminated and nonmilitry spending was reduced modestly, those steps were much too feeble to offset the lower revenues and additional military expenses. 
 The federal deficit grew to $208 billion in the 1983 fiscal year, Mr. Reagan's second budget year, from $79 billion in the 1981 fiscal year, the last year the government operated under a budget prepared by President Jimmy Carter. As a percentage of the national economy, the deficit in 1983 was 6 percent, the highest ever, up from 2.6 percent in 1981.
 The large deficits were antithetical to Mr. Reagan's view of himself as a fiscal conservative, and he never seemed completely reconciled to them. He signed tax increases later in his first term that repealed more than one-third of the 1981 tax cuts. But the lesson the Republicans in power today took from the Reagan experience was that they could disregard deficits. President Bush's first treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, reported in his book, ''The Price of Loyalty,'' that at a crucial budget meeting, Vice President Dick Cheney brushed off a question about the deficit by saying, ''Reagan proved deficits don't matter.''
 Representative Jim Nussle, Republican of Iowa, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said he did not agree that deficits were unimportant. But he said the ''basic playbook'' on budget and taxes was written by Mr. Reagan, and ''that is the playbook I follow today.''
 Another lesson the current administration took from the Reagan years is that it can be politically advantageous to publish budgets with numbers that are less than fully honest.
 Under Mr. Reagan, said Robert D. Reischauer, the economist who was director of the Congressional Budget Office from 1987 to 1995, the Office of Management and Budget ''ceased to be viewed as an objective estimator of budget numbers.'' That is also the case today, Mr. Reischauer said. 
 The budgets prepared by David A. Stockman, Mr. Reagan's first budget director, adopted what was called a ''rosy scenario'' -- impossibly optimistic predictions about future growth, inflation and interest rates. They also included what was called the ''magic asterisk'' -- a gimmick that allowed for the budgeting of unspecified, and never intended, spending cuts.
 Both techniques allowed the budgets that were submitted by the White House to Congress in January or February to show lower deficits than what was probable.
 Mr. Bush has taken a different tack, but the result has been the same: an unrealistic budget. The budget Mr. Bush submitted in February projected a deficit of $521 billion, perhaps $100 billion higher than what economists are now estimating. As the election approaches, the administration may be able to forecast a lower deficit than was assumed in February and proclaim that the deficit is being brought under control.
 The administration's budget also does not take account of the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 But while the Reagan budget policies have survived into the Bush administration, one of the main aspects of his tax policy went by the boards long ago.
 In 1985 and 1986, Mr. Reagan pushed through Congress a complete overhaul of the federal income tax system, the most sweeping changes in the tax code and one of the most important pieces of legislation since World War II.
 The underlying principle of the measure was that tax rates should be set as low as possible and the tax base made as broad as possible by eliminating deductions, credits and other tax breaks.
 With the enactment of the legislation, the top tax rate was lowered to 33 percent from 70 percent when Mr. Reagan took office. And scores of tax preferences were abolished, ranging from the deduction for state sales taxes paid by individuals to the investment tax credit for manufacturers to tax shelters for investors in commercial real estate. 
 The bill was heralded by economists and tax policy experts across the political spectrum.
 But what the academic authorities loved, the politicians quickly spurned as soon as Mr. Reagan left office. Presidents and lawmakers cannot resist using tax breaks to reward favored interest groups and to accomplish social goals without seeming to spend money.
 In that vein, President Bill Clinton endorsed many new tax breaks, including a tax credit for child care, another one for employers who hire people on welfare and tax-free retirement savings accounts, and as a deficit-reduction measure, he allowed the top tax rate to rise to 40 percent.
 President Bush has sought scores of new tax breaks, including those for charitable contributions, residential rental property, transfer expenses for children in failing schools, health savings accounts, individual investment accounts, development of low-cost single-family housing and land conservation.
 In the area of energy policy alone, he has proposed at least seven new tax credits.
 Still, C. Eugene Steuerle, a Treasury official under Mr. Reagan who helped draft the legislation overhauling the tax code, said he thought the lower rates ushered in by Mr. Reagan had become a permanent fixture of the economy.
 Since Mr. Reagan left office, Mr. Steuerle said, ''We have been debating whether the top rate should be 33 percent or 35 percent or 40 percent. It's really unlikely we'll ever go back to 70 percent.''

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Ronald Reagan's legacy on budgets and taxes misidentified the author of the book ''The Price of Loyalty,'' in which Paul H. O'Neill, President Bush's first Treasury secretary, was quoted as attributing to Vice President Dick Cheney the comment ''Reagan proved deficits don't matter.'' The book was by Ron Suskind, not by Mr. O'Neill.

HEADLINE: Two Said to Tell Of Libyan Plot Against Saudi

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9 

 BODY:
While the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, was renouncing terrorism and negotiating the lifting of sanctions last year, his intelligence chiefs ordered a covert operation to assassinate the ruler of Saudi Arabia and destabilize the oil-rich kingdom, according to statements by two participants in the conspiracy. 
 Those participants, Abdurahman Alamoudi, an American Muslim leader now in jail in Alexandria, Va., and Col. Mohamed Ismael, a Libyan intelligence officer in Saudi custody, have given separate statements to American and Saudi officials outlining the plot.
 Mr. Alamoudi, has told Federal Bureau of Investigation officials and federal prosecutors that Colonel Qaddafi approved the assassination plan. Mr. Qaddafi's son, in an interview in London, called the accusation ''nonsense.'' 
 American officials confirm that Mr. Alamoudi and Mr. Ismael have offered detailed accounts of a Libyan plot to assassinate Crown Prince Abdullah and that they appear to be credible enough to have launched an American investigation. But the officials said they are still examining the scope of the plot, how far it advanced and whether Colonel Qaddafi was involved. They said the accusations were one reason the United States had not removed Libya from the State Department's list of nations that support terrorism. 
 On Wednesday, a senior administration official said: ''We are fully aware of Libya's significant past involvement with terrorism. Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi has pledged to end Libya's ties with terrorism and cooperate with the United States and our allies in the war on terrorism. We continue to monitor closely Libya's adherence to this pledge.''
 As a revolutionary who overthrew a monarchy, Colonel Qaddafi has long regarded the Saudi royal family with a degree of contempt. The feeling was often mutual as he charted an erratic course in the Middle East. In recent years, however, Saudi and British diplomats worked behind the scenes to help Libya negotiate an end to sanctions resulting from the Libyan terrorist operation that downed Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988. 
 Mr. Alamoudi's statements were offered in plea negotiations with federal prosecutors that are not complete. He was indicted last October in the United States District Court in Alexandria accused of violating United States sanctions by traveling to Libya and receiving money from Libyan officials.
 Under federal guidelines, prosecutors could urge a judge to reduce his prison term in exchange for his statements, criminal lawyers said. 
 The statements of the two conspirators were described by three people with extensive official knowledge of the case who insisted that they not be identified because information about it remains classified in intelligence and law enforcement channels. Senior officials in the American, British and Saudi governments have been aware of the investigation of the assassination plot for several months. 
 Colonel Qaddafi and Crown Prince Abdullah clashed at the Arab summit meeting that immediately preceded the war in Iraq. The two leaders exchanged insults in open session, accusing each other of selling out to colonial powers. An indignant Prince Abdullah glared at Colonel Qaddafi and said, ''Your lies precede you and your grave is in front of you.''
 A Libyan terrorist plot, if verified by American, British and Saudi governments who are working in close coordination to investigate it, would undermine Colonel Qaddafi's public pledges that his government has abandoned terrorism. It could also trigger a reinstatement of international sanctions on Libya that were lifted by the United Nations Security Council last September after Colonel Qaddafi's government renounced terrorism, admitted responsibility for the 1988 Pan Am 103 bombing and agreed to pay $10 million compensation to the families. 
 A senior Bush administration official said that the emergence of convincing evidence that Colonel Qaddafi ordered or condoned an assassination and terror campaign could cause a ''180 degree'' change of American policy toward Libya. 
 President Bush has conveyed to the Saudi royal family that he is going to find out what happened in the alleged conspiracy, according to a diplomat.
 Mr. Alamoudi has told prosecutors that he twice met with Colonel Qaddafi, in June and August of 2003, to discuss details of the assassination plan, according to people with official access to his statements. In June, Mr. Alamoudi said, Colonel Qaddafi told him, ''I want the Crown Prince killed either through assassination or through a coup.'' By August, according to Mr. Alamoudi's account, Colonel Qaddafi asked why he had not yet seen ''heads flying'' in the Saudi royal family.
 Mr. Alamoudi's account is critical for federal prosecutors because it ties the terrorist plot that has been said to exist to a head of state. For that reason, Mr. Alamoudi has been questioned in great detail about his two meetings with Colonel Qaddafi, including descriptions of the Libyan leader's farm in Sidra, where they reportedly met in June, and of Colonel Qaddafi's office in Tripoli, where they reportedly met in August.
 F.B.I. investigators from the Washington field office are trying to arrange meetings with two of Mr. Alamoudi's associates to whom he confided details of the plot as further corroboration.
 The first person to provide Saudi, the British and American authorities with an account of a plot was Colonel Ismael, 36, who was captured by Egyptian police after he fled Saudi Arabia last November in an aborted ''drop'' of $1 million to a team of four Saudi militants who were prepared to attack Prince Abdullah's motorcade with shoulder-fired missiles or grenade launchers, according to his statements.
 Colonel Ismael has said that his orders to be operational commander of the plot came from Libyan intelligence chiefs, Abdullah Senoussi and Musa Kussa, both of whom report directly to Colonel Qaddafi, according to the people who described the statements.
 F.B.I. and Central Intelligence Agency officers have twice traveled to Saudi Arabia to interview Colonel Ismael. Investigators are said to believe that the account matches that of Mr. Alamoudi and that, taken together, the accounts could form the basis of a criminal indictment against Colonel Qaddafi on charges of leading a conspiracy that included an American citizen, Mr. Alamoudi.
 Mr. Kussa played a leading role last fall with American and British intelligence teams to work out a surrender of Libya's illicit weapons programs.
 F.B.I. officials have yet to interview the four Saudis who were to carry out the assassination attempt, but Saudi officials said that they would agree to make them available upon receiving a request. 
 The Saudis were arrested Nov. 27 as they prepared to receive $1 million in cash from Colonel Ismael and a team of Libyan intelligence officers at the Hilton Hotel in Mecca. The hotel overlooks the holiest shrine in Islam. Though two people with access to the statements of Mr. Alamoudi and Colonel Ismael said that the plan to attack Prince Abdullah was to strike his motorcade with armor-piercing missiles or rocket-propelled grenades, a third person said there was a suspicion that the four Saudis arrested in Mecca were going to fire their weapons at Prince Abdullah's apartment, also overlooking the shrine.
 In the reported conspiracy, Mr. Alamoudi and Colonel Ismael traveled to London seeking to make contacts among Saudi dissidents through whom they could recruit militants in the kingdom willing to participate in the plot. They distributed more than $2 million in cash in this recruitment drive in London, according to the account of their statements.
 Colonel Qaddafi's son, Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, described the reported plot as ''nonsense'' in an interview in London, though he acknowledged that the Libyan intelligence officer, Colonel Ismael, was missing and presumed by Libya to be in Saudi custody.
 ''I don't know exactly what he is saying in custody, but I can guarantee that nobody asked him to create cells and assassinate people,'' the young Mr. Qaddafi said. 
 Mr. Qaddafi said he could not say whether Colonel Ismael was an intelligence officer. ''I don't know in fact, but maybe yes and maybe no,'' he said. 
 Colonel Qaddafi also indicated that there may have been a ''misunderstanding'' over Libyan support for what he called ''reform'' in Saudi Arabia. 
 ''If we support the people who want to reform Saudi Arabia, if doesn't mean we are working against the government,'' he said.
 Mr. Alamoudi, an American citizen living in Falls Church, Va., has been a longtime spokesman for Muslim views in America as founder of the American Muslim Council. 
 The State Department paid him as a consultant to travel overseas and advocate tolerance and reconciliation among Jews, Christians and Muslims, but was thereafter accused of making statements in support of terrorism.
 A person close to Mr. Alamoudi said he believed that Mr. Alamoudi entered into the reported conspiracy because he badly needed money and did not believe that Colonel Qaddafi would carry out the plan to kill Prince Abdullah.
 The accusations present a difficult problem for Saudi Arabia, which has suffered a series of major terrorist attacks in the last year, the most recent of which left 22 people dead during a shooting spree by militants in Khobar on the Persian Gulf coast.
 Crown Prince Abdullah is said by two officials to be convinced that Colonel Qaddafi was out to kill him and decapitate the Saudi government. But the Saudi leader is also concerned about playing into the hands of American hardliners who might use the case to call for leadership change in Libya, a step that Saudi Arabia would oppose, officials said. 
 ''We are going to really jam Qaddafi over this, but there is no pretext for regime change,'' the Saudi official said. ''What is in our interest is to keep the caged animal in his cage.'' 
 Within weeks of the confrontation between Mr. Qaddafi and Crown Prince Abdullah at the Arab summit meeting last March, Mr. Senoussi, one of the Libyan intelligence chiefs, convened the first meeting to plan a campaign against the Saudis, the two participants said. 
 Present at the meeting was Mr. Alamoudi, who had been summoned from the United States by Mr. Senoussi. Mr. Alamoudi was paired with Colonel Ismael to start making money ''drops'' in London as part of what was generally described as a ''destabilization'' campaign, according to persons with access to Mr. Alamoudi's statement. 
 Mr. Senoussi's instruction remained vague during the initial phase, but when Mr. Alamoudi arrived at Colonel Qaddafi's farm at Sidra in June, the dimensions of the plot escalated greatly, according the people familiar with the statements. 
 Colonel Qaddafi asked Mr. Senoussi and a Libyan ambassador to leave the room so he could talk privately with Mr. Alamoudi. 
 ''Why do you cooperate with us against the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia?'' Colonel Qaddafi said, according to persons with access to Mr. Alamoudi's statement. 
 ''Because I disapprove of what the Crown Prince said to you,'' Mr. Alamoudi was reported to reply.
 After a number of large cash transfers, Mr. Alamoudi traveled to Tripoli in August and stated that, while there, he met again with Colonel Qaddafi. 
 ''How come I haven't seen anything? How come I have not seen heads flying?'' Colonel Qaddafi reportedly demanded?
 Mr. Alamoudi briefed him on how plans were progressing. 
 In early August, Mr. Alamoudi was arrested at Heathrow Airport carrying $340,000 in cash that he later said he had received from a Libyan intelligence officer. British officials confiscated the cash and interrogated Mr. Alamoudi, who said he had accepted the money from the World Islamic Call Society, a Libyan-backed charity. 
 Mr. Alamoudi boarded a flight from London to Washington Dulles airport in late September, he was arrested upon landing. 
 He was later indicted accused of violating United States sanctions by traveling to Libya and by receiving funds from Libyan officials. 
 Colonel Ismael has freely spoken about the plot, according to persons familiar with his statement. During one F.B.I. interrogation, he was asked whether he had been tortured or abused in detention. He replied that he had been treated well and that he wanted to apply for political asylum, because he assumed that if he returns to Libya, he will be killed, the people said.

HEADLINE: The Capital Pays Homage to 'a Graceful and a Gallant Man'

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 9 

 BODY:
To the thrum of muffled drums, the strains of solemn music and eulogies from the leaders of the Republican-run Congress he helped to create, the body of Ronald Wilson Reagan returned Wednesday evening to the capital he campaigned against so often, then did so much to reshape through two terms as president. 
 ''While others worried, President Reagan persevered,'' Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois told members of Congress, the Supreme Court, the diplomatic corps and invited guests in the Rotunda. ''When others weakened, President Reagan stood tall. When others stepped back, President Reagan stepped forward. And he did it all with great humility, with great charm and with great humor.''
 Vice President Dick Cheney recalled that Mr. Reagan had once said, ''There is no question I am an idealist, which is another way of saying I am an American.'' Mr. Cheney called Mr. Reagan ''a providential man who came along just when our nation and the world most needed him,'' adding, ''Fellow Americans, here lies a graceful and a gallant man.'' 
 At the end of the 45-minute service, as the Army's Brass Quintet played ''God Bless America,'' Mr. Reagan's widow, Nancy, ran her hand up and down the length of the coffin, then bent down toward it as if reluctant to leave, shaking her head sadly as Mr. Cheney approached to comfort her.
 Unlike John F. Kennedy, who was struck down in office, or Lyndon B. Johnson, whose body reposed in the Rotunda while the wounds of the Vietnam War were still raw, Mr. Reagan died at 93 after a decade with Alzheimer's disease and a rich life long enough to see the fruits of his dreams and policies, good or bad. 
 But the highly formal state funeral had all the same rituals of official mourning made so famous after Kennedy's assassination in 1963. Of the capital's top officials, only President Bush was absent, attending the economic summit of industrialized nations in Sea Island, Ga. Mr. Bush is scheduled to deliver a eulogy at the funeral service for Mr. Reagan in the National Cathedral on Friday. 
 Mr. Reagan's body arrived at Andrews Air Force Base right on schedule at 5 p.m., and by just after 6 p.m., the hearse carrying his coffin pulled up at the south end of the Ellipse between the White House and the Washington Monument. There, the coffin was transferred to a vintage 1918 horse-drawn caisson, accompanied by a riderless horse named Sergeant York, for the Tennessee pacifist who became one of the greatest heroes of World War I, with Mr. Reagan's own soft brown riding boots reversed in the stirrups in a sign of military mourning.
 Mrs. Reagan, looking tired and frail and holding oversized eyeglasses, briefly emerged from the motorcade to watch the transfer. The gathered crowd of spectators greeted her with cheers and applause, and she mouthed silent thanks in return.
 Pallbearers representing all the military services carried the coffin onto the caisson with quiet precision, sliding it onto the wagon-bed a single, side-stepping pace at a time.
 Then the procession rolled slowly down Constitution Avenue past the Smithsonian museums and the National Archives, finally ascending Capitol Hill to the grand West Front of the building facing the Mall, where Mr. Reagan first took the oath of office 23 years ago, breaking with long tradition that had placed such ceremonies on the East Front. The plaza facing the East Front is now inaccessible because of the construction of an underground visitors center.
 As the cortege approached the Capitol, 21 F-15 Eagle fighters -- led by a lone jet, then flights of four, the last of them with a man missing -- roared overhead. Then, as the caisson paused at the foot of the steps leading up the West Front, three howitzers thudded out a 21-gun salute as the band played ''Ruffles and Flourishes'' and ''Hail to the Chief,'' and finally a mournful rendition of ''The Battle Hymn of the Republic.''
 In all, the journey to the Rotunda was 116 steps, and the pallbearers switched out every two flights to share the coffin's 700-pound weight. Mrs. Reagan stood atop the stairs, gazing down with a sorrowful version of the loving look she so often gave her husband in life, then followed the coffin inside. There it was placed on the simple, velvet-covered wood catafalque first used at Abraham Lincoln's funeral in 1865, 180 feet below the concave ceiling of the Capitol's cast-iron dome.
 In a vivid sign of the intense anxiety over security, a little more than two hours before the service was to begin the entire Capitol and adjoining offices were hastily evacuated in what turned out to be a false alarm. The Federal Aviation Administration said a radio transmitter had malfunctioned on a Beech King aircraft belonging to the Kentucky State Police as it neared Washington airspace. The device is supposed to identify the craft to air controllers, but it failed intermittently, prompting a heightened alert.
 Capitol police officers, shouting ''Airborne threat, four minutes out!'' ordered an evacuation as loud alarms sounded, and dozens of dignitaries and former Reagan aides gathered in a reception room near the Senate floor went running down the north steps of the Senate wing. In dark suits and black dresses, mourners including former Attorney General Edwin Meese III, former Vice President Dan Quayle and Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the former ambassador to the United Nations, hustled into the muggy late afternoon sunshine, with men shucking their jackets and women under orders to remove high heels if they could not run in them.
 ''They came in screaming at us like you can't believe,'' said Margaret D. Tutwiler, the former State Department spokeswoman, who with the others returned to the building when the alert was lifted after several minutes. ''They said, 'you can't walk, you have to run.'''
 Before Mr. Reagan's body left California, more than 100,000 mourners filed past his coffin at the Reagan presidential library in Simi Valley. Mrs. Reagan and her children arrived at the library on Wednesday morning to begin a journey that took them from the rolling hills north of Los Angeles to the windy tarmac of the Naval Air Station at Point Mugu, and then aboard one of the blue-and-white Boeing 747's that normally serves President Bush as Air Force One for the flight to Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Maryland. 
 Along the Mall, from the Washington Monument to the West Front of the Capitol, crowds lined the street despite intense heat and humidity. 
 Carol Williams, 49, a professor at Strayer University from Chesterfield, Va., was first in the line of would-be mourners, waiting for the Rotunda to open after the evening's formal services. Ms. Williams arrived at the foot of the hill on the West Front at 5 a.m. Wednesday with her daughter, Melanie, 16, and her niece, Jessica, 18.
 ''I expected to be the 1,001st person in line if I was lucky,'' said Ms. Williams, who expressed relief that Mr. Reagan's death had diminished political bickering for at least a moment. ''They've put aside the rhetoric for two or three days,'' she said, adding, ''Ronald Reagan would want to remind the world -- Americans -- can we be Americans?''
 Mr. Reagan never served in Congress, of course, and his most frequent trips to the Capitol were to deliver his annual State of the Union Message in the House Chamber. But in 1985, after the outdoor ceremonies for his second inauguration were canceled in the face of a wind-chill factor of 50-degrees below zero, he took the public oath of office in the Rotunda, a day after being privately sworn in at the White House because Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, fell on a Sunday.
 ''We must act now,'' Mr. Reagan said then, ''to protect future generations from government's desire to spend its citizens' money and tax them into servitude when the bills come due. Let us make it unconstitutional for the federal government to spend more than the federal government takes in.''
 Congress never did pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, but by the late 1990's, a soaring economy and efforts at fiscal discipline by a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, produced a brief run of budget surpluses.
 It was in the Rotunda, too, where Mr. Reagan, in that same second Inauguration, spoke of American history, from Valley Forge to the Alamo to a settler who ''pushes west and sings a song.''
 ''It is the American sound,'' Mr. Reagan said in words recalled by Mr. Cheney on Wednesday night. ''It is hopeful, big-hearted, idealistic, daring, decent and fair. That's our heritage, that's our song. We sing it still. For all our problems, our differences, we are together as of old.''
 This day, at the heart of the government he once denounced as ''the problem'' in American life, Mr. Reagan was together with his friends and adversaries once more.
 Ted Stevens of Alaska, the Senate's senior Republican and third in the line of presidential succession, choked up as he evoked Mr. Reagan's farewell address on leaving office in 1989, declaring: ''As we say farewell, his last words as president echo across this great nation. If we listen, we will hear him whisper the humble words he used to sum up his revolution: 'All in all, not bad, not bad at all.'''

HEADLINE: How Hitler's Armies Conquered a Mind

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
You don't need to see swastikas to know when there's a Nazi on the stage. From the moment William Atherton first appears in ''Address Unknown,'' Frank Dunlop's dust-caked adaptation of Kathrine Kressmann Taylor's short novel from the late 1930's, he bristles with those telltale signals associated with films like ''The Damned'' and ''The Night Porter,'' made when brownshirt psychosexuality was all the rage.
 The curdled Aryan creaminess; the dissipated, glazed good looks that suggest a host of nervous tics waiting to surface; the tight-lipped expression that speaks of conflicting desires to whip and be whipped -- yes, they are all in place in Mr. Atherton's performance in ''Address Unknown,'' which opened last night at the Promenade Theater, also starring the impeccable Jim Dale. Of course, Mr. Atherton's attire -- a heavy brocade dressing gown accessorized with black boots made for stomping -- is also a dead giveaway. 
 Such explicit iconography doesn't serve the best interests of this 75-minute, two-character drama, directed by Mr. Dunlop. The old-fashioned literary frissons of Taylor's book, one of the first American works of fiction to deal with Nazi anti-Semitism, come from watching a character who seems comfortably familiar turn by degrees into a rabid disciple of Hitler. But from the moment you set eyes on Mr. Atherton, you feel he might as well have ''Sieg Heil!'' tattooed on his forehead.
 ''Address Unknown,'' which was made into a movie starring Paul Lukas in 1944, follows in epistolary form the disintegrating friendship between two German-born business partners who own an art gallery in San Francisco in the early 1930's. Max Eisenstein (Mr. Dale), who is Jewish, has remained in California to run the business, while Martin Schulse (Mr. Atherton) has returned to Germany with his wife to send their sons to school there.
 The first letters are effusive with familial warmth. Soon they grow frosty, as Martin describes his growing attraction to the policies and persona of Hitler, an affinity Max cannot connect with the generous, liberal-minded companion he thought he knew. The book's last letters depict soul-destroying acts of betrayal by both correspondents.
 The epistolary play is always tough to put over, since the dramatic power of letters lies so much in inference and implication, in the ways correspondents read between each other's lines. In translating this effect to the theater, it's generally best to stick to minimal stagings that let the audience paint its own images from the actors' words and tones of voice.
 Mr. Dunlop, who collaborated with Mr. Dale on the Broadway production of ''Scapino'' in 1974, with great success, has provided a full-dress production for ''Address Unknown'' that leaves little to the imagination. James Youmans's period-detailed set divides the stage between Max's San Francisco office and Martin's study in his new baronial digs in Munich. The actors occasionally cross into each other's space to suggest futile attempts at connection, but mostly they are stranded in the rather awkward position of declaiming, with decorative gestures, what their characters write.
 Though you can see how Taylor's warning cry would have stunned American readers in the late 1930's, it is not a subtle piece. If it still has power, and it does, that's because it builds in careful O. Henryesque style to a satisfyingly startling but inevitable conclusion. And Mr. Dale, an actor of considerable agility and sharp instincts, brings a shivery sense of a good man undone in his tense interpretation of Max's climactic letters.
 Up to that point, though, the show is a bit of a slog, as each brick of background and exposition is conscientiously laid in place. True, it's kind of fun to see Mr. Atherton, who became famous in the 1970's for playing the young man most likely to crack up in movies like ''The Sugarland Express,'' resurrect his neurotic specialty act.
 But since his Martin comes across as such a sinister basket case from his first words, he doesn't make much of an argument for Nazism's terrible gift for turning ordinary men into monsters. The abiding effectiveness of ''Address Unknown'' comes from its insistence that given the right political and economic climate, even seemingly good people can go bad quickly. That message is obviously not without contemporary relevance. But it never fully registers in this static, literal-minded production.

HEADLINE: Taliban Suspected in Killing of 11 Chinese Workers

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL; Howard W. French contributed reporting from Shanghai for this article.

DATELINE: KANDAHAR, Afghanistan, June 10 

 BODY:
The massacre of 11 Chinese road construction workers and an Afghan guard as they slept in their tents early Thursday was the deadliest against foreigners since the fall of the Taliban and dealt a setback to United States efforts to stabilize the country ahead of elections scheduled for September. 
 The men were among more than 100 Chinese engineers and construction workers who had recently arrived in Afghanistan to work on a World Bank project to rebuild a road running north from Kabul to the Tajikistan border. Some of those killed Thursday had been in Afghanistan only a few days, the Chinese news agency reported. 
 The attack occurred at 1:30 a.m. about 20 miles south of Kunduz, in the normally peaceful northern part of the county, Afghan officials said. A group of some 20 gunmen in cars attacked the men as they slept, the spokesman for the Interior Ministry, Lutfullah Mashal, said. 
 The Afghan guard and nine Chinese men were killed immediately in the attack. Two more Chinese men died in the hospital later. Four other Chinese workers were wounded and being treated in a Kunduz hospital and by German members of a peacekeeping force based in the town, said the Kunduz police chief, Gen. Abdul Mutalibeg. A second Afghan guard was missing, he said. 
 Coming after the murder of five aid workers last week in northwestern Afghanistan, the assault, which Afghan officials attributed to the Taliban, may indicate that the gunmen are shifting their attacks to northern Afghanistan, which has been relatively free of violence. President Hamid Karzai and Gen. David Barno, the commander of the American-led forces in Afghanistan, have recently warned that attacks on aid workers, government officials and foreign military forces will increase in the months ahead of the elections. United States troop deployments have been increased recently to 20,000, in part to help with security ahead of the voting. 
 A senior Afghan military commander in southern Afghanistan, Hajji Mir Wali, said Mullah Dadullah, one of the top Taliban commanders, recently issued orders to his fighters to strike at road builders. ''His orders were: 'First, you have to kill engineers to stop the building of the roads. Second, you have to burn schools and spread out leaflets. Third, you have to put mines and attack government officials; and fourth, if you can, you have to attack American forces,''' Mr. Wali said. He said he was told of the orders by a member of the Taliban who was present at the meeting in which they were issued.
 General Mutalibeg said the people responsible were probably ''remnants of the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and people of Hesb-e-Islami of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar,'' referring to a renegade mujahedeen commander who is on the United States list of wanted terrorists and who has declared a war against foreign forces in Afghanistan.
 Gen. Muhammad Daoud, the military commander in the north, said the attack appeared timed to coincide with the opening of the first two miles of the road on Thursday. ''This is an action to destroy the reconstruction process of Afghanistan,'' he said. ''Our enemies want to destabilize the situation here as they did in the south of Afghanistan.'' 
 The government of Afghanistan also sent generals from the Defense Ministry and the National Security Directorate, the Afghan intelligence service, to lead an investigation. 
 The Taliban did not immediately claim responsibility for the attack, as it has with previous incidents. 
 A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Liu Jianchao, said the workers were members of a railroad construction company that has 123 people in Afghanistan. He condemned the attack as a ''brutal terrorist act,'' and vowed that Chinese civil engineering projects there would continue. ''China will not give in to any terrorism,'' he said.
 The Chinese workers were from the China Railway Shisiju Group Corporation, based in Jinan, in eastern China, a World Bank spokesman said. 
 The United States Embassy in Kabul said it was ''deeply shocked and saddened'' by the killings. ''We condemn those who carried out this cowardly attack on these individuals who were working to assist the people of Afghanistan,'' an embassy statement said. 
 The United Nations suspended all movement of personnel out of Kunduz and suspended its voter registration work there, a spokesman said.

HEADLINE: Major Step Toward Casino In the Catskills

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
A $500 million Las Vegas-style casino in the Catskills moved significantly closer to reality yesterday when the Pataki administration signed an agreement with the Cayuga Indian Nation, settling the tribe's 200-year-old claim to 64,000 acres in upstate New York in exchange for casino revenues.
 If it is built, the casino in Monticello in Sullivan County will be the closest one to New York City, only 90 miles away, and will dwarf the four Indian gambling halls already operating in the state. With analysts estimating that it could pull in $1 billion a year in revenues, the casino would most likely pose significant competition to the Atlantic City gambling resort and the Foxwoods casino in Connecticut. 
 The agreement is a major step forward in a 30-year effort to use gambling to revive the Catskill Mountains resort area once known as the borscht belt. 
 ''The agreement would allow us to move forward with plans to establish the first of three new casinos in the Catskills, which would create thousands of new jobs and provide a tremendous boost to the region's economy,'' Gov. George E. Pataki said in a statement released yesterday afternoon.
 The Pataki administration has been negotiating for years to settle land claims with a half-dozen New York tribes, hoping to use the promise of casinos, rather than taxpayer dollars, to persuade tribes to drop their claims. Under yesterday's agreement, the Cayugas will drop most of their claim to land at the northern end of Cayuga Lake in exchange for $247.9 million over 14 years, starting in 2007 when the casino is scheduled to open. The money will come from a percentage of the slot machine revenues the tribe agreed to turn over to the state every year.
 The tribe will also be allowed to purchase up to 10,000 acres within the claim area. Both sides agreed to seek federal legislation ratifying their agreement.
 Three years ago, a federal court ruled that the state illegally purchased Indian tribal land more than 200 years ago and awarded $247.9 million to the Cayugas and the Seneca Cayugas of Oklahoma. Both sides appealed the decision.
 The agreement calls for the state and the Cayugas to pay Seneca and Cayuga Counties $3 million a year each for 21 years out of gambling revenues, and to establish price parity with local businesses, concessions designed to make the deal more palatable to non-Indians in the area affected by the land settlement. Businesses near Indian reservations, which are sovereign land and not subject to local, state or federal taxes, have long complained that they were undercut by cheap Indian gasoline, alcohol and cigarettes. The tribe has agreed not to undersell local competitors.
 Rich Ricci, a leader of one opposition group, Upstate Citizens for Equality, was not mollified.
 ''We're not going to stand by and get steamrolled,'' Mr. Ricci said. ''The government spent 24 years discussing the tribe's right of self-determination. But when it came to the settlement, they gave very little consideration to the rights of legitimate landowners and taxpayers in Seneca and Cayuga Counties.''
 But many political and tribal leaders in the area said their concerns had been addressed. Timothy Twoguns, a representative of the Cayuga Nation, said in a statement that he was gratified by the proposed settlement, which, he said, would ''enable the Cayuga people to establish itself in its traditional lands, which it lost more than 200 years ago.''
 In 2001, the State Legislature approved the development of three tribal casinos in the Catskills and three near Niagara Falls. Two casinos have opened in Niagara Falls, but little has happened in the Catskills, which is regarded by gambling analysts as a potential goldmine because of its proximity to New York City.
 In Sullivan County, the pending settlement means that a casino may finally open after years of rumors, promises and disappointments, although the Cayugas and their partners, Empire Resorts, still have negotiating to do. The amount to be paid to Sullivan County is also still under negotiation.
 A month ago, the Cayugas obtained preliminary approval from the Bureau of Indian Affairs for a plan to build a $500 million casino on 30 acres next to Empire's Monticello Raceway, a harness track that has been struggling. Robert Berman, chief executive of the company, has spent more than a decade trying to build an Indian casino at the racetrack. In 19 days, Empire is opening a so-called racino at the Raceway with 1,800 video slot machines.
 ''After 10 years and a long road it appears that we will soon be able to realize our dream of bringing casinos to the Catskills,'' said Mr. Berman, who was born and raised in Monticello.
 But as much as they want a casino, Sullivan County leaders have demanded that Empire and the Cayugas pay the county $15 million a year to offset the effects of the gambling operation, which they say would require more police, schools and road work. Two of the six tribes that have tried to develop casinos in Sullivan County have agreed to that number. But Mr. Berman maintains that he has a pre-existing deal with Monticello to pay $5 million.
 ''It's clearly a step forward in bringing casino gambling to Sullivan County,'' said Chris Cunningham, chairman of the Sullivan County Legislature. ''We look forward to negotiating a local service agreement to mitigate the impacts that we've identified in a mutually beneficial way.''

HEADLINE: Cameras as Weapons Against Injustice

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Arriving right on the heels of the Abu Ghraib scandal, the Human Rights Watch International Film Festival has a new, uncomfortable resonance for those who habitually regard the United States as remaining above the moral fray.
 ''Persons of Interest,'' for example, is a spare, modest documentary in which New York-area residents of South Asian and Middle Eastern descent describe their arrests and detainment by the Justice Department in the weeks after 9/11. The movie, which has the first of three screenings at the Walter Reade Theater tonight at 6:15, offers disturbing first-hand testimony of how the safeguards of civil liberty were relaxed in a time of panic.
 In ''Persons of Interest,'' the suspects, released often after weeks of incarceration and interrogation, insist on their complete innocence of any terrorist connections. Taken one after another into an empty white room, they are questioned by the unseen filmmakers, Alison Maclean and Tobias Perse, about their arrests and confinement. 
 Because the film records only their versions of what happened, it is obviously one-sided, but the cumulative impact of their stories creates the sickening impression of people who are persecuted and humiliated on the flimsiest of excuses in a witch-hunting atmosphere.
 Like many films shown in the festival over the years, ''Persons of Interest'' doesn't pretend to any political objectivity. In scrutinizing the moral conduct of governments and institutions around the world, the festival, as its name declares, is a watch, or monitor, much like Amnesty International. But the perspective of the festival, which continues at the Walter Reade through June 24, goes well beyond human-rights abuses to examine the devastations of war and economic inequity.
 One of the most fascinating entries this season, ''The Corporation,'' traces the rise of the corporation as a phenomenon, to its present status as a fundamental and essentially amoral modern institution. The movie, which is to open in two weeks at Film Forum in Manhattan, analyzes the corporation's values as if it were a person, and finds it psychologically dysfunctional on almost every level.
 ''Persons of Interest'' isn't the only film to explore American-style injustice. Katy Chevigny and Kirsten Johnson's documentary, ''Deadline,'' examines capital punishment and focuses on the surprising decision of George Ryan, the former governor of Illinois and a longtime conservative Republican, to commute the sentences of 167 prisoners on death row just before he left office.
 The process began after a group of journalism students at Northwestern University found evidence that many prisoners facing death in Illinois were innocent. Their findings prompted Governor Ryan to order clemency hearings for every prisoner on death row and to reverse his longstanding advocacy of capital punishment.
 Political imprisonment and its repercussions are also the subject of ''Repatriation,'' Dong-won Kim's long (149-minute) personal and searching study of North Koreans who were convicted of spying by South Korea and incarcerated for 30 years, during which they were tortured and pressured to ''convert.'' The subjects, of whom Mr. Kim grew fond over the 12 years it took to make the film, are the unconverted, who clung to Communism and who, despite their physical frailty in prison, sang Communist Party work songs with undiminished fervor and dreamed of repatriation to the North.
 In ''Born into Brothels,'' the filmmakers Zana Briski and Ross Kauffman visited Calcutta's squalid red-light district and befriended the often talented, attractive children of prostitutes. Ms. Briski, a professional photographer, gave the children cameras and photography instruction, took them on field trips to the zoo and to the ocean, and arranged an international exhibition of their work. Ultimately, she tried to arrange for as many as possible to attend private boarding schools, their only hope of a better life. Some make it; others don't.
 The festival isn't all straight documentary. Francisco J. Lombardi's film ''What the Eye Doesn't See'' spins six fictional vignettes around an actual scandal to create a complex social mosaic dramatizing the effects of political corruption on ordinary people.
 The real-life event is the broadcasting of the notorious ''Vladi videos'' of Vladmiro Montesinos, an adviser to the former Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori, which show Mr. Montesinos bribing government and business leaders. The exposure brought down the Fujimori government. The characters range from a corrupt army colonel to a news anchor to a teenage girl, whose lives are all shaped by the scandal.
 The exposure of those videos demonstrates the same principle that drives the Human Rights Watch festival: knowledge is power that can sometimes be translated into reform.
 The 2004 Human Rights Watch International Film Festival will run through June 24 at the Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center. Tickets: $10; students, $7; 65+ and ages 6 to 12, $5 at weekday matinees. Screening times and other information: (212) 875-5600 or www.filmlinc.com.

HEADLINE: Import Prices Increase 1.6%, Biggest Surge in 15 Months

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
United States import prices rose 1.6 percent last month, the biggest increase in 15 months, the Labor Department reported yesterday. The increase, which followed a 0.2 percent rise in April, was led by energy prices that were twice what economists had forecast. 
 Excluding petroleum, the index, which gauges the cost of goods and raw materials from abroad, rose 0.4 percent. Crude oil futures reached a record in New York on June 1.
 The increase was another sign of inflation that could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate this month. ''Until oil prices retreat more convincingly, the Fed is likely to remain nervous'' about companies passing along those increases to consumers, said Maury Harris, chief economist at UBS Securities in Stamford, Conn.
 Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said this week that the Fed was ready to do what was necessary to head off inflation as the economy expands and adds jobs. The Labor Department said yesterday that the number of people continuing to collect unemployment insurance fell by 106,000 in the week that ended May 29, to 2.881 million, the fewest in three years.
 The decline ''provides some confirmation that hiring has picked up, so that those receiving jobless benefits are finding work more quickly and dropping out of the tally,'' said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Conn.
 The department also said yesterday that first-time unemployment claims rose by 12,000, to 352,000 last week. The unexpected increase came in a week that included Memorial Day, which the department and economists said made it hard to adjust for seasonal variations. Economists had expected claims to fall to 335,000 from the 339,000 initially reported, based on the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.

HEADLINE: A Cat From the Comics, Full of Lasagna

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
If this is the only newspaper you read, then a bit of explanation might be in order. Garfield is a cat who says funny things at his owner's expense, makes fun of a dog named Odie and eats a lot of lasagna. That's right, lasagna. A cat who eats lasagna! Isn't that the craziest thing you've ever heard?
 Here's something even crazier: someone at 20th Century Fox has decided that ''Garfield,'' Jim Davis's long-running syndicated comic strip, tolerated by millions of newspaper readers around the world, should be adapted into a movie. Apparently, Hollywood has run through all the old, beloved television shows, all the television shows nobody really cared about and most of the theme park rides in Orlando, Fla., and has now decided to turn its synergistic attention to the funny pages. I have a feeling ''Garfield: The Movie,'' which opens nationwide today, is only the beginning. I'm bracing myself for ''Cathy,'' for ''Ziggy'' and, of course, for ''Marmaduke.'' 
 The guiding principle behind ''Garfield,'' directed by Pete Hewitt from a script by Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow, seems be that jokes that barely raise a chuckle when stretched across three pen-and-ink panels become gems of hilarity once they are outfitted with celebrity voices, soundtrack music (James Brown's ''I Feel Good'' -- how original!) and computer-generated special effects.
 There are many problems with this theory, one of which is economic. In the paper the weary smile provoked by Garfield's sarcasm or Odie's idiocy will seem like a positive bargain. You've spent 50 cents, and you still have the Jumble and the box scores to see you through your morning coffee. Movies are another matter entirely, and you are likely to leave this one feeling as grouchy and put-upon as the title character.
 Then there is the matter of plot. Most humorous comic strips don't have them. The problem with ''Garfield: The Movie'' is that it does. Jon (Breckin Meyer), the hapless, dateless owner, now has a love interest, a kindly veterinarian named Liz, played by Jennifer Love Hewitt in a succession of uncomfortable suits. It is she who unleashes Odie on Garfield, who must overcome his laziness and egoism when Odie is kidnapped by an unscrupulous television personality named Happy Chapman (Stephen Tobolowsky). Garfield must grow, in other words. He must, like every prickly, selfish Hollywood hero, learn a valuable lesson.
 Excuse me, but what cat has ever learned anything, valuable or not? The whole point of cats is that they are immune to training, moral instruction or any other kind of education. A little realism, please. That Garfield speaks in the supercilious, world-weary drawl of Bill Murray is some small consolation, as are a few of the animal tricks. Odie, for example, is played by a talented (and, mercifully, voiceless) mutt who is remarkably good at walking on his hind legs. Garfield himself has the rubbery, two-and-a-half-dimensional look common to computer-animated creatures, but he moves in a convincingly obese-feline manner. The movie may lack the insight and nuance of the comic strip, but at least it is short, and at least the studio didn't skimp on the lasagna.
 ''Garfield: The Movie'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has a few semicrude jokes and moments of implied animal cruelty.

HEADLINE: Filling Hotel Rooms One Tank at a Time

BYLINE: By SUSAN BRENNA

 BODY:
IT'S too early to tell how much gasoline prices topping $2 a gallon will depress enthusiasm for travel this summer, but many tourist businesses aren't waiting for a definitive answer. If there's a chance that fear of fill-ups will keep customers away, expensive hotels and even some day-trip museums will pay for the gas.
 Indian Lakes Resort in suburban Chicago, a luxurious golf and conference center where rooms are hexagonal in tribute to a design by Frank Lloyd Wright, is rewarding customers who stay at least four nights with coupons for up to $35 to fill their tanks at a BP station a mile away.
 ''We can't rely on travelers not being turned off by the gas situation,'' said Maris Brenner, the director for marketing and sales of Indian Lakes. ''We need to be proactive.'' 
 In San Luis Obispo County in California, home to Hearst Castle and a coastal midpoint between Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay area, 19 lodgings are offering gas coupons ranging from $10 to $60.
 In Aspen, Colo., the sleek Hotel Jerome, with suites in the $800 range, is throwing travelers a break in the form of a free tank of gas to be redeemed at a nearby Shell station. Eleven other lodgings in Aspen will do the same.
 The Doral Tesoro Hotel and Golf Club in Fort Worth is offering a $40 gas credit to anyone who books for at least two nights. Texas has been pumping out press releases boasting of its low gas prices (the average price of a gallon of regular was $1.88 yesterday in Houston, for example, compared with $2.28 in New York and $2.35 in Los Angeles, according to AAA). ''If you're going to drive, you might as well drive in Texas, where it's cheap,'' said Gerard J. Tollett, president of the Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau.
 Tourists who drive to Branson, Mo., can trade two days' worth of gas receipts for coupons for meals, hotel rooms and entertainment. Dawn Vincent, a retired restaurant manager who saved $20 on tickets and souvenirs at an IMAX show, said she would have taken her week's trip to Branson from her central Missouri home anyway. But that doesn't mean the town's business instincts were wrong. ''My brother wanted us to go visit him in Alabama'' she said. ''But I said, 'Let's wait till the gas prices go down.' ''
 ''There's something psychological about gas,'' said Trudy Coxe, the chief executive of the Preservation Society of Newport County, which promotes tours of the robber barons' mansions in Newport, R.I., and has been advertising $5 discounts since late May for travelers who showed gasoline receipts to ticket clerks. ''Any increase is World War III in the minds of most Americans.''
 ResortQuest International, which rents vacation homes online, is offering gas cash cards of $20 to $40 on home rentals in 16 regions, mostly in the West and South. That doesn't change the economics of staying at the $2,800-a-night home near the Aspen Institute, where the children can sleep in built-in tepees. But Steve Schein, ResortQuest's western region vice president, said: ''Even folks who are spending $1,000, $2,000 a night appreciate added value. That's how they got to be high-net-worth.''
 Even cruises can win gas discounts. CruisesOnly, an online broker, is offering gas cards worth $50 to $150 to travelers who sail in July or later on the Norwegian Cruise Line in Alaska, Mexico and the Caribbean.
 Gail and Wayne Popiolek of Largo, Fla., canceled plans to meander among craft shops in Tennessee and North Carolina this summer. Instead, they will loaf by a pool two hours from home, at the glass-domed Gaylord Palms resort in Orlando, Fla., where they are getting a $75 gas rebate. The Popioleks may be unusually fuel-conscious. They own a construction company, and the price of keeping fuel in their fleet of 16 trucks was $2,000 last month, up from $1,200 a month last summer. ''We are very, very sensitive to gas prices,'' Mrs. Popiolek said.
 Industry prognosticators insist that despite all the nervousness, this will be a gung-ho summer for American road-trippers. The Travel Industry Association and AAA predict that 3.2 percent more people will take driving vacations this year than last.
 ''So far it seems like people are getting in their cars and getting out on the roads,'' Mantill Williams, an AAA spokesman, said the day after Memorial Day. ''There may be a pent-up demand for travel that people are exercising. If I put my trip on hold the last two years because I was worrying about my job, or worrying about what was happening overseas, I might be really reluctant to put it off for another year.'' (Drivers looking for inexpensive gas across the country can log on to www.gaspricewatch.com or www.gas buddy.com.)
 But there's no denying that consumers like the breaks on gasoline. Even though she lives in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, and doesn't own a car, Carol Martin was happy to accept the $25 Mobil gas card she got from booking a trip to an Iroquois festival in Howes Cave, N.Y., through www.fuelingthefun.com, a Web site in Schoharie County. She gave the card to her mother, who drives around Virginia. ''These days, it's a gift,'' she said.
MOST discounts are nominal, in the range of the $30 rebate offered on three nights' lodging booked through the Web site Hotels.com. Nonetheless, Jack Richards, the site's senior vice president for product marketing, said there is such heavy traffic to the gas-deal offer that managers decided to extend it to Oct. 15. He sees the traffic as proof that even people who are not canceling travel plans are pondering gas prices.
 That describes Jane Mang of Denver. Her family of six, together with friends from New Jersey, will be cruising later this month on a houseboat on Lake Powell, which straddles the Arizona-Utah border. They're renting it from Lake Powell Resorts & Marinas, in Page, Ariz., which is offering perhaps the nation's biggest gas rebate: between $500 and $700, depending on the size of the houseboat rented.
 Consider, however, that the largest of the boats has a 420-gallon tank, gas has been running more than $3 a gallon at Lake Powell marinas, and the boats burn through 10 gallons an hour. ''Really, I didn't want to figure out'' the cost of gas for the houseboat, Mrs. Mang said, plus fuel for the power boat and WaveRunner they will be hauling.
 ''I hesitated, but my husband didn't at all,'' she said. ''He had made up his mind that we were going to go.''
 Still, she added, ''He was thrilled when they offered the rebate.''

HEADLINE: Financing of Book by Rowland's Wife Is Scrutinized

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEYand ALISON LEIGH COWAN; Stacey Stowe contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: HARTFORD, June 10 

 BODY:
A state employee and longtime confidante of Gov. John G. Rowland solicited a $32,000 loan from the nonprofit foundation that supports the governor's residence so the governor's wife could publish a children's book, ''Marvelous Max, the Mansion Mouse,'' according to documents released on Thursday by the House committee investigating whether to recommend impeaching Mr. Rowland.
 The foundation's lawyer rejected the idea as inappropriate. But the chairman, Wilson Wilde, later wrote a series of personal checks totaling more than $41,000 to have the book illustrated and published. In a telephone interview on Thursday, Mr. Wilde said that at the time he expected profits to benefit both Patricia Rowland and the Governor's Residence Conservancy.
 ''I stepped up and said, well, I would like to do that in the interest of my friendship with the first lady and the conservancy that stands ready to benefit,'' Mr. Wilde said. 
 Evidence relating to the book was among a handful of revelations on Thursday that added to an image of a politician who often enjoyed life's perks through the largess of others. While the account was rarely surprising, coming after six months of scandal surrounding the governor, for some committee members it was yet another building block in a case against Mr. Rowland.
 ''Is it a gift, is it a loan, is it an investment?'' asked Representative Michael P. Lawlor, a Democrat from East Haven who is among the governor's most outspoken critics on the 10-member bipartisan committee. ''Each one of them is a problem.''
 But the committee did not get to review the book transaction or several other pieces of evidence on Thursday. Its third day of hearings broke off earlier than expected to allow lawyers for the governor to cross the street to appear before the State Supreme Court.
 Several committee members soon followed them over to hear the court decide in the evening that it would take up the governor's appeal to have the committee's subpoena for his testimony thrown out as unconstitutional.
 The court scheduled arguments for next Friday, the last day on which the committee had planned to hold hearings.
 The intervention of the Supreme Court pushed into yet another setting a scandal that also includes a federal criminal investigation into the governor's conduct relating to gifts and benefits he received from people doing business with the state.
 Committee members have been careful to avoid drawing conclusions, at least publicly, about whether the evidence they have reviewed so far appears to rise to the level of an impeachable offense.
 On Wednesday, at the end of the second day of testimony about the relationship between the governor and Robert V. Matthews, a businessman, Representative Arthur J. O'Neill, a Republican from Southbury who is a co-chairman of the committee, said only that the relationship raised questions. He said the condominium transaction was ''not fully explainable in normal economics'' and that Mr. Matthews ''is to some degree benefiting from his relationship with the governor.''
 On Thursday, the lawyer for the impeachment committee, Steven F. Reich, distributed timelines the committee had asked him to create to help them synthesize the scores of dates, documents and conversations it had reviewed in its first two days of testimony.
 Mr. Reich distributed two color-coded pages listing events linking the governor to Mr. Matthews, who secured millions of dollars in financing through the state and leased office space for millions in contracts.
 The timelines cover the years 1995 through 2001 and show a consistent interaction between the governor and Mr. Matthews.
 They note that Mr. Matthews and a business colleague met with the governor in his office on March 19, 1996. That same day, Mr. Matthews wrote to a niece notifying her that he would begin wiring her $1,750 a month so that she could then write checks to the governor for the same amount to rent his Capitol Hill condominium. The rent was triple the going rate.
 The timelines also note that Mr. Matthews arranged for a third party to make an above-market offer on the sale of the condo on May 1, 1997, just four days before the governor closed on his vacation cottage in Litchfield in May 1997. The sale of the condo provided the governor with a $15,000 gain.
 The governor's admission in December that he lied about renovations made to the Litchfield cottage by people working for or doing business with the state is what prompted the impeachment inquiry.
 The only witness called by the committee on Thursday was Rachel S. Rubin, a former managing director of the State Ethics Commission, who left the agency in 2000. The governor has been fined twice for ethics violations. Ms. Rubin walked the committee through parts of the ethics code that restrict gifts to public officials and state employees from people doing business with the state.
 ''You shouldn't be allowed to foster good will to have extra access to the people who are making decisions,'' Ms. Rubin told the committee.
 She also said the fact that someone is friends with a public official could ''mitigate'' to some extent whether a gift is improper.
 Mr. Reich then asked if the public official is ''insulated'' from an ethics violation because of the friendship.
 ''No,'' Ms. Rubin said flatly.
 Lawyers for Mr. Rowland, a Republican, have sought to portray his relationships with people who helped him financially as longtime friendships.
 The committee did not have time to discuss much of the evidence it released on Thursday, and few lawmakers knew just what to make of the transactions surrounding Mrs. Rowland's book.
 The book tells the story of a young boy named Tim, who moves into the mansion of Mr. and Mrs. Governor only to discover that he has no friends and is sad. Fortunately, a team of friendly talking mice help him find a playmate.
 The pitch to use funds from the conservancy was made on Aug. 28, 2002, in a letter from Jo McKenzie, a confidante of the Rowlands who runs the governor's residence, to Mr. Wilde. ''Patty Rowland has written a wonderful manuscript,'' she wrote. But, she explained, ''in order for us to continue to move forward with this project, we need to ask you and the conservancy a huge favor. We would like to borrow approximately $32,000 from the conservancy's account.''
 The conservancy's lawyer rejected the idea, and Mr. Wilde made his own proposal. In his notes from that meeting, Mr. Wilde wrote that ''Patty has some personal debts she would like to repay.'' 
 He said further that any ''amount over cost'' recovered in selling the book would be split between the conservancy and Mrs. Rowland.
 In the interview, he explained that he would have ''liked to see Patty get some money'' from the book because ''she put a lot of time into this.'' But he said Mrs. Rowland was later advised against taking any money from the project, advice she followed.
 The book itself says that ''a portion'' of its profits will go to a literacy charity. But a letter from Ross H. Garber, the governor's in-house lawyer, to the state ethics commission in October 2003 asserted that all profits from the sale would go to charity.
 So far, the discussion seems academic. According to an affidavit submitted to the committee by John Tucker, president of Norfleet Press, the book's publisher, the book has not even sold enough copies to repay Mr. Wilde in full. ''No profits have yet been made and I would be happily surprised if there were any profits in the future,'' he wrote.

Gifts and Ethics

The Connecticut House Select Committee of Inquiry, which will determine whether to recommend the impeachment of Gov. John G. Rowland, heard public testimony yesterday from:

RACHEL S. RUBIN -- a former managing director of the State Ethics Commission. She briefed the committee on state ethics law, particularly involving gifts to public officials and state employees from people doing business with the state.

HEADLINE: Not Many Jobs Are Sent Abroad, U.S. Report Says

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
International outsourcing, politicians from both parties often say, has turned into a scourge of American workers, who are losing jobs on a large scale to competition from cheaper workers abroad. 
 But according to the first government effort to actually measure the phenomenon, such fears may be overblown. A new report released yesterday by the Labor Department on mass layoffs found that in the first quarter of this year, 4,633 workers were laid off because their jobs were moved overseas, a mere 2.5 percent of the total of 182,456 longer-term job losses reported by companies in the period.
 Officials acknowledged that the numbers clearly undercount the total number of jobs lost offshore. For one thing, the new data covers layoffs only at companies employing at least 50 workers where at least 50 filed for unemployment insurance and the layoffs lasted more than 30 days. Even more important, the report does not account for jobs created by American companies overseas that did not involve a direct layoff in the United States. 
 The new data, however, does seem to fortify those experts who have long argued that outsourcing plays a relatively small role compared with other more important factors affecting American job gains and losses.
 ''Offshoring is not at the heart of the matter,'' said Robert B. Reich, who served as labor secretary under President Bill Clinton. ''I don't think it is a major part of the job picture.''
 Instead, many experts say, the job market is driven more by rapid productivity growth, allowing companies to accomplish more work with fewer workers; the introduction of new technologies, which destroy many jobs while creating many others; and the overall level of demand in the domestic economy. 
 Indeed, while nearly three million jobs were lost from March 2001 through August 2003, the recent recovery of the economy has added 1.4 million jobs since then. And despite the job losses the Labor Department found during the first quarter, over all the economy added an estimated 595,000 jobs during that period.
 The new data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that about 16,000 layoffs in the quarter were because of the relocation of jobs. Of those, more than 6 out of 10 moved to another part of the country. Of the reported 4,633 jobs lost to other countries, nearly two-thirds were moved within the same company to a new location abroad, while one-third were outsourced to another company.
 American corporations have been putting operations in foreign countries for many years. But concern over offshore investments surged not long ago as companies took advantage of advances in telecommunications and other technologies to move a new set of operations, from customer service call centers to computer programming tasks, to lower-wage countries like India that are turning out large numbers of educated software developers earning far less than Americans with comparable skills. 
 The recent burst of job growth has taken much of the bite from outsourcing as a political issue. Nonetheless, the move of service work overseas raised concerns over the potential loss of the high-wage white-collar jobs that were once considered safe from global competition, igniting angry calls from lawmakers and union officials for action to stem the loss of jobs. 
 Senator John Kerry, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, has dropped most of the attacks against companies that send jobs overseas. But he remains interested in the issue. Gene Sperling, an economic adviser to the Kerry campaign, noted that Mr. Kerry ''opposes tax incentives that encourage the movement of jobs and investment overseas'' and wants a policy ''that does more to create incentives to create jobs in the United States.''
 Critics charge that sending jobs offshore could have deep and long-lasting negative effects on the workplace, as more Americans are forced to compete with equally well-trained but cheaper workers in developing countries.
 The current labor bureau report said nothing of the impact of outsourcing on wages. Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute noted that competition from cheaper workers overseas can be expected to slow the wage growth of American workers over coming years. Still, the latest evidence suggests that the effect of such trends may be more limited than many feared.
 While the new report painted a relatively reassuring picture, Andrew Tilton, an economist at Goldman Sachs, warned that there were flaws in the latest data. The new numbers understate outsourcing because the data was from a small subset of total jobs lost: 182,456 extended nonseasonal mass layoffs compared with 4.5 million workers who applied for unemployment insurance in the period. 
 Moreover, the labor bureau arrived at its numbers simply by asking companies that reported extended mass layoffs whether they had moved any work to another location overseas or outsourced them to another company abroad. Jacob F. Kirkegaard, a research associate at the Institute for International Economics, a Washington research center that favors reducing barriers to free trade and investment, added that the numbers could thus also undercount the movement of jobs abroad because in the current political environment company executives would rather not admit to such actions. 
 Estimates by Goldman Sachs -- which include smaller companies excluded by the labor bureau's data -- point to more outsourced jobs by American corporations: 250,000 to 350,000 a year. But even those are quite small numbers in the context of a labor market that employs more than 130 million people. 
 In a speech last March, Ben S. Bernanke, a Federal Reserve governor, noted that estimates of jobs lost to outsourcing were quite small compared with the 15 million jobs lost every year for all reasons.
 ''Outsourcing abroad,'' he said, ''simply cannot account for much of the recent weakness in the U.S. labor market and does not appear likely to be an important restraint to further recovery in employment.''

HEADLINE: A Colony Lost, A Tradition Lingers

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
THIRTY-THREE summers is an awfully long time to spend covered in body paint, whooping your way across a stage in the mosquito-drenched heat of coastal North Carolina, and last winter Bob Midgette thought seriously about hanging up his coyote-trimmed loincloth for good. 
 ''There comes a time for everything,'' he said. 
 But there was Mr. Midgette last Friday, applying black stripes to his face in the mirror, preparing for one more opening night of ''The Lost Colony,'' a musical history of a short-lived early settlement on Roanoke Island that over the course of its 67-year run has become the story of Roanoke Island itself. ''I still find myself walking in here sometimes before the show starts,'' said Mr. Midgette, a semiretired gym teacher, ''thinking about how great it is to carry on this tradition.'' 
 All across the country, summer is when history comes to life. From Plimouth Plantation in Massachusetts to Old Tombstone in Arizona, tens of thousands of people are suiting up in breeches or cowboy hats, shouldering fake muskets and panning for gold, trying to impart some digestible combination of education and entertainment to tens of millions of tourists. 
 But it is hard to imagine a place where history lives as large, relatively speaking, as it does on little Roanoke Island, a 12-mile-long patch of sand and pine tucked between the fragile dunes of the Outer Banks and the marshy mainland, with a year-round population under 3,000. 
 Since 1937, more than four million people have seen ''The Lost Colony,'' which tells of the arrival in 1587 and mysterious disappearance soon after of a group of English settlers whose members came to include Virginia Dare, the first child born in the New World to English-speaking parents. (Last year, 65 local babies vied for the coveted role of Virginia, which is played by a live child once each season. In a controversial decision, it ended up going to the 2 1/2-year-old, 45-pound grandson of a board member.) 
 The show's renown has helped transform the island's commercial center, Manteo, from a skeletal fishing village to a company town in the most literal, theatrical sense. Streets named Sir Walter Raleigh and Eleanor Dare are lined with establishments like Ye Olde Pioneer Theater and Old Tom's Ice Cream Shoppe. 
 And not only has the sand-covered stage of the Waterside Theater been the launching pad for show-business careers -- including that of Andy Griffith -- it has even inspired another living-history venture in Manteo, Festival Park, a mini-Williamsburg whose re-enactors tell the story of an even earlier failed expedition to the island, in 1585.
 The Festival Park players, who have set up shop in a three-masted ship and a small settlement on the park grounds, labor in the shadow of ''The Lost Colony,'' though they draw about 50,000 more visitors a year. This causes them no small annoyance, especially when eager young children come up to the entrance and announce: ''I want to find 'The Lost Colony,' '' as Julia Colbert, 8, of Raleigh, did last Saturday. 
 But over in their corner of the island, the Festival Park folks are actually breaking new ground in the field of historic interpretation. At most historic parks, the costumed employees either present themselves as present-day guides, describing in modern parlance what their forbears used to do, or they take on the guise of permanent residents of the past, caught in an unchanging time capsule and unaware of anything that has transpired since, say, 1585. 
 The disadvantage of the first approach, said James Charlet, the park's lead interpreter, is that it is too removed to make the history come alive. The problem with the second is that the interpreters must endlessly parry visitors' attempts to trick them into acknowledging something their characters could not know about, like photography.
 At Festival Park, they have developed something they call ''still-living history.'' The premise is that the interpreters really are from the 1500's, but because of the magic of the New World, they stopped aging shortly after their arrival on these shores. In other words, they play youthful 437-year-olds with Elizabethan accents who know about lighters and flush toilets but prefer to rub sticks and dig privies. 
 Mr. Charlet said this approach, which as far as he knows is not used elsewhere, allows the interpreter to acknowledge anachronism rather than waste time fighting it. ''People see us pull out a walkie-talkie,'' said Mr. Charlet, who was in the bejerkined finery of Master Thomas Constable, the ship's steward, ''and they say, 'Hey, you didn't have those back then.' And I say, 'But remember, sir, this is not back then.' ''
 The challenges of bridging past and present are constant. Near closing time last Saturday, an older couple with cameras around their necks popped into the settlement and approached the blacksmith Nathaniel Loughery, a thickset 22-year-old. ''We're looking for good pizza tonight,'' the man said. ''So, putting aside the accents. . . ''
 ''We can't put aside the accents, sir,'' Mr. Loughery politely interjected, ''but we can answer your questions.'' 
 The question was, where could they find decent Italian food on the island? 
 Sean Andrews, who portrays Mr. Loughery's Irish indentured servant, snorted. ''Ay, yer in Manteo,'' he said, whittling on a stick. ''If ye're looking fer Italian . . .'' He shook his head. 
 HISTORY on Roanoke Island is more than an economic engine. It's a communal obsession. It is the local baseball team, the Junior League and homecoming rolled into one, a source of a sometimes haughty pride that descendants of those 17th-century goodman-come-latelies on the Mayflower can only wish for.
 And there are times when it even transcends the banality of repeating the same story night after night, year after year. ''When you're re-enacting and you really get into it, you get the feeling that this has been done before,'' said Trent Pcenicni, who plays an indentured servant at Festival Park. ''It's almost crazy to say it because it sounds really hokey, but it's like you're channeling somebody.''
 The historical life has brought a new wave of settlers, mostly theater folk who came to play in ''The Lost Colony'' and ended up staying and transforming the island even further. ''There are people who came to do the show and are now teaching at the high school, who are running the crisis center,'' said Mike Campbell, 48, the show's master carpenter for more than a decade. 
 Most of the parts in ''The Lost Colony'' are filled by college students, but some long-running principals, like Mr. Midgette, 53, who plays Manteo, an Indian chief friendly to the colonists, hang on for decades and find that the role comes to define their lives. For years, he shaved his head except for a tuft in the back to which he affixed his headdress, a look that brought respect on the island but snide comments when he left town. Some people never break character. In the town cemetery, an obelisk marking the grave of Mary Long, who played Queen Elizabeth I for most of the 1950's, bears the inscription ''Unto my people, Greetings,'' the queen's signature entrance line. 
 Pageants retelling the tale of 1587 go back at least to the second decade of the 20th century, said Lebame Houston of the Roanoke Island Historical Association, which mounts the production. During the Depression, financing from the W.P.A. was available for historical theater projects. Paul Green, a North Carolina playwright who already had a Pulitzer Prize, wrote the book. The theater, a gorgeous open-air wooden structure with the Roanoke Sound for a back wall, was built. The rest, as they say, is history, and more history. 
 The outlines of the story are this: the 1587 colony was hatched by Sir Walter as a way for Britain to grab some of the gold that Spain was extracting from elsewhere in the New World. He persuaded Elizabeth to back the venture and send 117 settlers over, but she withdrew her support when she became distracted by war with Spain. When the colony's overseers finally returned with supplies in 1590, they found no trace of the settlers except two words carved in wood, apparent references to the nearby Indian settlement of Croatoan Island.
 Green's treatment is sentimental but sturdy. The colonists sing and dance an ode to ''the fair land Virgin-i-aye-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.'' Eleanor Dare, mother of Virginia, is given a smoldering, illicit love interest. A drunken beggar who makes the crossing, Old Tom, is transformed by hardship into a sturdy defender of the fort. 
 To modern eyes, the show can seem a little quaint. But some concessions have been made to political correctness. A speech by Mr. Midgette's character, Chief Manteo, that was written: ''She see Indians come kill white man last moon, some drown, all dead'' has become: ''She saw Indians come during the last moon and kill the white man. Some of them drowned. All of them were dead.''
 TWO hours before the 8:30 p.m. curtain last Friday, Mr. Midgette stood in the Indians' dressing room, surrounded by younger men in loincloths who were slathering themselves in Stein's Creole body makeup. It had been raining most of the day, but the show is always presumed to be on until officially canceled. (Performances are scheduled six nights a week through Aug. 20.)
 At 6:50, the company manager, Carl V. Curnutte III, ordered all the players indoors. A tornado warning had been issued. Within a minute, a white line of rain swept across the sound.
 As rain delayed the opening curtain, audience members took shelter and talked of shows past. Richard Bell, 68, a retired print-shop manager, recalled that he was in ''The Lost Colony'' for one season, at age 12. 
 Just behind Mr. Bell a crowd of queens was forming -- three women who had played Elizabeth, all come to pay their respects to the reigning monarch, Lisa Bridge. ''I do all the lines in my head,'' said Nancy Knowles, 70, who wore the crown for 16 years, ''and if one is not right, it's a shock.'' 
 There would be no shocks last Friday. Mr. Curnutte declared the show rained out. 
 But Saturday evening arrived without a cloud, and the ''Lost Colony'' players finally took the stage as the sun dropped like an Alka-Seltzer tablet into Roanoke Sound. 
 Old routines were renewed, some onstage, some off. Ms. Bridge, known to her colleagues as the human Zamboni, groomed the stage without trying as her $25,000, jewel-encrusted royal dress dragged through the sand. Ms. Bridge, 46, said she was particularly pleased with the weather. ''They always say, 'In thunderstorms, stay away from the queen,' '' she said.
 After the show came Slaughter, the traditional post-opening bash at Morrison Grove, the dorm-like complex in the woods where many cast members stay. Newbies were indoctrinated into the ''family'' in a ceremony that involved lighting candles and standing in a circle. Rum and Dr. Perky, a supermarket variant of Dr Pepper, flowed liberally, and Ms. Bridge, in civilian garb, tried out an unqueenly greeting. ''Welcome to Slaughter,'' she said, leaning heavily on her husband.
 Around 3 a.m., Eric Green danced into view, with a young actress on either side of him. For the summer, Mr. Green, 32, will be spending his days as the boatswain's mate on the ship at Festival Park and his evenings as Father Martin, the minister in ''The Lost Colony'' who has an unspecified crisis of faith. He is also one of the few year-round residents of the Grove, and he said he found the historical life very much to his liking. ''Like Old Tom,'' he said, referring to the ne'er-do-well turned solid citizen of the play, ''this island has made a man of me.''

HEADLINE: Europe Knows It Needs a Lot of Immigrants. But It Also Fears Them.

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

DATELINE: MARRAKESH, Morocco 

 BODY:
TERRORISM has come to Europe. The Continent's economic growth seems to lag perennially behind that of the United States. But neither of those things topped the list of worries for some European business and political leaders who gathered here this week for an international business conference. 
 Instead, they worried about babies, or more specifically, about a lack of them. The tone was set by Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the former president of France, who presented a series of demographic projections indicating that many European countries would be losing population at a rapid rate within a couple of generations. Meanwhile, he said, nothing of the kind would be happening in the United States, thanks to immigration. 
 Those who remember the fears of the 1970's, when there was Malthusian talk of too many people using up the world's resources, might think that a time of falling population would not be all that bad. 
 In her 1995 novel ''Children of Men,'' P.D. James invented a time when, because of some environmental disaster, no babies had been born for decades. Real estate prices fell and some towns gradually lost all their inhabitants, but what made the situation unbearable was the fear the human race was vanishing. 
 There is no danger of that now, of course, at least not from demographic trends. Europeans have babies, just not enough of them to provide future workers to pay their parents' and grandparents' retirement benefits. The pay-as-you-go system seems to demand more workers just to finance benefits already promised. 
 There is an obvious solution, as Jean-Rene Fortou, the chief executive of Vivendi Universal, noted when asked about Mr. Giscard d'Estaing's demographic worries. ''The Mediterranean was for many centuries a single world,'' he said. ''We could have very strong synergies with the countries'' of North Africa, where population growth continues. 
 Now the opposite is happening. Michael Fuchs, co-owner of the Impex Group, a German advertising company and a Christian Democratic member of that country's Parliament, dismissed talk of immigrants seeking work. They were, he said, trying to get welfare benefits. 
 Moroccan businessmen at the world congress of the International Chamber of Commerce said European visas had become difficult to obtain. Europe fears that visitors will stay, whether as terrorists, welfare recipients or workers who take jobs when unemployment is already high. 
 Taieb Fassi-Fihri, an official in the Moroccan foreign ministry, complained about ''the nonintegration'' of Europe with the Arab world, saying that as the European Union expands it becomes less open to his region.
 The newer members of the European Union have learned that it will be years before their citizens can seek work in most of the older members. There is considerable hostility to Turkey's application to join the union, with Mr. Giscard d'Estaing suggesting it would make more sense for Russia to enter. ''Russia is a European country,'' he said. ''Will the E.U. expand to cover half the planet?'' 
 To Norbert Walter, the chief economist of Deutsche Bank, the solution is obvious: first reform the European welfare states, to reduce benefits for those who do not work, then welcome immigrants. 
 But don't bet on that happening. ''People do not like reforms,'' said Claude Bebear, the chairman of the supervisory board at AXA, the insurance company. The young people who will suffer as tax burdens rise to support the growing number of retirees seldom vote, he added.
 Europe believes it needs more people to support its system. But it also fears what would happen if they came.

HEADLINE: Rebel Barista With a Cause (Make That a Venti)

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
IN the cozy corporate lingo of Starbucks, the java-servers in company baseball caps and green aprons are so far evolved from folks who, in quainter, less caffeinated and less linguistically sensitive times, were dubbed soda jerks, that the coffee chain graces them with a special name: baristas. The moniker conveys a Euro-cachet, implies a certain skill set and is the entry-level niche at a $15 billion behemoth with a hot -- in more ways than one -- product and a rung on the Fortune 100 best-places-to-work list.
 Baristas like Daniel E. Gross who pour enough coffee fast enough, and with affable competence, can command $8.09 per hour after a year on the job, up from a starting wage of $7.75. Scalding stuff, according to Mr. Gross, with or without meager tips. And without a defined workload: no barista is guaranteed a 40-hour week. 
 Good luck trying to save enough to buy company-sponsored health care or incubate a 401(k) nest egg, he says. Not with rents on bare-bones railroad flats like his in Bushwick, Brooklyn, pushing $1,000 a month.
 ''Starbucks also refers to its employees as partners, which really is sort of Orwellian,'' says Mr. Gross, who is not just a terminally disgruntled barista, but a relentlessly on-message mouthpiece for insurgent baristas at the Starbucks on Madison Avenue at 36th Street who have, to the company's dismay, formed a single-shop union. 
 Here he is, on his day off, on the sidewalk looking askance at the Starbucks that hired him last year. He'd heard it was a ''decent'' place to work. Not so, he says now.
 ''Those who have power over us workers have abused it so egregiously: we feel the company should be held to the standard that it preaches,'' he declares. ''There's something wrong when the chairman is taking in $17 million in 2003, but baristas, who are the foundation of the company, are living in grinding poverty and serving very hot drinks at unsafe speeds under ergonomically incorrect conditions.''
 He says complaints to superiors went unheeded, hence his decision to play hardball and unionize; more than half of the store's 13 baristas are on his team, he says.
 Two days after Mr. Gross announced his group's intentions on May 17, the chairman of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, sent a voice-mail message to employees reminding them of the company's social conscience and commitment to a supportive workplace. Starbucks hired a Manhattan law firm to counter Mr. Gross's request that the National Labor Relations Board administer a union election for the store he works in. The would-be local is being represented, free of charge, by Kennedy, Schwartz & Cure.
 Mr. Gross, 25, earnest, articulate and dogmatic to a flaw, can't think of a better way to flex his magna cum laude degree in economics from the University of California, Santa Barbara -- he grew up in Los Angeles, where his parents are ''in sales'' -- than to organize the first unionized Starbucks in the United States. 
 He sees the move as historic, even if none of the baristas from some 50 other downtown Starbucks have publicly expressed solidarity, and envisions the union as a precedent-setter. He hasn't been this inspired since he read the Dalai Lama's ''Art of Happiness'' during college and helped found Students for a Free Tibet at U.C.S.B., then volunteered at the Khana Nirvana Community Cafe in Dharamsala, India, after graduation. 
 This time his cause celebre is closer to home. ''I know I could probably do better financially than this job, because unlike most baristas, I was blessed with a great education,'' he says. ''But the way I was raised and what I believe is that if something is not right, you don't just walk away from it and leave it for the next person to fix.'' Besides, Grandpa was a truck-driving Teamster; it's in the genes. 
 Mr. Gross's group of baristas is affiliated with IU/660, a division of the International Workers of the World; the union, which represents retail workers, appeals to his anti-authoritarian side. ''It blends the social movement aspect with unionism, but it lets us make our own decisions. We didn't want to go from having corporate bosses to having corporate and union bosses. This way we sort of feel in control.'' 
 TOUGH to get a cup of coffee, though, when one hangs out with Mr. Gross, a sylph of a labor agitator who stands 5-foot-7 and figures he tips the scales (doesn't own one, can't afford it) at 135 pounds. Though he doesn't mind posing outside his workplace on a sweltering afternoon, he is loath to pop inside for a drink. He still has a job, but the work environment tends, he says, to be hostile since ''the union thing'' picked up steam. When, along with the morning coffee, he handed out informative fliers to customers two weeks ago outlining the baristas' gripes, a store manager called in the police, he says. ''They're probably itching to fire me,'' he speculates.
 So Mr. Gross leads the way to another, cheaper coffee shop, only to discover it shuttered. More walking leads to, what else, another Starbucks. The store at Fifth Avenue is jammed, and Mr. Gross, carrying a briefcase and out of uniform, decides he can risk an incognito appearance as a paying customer. He buses a table and gets in line for iced passion tea lemonade. At the cashier, he uses his employee discount, 30 percent. Such a perk! Has he no misgivings about badmouthing Starbucks while sitting inside one sipping its wares at a tidy discount?
 ''Come on,'' he says with a grin. ''You've got to take what meager crumbs they throw out at you.'' He leaves a nice tip for his nonunion brethren. He's convinced they'll see the light.

HEADLINE: States' Big Role in Phone Rates May Be Only a Cameo

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10 

 BODY:
Now comes the states' turn.
 For the next few months, state regulators could play an important role in setting wholesale telephone rates if the Supreme Court decides, as many expect, not to intervene and extend federal regulations that require the regional Bell companies to offer their rivals deep discounts for access to their networks. 
 Under a ruling by a federal appeals court in March, the rules will expire next week. The odds of intervention by the Supreme Court to preserve the rules grew longer on Wednesday when both the Bush administration and the Federal Communications Commission withdrew from the case and sided with the four Bell companies. The new state power would derive from the fact that there would be no regulations on the books; thus any change in rates would be subject to commercial negotiation and arbitration overseen by the states. 
 But their authority may be short-lived. In the long run, the new position of the commission and the Bush administration could make state regulators the biggest losers. 
 Officials say that eliminating the older rules, as the administration and commission hope and expect to happen, will most likely lead to the adoption of new rules that will strip the states of the broad discretion that the older rules granted them.
 On Thursday morning, Michael K. Powell, the chairman of the F.C.C. and a longtime critic of the regulations, told reporters that if the Supreme Court did not extend the old rules, the agency would soon begin preparing new ones. 
 ''My goal will be to do something that will limit disruption and will be as simple and as easy to execute as possible,'' he said after a commission meeting on other issues. ''There is competition, there is going to be more competition. It's going to be better than what we had before, and I'll even go so far as to say that this isn't a prediction, it's a promise.'' 
 Mr. Powell did not say what the new rules would look like, but he has repeatedly criticized a rate structure that he says delegates too much authority to the states. Commission officials and industry experts said they expected he would propose one national standard that would not give the states much latitude. 
 When a deeply divided commission approved last year the rules that the court struck down in March, Mr. Powell said that the majority had improperly invoked states' rights in a ''trivial misuse of a cherished constitutional precept.''
 ''The impulse to leave much more telecom policy to state commissions may run against the winds of technological change,'' he said at the time. ''Communications is converging; distance is fading as a meaningful construct in an Internet, cyberspace world; mobility is ascending. These are the circumstances that necessitate, at a minimum, a coherent national framework of rules. States can play important roles in such a regime, but I am of the view that primacy must rest with the national government.''
 Regulators from Arizona, California and Michigan joined the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners on Thursday in petitioning the Supreme Court to extend the rules and reverse the appeals court. The court is expected to rule on the petition next week. 
 Earlier this week, West Virginia joined three other states -- Connecticut, Michigan and Rhode Island -- in prohibiting any rate increases without state permission. Other states are expected to issue similar orders.
 State officials said that they expected the Bell companies -- Verizon Communications, SBC Communications, BellSouth and Qwest Communications -- to slowly raise their wholesale rates. Efforts by the federal government to pre-empt state authority could prove nettlesome for consumers, the officials said.
 ''It's like cooking the frog,'' said Loretta Lynch, a member of the California Public Utilities Commission. ''The Bells will turn up the heat enough to simmer the frog'' but not to kill it outright, she said. Eventually, however, ''some competitors will die off, and that's fewer choices to consumers.''
 Executives at the regional Bell companies dismissed the contentions of AT&T, MCI and other rivals that rates will rise, and said again on Thursday that they had no intention of increasing rates before the end of the year. They suggested any increases would be gradual. 
 ''AT&T's doomsday claims aren't very credible,'' said Jim Ellis, general counsel at SBC Communications. ''This is the third time the rules have been thrown out and each time you didn't have a 'Day After' scenario, as they say in the movies. There is an orderly process. 
 ''We have committed that at least through the end of the year we will not take any action to increase the wholesale rates,'' he said. ''People ought to relax and look at it on that basis. Beyond that, there is in our contracts a change-of-law process that requires notice and negotiations and eventual arbitration.''
 Bush officials continued to side with the Bells, questioning their rivals' assertions that rates would go up and competition would decline.
 ''The companies that are leveling those allegations have a strong say in whether those prices go up or not themselves,'' said Michael D. Gallagher, the acting head of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. ''I would suggest that threatening consumers is not a responsible way to grow their business or meet their needs.''
 But executives of the rivals disputed Mr. Gallagher's view.
 'This is a matter of math and economics,'' said Leonard J. Cali, a senior lawyer at AT&T. ''It is not a matter of posturing or advocacy. If rates go up, we may have simply no choice but to raise prices or pull out of some markets, and the decision-makers should know better. ''

HEADLINE: Behind the Ropes at Shinnecock, a Deep-Rooted Union Frays

BYLINE: By CHARLES McGRATH

 BODY:
Two of the most private and publicity-shy precincts on eastern Long Island are in Southampton, separated by about a quarter-mile of the Montauk Highway. One is the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, one of the oldest and most exclusive clubs in the country and host to this year's United States Open. The other is the Shinnecock Indian Reservation, an 800-acre peninsula that is home to some 500 tribal members.
 At the beginning of the driveway leading to the golf club, there is a big sign that says, ''Members Only.'' On the otherwise unmarked road leading into the reservation, there is a sign that says ''Private'' and ''No Trespassing.'' At neither place are people very keen on talking to outsiders.
 For more than a century, though, the histories of these two enclaves have been inextricably entwined. The golf club sits on land that was once owned by the Shinnecocks; it was built by Shinnecock laborers, and generations of Shinnecocks have worked there as greenskeepers or caddies. 
 The ties between the Shinnecock club and the Shinnecock tribe, and between certain members of each, grew so close, in fact, as almost to be familial. Since 1995, however, the last time the Open was played at Shinnecock, there has been a noticeable drifting apart; and the advent of this year's Open, which begins next Thursday, has deepened what amounts to a family quarrel.
 First, the golf club replaced a longtime superintendent who had a distinguished tribal pedigree, and then, as the tribe sees it, the Shinnecocks were deprived of some United States Open revenue they had been counting on. Meanwhile, the tribe has alienated not only some club members but other Long Islanders as well by aggressively pressing to build a casino on Shinnecock land. Lance A. Gumbs, chairman of the board of trustees of the Shinnecock Nation, said last month, ''We stopped being good little Indians, and that has made us into Public Enemy No. 1.''
 The Rev. Michael Smith, a Shinnecock who grew up on the reservation and is now the pastor of the Presbyterian church there, acknowledged that change was inevitable. ''But,'' he said, ''some of the newer club members don't have an appreciation of the depth and wealth of the relationship that has existed from the beginning of the golf course, from its inception.''

Tribe and Club, Together From Beginning
 Shinnecock Hills, which started in 1891, was the first American golf club to be incorporated, the first to maintain a waiting list and the first to build a clubhouse. The original 12-hole course was built by a Shinnecock work crew using horse-drawn road scrapers, and some holes incorporated old Shinnecock burial mounds as obstacles.
 The course was expanded to 18 holes in time for the second United States Open, which was held at Shinnecock in 1896. Among the entrants were two teenagers who lived on the reservation: Oscar Bunn, then 19, who was a Shinnecock, and 16-year-old John Shippen Jr., a young black man, whose father was the pastor of the Shinnecock church there.
 The day before the tournament was to begin, a number of the other players, mostly Scottish and English professionals, threatened to withdraw if Shippen and Bunn were allowed to play. The issue was not their youth, or their relative newness to the game, but their race.
 After Theodore Havemeyer, then the head of the United States Golf Association, declared that the Open would be played even if Shippen and Bunn were the only contestants, there were no defections, and the tournament went ahead as scheduled. The Open in those days was 36 holes back to back, and in the morning round Shippen shot a 78, which tied him, with three others, for first place and made him not only the first black man but the first American player to lead a United States Open. Shippen's second round began well, but he came unglued on the par-4 13th and eventually carded an 11. His second-round score was 81, good enough for fifth place and a check for $10. Bunn finished 21st.
 Smith now holds John Shippen Sr.'s pastoral post at the Presbyterian church. Smith's grandfather, George, was a greenskeeper at Shinnecock -- not at the old layout, but at a new course that was created on club property in 1931 by William Flynn. Of all the golf course real-estate in North America, it most resembles the windswept links land of Scotland and England. ''It's almost as if the Creator just dropped it down there and everything flowed naturally,'' Smith said.
 In the early 1950's, Michael Smith's father, Elmer, was the club's first full-time superintendent. He became a legendary figure, famous for his grass-growing genius, his probity, his decency, his way of treating everyone, caddies and members, with the same respect. When he died of a heart attack in 1980, the club, hoping to keep the job in the family, offered it to his son Peter (Michael's brother), a Dartmouth graduate who had grown up working on the course. Peter Smith, who had never intended to fill his father's shoes, prepared the course for both the 1985 and 1996 United States Opens. After disappearing from the Open rotation for almost a century, Shinnecock Hills re-emerged as something of a revelation to much of the golfing world -- a course of both exceptional difficulty and beauty.
 In 1999 the club nudged Peter Smith aside, ending three generations and 44 years of the Smith family connection, and in 2000 it hired Mark Michaud, who had been the superintendent at Pebble Beach. Smith's departure from Shinnecock was a sore point with many at the reservation, and the pain deepened when in December 2002 he died of a heart attack at 47.
 A spokesman for Shinnecock Hills said recently that Smith's history with the club was private. He insisted that the club continued to have good relations with the Shinnecocks and pointed out that two members of the tribe are employed there in key positions.
 Michael Smith said of his brother's departure from the club: ''You hear different stories. Some folks say that the course wasn't in the condition they wanted it to be in. That was one of the legacies that Peter had to live down from my father. My father was a very frugal man, so he saved the club tons of money. He would use equipment until you couldn't start it anymore. So they got spoiled. They were accustomed to maintaining a golf course on a shoestring budget.''
 According to figures from Golf Digest, which every two years ranks the top courses in America on a number of criteria, including course condition -- something that members of high-end clubs tend to fret over -- the Shinnecock Hills conditioning rating had been slipping at the end of Peter Smith's tenure, and went up again as soon as Michaud arrived. Shinnecock Hills now outranks its next-door neighbor and rival, the National Golf Links.
 In 1986 and 1995, the U.S.G.A. paid the Shinnecocks to use reservation lands for United States Open parking, and the money -- $90,000 in 1995 -- was something the tribe was looking forward to this year. Last winter, however, the U.S.G.A. decided instead to lease fields from a local farmer for parking. Steve Worthy, the U.S.G.A.'s director of operations at Shinnecock, said the U.S.G.A. had issues with the parking in 1995, foremost among them that the tribe made available five separate sites, and not one contiguous lot, which complicated the scheduling and routing of shuttle buses. There were also reports of vandalism and of one incident when a man, returning late to the lot, was accosted by some Shinnecocks who demanded that he pay ransom for his car.
 Gumbs, the chairman of the Shinnecock trustees, said last month that he objected to the way the tribe found out about the new plan. ''I picked up The Southampton Press and read that they wouldn't be using us,'' he said. ''That in itself was a slap in the face. You couldn't pick up the phone?''
 Gumbs also said that he thought the U.S.G.A.'s decision was politically motivated. ''We feel it was a backlash based on the casino issue,'' he said. ''Sitting in our shoes, how else are we supposed to look at this except that it happened at a time when we've come out of the box and are trying to make ourselves economically self-sufficient? It's a little too coincidental.''
 The casino issue is an immensely complicated one, much debated not only on Long Island but in Albany, where Gov. George E. Pataki has declared himself opposed. The complications start with the fact that the Shinnecock Nation, though it has treaties with New York State, is not federally recognized. A judge from the United States District Court, however, has agreed to hold a nonjury trial to address the tribe's status as a sovereign nation. His verdict could short-circuit the federal process and hasten the day that many Long Islanders dread -- when their already crowded highways are choked with cars full of gamblers.
 Dennis Suskind, a Southampton town councilman who, together with George Guldi, then a county legislator, tried to broker a compromise between the tribe and the U.S.G.A., sees no connection between the parking issue and the casino threat. ''What does the U.S.G.A. care about the casino?'' he said in a recent phone interview. ''They could care less. They come here once every 10 years, and then they leave.''
 In a phone interview, Guldi, whose family has connections with the Shinnecocks going back to the 1920's, said: ''When you boil it down, what it is is just American racism, pure and simple. They're not white enough.''

Signs That the Rift May End
 By the end of last week, as preparations for the Open intensified, some partial healing appeared to have taken place. By renting land to caterers and hospitality tents -- part of the vast army of camp followers that now swarms around any major golf event -- the tribe hoped to make up a good bit of the lost parking revenue. The U.S.G.A., meanwhile, invited Shinnecock children to participate in a junior golf event on Tuesday and had agreed to donate to the tribe some of the wood, carpeting, stairs and gravel left over after the tournament.
 ''They've put forth an honest effort,'' Gumbs said. ''They've acknowledged that they didn't handle everything appropriately, and they've gone a long way toward ending the rift.''
 The U.S.G.A., he added, had even welcomed his request that the tribe be allowed to perform a ritual prayer ceremony at the club on the morning before the tournament opened, but then permission was denied by Shinnecock Hills. ''I don't understand that,'' he said. ''I don't understand that at all.''
 The U.S.G.A.'s Steve Worthy said that the club and the U.S.G.A. had concerns about the ceremony. ''There's a matter of precedent here,'' he said. ''The U.S. Open doesn't have an opening ceremony, and we didn't feel this was the right time or opportunity.''
 In spite of everything, Michael Smith is still looking forward to this year's tournament. He will be rooting not for any particular golfer but for the course. He said he still recalled the night before the 1986 Open, which was won by Raymond Floyd with a score of one under par.
 ''I was just kind of out there by the clubhouse on the ninth green,'' he said. ''I was standing out there looking and it was an absolutely gorgeous site. The sun set purple and orange and everything was quiet.'' 
 Off to his right he imagined he saw his brother and Charlie Thom looking out at the golf course. Thom, another Shinnecock Hills legend, was the pro there from 1906 to 1955, and even after he retired he lived in a little cottage near the 14th tee.
 ''They had these smug looks on their faces,'' Smith went on, ''kind of saying, 'They think they're going to conquer our course, but you and I know better.'''

HEADLINE: Shares Are Modestly Higher, Up in a Short Trading Week

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Shares made modest gains yesterday, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index posting a third consecutive weekly gain, the longest such stretch since January. Energy shares led the market amid optimism that economic and profit growth would withstand rising commodity prices for crude oil.
 The S.&P. 500 advanced 5.14 points, or 0.45 percent, to 1,136.47. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 41.66 points, or 0.4 percent, to 10,410.10. The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index added 9.26 points, or 0.47 percent, to 1,999.87. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization stocks was barely higher, up 0.54 point, or nearly 0.1 percent, to 569.12. 
 For the week, the S.&P. 500 gained 1.2 percent, the Dow 1.6 percent and the Nasdaq 1.1 percent. Financial markets in the United States are closed today for the funeral of Ronald Reagan.
 Market breadth yesterday was positive, with five stocks rising on the New York Stock Exchange for every four that fell. Volume decreased to 1.21 billion shares from 1.28 billion on Wednesday, about one-fifth below the three-month daily average.
 An index of energy shares advanced 1.3 percent, the biggest gain among the S.&P. 500's 10 industry groups, as oil prices increased. 
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for July delivery rose 91 cents, to settle at $38.45 a barrel. on concern that attacks in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East might reduce world supplies.
 Exxon Mobil, the largest publicly traded oil company, added 53 cents, to $43.98. ConocoPhillips, the biggest refiner in the United States, climbed 95 cents, closing at $75.05.
 Drilling activity may improve faster than expected, James Stone, an analyst at UBS, wrote in a note. Mr. Stone raised his recommendations on half a dozen oil service companies to buy from neutral.
 BJ Services, which specializes in helping energy companies extract natural gas, added 72 cents, to $43.61. Ensco International rose 38 cents, to $26.52. Schlumberger advanced 48 cents, to $58.40. Nabors Industries rose 39 cents, to $41.70, on the American Stock Exchange. 
 Anadarko Petroleum, a Texas oil and natural gas producer, gained $1.40, to $57.48. The company said it would sell more than $2.5 billion in assets and buy back as much as $2 billion in stock to increase shareholders' returns.
 Elsewhere in the market, FedEx added 93 cents, to $76.94. It earned $1.36 a share in the fiscal fourth quarter, more than it had expected, as demand for shipments rose amid improvement in the global economy.
 The department store chain Dillard's rose $3.05, or more than 15 percent, to $23.23, the biggest jump in the S.&P. 500. Two analysts wrote in reports that the stock might be undervalued, based on May Department Stores' agreement to buy the Marshall Field's chain from Target for $3.24 billion.
 Among technology issues, Intel, the leading maker of semiconductors gained 24 cents, closing at $28.64. 
 A broadly positive view of the market was expressed by Steve Neimeth, who manages the $400 million SunAmerica Growth and Income Fund. ''Profit margins are coming in better than expected because of cost cutting and revenue growth,'' he said. ''These trends should continue throughout the year, as the market looks pretty cheap.''
 S.&P. 500 stocks trade at 17.5 times earnings compared with a ratio of 18.6 a year ago, even after a rally of 15 percent in the last 12 months.
 Shares of companies developing cancer treatments, including Genentech and ImClone Systems, dropped yesterday after The Wall Street Journal said that investors' enthusiasm for them was likely to diminish. Genentech declined 55 cents, to $51.75, and ImClone fell $2.87, or 3.6 percent, to $77.76.

Treasuries Edge Higher
By Reuters
 Treasury prices were slightly higher yesterday after an auction of 10-year notes showed strong demand, helping to offset inflation worries. A focus on inflation prevented a further rally after data for May on import prices showed a surge of 1.6 percent, twice what economists expected. 
 By late in the day, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond was up 4/32, to 98 22/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, declined to 5.47 percent from 5.48 percent late Wednesday. 
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of 10-year Treasury notes:

The 10-year notes mature May 15, 2014.

 The New York Stock Exchange does not close its doors for just anyone.
 Today, the exchange will close for the funeral of former President Ronald Reagan. Although the exchange began during George Washington's first administration and has outlived 39 of the country's 43 presidents, it has closed for a whole day only 13 times because of a president's death. The last time was on April 27, 1994, for the funeral of former President Richard M. Nixon. The deaths of four other people have resulted in days of observance: two vice presidents, Garret A. Hobart and James S. Sherman; Martin Luther King Jr.; and Queen Victoria. Former colonists also accorded such an honor to her son. The exchange closed at 11 a.m. on May 7, 1910, on news of the death of King Edward VII .
 Closings are not as routine as they used to be. When the exchange traded on Saturdays, it would often stay closed the day after a major holiday that fell on a Friday. In recent years, unforeseen events -- terrorism, snowstorms or power failures -- have been the main causes of closings. Now, the exchange notes special occasions by opening late or closing early or with minutes of silence rather than complete shutdowns.

Chart illustrates how many other special closings (CLOSED, PARTIAL CLOSE, LATE OPENING OR EARLY CLOSE) there have been for the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Living in Las Vegas

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 As a third-generation Las Vegan, businessman and father, I feel compelled to tell your readers about the Las Vegas you neglected in your May 30-June 4 ''American Dreamers'' series.
 Broken dreams and personal tragedies can be found in any major city in the country. You failed to capture our success stories, thriving economic climate and sense of community despite our city's young age.
 Las Vegas was founded in 1905 by pioneers with little more than a dream and a drive to succeed. Thousands continue to move here each month in search of a better life. We embrace these ''American dreamers,'' and watch their success stories unfold at every turn.
 Our community is home to nearly 1.7 million people. We raise our children in neighborhoods with parks and churches. We revel in our city's quality of life, moderate cost of living and vibrant economy, for which we receive constant accolades.
 As one ''American dreamer'' on behalf of thousands more, we are proud to call Las Vegas home.

HEADLINE: World Briefing Asia: Japan: Suicides At Record High

BYLINE: By James Brooke (NYT)

 BODY:
Suicides hit a record high of 32,082 last year as the economy struggled to emerge from a prolonged slump. It was the second year in a row in which suicides have risen, and the number represented a 1 percent increase over the 2002 level. Japan and the United States have roughly the same number of suicides, but the United States has more than twice the population of Japan. No religious prohibition exists against suicide in Japan. Historically, it has been seen as a way to escape failure. James Brooke (NYT)

HEADLINE: Several States Likely to Follow California on Car Emissions

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 10 

 BODY:
California's plan for sharp cuts in automotive emissions of global warming gases could eventually lead much of the coastal United States to turn to vehicles that are substantially cleaner, and by extension more fuel efficient, than those in the rest of the nation.
 This year, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Connecticut have said they intend to start following California's car rules instead of Washington's. New York, Massachusetts, Vermont and Maine already do so. 
 Together, these seven states, along with California, account for nearly 26 percent of the nation's auto market, according to R.L. Polk, a company that tracks auto registrations. Other states are also considering joining. One reason is that many states are now out of compliance on federal ozone emission regulations and see car tailpipes as a solution. Canada is also considering a similar approach on global warming. 
 Automakers from Detroit to Tokyo are concerned that these states, and potentially Canada, could form a potent bloc that has more demanding regulations than the rest of the country. 
 ''It would be a logistical and engineering challenge, and a costly problem,'' said Dave Barthmuss, a spokesman for General Motors. ''It's more cost effective for us to have one set of emissions everywhere.''
 Many steps remain before all this happens. But this week, the first details of California's plan, which is still in its early stages, were made public. The plan would require automakers to cut global warming emissions from their new vehicles by 29.2 percent over the next decade, phasing in from the 2009 to the 2015 model years. 
 California regulators are adamant that the plan is not a fuel economy measure because the federal government has authority over that issue. 
 ''This agency is required by law to address air pollution that affects public health," said Jerry Martin, a spokesman for the California Air Resources Board. "We only adopt emissions regulations," he said, adding that the plan "was never intended" to be a fuel economy regulation.
 There is no filter for carbon dioxide and other gases linked to climate change, in the way that catalytic converters can filter smog-forming particles. The only way to cut global warming emissions from cars is to use less fossil fuel. 
 Thus, the proposed cuts in emissions would have the side effect of requiring automakers to increase fuel economy by a range of mid-30 percent to mid-40 percent, experts say. 
 The national fuel economy average for new passenger vehicles was 20.7 miles a gallon in the 2003 model year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, down from a peak of 22.1 miles a gallon in 1987. A mid-30 percent improvement would put average fuel economy above 27 miles a gallon, meaning that cars, sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, taken together, would have to average the mileage of a Volkswagen Jetta.
 Such mileage is already achievable in larger vehicles, though the question is at what cost. Ford's new Escape hybrid S.U.V., coming out in the fall, is projected to get more than 30 miles a gallon.
 Automakers say such objectives would be extremely difficult and costly to achieve across their vehicle fleets. Eron Shosteck, a spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, cited a recent study that showed fuel economy remained far down on most shoppers' priority lists. 
 ''It's still behind cup holders,'' he said. 
 Other surveys, however, show high gas prices are making fuel economy a top-of-the-mind issue. And fuel-efficient hybrid electric cars have become sought after; many areas now have a six-month waiting list for the Toyota Prius. 
 Environmentalists say automakers would not even need technology as advanced as hybrid cars to meet the proposed California rules but could use combinations of simpler technologies and also curb horsepower. Over the last two decades, the average vehicle has doubled to about 200 horsepower from 100. 
 ''I feel very confident about these kinds of numbers, in terms of technical feasibility,'' said John DeCicco, an engineer and a senior fellow at Environmental Defense, an environmental group. ''It's a matter of optimally designing for efficiency as opposed to yet another round of horsepower wars.''
 The California Air Resources Board estimates the changes would add $1,047 to the cost of a vehicle by 2015, though additional upfront costs would be mitigated over time at the gas pump. 
 California's plan faces a long regulatory and legislative review process that will continue through next year. 
 And two considerable legal hurdles loom. 
 First, the E.P.A. recently ruled that carbon dioxide is not an air pollutant, which effectively meant that the agency decided it did not have authority to regulate global warming gases. California and other states, along with environmental groups like the Sierra Club, have sued to overturn the decision. The matter will be an important one because the E.P.A.'s decision could undercut California's ability to regulate global warming gases. 
 Second, the auto industry is expected to sue to block California's regulation from taking effect under the argument that it is pre-empted by the federal government's authority to regulate fuel economy. 
 There is also a question of whether states that use California car rules would automatically have to adopt the new regulations. 
 California has the authority to set its own air-quality rules because its rules predate the Clean Air Act. Other states can opt in to California's rules or stick with Washington's. Generally, they are not allowed to modify California's approach because that would create three sets of rules for the industry to deal with. 
 Legal experts said states that follow California's rules would most likely have to adopt California's new plan eventually or return to federal standards. 
 One state, New York, has indicated that it will follow California. 
 ''Let's work to reduce greenhouse gases by adopting the carbon dioxide emission standards for motor vehicles which were recently proposed by the State of California,'' Gov. George E. Pataki said in his state of the state address last year. 
 This week, Mike Fraser, a spokesman for New York's Department of Environmental Conservation, said, ''New York State is still committed to that goal.''
 Today, automakers generally certify all their light-duty vehicles to meet standards in all 50 states because the separate regulations are not far apart. But they have made cars to different emissions standands for different states in the past. 
 ''It certainly complicates things in terms of planning and distribution and lots of issues,'' said Michael Love, national regulatory affairs manager for Toyota.
 Roland Hwang, a senior policy analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said, ''Two cars are unfair, but it's unfair because all consumers won't have the opportunity to drive the cleanest vehicle possible.''
 ''If they only want to make one car,'' he said, ''clearly it should be a clean car, and that's the California car.''

HEADLINE: Jazz Impresario Tries New Idea: Jazz, Just Jazz

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF

 BODY:
George Wein is giving jazz a chance this year. For the 50th anniversary of his Newport Jazz Festival in mid-August -- now called JVC-Newport, since the Japanese electronics company for which it is named started sponsoring a number of his festivals in 1974 -- the titan of American jazz festivals is trying out a full schedule of the real acoustic thing. 
 For the uninitiated, this may seem like the opposite of news. A jazz festival putting on all jazz? Isn't that what jazz festivals are supposed to do? In fact, jazz festivals in general, including Mr. Wein's annual JVC Jazz Festival in New York, which opens on Tuesday, have slipped farther and farther afield, booking everyone from Led Zeppelin to James Brown under the comfortably adult (and sponsor-friendly) ''jazz festival'' umbrella.
 Mr. Wein accepts blame as the prime offender. Just as he originated the idea of the jazz festival, he also originated the idea of mixing up genres, both to reflect a shift in jazz listening tastes and to keep sales afloat. By the 1970's, when his company, Festival Productions Inc., became economically secure thanks to JVC, he had a year-round staff to support. 
 To celebrate this year's milestone in Newport, R.I., Mr. Wein had the idea to go serious: to categorize, to essentialize, to devote a whole festival to what put him on the map in the first place, in the days when Ellington, Monk, Miles and Mulligan regularly created a stir. And the idea is really winning: put jazz's best talent on the line -- leave the salsa, R&B, pop, rock and other genres to other festivals and see if the public appreciates the gesture. If the experiment goes wrong, if ticket sales are a disaster, then it goes wrong. Something has definitely been proved, and as he says, putting on good jazz is fun. It doesn't feel so much like work.
 At 78, Mr. Wein (pronounced WEEN) pays more attention to jazz in particular, and music in general, than most aficionados half his age. He is a musician himself, a pianist, and this does matter in treating his kind fairly: it is rare to come across anyone who has serious business quarrels with him. 
 He has been a legendarily fair boss in the jazz business, keeping a number of employees on the payroll even after they stopped working for him. His company president, John Phillips, has been with the company for 26 years. His director of public relations, Charlie Bourgeois, at 85 still handling press tickets to the festivals, is working for Mr. Wein for the 53rd year. 
 He understands the compounded importance of each jazz performer over time -- as with wine, another of his great interests. But Mr. Wein is also interested in what's new, and often asks his younger connections to keep him current. He doesn't care what he goes to see: a few months ago, he went to hear Tord Gustavsen, the young Norwegian pianist whose music is all stagey ebb tide, minor keys and crawling tempos. Mr. Wein got a kick out of it, marveling at the pious, docile vibe in the crowd.
 ''In the old days,'' he said, leaning over to whisper in his Boston accent, ''Erroll Garner and Art Tatum would play, and the music would just roll over the audience like waves, spreading joy all over the place. Now people just want to go to church.''
 The other day at the Cafe des Artistes, a regular lunch spot not far from the four-floor brownstone on West 77th Street where Festival Productions keeps its New York offices, Mr. Wein talked about the problems of spreading his company too thin.
 Each year, it produces 50 music festivals or aspects of concert halls' yearly programming. This includes JVC-New York and JVC-Newport, of course, but also the JVC Jazz Festivals in Seoul, Warsaw, Paris and Chicago. It also includes the Playboy Jazz Festival in Los Angeles; the Verizon Music Festivals in Washington, New York and Tampa Bay; and the enormous New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.
 ''Survival is the only thing that counts in the long run,'' he said, working on his customary lobster salad. ''If you can survive with your credibility, then you've accomplished something. I mean, look, I could have been a rock promoter and made a lot of money. I didn't want to do that. I made enough money, thank God. I earned it basically on my own terms. But I never realized that you could make money until sponsors came along. The credibility we'd been working on all those years always brought media notice. And then the opportunity for media notice was picked up by sponsors.''

One-Stop Booking
 JVC has been an unusually loyal, nondictatorial sponsor since 1974. The company does want the major events to be presented in large spaces, however, and in New York City that generally means Avery Fisher Hall, Carnegie Hall, the Beacon Theater and Town Hall. (In jazz, big concerts often tend to be medium-size affairs, but apart from the 1,100-seat Alice Tully Hall, which can be prohibitively expensive to rent, there is a shortage of medium-size theaters in New York.)
 To increase the number of events, JVC-New York has increasingly worked with jazz clubs and small concert spaces around the city like the Village Vanguard, which from June 22 to June 27 has booked the pianist Uri Caine with six different bands. By joining up with the JVC Jazz Festival events, the Village Vanguard gets exponentially increased promotion.
 Because Festival Productions can in some cases make eight offers to a band at once, for different high-paying festival concerts, many jazz musicians have become dependent on it. In some cases, the gigs fall in a neat sequence on the calendar. This year, a new all-star quartet materialized, with Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Dave Holland and Brian Blade. Festival Productions booked it for JVC-New York, then immediately afterward for Freihofer's Jazz Festival in Saratoga, N.Y., and then a month later for JVC-Newport. Festival's contract does not stipulate that the band accept more than one of the offers, but it makes an artist-manager's job easy to do business for three festivals with only one concert producer.
 Booking at such high volume, Festival Productions has done less and less hands-on producing in the curatorial sense of creating bands that didn't exist before or setting up special concerts. This trend has led to a kind of starchiness in the festivals, try as the organization might to offset the Big and Expected with smaller, potentially more groundbreaking acts in opening slots or on second stages.
 In adding the three Verizon Music Festivals around the country to its roster, the company has waded into today's true mass-pop tastes, sometimes with negative results. It booked Missy Elliott for Carnegie Hall on April 29 in a Verizon-New York festival. It would have been the first hip-hop show at Carnegie Hall -- something for the books.
 But Ms. Elliott's fans had already had four opportunities to see her in the New York area this spring on tour with Beyonce and Alicia Keys, and perhaps they weren't so impressed by the idea of hip-hop in that rarefied atmosphere. Ticket sales were disastrous, and Ms. Elliott canceled two days before the show. Festival Productions had to absorb its rent and advertising losses, but it saved money by canceling the show and not having to pay the full hall fee.
 But JVC-Newport's programming has been reinvigorated this year, and JVC-New York seems firmer as well. The New York festival, which ends June 26, has fewer events and a higher percentage of them are noteworthy.
 On June 20, Ornette Coleman's quartet will play a double bill with the singer Abbey Lincoln, a program that reflects some of the best and most lasting changes in jazz from the early 1960's. Whereas the festival in past years has perhaps leaned excessively on tributes to the deceased, the one explicit multi-artist tribute concert this year is to Nina Simone, whose importance in feminism and black liberation stretched beyond jazz and beyond music; the participation of the new R&B trio Floetry as well as the author Toni Morrison underscores the point.
 The two big pop acts at JVC-New York are K. D. Lang and Lou Reed, significant artists in the adult-music continuum whose names have the ring of good taste. And then there's the fourth JVC-New York performance at Carnegie Hall in six years by the bossa-nova pioneer Joao Gilberto, who has become a perfect match for both that theater and JVC's target audience.

The Number Crunch
 Mr. Gilberto's concert illustrates some festival economics. For the last eight years, JVC has provided around $2.7 million in sponsorship annually for all the JVC festivals produced by Festival Productions, Mr. Wein said. Around $800,000 of that tends to be allotted to the New York festival, which always loses money. The less the festivals lose on concerts, the more Mr. Wein's company, with 70 full-time employees in four offices, can keep for its own overhead.
 Including travel and lodging expenses, Mr. Gilberto's fee works out to around $70,000. The gross take on ticket sales, for a full house, would amount to around $150,000. If the hall sells out, as it could, Festival Productions will make money. It takes around $40,000 to rent Carnegie Hall, and advertising costs are about $25,000. That could leave $15,000 profit -- not much, but better than the usual red ink. 
 Ornette Coleman also charges in the range of $60,000, Mr. Wein said. But despite through-the-roof critical approval, Mr. Coleman isn't always a sell-out artist in New York. ''We know we'll not make money,'' Mr. Wein said. ''If we gross $100,000, I'll raise a flag.''
 Mr. Wein has made some wise financial decisions since accepting sponsorships. For the company and himself, he has bought real estate in New York, Connecticut and near Vence, France, as well as paintings by Romare Bearden, Jacob Lawrence and other black American artists that have risen steeply in value over 30 years. And some good years for the various festivals, including a record-breaking 2002 because of Bob Dylan's appearance at the Newport Folk Festival (which Festival also books), have sweetened the company's central fund.

A 'Blaze of Glory'
 From planning to finished schedule, Newport 2004 has been different. Right at the end of last year's Newport festival, Mr. Wein started imagining what he wanted for the 50th-anniversary year. ''If this is my last year, I want to go out in a blaze of glory, the way I came in,'' Mr. Wein said. ''I hope it's not my last year, but I'm acting like it is.''
 So the company's producers assembled a wish list of performers. Mr. Wein approved some and vetoed others. Some of his vetoes are based on practical experience. And certain artists have rules. Keith Jarrett and Oscar Peterson usually don't like to play outdoors. Sonny Rollins usually doesn't like to play on multiple-artist bills. Pat Metheny plays his own concerts, with his own sound and lights. And so on.
 But the idea of a special Newport festival that was all ''real jazz'' caught on with many other artists. Dan Melnick, artistic director at the company, who is responsible for most of New York and Newport's bookings, said he waited an unusually long time -- until December -- to fax out offers to artists and received commitments unusually quickly. Tickets for the festival went on sale in late March, six weeks earlier than normal.
 The festival will cost the company a great deal more to mount than the usual Newport festival, in artist fees, advertising, on-site staff and stages. But its strict focus on jazz could impress audiences, and perhaps it could have consequences for other jazz festivals around the world. (Switzerland's enormous Montreux Jazz Festival, for example, gives its jazz bookings a decidedly lower profile than its pop acts.)
 The Newport bookings are mostly first-tier names: the Hancock-Shorter group and Ornette Coleman, but also Peter Cincotti, Dave Douglas, George Shearing, the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, Lee Konitz, Dave Brubeck, Dianne Reeves, Branford Marsalis and Harry Connick Jr. A third stage of solo-piano sets will be added to the customary two, with performers like Jason Moran, Mulgrew Miller, Peter Martin, Bill Charlap, Geri Allen and Jamie Cullum. Several special groups have been assembled, including one organized around the pianist McCoy Tyner; it includes the drummer Roy Haynes and the saxophonist Michael Brecker, playing John Coltrane's music.
 At his large desk on West 77th Street, poring over proofs of the book of essays and program notes to be published for the Newport festival, Mr. Wein looked up and chuckled. ''The only thing wrong with my business,'' he said, ''and I guess one of the problems with life in general, is the inevitability of the same problems that come up every year. You could write a book about the problems: the rain, some artist's a pain.''
 ''That inevitability is always there,'' he said. ''It gets very boring sometimes.'' He smiled and looked contented.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Africa: Nigeria: Report Faults Shell

BYLINE: By Heather Timmons (NYT)

 BODY:
Royal Dutch/Shell's oil operations in Nigeria play a role in feeding the continuing conflict in the country, a company report has found. Nigerian labor unions were in the second day of a nationwide strike to protest the recent increase in gasoline prices there, the latest in a decade of demonstrations protesting how little of the profits reaped from the oil-rich country reach some of its citizens. The strike has halted transportation and closed stores and schools, but has not yet affected the amount of oil flowing from the region, energy experts said. Nigerian oil made up 11 percent of crude imports to the United States in the first quarter of 2004, according to PFC Energy, a Washington consulting firm. ''We sometimes feed conflict by the way we award contracts, gain access to land and deal with community representatives,'' said the Shell report, an annual review of the effect the company's policies have on sustainable development.

HEADLINE: China's Soft Landing

 BODY:
It's not all up to Alan Greenspan. When it comes to the global economy, Zhou Xiaochuan and Liu Mingkang may be as influential, even if most Americans have never heard of them. Mr. Zhou, the governor of China's central bank, and Mr. Liu, its top banking regulator, are central to the country's efforts to cool its overheated economy. 
 China, the world's most populous nation, has been growing at a torrid pace for some time, and there is a gold-rush aspect to its boom that Beijing needs to address. The aim is to achieve what economists call a soft landing, turning that headlong rush into continued, sustainable growth. The alternative is a hard landing, also known as a crash.
 More than the recent dot-com bubble, China's boom resembles America's feverish industrialization of the late 19th century. Much as the United States did then, China has a dynamic economy that lacks a developed financial system. If it's serious about its ambitions, the Communist government will need to foster the creation of mature and independent capital markets, even though it would mean relinquishing more control.
 China has averaged 10 percent annual growth in recent years, lifting millions out of poverty. The arithmetic of the boom is staggering. Ten million Chinese enter the work force each year, and some 350 million people are expected to migrate from the countryside to cities in the next quarter-century. China's exports have doubled in less than five years, though the country's growing appetite for commodities to fuel its industrialization means that it has an American-size trade deficit. The market for mortgage loans grew by a staggering 40 percent last year. Spending on new steel mills tripled from 2002 to 2003, and China now consumes nearly 30 percent of the world's steel products. 
 Much of the exuberance is rational, but plenty is not. In a frothy environment where money is in ample supply, and where assessing credit risks remains a sketchy concept, the banking system may have to write off more than a third of its outstanding loans. Part of the soft-landing strategy of Mr. Liu and Mr. Zhou is to make the banks more parsimonious. 
 Beijing was hoping to push its growth rate down near the 7 percent mark this year, but the economy still grew at an annual rate of 9.7 percent in the first quarter. Economic data released yesterday for the month of May, however, suggests that Beijing is managing to slow things down a bit. While there is still reason to worry about whether a soft landing is achievable, China's strengths should not be underestimated. What's more, inflation remains relatively tame for such a supercharged economy. And the bulk of foreign investment pouring into China is devoted to long-term productive projects.
 Everyone has a stake in China's industrialization. China is now one of the world's twin economic engines, alongside the United States. China's growing appetite for everything from soybeans to iron ore is responsible for an across-the-board surge in commodity prices. And not only is the Chinese market helping to perk up Japan and South Korea, but it has also become important to such faraway nations as Brazil. The whole world, in other words, is anxiously watching to see whether China remains the next big thing or becomes the next big bust.

HEADLINE: An Economic Legend

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
In the movie ''The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,'' a reporter defends prettifying history: ''This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.'' That principle has informed many of this week's Reagan retrospectives. But let's not be bullied into accepting the right-wing legend about Reaganomics. 
 Here's a sample version of the legend: according to a recent article in The Washington Times, Ronald Reagan ''crushed inflation along with left-wing Keynesian economics and launched the longest economic expansion in U.S. history.'' Actually, the 1982-90 economic expansion ranks third, after 1991-2001 and 1961-69 -- but even that comparison overstates the degree of real economic success. 
 The secret of the long climb after 1982 was the economic plunge that preceded it. By the end of 1982 the U.S. economy was deeply depressed, with the worst unemployment rate since the Great Depression. So there was plenty of room to grow before the economy returned to anything like full employment.
 The depressed economy in 1982 also explains ''Morning in America,'' the economic boom of 1983 and 1984. You see, rapid growth is normal when an economy is bouncing back from a deep slump. (Last year, Argentina's economy grew more than 8 percent.)
 And the economic expansion under President Reagan did not validate his economic doctrine. His supply-side advisers didn't promise a one-time growth spurt as the economy emerged from recession; they promised, but failed to deliver, a sustained acceleration in economic growth.
 Inflation did come down sharply on Mr. Reagan's watch: it was running at 12 percent when he took office, but was only 4.5 percent when he left. But this victory came at a heavy price. For much of the Reagan era, the economy suffered from very high unemployment. Despite the rapid growth of 1983 and 1984, over the whole of the Reagan administration the unemployment rate averaged a very uncomfortable 7.5 percent.
 In other words, it all played out just as ''left-wing Keynesian economics'' predicted.
 In the late 1970's most economists believed that eliminating the high inflation then prevailing in the United States would require inflicting a lot of pain: the economy would have to go through an extended period of high unemployment and depressed output. Once the inflation had been wrung out of the system, the unemployment rate could go back down. And that's exactly what happened. In fact, it's instructive to put a graph showing the actual track of unemployment and inflation during the 1980's next to a figure from a 1978-vintage textbook showing a hypothetical disinflation scenario; the two look almost identical.
 Ronald Reagan didn't decide to inflict that pain. The architect of America's great disinflation was Paul Volcker, the Fed chairman. In fact, Mr. Volcker began the process in 1979, when he adopted the tight monetary policy that caused that record unemployment rate. He was also mainly responsible for the recovery that followed: it was his decision to loosen up on the money supply in the summer of 1982 that set the stage for the rebound a few months later.
 There was, in short, nothing magical about the Reagan economy. The United States did, eventually, experience an economic miracle -- but not until Bill Clinton's second term. Only then did the economy achieve a combination of rapid growth, low unemployment and quiescent inflation that confounded the conventional economic wisdom. (I'm aware, by the way, that this plain statement of fact will generate an avalanche of angry mail. Irrational Clinton hatred remains a powerful force in American life.)
 It's a measure of how desperate the faithful are to believe in the Reagan legend that one often reads conservative commentators claiming that the Clinton-era miracle was the result of Mr. Reagan's policies, and indeed vindicated them. Think about it: Mr. Reagan passed his big tax cut right at the beginning of his presidency, and mainly raised taxes thereafter. So we're supposed to believe that a tax cut passed in 1981 was somehow responsible for an economic miracle that didn't materialize until around 1997. Apply the same timing to the good things that happened on Mr. Reagan's watch, and you'll discover that Lyndon Johnson deserves the credit for ''Morning in America.''
 So here's my plea: let's honor Mr. Reagan for his real achievements, not dishonor him -- and mislead the nation -- with false claims about his economic record.

HEADLINE: Legacy of Reagan Now Begins the Test of Time

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10 

 BODY:
Franklin D. Roosevelt once defined great presidents as those who were ''leaders of thought at times when certain ideas in the life of the nation had to be clarified.''
 By that reckoning and most others, Roosevelt himself earned a place on the list of greats for rallying the nation in the Depression and leading it to the brink of victory in World War II. Washington, who bent to the hard work of nation-building; Lincoln, who saved the union; and Jefferson, who codified some of its ideals, are other universal choices. Not by coincidence, all four have monuments in Washington.
 But what of Ronald Reagan, whose weeklong farewell ceremonies, culminating on Friday in a funeral at the National Cathedral and burial in California, have stirred such emotion and such largely laudatory comment? What will history, with its privileged vantage point far from the heat of partisan battles, conclude about him? 
 Clearly, Mr. Reagan died a respected, perhaps even a beloved man, although the affection was far from universal, as is true for any public figure. In office, his popularity, though dented, survived the Iran-contra affair, but popularity is never a reliable test of greatness. Harry S. Truman, now counted among the near-greats if not the greats, retrospectively admired for his prosecution of the cold war, left office with an approval rating of only 23 percent. Warren G. Harding, now disdained, whose stated ambition was to be remembered as the country's ''best-loved president,'' came close to that goal after his sudden death in 1923.
 It could be argued that Mr. Reagan's greatest triumphs came in his role as chief of state rather than as chief of government. He was often ignorant of or impatient with the policy minutiae that preoccupy most occupants of the Oval Office, sometimes with unfortunate consequences (as when Oliver North ran amok in the Iran-contra affair, for instance). But his extraordinary political gifts carried him through -- his talents as a communicator, his intuitive understanding of the average American, his unfailing geniality even after being hit by a would-be assassin's bullet, his ability to build and sustain friendships across partisan lines (as with Tip O'Neill, for instance).
 Those gifts -- and his conviction that words counted for far more in politics than mere deeds -- enabled him to convince large majorities that as long as he was in charge, it would remain ''Morning in America.'' They made it possible for him to redraw the nation's political map, moving the center so abruptly to the right that even Bill Clinton would proclaim the end of ''big government,'' and to remold his party in his own image. They gave him the eloquence to lead the country in mourning after the Challenger disaster and to celebrate ''the boys of Pointe du Hoc'' near Omaha Beach on the 40th anniversary of D-Day.
 Vice President Dick Cheney hailed Mr. Reagan as ''a graceful and a gallant man,'' and more than that, ''a providential man'' who provided precisely what the nation and the world needed at a crucial moment.
 ''But he was not a great president,'' said Sean Wilentz, professor of history at Princeton University who was a vocal opponent of Mr. Clinton's impeachment in 1998. ''He was master at projecting a mood; he could certainly rally the country. He would have made a great king, a great constitutional monarch, but we do not have that form of government.''
 Success in war underpins the claims to greatness of many presidents. Jackson wins the plaudits of historians for broadening the character of American democracy by extending the franchise. But he was a celebrated soldier long before he became president, as were Washington, Theodore Roosevelt and Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose standing among historians and other commentators has increased markedly since he left office. Lincoln, F.D.R., Truman and James K. Polk (the victor in the Mexican War) were all wartime commanders in chief.
 Mr. Reagan spent World War II, the global conflict fought and won by his generation, making training films in Hollywood. But he came to power as the cold war was nearing a denouement, and he did all he could to hasten the process by beefing up the American military and then, in Berlin, boldly challenging Soviet leaders to ''tear down this wall.'' After that, it would have been hard for Mikhail S. Gorbachev to believe that Americans had lost their will to resist Soviet power, and he joined with Mr. Reagan to bring the long struggle to a conclusion. It was the result of 45 years of aggressive allied containment, but the commander in chief, as always, got much of the credit.
 Without doubt, that will form a very important part of Mr. Reagan's legacy, as one aspect of his vision. In his book ''Hail to the Chief: The Making and Unmaking of American Presidents'' (Hyperion, 1996), the historian Robert Dallek lists vision as a sine qua non of presidential greatness, along with ''pragmatism, ability to achieve consensus, charisma and trustworthiness.'' Few will deny Mr. Reagan's trustworthiness or his immense charisma, matched only in the modern era by F.D.R. and John F. Kennedy, and he demonstrated his pragmatism in rolling back some of his huge 1981 tax cuts with two tax increases when the cuts failed to produce as much revenue as he expected.
 Mr. Reagan had another vision, but he fell well short of the ''ability to produce consensus'' behind it, then or now. Much of the country, including most of those who are physically, economically or otherwise disadvantaged, deeply resented and still resent his insistence that government is the problem, not the solution. Severe and continuing cutbacks in government services to the poor and vulnerable resulted, and the gulf dividing rich from poor widened.
 If Mr. Reagan's celebrated optimism lifted the veil of malaise that darkened the Jimmy Carter era, it also obscured major problems. Many missed Mr. Carter's burning commitment to civil rights and liberties at home and human rights abroad. African-Americans and trade union members felt particularly aggrieved, as did many Jews, who resented Mr. Reagan's participation in a ceremony in 1985 at a German cemetery where Nazi SS troopers were buried.
 To some degree, history's verdict is shaped by the values of the time in which that history is written, and whom it is written by. H. L. Mencken, ever wary of pompous speeches and empty promises, rated Calvin Coolidge highly because, as he once wrote: ''There were no thrills while he reigned, but neither were there any headaches. He had no ideas, and he was not a nuisance.''
 Reputation is also shaped by perspective. A group of American and Australian political figures and others, assembled in Washington for a conference this week, disagreed sharply on Woodrow Wilson -- the foreigners called him a flop, largely because of his rigid and eventually counterproductive idealism, while the Americans (like most historians) held him in higher esteem. Historians may say that Kennedy held office for too short a time to achieve true greatness in the presidency, but for many around the globe he still embodies the best of the United States, which is why there are streets named for him and pictures of him hanging in houses all over the world.
 So far at least, Mr. Reagan has achieved no such status overseas, although as president he was held in far more esteem in Europe than George W. Bush is. His brand of radical conservatism had a counterpart in Britain under Margaret Thatcher, but it has achieved little success elsewhere.
 Some presidents leave behind records so contradictory as to cloud generalization. Richard M. Nixon's foreign-policy achievements, most significantly his rapprochement with Beijing, were eclipsed in his final years in office by domestic-policy failings and his evident shortcomings as a moral leader. Vietnam blackened Lyndon B. Johnson's reputation and forced him from office, despite his tremendous achievements in domestic policy, notably in lifting the cruel yoke of segregation from black Americans.
 It is not entirely clear yet what those two presidents will most be remembered for -- what one achievement or failure will attach to their names, at least in popular history, as the crusade against the trusts, the ''malefactors of great wealth,'' attaches to Teddy Roosevelt's, and Credit Mobilier and other scandals attach to Ulysses S. Grant's, all but wiping out his role as a war hero.
 The ''Reaganauts,'' as one of them said, have been out all week seeking to burnish their man's legacy on television and in print. But hagiography will not determine their leader's ultimate standing, and whether he is entitled to be called ''great.'' Only what the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. called ''the cool eye of history'' will do that, many years hence.

HEADLINE: UNDECIDED VOTER BECOMING FOCUS OF BOTH PARTIES

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Alan J. Borsuk contributed reporting from Wauwatosa, Wis., for this article, and Ellen Harris from St. Louis.

DATELINE: ARDMORE, Pa., June 10 

 BODY:
They are more likely to be white than black, female than male, married than single, and live in the suburbs rather than in large cities. They are not frequent churchgoers nor gun enthusiasts. They are clustered in swing states like Ohio, Michigan and here in Pennsylvania. And while they follow the news closely, they are largely indifferent to the back and forth of this year's race for president.
 These are what pollsters describe as the rarest of Americans in this election year: the undecided voters. And with aides to President Bush and Senator John Kerry increasingly confident about their ability to turn out their base voters, and thus create an electoral standoff in as many as 15 states, these people have become the object of intense concern by the campaigns as they try to figure out who these voters are and how to reach them.
 Only about 5 percent of the voting public is undecided, about one-third of what is typical at this point in the campaign, according to several recent polls. That figure increases to about 15 percent when pollsters include supporters of Mr. Kerry and Mr. Bush who say they might change their minds. In addition to those who are torn between the two major-party candidates, and possibly Ralph Nader, there is a sizable number of Americans who are deciding whether to vote at all. 
 Here in this Philadelphia suburb, as well as elsewhere across the nation, the undecided voter was the rare exception in hours of interviews that produced vociferous declarations of support for Mr. Bush or Mr. Kerry. ''I am very torn,'' said Marge Pyle, 52, a Republican who works as an administrative assistant at Bryn Mawr College. ''I really -- I just don't know who I'm going to vote for.''
 Carol Ferring Shepley, a college instructor in St. Louis who voted for Mr. Bush in 2000, and who is in many ways an archetype for this kind of voter, said: ''I am really totally undecided. At this point, I couldn't vote for either of them.''
 Aides to Mr. Bush and Mr. Kerry described this thimbleful of voters as a source of worry to the campaigns because they are disengaged from the presidential contest and thus less susceptible to traditional tools of political persuasion.
 At the same time, many of them are closely following the news of the day, pollsters said, meaning they might well be rushed to one side in the last days of this contest by a major event -- more turmoil in Iraq, good economic news at home -- that is beyond the control of either campaign.
 Mary Beth Cahill, Mr. Kerry's campaign manager, said that if the two parties succeeded at turning out their base vote, as both sides said now appears increasingly likely, ''this election looks as though it's going to come down to these late deciders.''
 ''We all read the daily polling,'' Ms. Cahill said, adding. ''You have to try every possible way to reach them.''
 Both campaigns are struggling to adjust to this complicated electoral equation. Ms. Cahill said her campaign believed one of the most effective ways to reach many of these voters was on radio shows, and had geared its surrogate speaker program to make Kerry advocates available for many radio shows.
 The Bush campaign in May produced an advertisement on education featuring Laura Bush, appealing to suburban women, and placed it on the Web site of The Philadelphia Inquirer in an effort to reach voters in Philadelphia suburbs like this one.
 ''You can't get messages to them just by broadcasting on the major nets,'' said Matthew Dowd, a senior Bush strategist, referring to television networks. ''Primarily, the way most of them make up their mind is with glimpses here and there that they catch of the president and Kerry.''
 And who are they? Undecided voters are likely to be younger, lower-income and less educated than the general electorate, said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster. 
 These voters are more likely to put themselves at the center of the political scale: Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said approximately 45 percent of undecided voters described themselves as moderate, compared with 23 percent of the general electorate.
 As a group, undecided voters in some ways mirror the general electorate.
 But pollsters and analysts said an in-depth examination of undecided attitudes had identified shared characteristics of these voters that could be of concern for both candidates, but particularly for Mr. Bush.
 These voters consider the environment an important issue, suggesting, some Democrats said, an opening for Mr. Kerry this fall. They tend to support abortion rights, and while they oppose gay marriage, they do not share the intensity of Republicans of the issue, said Andrew Kohut, who runs Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.
 Here in Ardmore, Joan Donoho, 61, an accountant who was a convention delegate for George H. W. Bush in 1980, and who voted for Mr. Bush in 2000, said she was unsure who to vote for, in part because of Mr. Bush's strong identification with opponents of abortion rights.
 ''I haven't decided -- my concern is that Bush is too conservative,'' Ms. Donoho said. ''I'm disappointed that the son isn't more like the father.'' 
 On two often revealing behavioral indicators, undecided voters were less likely than Mr. Bush's supporters to attend church services or own guns, findings that pollsters said should be a matter of concern for the White House. A poll of undecided voters in swing states by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania released last week found that 33 percent of these undecided voters went to church weekly or more, compared with 40 percent of respondents at large.
 Ellen Plotkin, 67, a retired surgeon's assistant who lives near here, said that she attended synagogue about twice a year, supported restrictions on gun ownership and was against restrictions on abortion. Ms. Plotkin described herself as a Democrat who voted for Mr. Bush in 2000, but who this year was put off by some of his social policies and the war in Iraq. ''But I'm not sure about Kerry,'' Ms. Plotkin said. ''Based on all the things I've heard about him, he seems wishy-washy.''
 By large numbers, undecided voters, like the general electorate, think the nation is heading in the wrong direction. And in another measure of incumbent distress closely traced by pollsters, just 44 percent said they approved of Mr. Bush's job performance, the Annenberg poll found.
 ''To me, the most significant figure is that only 35 percent think things are going in the right direction,'' said Mark Penn, a pollster who released a survey of swing states on Thursday for the New Democratic Network, a Democratic advocacy group. ''That means there is tremendous impetus for change.''
 Like most Americans, these voters generally supported Mr. Bush's decision to go into Iraq. But they are more likely to say that troops should be brought home right away, according to the Annenberg survey. And some pollsters said that the high number of married suburban women, many with children, in this group could be a matter of concern for the White House because of the demands on the military to fight the war.
 ''The draft issue is a huge concern -- I have a teenage son,'' said Susan Wood, 43, an undecided voter interviewed in Columbus, Ohio.
 From a tactical point of view, undecided voters present a special challenge because of their disinterest toward politics. The Annenberg poll found that 55 percent said they were not following the campaign closely, compared with 32 percent of the general electorate in swing states, which has produced a bit of a conundrum for both campaigns. 
 ''Sometimes I just don't even want to watch the news,'' Ms. Pyle said. She said advertisements did not affect her because she did not believe what the candidates were saying.
 Ms. Plotkin said: ''When I hear, 'I authorized this ad,' I tune out.'' 
 Outside Milwaukee, Karen Pauli, 52, said she saw no reason to pay attention to the contest before autumn. ''Until then, I just ignore it because it's so much confusing hot air,'' Ms. Pauli said, adding: ''I'm not even sure who Kerry is. Too early to tell.''
 A senior Kerry adviser describes this segment of the electorate as ''the classic picture of a relatively low-information, relatively disengaged political person -- less likely to know about the candidates, less likely to think that politics is relevant to their lives at all.'' 
 ''These are the people you focus on all the way through,'' this adviser said. 
 As a rule, undecided voters ultimately go against the incumbent, rejecting someone they know in favor of someone they do not, a line of history noted by Mr. Kerry's advisers in arguing that the situation augurs well for the senator.
 But Mr. Bush's campaign manager, Ken Mehlman, said that in this supercharged electoral atmosphere, voters would make their decisions based on security and economic concerns, and that would hurt Mr. Kerry. And Mr. Mehlman argued that Mr. Kerry's wavering supporters were much more likely to drop away once they got to know Mr. Kerry and his record, or at least got to know him the way Mr. Bush is trying to portray him.
 ''The common theme among undecided voters is that they are not typically motivated,'' Mr. Mehlman said. 
 ''We're talking about winning the war on terror and making the economy stronger. Our base voters care about that, and the swing voters care about. He's talking about why Bush is bad. His appeal is to his base, but undecided voters are motivated by different ideas and different issues.''

Fee Payments Questioned As Insurer Inquiry Widens
Three big insurance companies, Aetna, Cigna and MetLife, said that they had received subpoenas from the New York attorney general as an investigation widened into the field of employee benefits -- health, disability and group life insurance.
 Investigators have been concerned that payments from insurance companies to brokers for exceeding sales goals and keeping down claims costs may undermine the brokers' loyalty to the corporations that pay them fees and commissions to arrange coverage. Industry executives said similar fees were widely paid to brokers and consultants by employee benefits companies. [Page C2.]

An Oil Enigma Involving Reserves
Historically, proven oil reserves and production at big oil companies have moved in tandem. Lately, however, production is falling despite rising reserves. As consumers, economists and governments wonder whether oil supplies can keep pace with rising demand, production trends at the industry's public companies are not promising. [A1.]

Hearing Ordered in I.R.S. Case
A federal appeals court ordered a hearing into a Nevada couple's claim that Internal Revenue Service agents and Justice Department lawyers in a courtroom audience ''glared'' at jurors in a successful effort to intimidate them into reaching a guilty verdict. The decision could result in the overturning of the tax evasion convictions of Dr. Martin P. Rutherford, a Reno chiropractor, and his wife, Nanja. [C5.]

Inflation Is Slowing in China
The credit squeeze by China is bringing inflationary pressures under control. It may possibly be creating new headaches for the government, however, as an abrupt decline in the consumer price index in May indicated. [C4.]

S.E.C. Studying a Halliburton Unit
The Securities and Exchange Commission is formally investigating allegations that a subsidiary of Halliburton was involved in paying $180 million in bribes to get a natural gas project contract in Nigeria. Vice President Dick Cheney was chief executive of Halliburton at the time. [C2.]

Judge Removed From Yukos Case
A Moscow arbitration court removed a judge the government considered sympathetic to the troubled oil company Yukos. [C4.]

Nikkei and Other Asian Gauges Dip
The Nikkei 225 stock average fell 0.4 percent, to 11,526.82. The Taiex index, in Taiwan, dropped 2.3 percent, while the Kospi index, in South Korea, had the biggest decline among Asian benchmarks, sliding 3.9 percent. The benchmarks slipped after government reports showed the confidence of consumers and manufacturers declining. In Europe, the DAX index, in Germany, slipped 0.2 percent. The CAC 40, in France, dropped 0.3 percent. The FTSE 100, in Britain, lost 0.1 percent. [C4.]

Suburban Salons Lure Urbanites
Hair salons in suburban areas are attracting business from New York City residents because the prices are a little cheaper and because there is less attitude. [B1.]

Airbus Wins $2 Billion Order
Airbus won a $2 billion order for 20 A330-200 planes from China Eastern Airlines. The airline has an option to buy 10 more planes. [C4.]

Altria Reiterates 2004 Forecast
Altria reiterated its forecast for 2004 earnings of $4.50 to $4.60 a share. The forecast includes special items like anticipated charges for the restructuring of Kraft Foods, potential charges for a tobacco agreement under discussion with the European Commission, and the effect of an expected lower tax rate. [C2.]

Financial Markets Closed
Financial markets in the United States were closed yesterday because of Ronald Reagan's funeral. They will reopen on Monday.

HEADLINE: Far Left Gathers For Weather Report

BYLINE: By CHARLES McGRATH

 BODY:
The far left in America has not had a lot to celebrate recently. So a good-size crowd, and not all of it graybeards, turned up at Columbia Law School on Thursday evening for a party in honor of a new book, ''No Surrender: Selected Writings of an Anti-Imperialist Political Prisoner,'' by David Gilbert. 
 Mark Rudd, who as a member of Students for a Democratic Society led the antiwar demonstrations that shut down Columbia in the spring of 1968, was there, along with an assortment of Black Panther alumni and former members of the Weathermen. But there was also a large representation of young people, one of whom came in on a skateboard. Several of them said they were fans of Sam Green and Bill Siegel's recent documentary film ''The Weather Underground.'' Women slightly outnumbered men at the party, which must say something or other about the changing nature of the radical soul. 
 Mr. Gilbert himself was unable to attend, except via a recorded message in which he sent a ''loving anti-imperialist hug'' to everyone. He has been a prisoner in the New York State correction system since 1982 and will not be eligible for parole until 2056. His 23-year-old son, Chesa Boudin, was on hand, though -- tall, handsome and articulate and just back from Merton College, Oxford, where he is finishing his first year as a Rhodes Scholar. Mr. Boudin (whose first name means ''dancing feet'' in Swahili) is left-wing royalty -- or he would be if the left wing did not disapprove of royalty.
 Mr. Boudin's mother is Kathy Boudin. In 1981 she and Mr. Gilbert, then a leader of the Weather Underground, and several others were arrested after a notorious incident in Nanuet, N.Y. The group attempted to hold up a Brink's truck, though Mr. Gilbert later said it had not been a robbery, strictly speaking, but an ''armed action'' intended to ''expropriate'' funds that properly belonged to the black community. A Brink's guard was shot to death while loading moneybags into the back of the truck, and two police officers were later killed at a roadblock in nearby Nyack, N.Y. 
 The radicals were all charged with robbery and second-degree murder. Two of them, Ms. Boudin and Samuel Brown, hired conventional lawyers and defended themselves in court. The others, including Mr. Gilbert, boycotted their own trial, claiming that they belonged to the Provisional Government of New Afrika and should be treated as prisoners of war according to the Geneva Conventions. 
 Ms. Boudin, who eventually expressed remorse and sought forgiveness, was paroled last summer and reunited with her son, who was just 14 months old when she was sent to jail. Mr. Gilbert, unrepentant, still claims to be the political prisoner of an imperialist United States government.
 Time has not been kind to the reputation of the Weather Underground. Much of the rhetoric seems stale now, and many of the old heroes, like Cesar Chavez and Timothy Leary, are on their way to being demoted or forgotten. The group began quarreling back in the 70's, after three of them had been blown up in a Greenwich Village town house that had been turned into a bomb factory. Most members -- like Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn, who together raised Chesa Boudin -- eventually resurfaced, got jobs, mortgages and charge cards, and began to lead more or less conventional lives. Even while clinging to some of the old revolutionary ideals, these former members of the Weather Underground have for the most part renounced violence, especially the tactic of bombing civilian targets. 
 In a memoir he published in 2001, ''Fugitive Days,'' (Beacon Press), Mr. Ayers hedged a little, fondly recalling parts of his underground life and repudiating others. About bombing, he said he could not entirely rule out the possibility of someday doing it again. But the book came out not long after 9/11, and partly because of remarks like this, it failed to win a wide or sympathetic audience. The terror attacks, it seemed, had cast an unforgiving pall over the history of the Weather Underground and removed whatever traces of revolutionary glamour that still clung to it.
 In his book (Abraham Guillen Press/Arm the Spirit) Mr. Gilbert says that he was stunned and anguished by the attacks on the World Trade Center -- though he hastens to add that the United States is still the greatest terrorist of all, enforcing a ''political and economic system that kills millions of human beings worldwide every year.'' The message of his book is essentially antiwar, however, and most of the chapters are devoted to issues like AIDS, the environment and prison reform. There are even some flashes of humor, as in a letter that he sent to Chesa in college suggesting as the title for a biology term paper ''A Study in Parasitism: The Battle With Blood-Soaked U.S. Capitalist Patriarchal White Supremacist Homophobic Imperialism and Its Running-Dog Lackeys and Evil Gentry!''
 Matt Meyer, one of the party's organizers, said he thought that Mr. Gilbert's basic politics were unchanged. ''But questions of tactics, strategy,'' he said, ''these are things everyone has thought about. David Dellinger used to talk about how Gilbert was coming back into the pacifist fold. I don't think I'd go that far, but David certainly has a different analysis of violence than he had in 1981.''
 By the usual standards of Upper West Side book parties, this was a tame and remarkably abstemious affair. At the end there was actually some wine left over. There was some schmoozing but no talk of agents and advances. The guests mostly sat quietly and listened to a series of speeches and readings from Mr. Gilbert's book. The word ''comrade'' was used a lot, and there were numerous references to other prisoners, especially Mumia Abu-Jamal, the Pennsylvania journalist who is on death row, on charges related to the shooting of a Philadelphia police officer.
 The second-biggest cheer of the evening went to Susan Rosenberg, a former member of the Weather Underground pardoned by President Bill Clinton. She said, ''We hated Reagan, damn it,'' and went on to tell a story about a friend who stopped smoking pot the day of President Ronald Reagan's inauguration because he knew ''things were about to get serious.''
 The biggest and warmest cheer went to Chesa Boudin, who mentioned that he was supposed to be studying for exams and that his father had told him not to come to the party. ''But one of the things my dad taught me was to question authority,'' he said. ''So I immediately bought a plane ticket.'' After reading from the end of his father's book, he gave a moving and eloquent speech citing Che Guevara's belief that ''the true revolutionary is guided by great feelings of love,'' and ended by challenging everyone in the audience to ''join in a lifetime struggle for freedom.'' 
 No one mentioned the three people killed in the robbery.


CORRECTION-DATE: June 16, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article in The Arts on Saturday about a party at Columbia Law School to celebrate the publication of a book by David Gilbert, an imprisoned former member of the Weather Underground, referred imprecisely to Cesar Chavez and Timothy Leary. While they are heroes of many leftists, they were not members of the Weather Underground.

HEADLINE: Amid Scrutiny, Intrigue Envelops Rowland Friend

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
For two days this week, Robert V. Matthews, a wealthy businessman, was the focus of nearly as much attention as Gov. John G. Rowland. A Connecticut House committee weighing whether to recommend the governor's impeachment pored over everything from Mr. Matthews's golf games and phone calls to his having secretly helped the governor rent and sell a condominium, at enviable prices.
 Yet, for all the scrutiny, Mr. Matthews remains something of a mystery, even to those who know him well. They are left wondering if he was as close to Governor Rowland as he bragged, or if he was just name-dropping, a concession that the governor's in-house lawyer, Ross H. Garber, tried to elicit from one witness. They wonder if his connections with people like the governor grew out of his well-publicized success in business or whether he was successful because he was connected. And most intriguing, they wonder if he even qualifies to be counted among the superrich.
 Reached on Friday, his lawyer, Hope C. Seeley, declined to comment. 
 An examination of Mr. Matthews's past shows a passion for big talk and even bigger spending on antiques and other trophies, from homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and Nantucket, Mass., to an original copy of the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights transaction is now caught up in litigation. A review of his business practices shows a penchant for highly leveraged business deals that sometimes end in bitter litigation.
 He has even been angrily denounced by a former fiancee, an heiress to the Rollerblade fortune, for using her money to buy himself a yacht called the ''Bon Vivant,'' a $158,000 wooden Indian, and a Mercedes that he gave her as a gift. She claimed he had also used her money to bail out a troubled marina he owned in Florida.
 After the fiancee, Jennifer J. Naegele, retained lawyers in early 1995 who documented that he had spent $5 million of her money in 39 days, Mr. Matthews agreed to classify the expenditures as a ''loan.'' He repaid most of the money later that year. But last year, he told The Hartford Courant that her claims were ''total lies'' and reflected a ''very painful breakup.''
 Ms. Naegele's allegations about ''this most unpleasant chapter'' of her life, as she described it, were contained in correspondence that was recently produced by the governor's office in response to subpoenas from the impeachment panel and a parallel federal investigation into the governor's conduct.
 ''Suffice to say,'' wrote Ms. Naegele, in one of the more restrained outpourings to Mr. Matthews's lawyers, ''there are diverse opinions about Mr. Matthews's reputation, for which he alone is accountable.''
 She conceded in her letters that she might have been naive but still felt duped. ''Mr. Matthews repeatedly bragged to me, my parents and my family that he was worth $80 million to $100 million,'' she wrote. Her own investigation concluded the correct figure was less than $15 million.
 In October 1995, Ms. Naegele also documented her disgust with Mr. Matthews in a letter to his relatives and others explaining why she had ended the relationship. It is not clear how this and other letters ended up in the possession of the governor's office, and neither Ms. Naegele nor her lawyers could be reached on Friday.
 What is clear is that her characterization of Mr. Matthews is at odds with representations that Mr. Rowland has made recently about the businessman, according to documents and testimony presented at this week's hearings.
 Mr. Matthews, 46, has said he first met Mr. Rowland more than 20 years ago in Waterbury, where Mr. Rowland grew up. Mr. Matthews had gone to Connecticut to make his fortune in real estate after dropping out of the University of Massachusetts.
 He narrowly escaped prosecution in 1993 when Mayor Joseph Santopietro of Waterbury was convicted of taking kickbacks. Mr. Matthews's criminal lawyer at the time, Richard R. Brown, said that he persuaded the federal government not to prosecute Mr. Matthews for making a cash payment of $25,000 to the mayor. 
 That brush with trouble did not stop Mr. Matthews from expanding his sights. He entered into several leases with state agencies while Lowell P. Weicker Jr. was Connecticut's governor. And during Mr. Rowland's first term, with the blessing of the state's Department of Public Utility Control, he paid very little to acquire the former SNET building in New Haven. Roughly three years later, he sold it for $27.5 million.
 As his fortunes rose, he remained close with the governor and his wife. He played host to the couple in July 1995 aboard the Bon Vivant and allowed the governor to vacation at his home in Palm Beach in 2001. The governor later paid a fine and restitution for that trip and others, which violated the state's ethics regulations.
 Occasionally, Mr. Matthews asked a favor of his own.
 One such time, according to testimony before the impeachment committee on Wednesday, came while Mr. Rowland played golf with Mr. Matthews in October 2000.
 A Pennsylvania company, Pinnacle Foods, was considering hiring Mr. Matthews as its financial adviser after he promised to help secure millions of dollars of financial incentives from Connecticut so the company to move into one of his buildings in New Haven. Michael D. Queen, a Pinnacle executive at the time, said in a deposition introduced at the hearings that the governor had called him from the golf course to vouch for Mr. Matthews.
 Mr. Queen's deposition, taken in late 2002 during a lawsuit brought by Mr. Matthews, described the conversation in detail. Mr. Queen said the governor told him, ''I was in good hands with Bob Matthews and he could get the job done for us and that he had a lot of dealings with Bob, felt very comfortable with Bob, that the state was looking for jobs and that Bob had told him a lot about the company and that he looked forward to, you know, working with us and getting the project completed.''
 Seconds later, Mr. Queen reported, Mr. Matthews got on the phone and said, ''See, I told you I had a relationship with Rowland. I'll get this thing done for you.''
 Documents show Pinnacle hired Mr. Matthews the following month, entitling him to stock that at the time was valued at $2.7 million as his fee.
 Andrew B. Melnick, an investigator for the impeachment panel, testified that Mr. Queen said Mr. Matthews drove him around Connecticut in an effort to burnish his credentials as a well-connected businessman. Mr. Melnick said Mr. Queen described being shown the carriage house on Mr. Matthews's property in Middlebury, where Mr. Rowland lived briefly after separating from his first wife. 
 Mr. Melnick also testified that Mr. Queen quoted Mr. Matthews as saying that he ''bought the governor's condo,'' a reference to a Capitol Hill condominium that the governor sold for a $15,000 gain. In March, the buyer, Wayne Pratt, pleaded guilty in federal court to a tax charge stemming from the purchase. He told prosecutors that he was fronting for Mr. Matthews, a friend and client in his antiques business. 
 Other testimony presented at the impeachment hearing showed that the governor vouched for Mr. Matthews on at least one other occasion.
 The assistance came in early 1997, a crucial time for Mr. Matthews because he had financial pressures of his own. Besides having to pay an angry fiancee in 1995, Mr. Matthews was also paying Robert L. Hughes, the former president of Fabricated Metal Products in Naugatuck.
 The two had clashed often over Mr. Matthews's business practices, ever since Mr. Matthews bought the company in 1989. Litigation ensued and Mr. Hughes settled the case in December 1993 in exchange for a promise that Mr. Matthews would pay him $950,000 over seven years.
 In late 1996, Mr. Matthews applied for financial assistance from the state's quasi-public economic development authority on behalf of Fabricated Metal Products. Staffers at the Connecticut Development Authority who reviewed the application noted that the owner of the company, Mr. Matthews, had been taking out ''excess rent.'' Board members also had qualms, memos show.
 But at another board meeting in January 1997, one board member changed his vote to ''accommodate the governor,'' as he put it in his affidavit. As a result, Mr. Matthews secured a guarantee from the state that clinched $16 million in private financing for the company.
 To mark the occasion, Mr. Matthews and his bankers at Norwest enjoyed a celebration dinner in April 1997. Mr. Melnick testified that four participants at the dinner recall Mr. Rowland making an appearance at the dinner.
 At the time, Mr. Matthews also wanted a $1.15 million loan from the state for another company, New Haven Manufacturing. A former executive of Fabricated Metals, who was there that night, remembers the governor reassuring the private bankers that ''the state will do its part'' on the second deal if they did theirs, according to Mr. Melnick.
 Documents released by the impeachment panel show that the state did approve the second deal on June 18, 1997, six days after the governor sold his condominium to Mr. Matthews's friend.

HEADLINE: Digging in Folklore, Unearthing Science

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J. 

 BODY:
Adrienne Mayor, known as a folklorist, has a story for each of the objects inside her curio chest: the gila monster stuffed by her great-grandfather, the skeletons, a Zuni fetish in the shape of a dinosaur and casts of mastodon teeth collected by Abenaki Indians in 1739 along the Ohio River, among others. 
 The casts, though, are one of Ms. Mayor's favorite curiosities because they represent the first American fossils ever studied by scientists. 
 ''It all comes back to the question that is at the center of my research: what are the first inklings of science?'' said Ms. Mayor, a short 58-year-old with black wire-framed glasses, a gentle manner and a musical voice. ''All these stories I collect are based on observation and interpretation, which is what science is. Science didn't just burst on the scene, but it wasn't noticed because it was written in mythological language.'' 
 Ms. Mayor was talking in the living room of her home on a quiet dead-end street in this leafy community. Although she lives in a university town, she came late to scholarship after spending most of her professional life as a printmaker and freelance copy editor. ''I never even thought about writing a book until I was 50 years old,'' she said.
 But when Ms. Mayor's first book, ''The First Fossil Hunters: Paleontology in Greek and Roman Times'' (Princeton University Press), came out four years ago, this late-blooming outsider with no advanced degrees caused something of a sensation among high-ranking anthropologists, paleontologists, geologists and others. She used Roman and Greek texts to argue that some fossils were used to support or create myths about strange creatures in the ancient world.
 ''Art historians think that Ms. Mayor may well have solved the puzzle of the Corinthian vase depicting Heracles shooting arrows at the head of the monster of the Troy legend,'' John Noble Wilford wrote in The New York Times in 2000. She noticed that the mysterious monster's head closely resembled the skull of an extinct giraffe.
 Now Ms. Mayor is at it again. She said her third and latest book, a combination of history, archaeology, folklore and old-fashioned detective work, would be the first scholarly attempt to set the record straight about Native American contributions to paleontology. 
 American museums often juxtapose Indian artifacts with dinosaur remains, Ms. Mayor said, but curators never seem to make the connection between local native cultures and the evidence of remarkable creatures from another age that the Indians had encountered on their lands. (''The message you get is that both are extinct,'' she said.) So she took on the task of documenting the extensive paleontological knowledge of many Indians, expanding a historical record that showed that they often served as sources and guides for early fossil expeditions. 
 But many of the Native Americans' contributions were either lost or dismissed as myth as paleontology sought to become a more formal science, she explained. Sometimes they were ignored because of racist ideas about Native Americans, Ms. Mayor said. And because Native American history is largely passed down orally, much of it was simply not written down. Her corrective journey took her everywhere from museums in Paris to Indian reservations around the United States. She drove more than 8,000 miles, her companions several small wire-bound notebooks, as well as a sleeping bag, water and food.
 Ms. Mayor ended up finding many of the native people's explanations for the fossils on Indian reservations, where residents were surprisingly forthcoming. Sometimes she literally went door to door, seeking medicine men and traditional historians, hoping to make a connection with people who often regard their stories as personal possessions. 
 ''In Pine Ridge, S.D., I knocked on the door of Johnson Holy Rock,'' she recalled, referring to an 87-year-old Lakota historian. ''I just knocked on the door, and he let me in. He talked to me for two and a half hours. He wanted to talk about Crazy Horse. His father was there with Custer; he was just a little boy. He recalled an old story about warriors' watching thunder in the valley and finding the carcass of a creature they'd never seen before, a gigantic rhinoceroslike beast.'' 
 The Comanche people in Oklahoma, she said, told stories about grandmothers' sending them out to find the bones of monsters, which they would grind into a powder for medicine or mix with water to set bones.
 ''They said you could tell if it was the right bone if it stuck to your tongue,'' Ms. Mayor said. Researching that report, she discovered that paleontologists do indeed lick bones to tell whether they are real fossils, because the real ones cling to the tongue. (Fossil bone is hydrophilic, which means that it absorbs moisture.) 
 ''I expect a little controversy with this book because of the continuing tension, quite raw, between paleontologists and Native Americans,'' Ms. Mayor said. 
 There is a continuing debate between the two groups over who owns the fossil-rich land (and what's inside it) and over who can interpret those findings, she explained. Some traditional Native Americans do not believe in digging beneath the earth's surface or in disturbing fossils.
 That battle plays out against an ugly history of scholars' taking Native American skulls and turning them over to natural history museums. She said some paleontologists told her that they feared that Native Americans would try to reclaim some of the fossils now in museums as cultural artifacts belonging to their people.
 But the two groups are not as far apart as they think, Ms. Mayor insisted. Each believes there is something valuable to learn from fossils. One idea that she likes, suggested by some Native Americans, is to build museums right over the fossils, on the reservations. It would help the reservation economy and allow museum visitors to see the actual bones right in the ground. (The view would depend on soil erosion and on how much dirt the paleontologists removed.)
 ''I think she is very courageous to take on the archaeological and anthropological establishment,'' said Vine Deloria Jr., a leading Native American scholar and professor emeritus of history at the University of Colorado, Boulder. ''From our correspondence, I feel it will be a well-researched book asking piercing questions.''
 Ms. Mayor said she was mostly surprised and delighted by the interest in her work, which captivates not just scientists but also schoolchildren who attend her lectures. In August the History Channel plans to broadcast a show (as yet untitled) about the first fossil hunters, based on her first book.
 One of Ms. Mayor's admirers is Barry S. Strauss, a professor of history and classics at Cornell. He said Ms. Mayor was ''one of those people with a way of flying in under the radar, and then suddenly it seems as if her presence was there all along.'' He described her as both modest and exuberant. 
 ''Before Mayor, it seemed outlandish that Greeks and Romans collected fossils, much less based their myths on them,'' Mr. Strauss said. ''Now it seems obviously true. Before Mayor, poison arrows and man-made plagues seemed a far cry from ancient warfare, but now it looks like they were always waiting in the wings.''
 Ms. Mayor, who has a bachelor's degree in classical legend from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis -- she invented the major by combining her interests in history, science and folklore studies -- explained: ''I was talking to classicists and archaeologists to point out how interesting this all was. I saw a pattern that nobody else saw.''
 Her second book, ''Greek Fire, Poison Arrows and Scorpion Bombs: Biological and Chemical Warfare in the Ancient World'' (Overlook Duckworth, 2003), was also well received, exciting scholars like Robert Cowley, a founder and former editor of MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History. It didn't hurt that the book came out post 9/11, after anthrax became a household word, and there was a resurgence in scholarly interest in the origins and history of war. 
 ''The books are intriguing,'' said Michael Novacek, the curator of paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History, in Manhattan. ''They do have a detective flair, so they make fascinating reading. She takes evidence and matches it with ideas in an insightful way.''
 Mr. Novacek said that while he did not agree with all the connections that Ms. Mayor makes (like that between griffins and the dinosaurs in the Gobi Desert), he respected her for the originality of her views and for inspiring scholars to find a fresh way of intertwining history and paleontology. 
 Ms. Mayor's new book, ''Fossil Legends of the First Americans,'' to be published by Princeton next spring, comes at a challenging time in her life. In December she was told she had breast cancer and underwent surgery and chemotherapy. Most of her hair has fallen out. The support of her husband, Josiah Ober, a professor of ancient Greek history at Princeton, has been invaluable, she said, as have the understanding and empathy of others as she has pushed back deadlines.
 ''It's ironic that I would have researched all those poisons, and now I experience it firsthand,'' she said evenly, sitting in front of the curio chest, a jaunty beret covering her head. She said she was now looking ahead, considering a book on the Amazons, even as she indulges in the introspection that often comes with illness or finishing a big project.
 ''I didn't expect all this attention to this field,'' Ms. Mayor said, coming back to the constant theme of her short, surprising career. ''I'm an outsider and ordinary person with ordinary questions but the determination to find the answers.''

HEADLINE: Newark Bond Sale Advances an Arena

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NEWARK, June 11 

 BODY:
The city moved a step closer to building a downtown hockey arena for the New Jersey Devils as the Newark Housing Authority raised $200 million in a bond sale to help pay for it.
 The sale was handled on Thursday by Citigroup and several smaller institutions less than two days after a judge ruled that residents did not have the right to vote on the financing arrangement in a referendum. 
 The sale is expected to be completed on June 24. But two city councilmen, Luis Quintana and Augusto Amador, got an appellate judge to agree to hear a request for a temporary restraining order that would stop the sale process until any litigation involving it is complete.
 The Housing Authority is to pay off the bonds over the next 33 years using annual lease payments of $12.5 million from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for Newark's marine terminal.
 Mayor Sharpe James sees the arena as the centerpiece of Newark's downtown redevelopment.
 Newark plans to spend $210 million on the arena, which it would own. The Devils would spend $100 million.

HEADLINE: In a House Campaign With Personality, One Candidate Has the Microphone

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW

DATELINE: SEATTLE, June 11 

 BODY:
Even before a popular radio talk show host entered the contest, the race to fill a Congressional seat in a middle-class area east of here was already considered one of the nation's most competitive, a crucial November test of the Democrats' ability to capture seats in swing districts and regain some footing in the House of Representatives. 
 One high-profile novice was already running for the seat, in the Eighth Congressional District, which opened when the Republican incumbent, Jennifer Dunn, abruptly retired this year. He is Dave Reichert, a 53-year-old Republican, the charismatic King County sheriff best known for his role in solving the case of the Green River Killer, who murdered almost 50 women, terrifying the Seattle area for nearly two decades. 
 Keenly aware of Sheriff Reichert's formidable celebrity and the importance of the district to Democrats, the Washington State Democratic Party recently recruited Dave Ross, 52, the spunky, smooth-talking baritone who is host of a well-known CBS morning show on KIRO Newsradio, which he, in his signature booming and lyrical tones, tags as ''Crusaders for Common Sense.'' His commentaries are heard nationally on the CBS Radio Network. 
 ''Spreading drive-by wisdom to the masses,'' says Mr. Ross, who also sings political parodies on the air and performs in amateur theater productions in Seattle.
 Mr. Ross's name recognition positions him well for a political duel with the sheriff, even as his refusal to go off the air has prompted criticism by his Democratic opponent, Alex Alben, 46, a high-tech businessman from Mercer Island, and major newspapers. 
 But Mr. Ross, who also lives on Mercer Island, says he promised the radio station that he would continue the show for six more weeks before signing off late next month after filing his election papers. 
 ''Welcome to the fray, Dave Ross,'' read the headline of an editorial in the Seattle Times on May 25, a few days after Mr. Ross announced his candidacy, ''Now get off the air.''
 Ms. Dunn, who is close to President Bush and was one of the state's more influential Republicans since first being elected in 1992, had easily fended off Democratic challengers in the Eighth District. But other state Democrats, including Gov. Gary Locke, have done well there, Al Gore narrowly won the district in 2000, and Democrats are hopeful they can capture the seat, despite early polls that show Mr. Reichert with strong support. 
 The question of whether radio and television personalities can remain on the air while they campaign for office is not new. Among the most notable examples, Jesse Ventura, the former Minnesota governor, had a radio talk show but went off the air in 1998 as soon as he filed his election papers, with executives of his station saying the move was out of fairness to the election process. Patrick J. Buchanan, who was a co-host of CNN's ''Crossfire'' in 1995, left the show when he announced that he was running for president in the 1996 election, although he was criticized for using the show to build his campaign between 1992 and 1995.
 Adding to the kerfuffle over whether Mr. Ross's decision to keep broadcasting gives him an unfair advantage, Mr. Alben broadcast his own campaign advertisements on Mr. Ross's show two weeks ago. In them Mr. Alben said: ''The Alex Alben for Congress campaign paid for this 60-second ad. But when Dave Ross talks about the issues, he gets $72,000 worth of free air time every day.''
 Mr. Ross was unmoved by the advertisements, he said, and did not acknowledge them on the air, as part of his promise not to mention the race during the show. And he sounds generally impervious to criticism of his decision to stay on the air until he files his candidacy papers, saying that as a talk show host he is used to being in the hot seat.
 ''I took some heat for this,'' he said. ''But I've taken heat all my life.''
 He added, ''If it hurts me, it hurts me.''
 Mr. Ross said he had resisted running for office until recently because he thought, ''Who is going to elect me, because I've ticked everyone off?'' But he said he now felt a ''call to service,'' and the Democratic Party made clear that it was eager for him to run.
 Mr. Alben, whose campaign says he has raised $600,000, far more than the other candidates, has picked up endorsements from several key Democrats, including the governor, for the primary on Sept. 14. Mr. Alben is a former vice president of RealNetworks, a Seattle company that streams audio and video through the Internet. 
 Once Mr. Ross files the papers, his opponents -- including several other lesser-known Democrats and Republicans -- would be entitled, under federal communications law, to free equal air time. That would amount to three hours a day, five days a week, since Mr. Ross's show is broadcast from 9 a.m. to noon weekdays. Mr. Ross, taking calls in his studio on Friday, quipped that perhaps Sheriff Reichert, Mr. Alben and he could be co-hosts. 
 But the station has already decided it will take Mr. Ross off the air at that point, said Ken Berry, its manager. 
 ''It would be my goal to keep him on the air as long as possible,'' Mr. Berry said, adding that Mr. Ross's ratings put him comfortably ahead of Rush Limbaugh in the Seattle region in the same time slot. ''He's very popular with the audience.''
 And in this case, Mr. Berry, added, ''the law is pretty clear.''
 Federal election law, unlike communications law, is murkier. It prohibits a host who is a candidate from promoting his campaigns and soliciting contributions on the air, but is less clear on whether a candidate who is talking about politics or other issues is in fact promoting his candidacy, said Lawrence Noble, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign contributions, and a former lawyer for the Federal Elections Commission. 
 Mr. Alben contends that Mr. Ross's show, with its focus on politics, amounts to an illegal campaign contribution from the station because Mr. Ross is free to discuss many issues -- the economy, the war with Iraq, trade -- that affect his district. ''Under federal election law, we all play by the same rules,'' he said. ''I'm playing by the same rules, and to have a fair election, common sense says that no candidate should have a special advantage.''
 The Alben campaign has no immediate plans to file a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, campaign officials said. ''It's up to Dave Ross if he wants to do the right thing,'' said Ben Vaught, Mr. Alben's campaign manager. 
 Some experts on federal election law say Mr. Ross's candidacy has highlighted gray areas.
 ''When someone is discussing the issues, you cannot distinguish their campaign from their role as a commentator,'' Mr. Noble said. ''It would be one thing if he were a D.J. playing songs and not discussing issues, but a talk show host -- there's clearly a problem if you're running for office at the same time.'' 
 Sheriff Reichert has not taken sides in the dispute between his Democratic rivals and says he is confident of his own success. 
 ''I don't really care what Dave Ross does,'' he said in an interview. ''He can stay on the radio, he can start his own TV show. It really doesn't matter to me. I'm just going to continue what I'm doing.''

HEADLINE: Drivin' That Dynaflow

BYLINE: By VERLYN KLINKENBORG

 BODY:
Mid-60's popular radio was a welter of youthful voices, just as it is now. But every now and then a disc jockey would work Ray Charles, who died on Thursday, into the rotation, and it was like hearing directly from Father Time. I could never figure it out. The voice was so adult, so yearning and playful, so self-contradictory -- reedy and smooth, high-pitched and grumbling at the same time. By then, a song like ''What'd I Say (Part I)'' was already an oldie, recorded in 1959 when Ray Charles was (still? already?) in his late 20's. And yet it sounded like more of a rave-up than even the early Yardbirds could muster. 
 The beauty of teen pop is that it believes that love belongs only to the very young. Maybe so, but with one vocal phrase Ray Charles could make it plain that real need -- the real complexity of sexual passion -- comes with age. He was singing many of the same words as the bands I listened to, but he meant something entirely different. Even his piano said so. I don't know what I would have done as a kid if I'd heard a song like ''Greenbacks,'' about the dire economy of love, or ''It Should've Been Me,'' that ode to sexual envy. Songs like that were far too grown-up for young ears, far too full of the blues.
 Ray Charles made every kind of American music his own, and he repaid every kind of American music with his keen attention. You could hear the country and the city in his songs. You could hear Los Angeles and Dallas, New York and Seattle, the dirt roads of Georgia and Florida, the rundown brick facades of a hundred neighborhoods.
 Watching him play -- the rigid swaying of his body, the tight stuttering percussion of his hands on the keyboard -- was enough to convince you that no one would ever get to the bottom of what he knew about his art. He would never be able to explain it. He would just have to play his way through the whole catalog of American music, and we would get to listen to him reinvent it, song by song.

HEADLINE: One Journal Of Oil Industry Covers More Than Just Rigs

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: HOUSTON, June 11 

 BODY:
With energy supplies tight around the world and prices bobbing near record highs, many eyes are on the oil and gas industry. And the industry's eyes are on an irreverent weekly printed on salmon-colored paper with a supermarket-tabloid taste in cover photos. 
 For energy executives, Upstream, edited in English each week from newsrooms in Oslo and London, has become a must-read, like Advertising Age or Variety or American Lawyer in their respective fields, and not only for its extensive news coverage of oil and gas developments and trends around the world. Upstream has also made a point of upending the stereotype of an eye-glazing trade journal. 
 ''I don't know anyone in the oil business that doesn't get it,'' said Rogers Beall, whose Houston company, First Exchange, represents small national oil companies from West Africa. ''They call you all sorts of insulting things when your name's in there, and they're a little risque, but you don't want to risk not reading it.''
 Not bad for a newspaper created eight years ago that has yet to turn a profit for its owners, NHST, a publishing concern that also owns Norway's main business newspaper, Dagens Naeringsliv, as well as TradeWinds, an English-language weekly for the international shipping industry.
 No small part of Upstream's appeal comes from its offbeat humor, cheeky headlines, and photographs that sometimes seem to have only the most tenuous connection to the accompanying articles -- like a close-up of pelicans with an article about a gas field off Mauritania that happens to be named Pelican. 
 Sometimes the approach gets Upstream, which costs $15 a copy, in trouble with its readers. The cover of the April 2 issue, which reported a crude oil discovery in Venezuela, featured a photo of swimsuit-clad revelers drinking from cut coconuts under the headline ''Venezuela party time.'' Censors in Iran, aghast at the image of a woman in a bikini, kept the issue from being distributed at an energy conference in Tehran, according to Erik Means, the newspaper's editor in chief.
 ''These things happen when you're a global publication,'' said Mr. Means, who holds dual citizenship in the United States and Norway and has been Upstream's top editor since its founding in 1996. ''I'd rather run the risk of a bit of censorship every once in a while than put out a paper full of boring images of rigs and tankers.''
 Upstream averages 56 pages a week, filled with staff-written dispatches from around the world. It has bureaus in Houston; London; Singapore; Moscow; Rio de Janeiro; Manama, Bahrain; Accra, Ghana; Wellington, New Zealand; and Calgary, Alberta. 
 The emphasis on international coverage extends to places that are not often on the radar of general-interest newspapers or news agencies, with developments in Gabon or Suriname competing with articles from Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States for readers' attention.
 ''It's the place to go for the latest on the political soap opera of Equatorial Guinea, which is pretty important stuff when you think about it,'' said Fadel Gheit, an energy analyst at Oppenheimer & Company in New York who subscribes to the paper. ''If you're not into that sort of thing, you can get bogged down quickly. It's information overload.''
 Like those of the industry it covers, the fortunes of Upstream tend to rise and fall with the price of oil, so 2004 is looking like a bumper year, with subscription rolls growing and cash-flush energy companies spending more on advertising.
 In a telephone interview from Oslo, Mr. Means said that Upstream's advertising revenue was up 25 percent in the first four months of the year, compared with the period in 2003, positioning the newspaper to turn its first annual profit. 
 Upstream has some 5,600 paid subscribers in nearly 100 countries around the world. That number may seem small, but a subscription to Upstream is not cheap, costing $765 a year in the United States, where more than a quarter of its subscribers are based, 800 of them in Houston alone. Mr. Means said it was common for one person in an office to subscribe to Upstream and pass it along to five or more colleagues; by his estimate, some 33,000 people in all regularly read the paper. Advertisers pay up to $14,000 for a full-page ad. 
 Working against Upstream lately has been the weak dollar: most of the paper's revenue is in dollars, while much of its costs are paid in Norwegian kroner and British pounds. 
 The newspaper's name comes from its focus on the exploration and production of oil and gas, known as the upstream side of the energy industry (refining and distribution of fuels are downstream). ''The upstream business is just sexier,'' said Blake Wright, Upstream's Houston bureau chief. ''It's more glamorous and adventurous.''
 Glamour is not a word that leaps to mind regarding Upstream's main competitor, The Oil and Gas Journal, a Houston-based weekly founded in 1902 and run on more traditional lines. It has far more subscribers than Upstream, about 40,000 in all, who pay $49 a year for a mixture of news articles and technical reports, all played straight and serious. 
 ''We have a different approach, targeting an audience of executives, engineers and scientists, so they're not keeping me up at night,'' said Bob Tippee, editor of The Oil and Gas Journal. ''If we try to get cute as writers, our readers let us know very quickly.''
 Upstream, by contrast, seems to go out of its way to shake up readers. A recent article on offshore drilling near New Zealand was accompanied by a photo of tattooed Maoris with fierce facial gestures storming a beach. The caption: ''Wave of interest.''
 Near the back of the paper, the weekly Cuttings section specializes in the lighter side of life in the oil patch. One recent article detailed the lengths that a prominent exotic-dancing club in Houston went to in advertising itself to those attending a recent industry convention here. Another article described criticism leveled at Yukos, the Russian oil giant, for selling Czech-made Cannabis Vodka at its gas stations. ''Yukos high but not dry over vodka,'' read the headline. 
 Mr. Means said that coverage of international politics, economics and energy needs to be leavened with an occasional light read. 
 ''There's so much dry reporting in the oil and gas industry,'' Mr. Means said. ''We feel a bit of an obligation on our part to rattle the cage.''

HEADLINE: Made in India vs. Made in China

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: SHENZHEN, China 

 BODY:
When Crystal Chen, a 28-year-old mechanical engineer, started designing microwave oven doors for Whirlpool in 2001 in this gleaming Chinese metropolis, one of her biggest surprises was the size of the ovens.
 Built to be installed over ranges in spacious American kitchens, the ovens were twice the size of the countertop microwaves sold for Chinese kitchens. And as she has kept working on them, the Whirlpool models, nearly all of them made to be exported to the United States and Europe, have grown even larger, approaching three times the size of a typical Chinese microwave.
 By contrast, at a Whirlpool complex more than 2,500 miles away in Thirubhuvanai, on the southeastern tip of India, the washing machines built in a hot low-tech factory are products the Indian workers easily recognize. Unlike the microwave ovens in Shenzhen, these washing machines are very much designed for local use, not for export. 
 They have rat guards to keep vermin from nibbling laundry or hoses. They have extra-strong parts to survive being bumped around in trucks on India's potholed roads. And they are built with heavy-duty wiring to cope with the powerful ebbs and surges in India's electrical grid.
 The difference is telling. Whirlpool's emphasis on using China to make goods for export while locating in India to enter the local market reflects a broader trend that is becoming apparent for many household appliances, from television sets to refrigerators. And it highlights a division that could spread in the coming years to other industries. 
 For all the dreams of selling goods into a fast-growing market of 1.3 billion Chinese, the reality is often very different. While China still holds considerable allure, many multinationals have struggled to earn profits selling here.
 Companies setting up shop in China face domestic manufacturers that consistently undercut them by building factories at practically no cost, borrowing the money cheaply from state-owned Chinese banks and using various strategies to avoid repayment. To make matters worse, many department stores are still owned by municipal or provincial governments that give floor space to local products and resist selling foreign brands.
 A result has been a struggle among manufacturers to see who can discount wares more deeply -- a struggle with little appeal for multinationals that need to make real profits.
 ''We're not interested in chasing a price-driven strategy,'' said Garrick D'Silva, the regional vice president for Asia at Whirlpool.
 India's economy has been growing nearly as quickly as China's in recent years. By dismantling many barriers to foreign investment, the government in New Delhi has also made the country an increasingly attractive market for globalizing companies.
 Marketing is easy through thousands of privately owned retailers, from department stores to corner shops. Risk-averse banks in India charge such steep interest rates to local manufacturers, and so strongly insist on repayment, that some economists worry they may even be slowing growth unnecessarily.
 India's steep tariffs, although starting to decline, long insulated its markets from international competition and still keep prices somewhat higher for many manufactured goods.
 And because India did not follow China's draconian ''one child'' policy, United Nations demographers forecast that India's population will surpass China's as soon as 2040.
 With all those factors, Whirlpool -- while still strongly interested in tapping the Chinese market -- has found greater opportunity to lock in profits and expand its market share in India than in China, Mr. D'Silva said.
 LG Electronics of Korea, Whirlpool's rival in Asia for many kinds of household appliances, shares that view.
 ''We couldn't make a profit in China,'' chiefly because of the free loans available to local competitors, said Kim Kwang Ro, the managing director of LG Electronics India. ''The main focus of expansion for LG is India, not China.''
 China's effort recently to brake its economy, in response to rising inflation and a growing problem of nonperforming bank loans, is also starting to take the edge off some companies' interest. China's political prospects remain murky.
 By contrast, India has just gone through a peaceful change of democratic government that produced a mere two-day drop in the stock market followed by an immediate recovery in share prices and corporate confidence.
 ''The Chinese economy is looking rather unstable,'' Mr. Kim said. ''Meanwhile, in India, the political, economic situation is becoming more stable.'' 
 Despite rising costs for steel and many other commodities that go into factory goods, prices for manufactured products are still falling in China because companies keep building more and more facilities to take advantage of the nation's extraordinary investment boom. Refrigerator prices, for example, fell 2.2 percent in China in the 12 months through April 2004. In India, they rose 3.5 percent. 
 India's combination of duties on imports and complex regulations on manufacturing start-ups has tended to benefit companies with factories in the country. ''The harder the obstacles, the bigger the advantage for the inside firm,'' Mr. Kim said.
 Many companies, of course, remain bullish on the Chinese market. Automakers are racing each other to build more assembly plants in China, but have moved more cautiously in India, where incomes are still somewhat lower and roads are in much worse repair. Anheuser-Busch just beat out SABMiller in a costly battle to take over a low-margin beer business in China's northeastern corner.
 Moreover, for all their differences, India and China share a growing popularity as places for companies from the United States and other countries with high labor costs to set up shop.
 Like many of its counterparts, Whirlpool is moving quickly to tap Asia's huge supply of well-trained engineers. Its employment of engineers and technicians in India and China has grown from zero in 1999 to 240 currently, with plans for 700 by 2007, or more than a quarter of the company's engineering work force.
 ''We're shifting quite a bit of our technology capacity to these countries from the higher-cost parts of the world, part of it from the United States and Europe,'' Mr. D'Silva said.
 Like many companies, Whirlpool insists that it has been able to manage this without significant layoffs among its engineers and technicians in the United States. But it acknowledges that it has not been increasing the size of its American staff, either.
 As it has expanded abroad, the company has increased the number of different models of everything from big Whirlpool refrigerators to KitchenAid coffee grinders. It has cut the time it takes to develop new models of the larger appliances to 12 to 14 months, from 30 to 36 months a few years ago.
 Engineers in the United States now work in the day on new designs, using computer-aided design software, then send the project around the world in the evening so that engineers in India and China, earning less than $1,000 a month, can continue the work during their normal daytime hours. 
 The high cost of the necessary computer software is an important reason for the 24-hour programming, which allows different technical centers to take turns using a limited number of software licenses, said Herbert Fu, the company's product development director here in Shenzhen. 
 As the sun sets each evening in the United States and computer-design work is transferred across the Pacific, engineers in India and China operate very differently. The Chinese engineers tend to continue working on the same projects as their American colleagues: designing or improving products for the American market. The Indian engineers, who occupy a warren of cubicles upstairs from the factory in Thirubhuvanai, devote a lot more of their effort to revising designs for sale in the local market.
 As with many outsourcing issues, the expansion of Whirlpool's engineering activities in Asia has been much more complicated than a simple transfer of American jobs.
 The main job losses, in fact, have been in Sweden rather than the United States. Whirlpool cut employment in half at a microwave oven factory there in 2003, to 305 jobs, while expanding research and development here and increasing its output at a factory up the Pearl River in Shunde.
 While the share of Whirlpool's work force overseas will continue to grow in the coming years, the increase will come from expanding the company's total employment; the overall number of jobs in the United States is not expected to decline, according to Stephen J. Duthie, a company spokesman.
 In India, Whirlpool has catered to customers like Rupam Shekhar, a New Delhi housewife whose husband has a small export business selling bed linens and curtains. They live with their two children in a walk-up apartment on the outskirts of New Delhi. 
 The Whirlpool refrigerator they own is quite different from those sold to Americans. Milk in India is seldom pasteurized, for example, so consumers boil it in a very tall steel urn on a stove. Whirlpool made it possible to fold away part of the top shelf in the refrigerator, so that the urn, known as a patila, could rest on the shelf below.
 At the same time, Whirlpool also uses a much smaller percentage of the refrigerator's space for the freezer than in other markets. Research showed that two-thirds of India's people are vegetarians who have little use for a freezer -- except for storing a little ice cream and a few ice cubes.
 Few Indian kitchens have room for refrigerators, and the appliances are also something of a status symbol: the cost is equal to nearly two months' salary for an engineer. So they are commonly displayed in living rooms or dining rooms. In response, Whirlpool now sells refrigerators in bright colors and curvy doors and sides.
 Mrs. Shekhar, more traditional in her tastes, has bought a plain white Whirlpool refrigerator and put it in the bedroom, next to a small shrine to Hindu deities. She used to have to boil milk and chill it a pint at a time for her son and daughter.
 ''Now, I can boil it all,'' she said, showing off the inside full of steel pots and fresh vegetables.
 Whirlpool has been able to overcome the typically fractious factory floor labor disputes and work stoppages in India by locating in the Pondicherry region, a former French colony that has a tradition of social peace described in Yann Martel's novel ''The Life of Pi.''
 India also appeals to Whirlpool because it is easier to enforce contracts there than in China. A Whirlpool executive said that the company had a contract in 2002 with a Shenzhen company to supply many of the components for a new toaster oven, only to have the supplier raise the price sharply.
 Whirlpool switched production to India. ''We had a contract but we decided it wouldn't be prudent to enforce it,'' the executive said. ''You never try to put a supplier too much in the corner because you get it back in quality.'' 
 But Whirlpool is not giving up on China, despite its difficulties here so far. In a workroom near Ms. Chen's cubicle, Cindy Wu, a 30-year-old engineer, was testing a new design for the fan blade that cools the microwave oven.
 ''Maybe someday,'' Ms. Wu said, ''Chinese families will have microwaves like these.''

HEADLINE: When Trade Leads to Tolerance

BYLINE: By Robert B. Zoellick. 
Robert B. Zoellick is the United States trade representative.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In Tangier's Museum of Antiquities stands one of the most famous mosaics in Morocco, ''The Voyage of Venus.'' It can best be appreciated by stepping back and taking in the full picture, so that each brightly colored tile blends into the others. As the United States signs a new free trade agreement with Morocco next week, we need to recognize the full mosaic of interests at stake. 
 The larger picture is one of a new and deeper economic and political partnership with Morocco, a bright light of reform and moderation in the Islamic world. For too long, the Middle East and North Africa has been a place of stagnant economies, religious extremism and lack of hope. Democracy is rare, small businesses are stymied by governments and a favored few, and militants want to turn back the clock to the seventh century. 
 Yet a different vision is beginning to emerge. Moderate Arab states like Morocco are reclaiming the ideas of an Islamic golden age when a vibrant culture allowed young scholars to explore the frontiers of knowledge and commerce thrived. Their reformist and tolerant vision of Islam includes free parliamentary elections, the sale of state-owned businesses, the encouragement of foreign investment that can be connected to broad-based development, and better protection of the rights of women and workers. 
 In Morocco, Jordan, Bahrain and elsewhere, young leaders are struggling for the soul of Islam. It is a battle of leaders who embrace tolerance against extremists who thrive on hatred. It is a conflict of economic reformers against those who fear modernization because it threatens their power to intimidate. And it is a contest of those who welcome closer ties with the West against those who see us as an enemy. 
 America's strategic interest in the outcome of this struggle is immense, but our ability to influence it is limited. From the Middle East to Southeast Asia, only fellow Muslims can lead their brothers and sisters to a better Islamic future. But the United States is not without influence. Through free-trade agreements, for example, we can embrace reforming states, encouraging their transformation and bolstering their chances for success even as we open new markets for American goods and services. 
 The free-trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001 was the first step. Closer trade ties and the removal of tariffs have resulted in a 197 percent increase in two-way trade and have drawn foreign investment to Jordan, including knowledge and entrepreneurial industries like pharmaceuticals and software. The Jordanians estimate that expanded trade has helped to create some 35,000 jobs. Jordan has also forged closer economic ties with Israel, our first free-trade partner. 
 To capitalize on this new interest in combining modernity with the Muslim world, President Bush outlined a plan last year to achieve a Middle East Free Trade Area. Now Morocco in the Maghreb is joining with Jordan by signing a free-trade agreement with the United States. Following fast, the United States and Bahrain just concluded free trade negotiations a few weeks ago, and we look forward to signing that agreement next. 
 These leaders have inspired the interest of others. The United States has now signed trade facilitation framework agreements with eight other Arab countries, from Algeria to Yemen, as a preliminary step toward free trade. Piece by piece, the administration is building a mosaic of modernizers with a plan that offers trade and openness as tools for Muslim leaders looking toward the rebirth of an optimistic and tolerant Islam. 
 Unfortunately, here at home, some don't see that bigger picture. Opponents of these free-trade agreements are preoccupied with demands for extra provisions on labor, claiming for example that unions have been pressured by government. But these objections, made by labor unions that don't want foreign competition, are self-defeating. The agreements with Morocco and Bahrain, like the Jordan agreement, require our partners to enforce their labor and environmental laws and strive to upgrade standards. The critics ignore the labor reforms Morocco has already enacted. The United States is the only nation pressing to include enforceable labor and environmental protections in its trade agreements.
 The labor protectionists' objections apply not only to Morocco and other Muslim reformers, but to poor countries generally. That's dangerous, because whether in the Middle East, Central America, Asia or Africa, free-trade agreements are a powerful way to strengthen openness and democracy, counter poverty, encourage tolerance and promote better working conditions.
 Economic isolationists are too shortsighted to see the full mosaic of America's interests. Their fight to defeat such trade agreements would rob the United States of one of its most powerful tools, just when we should be integrating trade and economic reforms with the struggle for democracy and tolerance that is vital to our security. The coming months will see a debate over which perspective prevails. The future of far more than a trade agreement hangs in the balance.

HEADLINE: Saving the Farm

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 In ''Debts and Drought Drive India's Farmers to Despair'' (news article, June 6), we see an agricultural system built upon structural inequities. Farmers around the world face an environmental and moral crisis as family farms are replaced with corporate farms, farmers with machines, mixed crops with monocultures, and local food security with global commerce.
 Modern agriculture robs both American family farmers and the world's poor. But farmers around the world are rallying for food sovereignty as a human right. This would mean strengthening domestic markets by prioritizing local, regional and national needs. A farmer's rights would include access to land, water, seeds and credit. We would prohibit overproduction and dumping and create a new farm economy.

HEADLINE: An Oil Enigma: Production Falls Even as Reserves Rise

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
For six consecutive years, ChevronTexaco has had good news for anyone worried that the world is running out of oil: the company has found more oil and natural gas than it has produced. Over that time, ChevronTexaco's proven oil and gas reserves have risen 14 percent, more than one billion barrels.
 But near the bottom of ChevronTexaco's financial filings is a much less promising statistic. For each of those years, ChevronTexaco's wells have produced less oil and gas than the year before. Even as reserves have risen, the company's annual output has fallen by almost 15 percent, and the declines have continued recently despite a company promise to increase production in 2002.
 ChevronTexaco is not the only big oil company whose production is falling despite rising reserves, though it has the largest gap. As consumers, economists and governments around the world wonder if oil supplies can keep pace with rising demand, production trends at the industry's publicly traded companies are not promising. 
 Collectively, they paint a picture of an industry that has depleted nearly all of the world's easily exploited reserves outside the Middle East and that is now struggling to sustain production, much less increase it. Fears about supply shortfalls and rising demand have already caused prices to climb about 20 percent this year, hovering around $40 a barrel. The four biggest companies own only about 4 percent of the world's reserves, which are mostly government-held, but they offer a unique glimpse of supply trends because they must disclose their reserves and production each year.
 Historically, proven reserves and output have moved in tandem. Industry experts disagree why the relationship has broken down. Although the reserves are only estimates, federal rules require companies to calculate them conservatively.
 Some analysts and the companies themselves take a relatively benign view of the production declines, promising that output will soon rise again as big new projects come online around the globe.
 ChevronTexaco said its production had declined in part because of asset sales and production agreements that allocate it less oil when prices are high, as they are now, than when prices are low, as they were in 1998. The company says it expects production to stay flat through 2005, then begin rising in 2006 as output increases from fields in Chad, Kazakhstan, Venezuela and Angola.
 But ChevronTexaco has promised to reverse its production declines before. In 2002 the company said that it expected its output to rise more than 20 percent by 2006, a forecast it has now dropped. 
 Royal Dutch/Shell, the world's third-largest oil company, admitted this year that it overstated its oil and gas reserves by 22 percent, the equivalent of 4.5 billion barrels of oil. Regulators and prosecutors in Europe and the United States are investigating Shell, which in March forced out Sir Philip Watts, its chairman.
 Some analysts say that the debacle at Shell proves that companies sometimes bend the rules to satisfy Wall Street's hunger for new reserves.
 In the 1990's, many public companies used aggressive accounting gimmicks -- some legal, some not -- to satisfy investors' demands that they report higher earnings. Oil companies face similar pressures to build reserves. And intentionally or not, some companies may have booked reserves that are not technically or economically viable, said Matt Simmons, a Houston investment banker who has warned of a potential supply crisis. Outsiders have essentially no way to know whether estimates of reserves are accurate, he said.
 ''We're going to have another Shell,'' Mr. Simmons said. ''They're not the only company that got optimistic on proved reserves.'' Neither Mr. Simmons nor anyone else is asserting that ChevronTexaco did anything illegal.
 Once a year, companies announce their ''reserve replacement ratio,'' telling investors whether they have found enough oil and gas during the year to make up for their production.
 Energy investors scrutinize the reserve replacement ratio more closely than any other measure of corporate performance, said Fadel Gheit, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Company. Every company aims to replace at least 100 percent of its production every year. And for the last decade, the industry's four giants, Exxon Mobil, BP, Shell and ChevronTexaco, have met that goal with remarkable consistency, at least until Shell's admission in January.
 But outsiders cannot tell whether companies are properly estimating their reserves, Mr. Gheit said. The calculations are complicated, and companies do not disclose the raw production and seismic data that would enable an outside analyst to check their estimates. Nor are the reserves subject to third-party audit.
 ''Reserves are very important but are extremely difficult to verify,'' Mr. Gheit said.
 Oddly, Wall Street pays less attention to actual production, which is generally relegated to a few lines in quarterly and annual reports. But output data deserves more attention, because reserves can be manipulated more easily than production, said John H. Lichtblau, chief executive of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York.
 ''Reserves are an estimate of what's in the ground; production is what you see coming out of the wells,'' he said. ''You don't have to take their production on faith.''
 The fall in production at the big oil companies does not portend an immediate crisis in the industry. The four so-called supermajors produce only a small fraction of the world's oil; together, they extracted 3.2 billion barrels last year, about 10 percent of production worldwide. (Some analysts classify Total, a French company slightly smaller than ChevronTexaco, as a fifth supermajor.)
 The supermajors control an even smaller share of global reserves. Together, the four companies have about 40 billion barrels of oil, or 4 percent of the world's proven reserves. They also have about 150 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, enough to produce the energy of 25 billion barrels of oil.
 No one really knows how much oil remains worldwide, or whether existing fields can be quickly squeezed should more oil suddenly be needed. Estimates range from just under one trillion barrels remaining worldwide, about 34 years at current production levels, to over two trillion. Saudi Arabia alone says it has proven reserves of 260 billion barrels of oil.
 But these estimates are far from exact. For most countries, the details of reserves and output are closely guarded secrets. In the 1980's, the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries sharply raised their reserve estimates, because OPEC's output quotas were based in part on national reserves.
 ''Countries want a higher allocation, so they tweak their numbers,'' Mr. Gheit said. ''Everybody lies about the reserve, so you want to make sure that you lie even more than the guy next to you.''
 On the other hand, the Securities and Exchange Commission requires oil companies to disclose detailed production data and reserve estimates to their investors each year.
 The S.E.C. rules are deliberately conservative and intended to prevent companies from overstating their reserves. The mere existence of oil and gas does not make a proven reserve; companies are supposed to report reserves as proven only if they can be recovered with current technology and are economically viable.
 Reserves classified as proven do not have to be producing at the time. But companies must usually have made a financial commitment to bring them into production before classifying them as proven. 
 New discoveries, lease extensions that give a company more time to exploit a field, or a more optimistic view of a field's potential are all cause to increase reserves. On the other hand, companies must cut reserves if they think that their initial estimates have been too high.
 ''The studies that I have seen show there have been upward and downward revisions, but over time, the revisions have been modestly upward,'' said Gene Gillespie, an analyst at Howard Weil. ''You're measuring something that's a couple miles under the surface of the earth that you can't see. It amazes me that over time they come as close as they do.''
 But in the long run, actual production is the most important proof that reserves exist. And the relationship between reserves and production is weakening.
 At Exxon Mobil, oil reserves rose from 9.6 billion barrels at the beginning of 1994 to 12.1 billion barrels at the start of this year, a 26 percent increase. But Exxon's production fell 2 percent, from 909 million barrels in 1994 to 893 million last year.
 At ChevronTexaco, oil reserves jumped from 6.9 billion barrels at the beginning of 1994 to 7.7 billion barrels in January 1998 to 8.6 billion barrels at the start of this year. But after surging from 644 million barrels in 1994 to 757 million in 1998, production plunged to 641 million last year. 
 At BP, the data is considerably more confusing, because the company has had so many acquisitions and sales over the last several years. Still, BP's production at its wholly owned fields has plunged to 562 million last year from 672 million barrels in 1998, while its reserves have risen to 7.5 billion from 6.5 billion over that span.
 (BP, ChevronTexaco and Exxon Mobil are all the products of mergers within the last decade; the reserves and production data reflect what the companies would have done if they had existed in their current form for the entire period.)
 Shell has actually increased its production slightly since 1994, despite the embarrassment of its announcement in January that it had improperly classified billions of barrels of reserves as proven instead of probable or possible. Shell's admission shows just how muddied reserve data can be, analysts say; the reserves it reclassified are real, but they will not be developed for years because of technical and political problems, so they should not be called proven. In coming years, if those problems can be solved, Shell may be able to once again classify them as proven, said Jennifer Rowland, senior oil analyst at J.P. Morgan.
 Mr. Simmons, the Houston investment banker, said that the output declines suggested that the companies needed to disclose more information about the performance of individual fields so that outside analysts could judge the companies' reserves estimates.
 ''What we have now is meaningless data,'' Mr. Simmons said. Big oil companies once prided themselves on conservative estimates. But today, to justify multibillion-dollar investments in risky fields, companies have become much more aggressive, he said.
 Combined with a survey from the International Energy Agency that shows rising demand, the drop in production at the supermajors offers more evidence that energy prices may stay high for the foreseeable future, said Steven Pfeifer, senior oil analyst at Merrill Lynch.
 ''The data is starting to say that underlying all this, the supply-demand balance is tighter than we thought,'' Mr. Pfeifer said. ''The maturing geological base is starting to rear its ugly head.''

HEADLINE: Labor Talks on Stage

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
If labor negotiations are theater, there was a wide selection of shows to choose from this week.
 With a series of strikes, protests and marches, New York City's labor unions turned their disputes into high drama, disrupting the lives of thousands of New Yorkers, most notably parents who use city day care centers and elderly and sick patients who rely on home-health aides.
 As with all good theater, this week's labor unrest was filled with plots, subplots, surprises and ambiguities -- it was certainly unclear who the heroes and villains were.
 If there was an overarching plot, it was that the unions were seeking to step up pressure on the city and state officials, especially Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, to provide more money for raises. 
 One unmistakable subplot was that union leaders were seeking to show themselves leading, being aggressive while negotiations languish. If the unions fail to obtain higher raises than those already on the table, then union leaders can at least proclaim that they fought the good fight, fired their biggest weapons.
 ''The unions are trying to squeeze as much as possible out of the mayor, and he's trying to give up as little as possible,'' said Raymond Horton, a Columbia University Business School professor. ''Union leaders are doing all this in part to posture, to show themselves as strong leaders. But you have to be careful because if you posture and don't get what you want, it looks as if you're not able to deliver.'' 
 When more than 20,000 teachers, police officers and firefighters demonstrated on Tuesday in what union leaders said was the largest labor protest at City Hall in years, they were making a frontal assault on Mr. Bloomberg, his bargaining stance and his popularity. (The rally's unspoken subplot was that if Mr. Bloomberg did not offer higher raises than he already has, the unions would mobilize against him when he runs for re-election.)
 The plot involving 7,000 striking day care workers was more complicated. They shut down 350 day care centers and disrupted the lives of more than 27,000 children and their parents in an indirect effort -- a carom shot, if you will -- to pressure Mr. Bloomberg. The day care centers are privately run, but the city provides almost all of their financing, so the day care workers are directing their appeals to the mayor because he indirectly pays their salaries.
 The other big actor in this week's unrest was 1199/S.E.I.U., the giant health care union, which called a three-day strike by 23,000 home health aides. The union directed its fire at 11 home-care agencies, with the walkout inconveniencing elderly and sick patients, although all of them ended up receiving help from aides or nurses. The union demanded that the agencies pay $10 an hour, up from the current wage of $7. 
 In some ways, 1199's demands were aimed more at Albany than at the care agencies, with the union hoping that state lawmakers would provide more money for raises through higher reimbursement rates or would force the agencies to devote more of their $17-an-hour reimbursement rate to raises.
 Labor leaders insisted that it was a coincidence that three big labor actions took place the same week, although they acknowledged that if one is going to hold protests or strikes, what better month to do so than warm weather June?
 ''You might not believe me, but it's pure coincidence,'' said Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers. ''The city has a big budget surplus, the national economy is improving, and that motivates people who feel left behind to be militant and more active.''
 If there was a common theme in all three acts in this week's drama, it was fairness. The health aides asserted that it was unfair for workers to live on $7 an hour. The day care workers said Mr. Bloomberg was being unfair in refusing to give them the 9 percent raise that other city unions received three years ago. The day care workers have not had a raise since December 2000.
 Mr. Bloomberg is seeking to skip the 9 percent raise and is instead offering the day care workers the 5 percent raise over three years that he gave this spring to the largest municipal union, District Council 37.
 The teachers, police officers and firefighters, asserting that their work is especially valuable, insist that it is unfair for Mr. Bloomberg to offer them the same 5 percent as D.C. 37.
 City Hall officials assert that with a $3.5 billion deficit projected for fiscal year 2006, they cannot afford to give municipal unions more than that 5 percent raise.
 Ms. Weingarten said, ''The theme of this week is that all these workers need to be treated fairly, and they haven't been treated fairly the last one, two, three years.''
 What happens next in these three dramas remains unclear. Four home-care agencies agreed to contracts paying the health aides $10 an hour, but seven other agencies continue to reject the union's demand. 
 The health aides are threatening more strikes this summer even though it is painful for workers who earn so little to go on strike. But officials at 1199 voice optimism since they usually emerge victorious in labor battles, partly because the union has so many friends in Albany.
 In contrast, the day care workers' union is not viewed as especially strong or sophisticated, but this week it took one of its most aggressive actions to try to force the mayor's hand. But he is digging in, and the day care workers, without a raise for 42 months, could decide to accept a far smaller raise than they hoped, instead of negotiating indefinitely.
 The police and teachers want an outside panel to recommend a contract -- for the police, the panel's recommendation would be binding, for the teachers, nonbinding. But City Hall opposes such a panel, saying contracts should be settled at the bargaining table, not by outsiders.
 Responding to this week's unrest, Mr. Bloomberg said, ''I'm sure everyone would like to get paid more, but unfortunately we just don't have the money.''

HEADLINE: Chip Stocks Fall Overseas On Worry About U.S. Growth

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Semiconductor-related shares slid worldwide amid expectations that rising interest rates in the United States would slow economic growth and as two brokerage firms advised investors to trim their holdings of chip shares. 
 STMicroelectronics, Infineon Technologies and ASML Holding declined in Europe after UBS lowered its rating on the chip industry to neutral from overweight. 
UBS forecast lower demand for chips. 
 Earlier, Samsung Electronics in South Korea had its biggest decline in four weeks and Tokyo Electron slid in Japan as a Deutsche Bank analyst, Fumiaki Sato, said he expected demand for chips and liquid-crystal displays to slow in the second half. 
 The Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index in Europe fell 0.1 percent. The Morgan Stanley Capital International Asia-Pacific index, which tracks more than 900 stocks, slid 1 percent. 
 Standard & Poor's/TSX composite index, in Canada, added 0.1 percent, with technology shares limiting gains. 
 Concern that economic growth will slow heightened after the Federal Reserve Bank presidents, Jack Guynn and William Poole, joined the chairman, Alan Greenspan, this week in signaling that central bankers are ready to raise interest rates faster than investors expect to quell inflation. 
 In Europe, benchmark indexes fell in 9 of the 17 Western European markets. The DAX index, in Germany, slipped 0.2 percent. The CAC 40, in France, dropped 0.3 percent. The FTSE 100, in Britain, lost 0.1 percent. 
 In Asia, the Nikkei 225 stock average shed 0.4 percent, while the Taiex index, in Taiwan, dropped 2.3 percent. The Kospi index, in South Korea, slipped 3.9 percent. The benchmarks slipped after government reports showed consumer and manufacturers' confidence declining. 
 United States exchanges were closed yesterday for the funeral of former President Ronald Reagan.

HEADLINE: The Road to Democracy, via Damascus

BYLINE: By Michael Young. 
Michael Young is opinion editor of The Daily Star in Beirut and a contributing editor at Reason magazine.

DATELINE: BEIRUT 

 BODY:
Last month President Bush bowed to Congressional pressure and imposed economic and diplomatic sanctions on Syria. Although the president went beyond what Congress demanded -- banning most exports to Syria, prohibiting Syrian commercial flights to America and freezing assets of Syrians with known ties to terrorism -- he missed an opportunity to show that the United States is serious about democracy and self-governance in the Middle East.
 The sanctions may be helpful, and the United States has long called for an end to the Syrian military presence of Lebanon -- just last week President Bush said that ''the people of Lebanon should be free to determine their own future, without foreign interference or domination.'' But the Bush administration, working with the European Union, should be doing more to encourage Syria's withdrawal. 
 Because Syria is the patron of Lebanon's postwar political elite, this idea provokes official antipathy in Beirut. Recently, President Emile Lahoud of Lebanon declared that Syrian forces would remain in the country until a comprehensive Middle East settlement. Given the deadlock in regional talks, this invited an open-ended stay. Since May 2000, when Israeli forces withdrew from Lebanon (removing a Syrian justification for its troop deployments), the Lebanese authorities have defended the Syrian presence as necessary, legal and temporary.
 For decades, Syria has been the unavoidable force in Lebanese politics. Even after 1991, when Arabs and Israelis were negotiating peace, American and European envoys dealt with Lebanon in Damascus. Things have changed in recent years. There is growing boldness by Lebanese opposition figures who are now openly demanding a new relationship with Syria leading to a pullout. The Syrian president, Bashar Assad, has made reform his mantra, though he has not discussed a full pullout from Lebanon except in the most indefinite of terms. For the Lebanese, however, Syrian reform must include reviewing a Syrian military presence in their country that is seldom discussed in Damascus and has never been put to a referendum in Beirut.
 American sanctions have heightened pressures on Mr. Assad. Yet by themselves they will not improve Syrian-Lebanese relations. In fact, trying to force a Syrian pullout may be dangerous. It could lead to domestic tension in Lebanon that Syria would highlight, and even encourage, to reaffirm its indispensability to civil peace.
 What the United States and the European Union should do is put Lebanese sovereignty at the top of their agenda -- even if they have few means of enforcement. And Syria and Lebanon should themselves recast their relationship and set a sensible deadline for a Syrian withdrawal; it need not be immediate, but neither should it be relegated to a distant future. This would help marginalize those who, wrongly, seek a rude divorce between Beirut and Damascus.
 What would the advantages be to Syria and Lebanon? It would end a debilitating relationship that benefits neither -- so that both can, together, endure the impact of future regional realignments. But it would also acknowledge that Syria's real challenges come not from Lebanon or even from Israel (the Syrian-Israeli border is among the quietest in the region), but from Iraq, where American forces can continue to intimidate Syria.
 How can the international community help? First, by calling, after years of indifference, for the peaceful carrying out of United Nations and other resolutions demanding foreign troop withdrawals from Lebanon. This would include a renewed commitment to the 1989 Taif accord that ended the civil war and outlined a Syrian redeployment to the Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon within two years. While the wording of the accord is open to interpretation, its spirit is not: the Syrians are asked to move their troops with the implicit promise of a total withdrawal.
 Second, the United States and Europe should insert themselves into the Syrian-Lebanese relationship by advising the two states to redefine their rapport and set a framework for a Syrian departure. Both power blocs say they favor democratic self-determination; they can prove it in Lebanon. This might represent interference in the bilateral affairs of foreign states -- but sovereignty should not be an excuse to allow the domination of one country by another.
 Third, the United States and the European Union should protect and enhance Lebanese liberal institutions -- timely and free elections, and respect for the constitution, judicial independence, civic groups and opposition parties. A priority is guaranteeing that Lebanon's presidential election this year and parliamentary elections next year take place and are free and fair. After all, it is Lebanese democracy itself, not Syria's presence, that makes Lebanon stable. Only true democracy will ensure a Syrian pullout goes smoothly and that a durable Syrian-Lebanese bond -- one between equals -- is built afterward.
 President Bush has often spoken of the importance of bringing democracy and freedom to the Middle East. His focus has been on Iraq, but Lebanon provides as good an opportunity to advance such aims. And while the international community should play a role, it is the Lebanese and the Syrians who must take the lead in redefining their relationship.

HEADLINE: A Call for Arab Democracy

 BODY:
Leaders of the Group of Eight, the club of rich nations that gathered on a secluded Georgia island this week, have rightly placed the Arab world's democracy deficit on the global agenda. President Bush is to be commended for using the meeting to elevate so important an issue. In securing a G-8 statement calling for reform in the Middle East, he overcame European wariness about the wisdom of calling for democracy in that region, not to mention America's own history of championing the ''stability'' provided by authoritarian regimes. Unfortunately, the statement is about as far as the G-8 leaders were prepared to go. 
 The G-8 is essentially calling for others to act. One indication of how enthusiastically Middle Eastern leaders will respond to a call for democratic reform is the fact that some of America's closest allies in the Arab world declined to attend the meeting, even though all they were being asked to do was pretend to be interested in the subject. Nations' leaders usually jump at an opportunity to attend the G-8, but upon learning the agenda, the leaders of countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Kuwait and Morocco developed schedule conflicts.
 President Bush, sadly, is a much discredited salesman for his own campaign, so it is easier for these leaders to snub him. His decision to promote democracy in the region late last year, as the soured occupation of Iraq continued, raised questions about his motivation. The G-8 statement includes a nod toward the need to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But President Bush's excessive deference to Ariel Sharon on Israeli settlements -- along with his indifferent response to the American military's torturing of Iraqi prisoners -- has undermined his credibility in the Arab world.
 The lack of interest in democracy shown by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt is inexcusable, but it's hard to blame him for not wanting to rush back to Mr. Bush's side, given the humiliation he endured after his Washington visit in April. President Bush assured him then that the United States would remain a credible mediator for a Middle East peace, only to change his tune a few days later when Mr. Sharon was in town.
 Mr. Bush is right to say that democratic reform is the best path for the Arab world, but he lacks the credibility to pursue it outside the rarefied context of the G-8. The group will arrange regular meetings, starting this fall, between G-8 leaders and Arab governments, business executives and civic leaders to discuss democratization. 
 There are other areas in which the Bush administration is making more progress in engaging the Arab world. Next week, for instance, the United States will sign a free trade agreement with Morocco. It follows bilateral trade agreements with Israel, Jordan and Bahrain that are of minimal importance to the American economy but can help foster economic development in the region. In Jordan and Morocco, the promise of a free trade agreement provided the rationale for needed economic reforms. 
 But bilateral agreements are just a stepping stone to the ultimate goal of knitting together an Arab common market. That will be difficult to achieve without resolving the political rifts in the region, which Washington is currently only fueling.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From the Eulogies: Recollections of Hope, Humor and One Very Big Heart

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from eulogies yesterday for former President Ronald Reagan by Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister; Brian Mulroney, the former Canadian prime minister; former President George Bush, President Bush and former Senator John C. Danforth, as recorded by the Federal Document Clearing House Inc. A full transcript is online at nytimes.com/national.

Lady Thatcher
 We have lost a great president, a great American and a great man, and I have lost a dear friend. In his lifetime, Ronald Reagan was such a cheerful and invigorating presence that it was easy to forget what daunting historic tasks he set himself. He sought to mend America's wounded spirit, to restore the strength of the free world and to free the slaves of Communism. In the terrible hours after the attempt on his life, his easy jokes gave reassurances to an anxious world. They were evidence that in the aftermath of terror, and in the midst of hysteria, one great heart at least remained sane and jocular. They were truly grace under pressure. And perhaps they signified grace of a deeper kind. Ronnie himself certainly believed that he had been given back his life for a purpose.
 As he told a priest after his recovery, ''Whatever time I've got left now belongs to the big fellow upstairs.'' And surely it is hard to deny that Ronald Reagan's life was providential when we look at what he achieved in the eight years that followed. Others prophesied the decline of the West; he inspired America and its allies with renewed faith in their mission of freedom. Others saw only limits to growth; he transformed a stagnant economy into an engine of opportunity. Others hoped at best for an uneasy cohabitation with the Soviet Union; he won the cold war not only without firing a shot, but also by inviting enemies out of their fortress and turning them into friends. I can't imagine how any diplomat or any dramatist could improve on his words to Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Geneva summit: ''Let me tell you why it is we distrust you.'' Those words are candid and tough and they cannot have been easy to hear, but they're also a clear invitation to a new beginning and a new relationship that will be rooted in trust. We live today in the world that Ronald Reagan began to reshape with those words. It is a very different world with different challenges and new dangers. All in all, however, it is one of greater freedom and prosperity, one more hopeful than the world he inherited on becoming president.

Mr. Mulroney
 In one of his poems, [Thomas D'Arcy] McGee, thinking of his birthplace, wrote poignantly, ''Am I remembered in Erin?/I charge you speak me true!/Has my name a sound, a meaning/In the scenes my boyhood knew?'' Ronald Reagan will not have to worry about Erin because they remember him well and affectionately there. Indeed they do. From Erin to Estonia, from Maryland to Madagascar, from Montreal to Monterey, Ronald Reagan does not enter history tentatively. Some in the West, during the early 1980's, believed Communism and democracy were equally valid and viable. This was the school of moral equivalence. In contrast, Ronald Reagan saw Soviet Communism as a menace to be confronted in the genuine belief that its squalid underpinnings would fall swiftly to the gathering winds of freedom, provided, as he said, that NATO and the industrialized democracies stood firm and united. They did. And we know now who was right. I always thought that President Reagan's understanding of the nobility of the presidency coincided with that American dream. One day, in Brussels, President Mitterrand, in referring to President Reagan, said, ''Il a vraiment la notion de l'etat''; rough translation: ''He really has a sense of the state about him.'' The translation does not fully capture the profundity of the observation. What President Mitterrand meant is that there is a vast difference between the job of president and the role of president. Ronald Reagan fulfilled both with elegance and ease, embodying himself that unusual alchemy of history and tradition and achievement and inspirational conduct and national pride that defined the special role the president of the United States of America must assume at all times at home and around the world. 

Former President George Bush
 Our friend was strong and gentle. Once he called America hopeful, big hearted, idealistic, daring, decent and fair. That was America and, yes, our friend. And next, Ronald Reagan was beloved because of what he believed. He believed in America so he made it his shining city on a hill. He believed in freedom so he acted on behalf of its values and ideals. He believed in tomorrow so the great communicator became the great liberator. He talked of winning one for the Gipper, and as president, through his relationship with Mikhail Gorbachev, with us today, the Gipper, and, yes, Mikhail Gorbachev, won one for peace around the world. If Ronald Reagan created a better world for many millions it was because of the world someone else created for him. Nancy was there for him always. Her love for him provided much of his strength, and their love together transformed all of us as we've seen -- renewed seeing again here in the last few days. And one of the many memories we all have of both of them is the comfort they provided during our national tragedies. Whether it was the families of the crew of the Challenger shuttle or the U.S.S. Stark or the Marines killed in Beirut, we will never forget those images of the president and first lady embracing them and embracing us during times of sorrow. So, Nancy, I want to say this to you: Today, America embraces you. We open up our arms. We seek to comfort you, to tell you of our admiration for your courage and your selfless caring. As his vice president for eight years, I learned more from Ronald Reagan than from anyone I encountered in all my years of public life. I learned kindness; we all did. I also learned courage; the nation did. Who can forget the horrible day in March 1981, he looked at the doctors in the emergency room and said, ''I hope you're all Republicans.'' And then I learned decency; the whole world did. Days after being shot, weak from wounds, he spilled water from a sink, and entering the hospital room aides saw him on his hands and knees wiping water from the floor. He worried that his nurse would get in trouble. The Good Book says humility goes before honor, and our friend had both, and who could not cherish such a man? And perhaps as important as anything, I learned a lot about humor, a lot about laughter. And, oh, how President Reagan loved a good story. When asked, ''How did your visit go with Bishop Tutu?'' he replied, ''So-so.'' It was typical. It was wonderful. 

President Bush
 It has been 10 years since he said his own farewell, yet it is still very sad and hard to let him go. Ronald Reagan belongs to the ages now, but we preferred it when he belonged to us. In a life of good fortune, he valued above all the gracious gift of his wife, Nancy. During his career, Ronald Reagan passed through a thousand crowded places, but there was only one person, he said, who could make him lonely by just leaving the room. America honors you, Nancy, for the loyalty and love you gave this man on a wonderful journey and to that journey's end. Today, our whole nation grieves with you and your family. When the sun sets tonight off the coast of California and we lay to rest our 40th president, a great American story will close. The second son of Nell and Jack Reagan first knew the world as a place of open plains, quiet streets, gas-lit rooms and carriages drawn by horse. If you could go back to the Dixon, Ill., of 1922, you'd find a boy of 11 reading adventure stories at the public library or running with his brother Neil along Rock River, and coming home to a little house on Hennepin Avenue. That town was the kind of place he remembered where you prayed side by side with your neighbors. And if things were going wrong for them, you prayed for them and knew they'd pray for you if things went wrong for you. The Reagan family would see its share of hardship, struggle and uncertainty.
 And out of that circumstance came a young man of steadiness, calm and a cheerful confidence that life would bring good things. The qualities all of us have seen in Ronald Reagan were first spotted 70 and 80 years ago. As the lifeguard in Lowell Park, he was the protector, keeping an eye out for trouble. As a sports announcer on the radio, he was the friendly voice that made you see the game as he did. As an actor he was the handsome all-American good guy, which in his case required knowing his lines and being himself. Along the way certain convictions were formed and fixed in the man. Ronald Reagan believed that everything happens for a reason and that we should strive to know and do the will of God. He believed that the gentleman always does the kindest thing. He believed that people were basically good and had the right to be free. He believed that bigotry and prejudice were the worst things a person could be guilty of. He believed in the Golden Rule and in the power of prayer. He believed that America was not just a place in the world, but the hope of the world.
 And he believed in taking a break now and then, because, as we said, there's nothing better for the inside of a man than the outside of a horse. Ronald Reagan spent decades in the film industry and in politics, fields known on occasion to change a man. But not this man. From Dixon to Des Moines to Hollywood to Sacramento to Washington, D.C., all who met him remembered the same sincere, honest, upright fellow. Ronald Reagan's deepest beliefs never had much to do with fashion or convenience. His convictions were always politely stated, affably argued, and as firm and straight as the columns of this cathedral. There came a point in Ronald Reagan's film career when people started seeing a future beyond the movies. The actor Robert Cummings recalled one occasion: ''I was sitting around the set with all these people and we were listening to Ronnie, quite absorbed. I said, 'Ron, have you ever considered some day becoming president?' He said, 'President of what?' 'President of the United States,' I said. And he said, 'What's the matter? Don't you like my acting either?''' The clarity and intensity of Ronald Reagan's convictions led to speaking engagements around the country, and a new following he did not seek or expect. He often began his speeches by saying, ''I'm going to talk about controversial things.'' And then he spoke of Communist rulers as slave masters, of a government in Washington that had far overstepped its proper limits, of a time for choosing that was drawing near.
 In the space of a few years, he took ideas and principles that were mainly found in journals and books and turned them into a broad, hopeful movement ready to govern. As soon as Ronald Reagan became California's governor, observers saw a star in the west, tanned, well-tailored, in command and on his way. In the 1960's his friend Bill Buckley wrote, ''Reagan is indisputably a part of America, and he may become a part of American history.'' Ronald Reagan's moment arrived in 1980. He came out ahead of some very good men, including one from Plains and one from Houston. What followed was one of the decisive decades of the century as the convictions that shaped the president began to shape the times. He came to office with great hopes for America. And more than hopes. Like the president he had revered and once saw in person, Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan matched an optimistic temperament with bold, persistent action. President Reagan was optimistic about the great promise of economic reform, and he acted to restore the rewards and spirit of enterprise. He was optimistic that a strong America could advance the peace, and he acted to build the strength that mission required. He was optimistic that liberty would thrive wherever it was planted, and he acted to defend liberty wherever it was threatened.

Mr. Danforth
 Winthrop (John Winthrop, the Pilgrim leader) believed that the eyes of the world would be on America because God had given us a special commission, so it was our duty to shine forth. The Winthrop message became the Reagan message. It rang of optimism, and we longed to hear it, especially after the dark years of Vietnam and Watergate. It was a vision with policy implications. America could not hide its light under a bushel. It could not turn in on itself and hunker down. Isolationism was not an option; neither was protectionism. We must champion freedom everywhere. We must be the beacon for the world.

 BODY:
Why is it so hard to loosen the grip of AIDS on southern Africa? H.I.V.-prevention programs in that part of the world have been under way for years -- there have been campaigns to raise awareness about AIDS and to promote the use of condoms; clinics have been established to conduct H.I.V. testing and to treat sexually transmitted diseases that may accelerate the spread of H.I.V.; more recently, schoolchildren have been taught the benefits of abstinence -- and yet the virus continues to spread. About a third of all sexually active adults in Botswana and South Africa carry H.I.V., a rate nearly 10 times higher than almost anywhere in the world outside Africa. These prevention efforts have been sensible -- abstaining from sex or using condoms consistently do prevent H.I.V. infection -- but their effects have been disappointing. 
 There is another way to reduce the spread of H.I.V. -- one that is increasingly recognized by public-health experts but that has been relegated, thus far, to an afterthought: fidelity -- either in marriage or in a committed relationship. As experts come to understand more about the African AIDS epidemic, it seems clear that regular sexual contact with more than one person is the key human behavior that enables the rapid spread of H.I.V. Since 2002, international organizations have promoted an approach called ''A.B.C.,'' which stands for abstain, be faithful, use condoms. But the ''be faithful'' part has largely fallen through the cracks, and that may well have undermined efforts to fight the epidemic. 
 It's not clear why most AIDS campaigns in southern Africa have avoided the subject of infidelity. Perhaps the topic seems weighted with moral judgment; perhaps Western advisers in particular feel it would be insensitive to raise it; perhaps they also feel it would be futile to try to change deeply rooted patterns of behavior. Even secular public-health workers have endorsed programs that encourage teenagers to abstain from sex until they are older -- as long as they are informed about other methods of prevention -- but they have been far more reluctant to tell adults what to do. Whatever the reason, programs to encourage monogamy have seldom been seriously tried in southern Africa. Government planning documents, United Nations agency reports, AIDS awareness campaigns and AIDS education curriculums are strangely silent on the subject. The Bush administration's $15 billion President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief discusses faithfulness, but while it sets aside 33 percent of H.I.V.-prevention funds for abstinence-until-marriage programs, it fails to segregate funds to discourage infidelity. In April, Daniel Halperin, senior H.I.V.-prevention adviser at the United States Agency for International Development, and colleagues put it this way in The British Medical Journal: ''Partner reduction has been the neglected middle child of the A.B.C. approach.'' 
 This omission is serious, because wherever H.I.V.-infection rates have fallen -- from the market towns of Uganda, to the military barracks of Thailand, to the gay enclaves of the United States -- reduction in promiscuous sexual behavior very often had a great deal to do with it. These behavioral changes have often been a result of public-health campaigns, like the closings of gay bathhouses and discos. In Africa, the best-known case is Uganda, where the government deliberately encouraged people to stick with one partner and warned them frankly about the risk of H.I.V. 
In 1993, I was working as a molecular biologist and spent some 18 months in Uganda, the country with the highest H.I.V.-infection rate in the world at the time. I was conducting research on a vaccine to protect Africans from the virus. The vaccine was not a success, but what I didn't know then was that H.I.V. rates in Uganda were plummeting anyway. In 1995, the Uganda Ministry of Health reported that H.I.V. rates among urban pregnant girls between the ages of 15 and 19 had fallen by about 50 percent during the early 1990's, and rates declined greatly in other groups, too. The epidemiologists Rand Stoneburner and Daniel Low-Beer have shown that at the time H.I.V. rates began falling, very few people used condoms or had H.I.V. tests, and there was only one clinic in the entire country that specialized in the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. However, the frequency of casual sex fell by 60 percent between 1989 and 1995, and this probably contributed most to the sharp decline in H.I.V.-infection rates. 
 These promising trends seem to have begun in the late 1980's. At the time, few international health experts were working on AIDS in Uganda, but the Ugandan government developed a simple and effective program on its own. In 1986, the Uganda Ministry of Health started a vigorous H.I.V.-prevention campaign in which the slogans ''Love Carefully,'' ''Love Faithfully'' and ''Zero Grazing'' -- Ugandan slang for ''Don't have sexual partners outside the home'' -- were posted on public buildings, broadcast on radio and bellowed in speeches by government officials, teachers and AIDS-prevention workers across the country. Religious leaders scoured the Bible and the Koran for quotations about infidelity. Newspapers, theaters, singing groups and ordinary people spread the same message. 
 Their words fell on fertile ground. Stoneburner and Low-Beer argue that the urgent message for partner reduction was conveyed through informal social networks -- within families and neighborhoods and among friends. A realistic fear of AIDS was reinforced by a compassionate response to the suffering the disease created. Ordinary Ugandans have always been much more open about AIDS than people from other African countries, and they were also far more likely to admit that they knew someone who had died of the disease or was infected with H.I.V. Community- and church-based groups sprang up to help families affected by AIDS. Uganda's women's movement, one of the oldest and most dynamic in Africa, galvanized around issues of domestic abuse, rape and H.I.V. The anger of the activists, and the eloquent sorrow of women throughout the country who nursed the sick and helped neighbors cope, was a harsh reproach to promiscuous men. So was their gossip, a highly efficient method of spreading any public-health message. 
 Some researchers have attributed Uganda's H.I.V.-prevention success to increased sexual abstinence among teenage girls, but statistics suggest that partner reduction, especially on the part of men, was far more important. During the early 1990's, Uganda's teenage-pregnancy rates, which even today are among the highest in the world, barely changed at all. If abstinence among teenage girls had increased significantly, it would be expected that teenage pregnancy rates would have fallen. When I asked epidemiologists about this, they explained that abstinence among unmarried teenage girls did increase significantly in the early 1990's, yet marriage rates for that group also increased at the same time. Thus, the proportion of all teenage girls who were sexually active changed little, but more girls were in committed relationships -- and this could explain why fewer of them became H.I.V.-positive even though roughly the same number became pregnant. 
 Although condoms and abstinence do prevent H.I.V. infection, these seem not to have been the methods most Ugandans chose to protect themselves from the virus, at least during the early 1990's, when H.I.V. rates were falling most rapidly. Even in urban areas, condoms weren't widely available until around 1993. Since the mid-1990's, condom use in Uganda has soared, and this has almost certainly helped keep H.I.V.-infection rates relatively low; about 5 percent of sexually active adults carry the virus. Condoms have also helped prevent the spread of H.I.V. among prostitutes and gay men the world over. But increased faithfulness seems to have been crucial to the precipitous decline of H.I.V. rates in Uganda. 
 Partner reduction has been an important factor in H.I.V. prevention elsewhere as well. In Thailand, H.I.V.-infection rates declined steeply during the 1990's. While condom use increased significantly, visits by men to sex workers also fell by 60 percent. Among gays in America, H.I.V. rates fell steeply during the 1980's. Part of this decline was attributable to the increased use of condoms, but partner reduction was very important too. In Zambia and northern Tanzania, where churches promoted faithfulness, H.I.V. rates also declined. Meanwhile, in such countries as Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe, condoms have been emphasized as the main method of prevention, and H.I.V. rates have remained high. In all three countries, condoms are used more frequently than in Uganda when H.I.V. rates were falling rapidly in the early 1990's, and teenage sexual debut is later. The problem is not that condoms and abstinence don't prevent H.I.V. -- they do -- but that they are often less popular choices than sticking to one partner. Obviously if your one partner is H.I.V.-positive, you are in trouble, unless you use condoms all the time. But when large numbers of people reduce their partners, it can stop the virus in its tracks. 
People are promiscuous and unfaithful everywhere, not just in Africa, so I wondered, What makes relationships there so risky? This winter, I spent five weeks in Botswana and South Africa trying to find some answers. My hypothesis, and that of many social scientists who study the epidemic, was that H.I.V. rates remain high because older men are infecting young women in relationships that are often coercive and abusive and in which women have little power to negotiate the timing of sex or the use of condoms. (The vast majority of H.I.V. transmission in southern Africa is heterosexual.)
 I found that my assumption captured only part of the reality. During my travels, I spoke with about 40 men and women, most of them H.I.V.-positive, about their lives, their relationships and about H.I.V. I contacted some people through AIDS organizations, and others I met in taxis and on the street. I was surprised at how open people were with a stranger and how willing they were to share their experiences. As expected, many women described abusive, coercive relationships with men who turned out to be H.I.V.-positive, but many of them willingly stayed with these men. The most striking thing about the stories I heard was how difficult intimate relationships were for both men and women, and how often violence and abuse involved accusations of infidelity -- and thus seemed to emerge from the very same source as H.I.V. itself. 
 Shortly after I arrived in South Africa, I visited Ngcingane village, which lies on a green plain amid misty hills about 15 miles from Umtata, a large town in the Eastern Cape, South Africa's poorest province. Umtata is notorious for crime, and many people I met had been robbed or carjacked at least once. While I was waiting at a stoplight in the middle of town, I spotted a man in the lunchtime crowd casually loading an automatic pistol. Nelson Mandela's forebears lived in a nearby village and grazed their cattle and grew sorghum and millet on small plots of land. Then, throughout southern Africa, villages like Ngcingane began their long descent into destitution. In the 19th century, European settlers built railways, mines and cities and coerced millions of young men to work in them, forcing them to leave their families behind in their villages for months or years at a time. White settlers appropriated much of the most fertile land, and the black population that remained in rural areas became increasingly dependent on remittances from migrant workers living hundreds of miles away. When South Africa's apartheid government established independent ''homelands'' for the black population, many of the appointed leaders were astonishingly corrupt -- corruption that continues in many areas today. This corruption, along with persistent drought and barriers to agricultural trade imposed by Western nations, have all contributed to the economic crisis that has gripped sub-Saharan Africa since the 1970's and has demolished the small-scale agricultural economy that once sustained rural Africa. Today there are few jobs in rural areas, and most people rely financially on migrant-worker relatives and government pensions. 
 Rachel Jewkes, an epidemiologist with South Africa's Medical Research Council, has been conducting research on the sexuality of young people in South Africa since 1995. She's an expert on both H.I.V. and violence against women and has found, as she told me, that gender relations in South Africa ''are in a very bad state.'' South Africa has the highest recorded rate of rape in the world, but as Jewkes has shown, women here are at far less risk of H.I.V. from the rapist who climbs in through the window than they are from the men they know best -- their husbands and long-term boyfriends. Jewkes found that women with violent boyfriends or husbands were 50 percent more likely than other women to be H.I.V.-positive, regardless of their own behavior. Women who had been raped by strangers or acquaintances were not more likely to be H.I.V.-positive.
 On a Saturday morning in January, Lindiwe Farlane, who was Jewkes's research assistant, introduced me to some of the young women participating in one of Jewkes's research projects. Seven of them were waiting for us under a tree. The first thing that struck me was how beautiful they were. Just looking at them, with their elaborately braided and colored hair, their stylish clothing and the way they yakked and giggled into their cellphones, you would never guess how much hardship and violence they had seen in their young lives. 
 ''He beats me once every two months or so,'' said Mcha, a cheerful 18-year-old high-school student of her boyfriend, a 22-year-old mechanic. ''He beat me the day before yesterday.'' She showed me the wounds on her head. ''Someone called me on my cellphone, and I was on my way to the bathroom and I answered. When I came back, my boyfriend said, 'You have a boyfriend!' I decided to say yes, since he'd beat me anyway. Sometimes he forces me to have sex when I don't want to.'' 
 The young women described their boyfriends' infidelity. ''He does have other girlfriends,'' said Mcha, who has never been tested for H.I.V. but who was treated for a sexually transmitted disease last year. ''He even told me.'' So does the boyfriend of Mcha's friend Thokozile, 21. He works in Cape Town, and Thokozile sees him once every few months. She's unhappy about his other girlfriend. ''I don't know how much care he gives her compared to me. He might be loving her more.'' Thokozile hasn't been tested for H.I.V., either. 
 Studies show that people in southern Africa don't have nearly as many sexual partners as, say, homosexual men in San Francisco did in the 1980's, when reports of hundreds of sexual partners a year were not uncommon. Such behavior is rare in Africa, but many people -- like the boyfriends of Thokozile and Mcha -- do have a small number of longer-term, simultaneous or ''concurrent'' sexual relationships that may overlap for a few months or even years. This ''concurrency'' links sexually active people up in a giant network, not only to one another but also to the partners of their partners' partners -- and to the partners of those partners, and so on -- via a web of sexual relationships that can extend across huge regions. If one member contracts H.I.V., then everyone else in the web may, too. 
 Long-term concurrency is far more common in Africa than in Asia and in the West, where heterosexual people tend to practice ''serial monogamy.'' Martina Morris, a sociologist at the University of Washington, has shown that concurrency is more of a public-health danger than serial monogamy because it permits the virus to spread to others quickly, rather than trapping it in a single relationship for months or years. In addition, a recently infected person is much more likely to transmit the virus than a person who has been infected for a while. Thus, when a serially monogamous H.I.V.-positive person eventually finds a new partner, his ability to infect has been reduced. Someone at the hub of a network of concurrent relationships, however, is likely to infect all of his partners very rapidly when he is first infected. 
 Many people in Western countries and in Asia have one-night stands with prostitutes or acquaintances, but such encounters are often safer than concurrent, long-term relationships. Because it usually takes numerous sexual acts to transmit H.I.V., a relationship with an H.I.V.-positive person involving repeated unprotected intercourse is far more dangerous than a single encounter. Moreover, condom use with prostitutes and in one-night stands is increasingly the norm all over the world, but they are rarely used in longer-term, less businesslike affairs. 
 I wondered why southern African women so often put up with men who openly cheated on them, sometimes physically and sexually abused them and put them at risk of disease. When I asked, the answer was almost always the same. ''Because I love him,'' both Mcha and Thokozile said in separate interviews. ''But why?'' I asked. ''I like that he's working,'' Thokozile said, ''so he won't ask for money from me. It's boring when your boyfriend asks for 50 cents for a cigarette. This one can help me out with financial problems when I have them, not like the others. Sometimes he loads airtime on my cellphone.'' 
 Mcha said: ''He gives me support, even if I owe fees at school. Sometimes I use the money to buy clothes or do my hair.''
 Sexual relationships everywhere are motivated by a combination of physical attraction, emotional rapport and financial calculation. But the last of these seems to have particular weight in southern Africa, where ''transactional'' sexual relationships, in which women expect gifts of cash or consumer goods from boyfriends, are by many accounts extremely common. 
 ''It's totally different from prostitution,'' says Mzikazi Nduna, a research psychologist who works with Rachel Jewkes. ''Prostitution is seen as a business. You go into the street and set a price. With transactional sex, the nature of the relationship is different. It's more committed.''
 Even though transactional sex differs from prostitution, it may be almost as dangerous when it comes to H.I.V. Jewkes has shown that women in transactional relationships are more likely to be H.I.V.-positive, even if they have had very few sexual partners in their lives. Women in transactional relationships may be more vulnerable to H.I.V. because they are more likely than other women to tolerate an unfaithful partner and also to seek out additional concurrent sexual relationships themselves. 
 Transactional sex in its current form has probably become much more common since the economic crisis of the 1970's, says Mark Hunter, who is researching the political economy of AIDS at the University of California, Berkeley. It is not simply that poor young women want or need these gifts, but also that the gifts have enormous symbolic value. Marriages throughout southern Africa are traditionally negotiated through a system of bride-price, in which the groom's family pays the bride's family in cattle. The cattle are powerful symbols, both of mature manhood and of commitment to a woman. However, these days, few young men can afford them. Partly for this reason, marriage rates in southern Africa have plummeted since the 1970's, and men and women increasingly form temporary unions lasting months or years. High rates of female poverty mean some women rely on these liaisons for survival. 
 The tendency to form transactional sexual relationships has probably also been heightened by the penetration of the global market in consumer goods -- makeup, clothing, cellphones, cars and so on -- into impoverished communities throughout southern Africa. There is greater income inequality in South Africa and Botswana than in most other countries. On the main roads in large cities, BMW's and Mercedes-Benzes swish by, their occupants shuttling between chic shopping malls and lush suburbs. But about 60 percent of black South Africans live beneath the poverty line, and 50 percent are unemployed. Millions of people live in shacks with dirt floors. Even in Botswana, a prosperous country by African standards, almost half the population lives on less than $2 a day, according to the most recent published estimate. When a poor young woman is invited to a shopping mall or a restaurant by a well-dressed man with his own car, it must be like being offered a ride on the Space Shuttle. Unfortunately, these glamorous men are also the most likely to be unfaithful and thus, H.I.V.-positive. 
 This is a lesson Lulu, a 25-year-old H.I.V.-positive South African woman, learned the hard way. ''I was telling myself, 'He's my husband-to-be,' '' she said of the 26-year-old man who infected her with H.I.V. when she was 18. ''He was the director of a newspaper. He was a family friend and knew my parents from a long time back. He took me out, to lunch, dinner, to the zoo, the ocean. Maybe we went out eight or nine times. He was very good-looking, very well dressed, with a car and lots of money. We went to the mall. Everything was easy. When I asked for something, it was coming. I was feeling so happy, so excited. Then one day he invited me to a party, but he took me to a hotel. I didn't want to go, but I didn't know that he had already booked. He took me to the room.'' At first, Lulu said no, but the man begged her. This was Lulu's first sexual experience. I asked her if she reported it to the police, but this never occurred to her. ''It wasn't rape. I took my clothes off myself. I didn't scream.'' After that, the newspaper director didn't come back for six months. During that time, Lulu was tested for H.I.V. and discovered that she had become infected through her single sexual encounter. ''For me it was terrible,'' she said. She tried to contact her boyfriend by phone, but he was always away or about to leave town. '''I'm in Canada,' he'd say. 'I'm in Cape Town.' I was hurt that he didn't come back. Then I found out he was married at the time. He already had a son.'' 
 Muriel Kubeka, a research assistant with South Africa's Medical Research Council, explained, ''When a girl gets something in a transactional relationship, she sees it as a sign of love, not as an exchange for sex.'' Men don't always see it the same way. Transactional relationships are more likely to be coercive and violent, Jewkes has found, probably because the exchange of money and gifts gives men a sense of ownership over a girlfriend's sexuality. But even nonviolent transactional relationships, like Lulu's, often involve pleading, nagging and coercive pressure -- the man's way of enforcing what he views as an implicit sexual contract. 
 While young women complained to me of seduction by unfaithful men, young men without much money lamented that women had left them for richer men. ''A man's beauty is considered by his wealth,'' said Siya, a university student in Umtata who lost two girlfriends in a row to wealthier men who, he heard, were abusive. ''The boys I know think love is impossible,'' he said. ''They've been disappointed so many times.'' 
 Confusion about the meaning of love and money in relationships lay at the core of many coldblooded sexual escapades. ''It's easy to get a beautiful girl,'' said Junior, a 27-year-old H.I.V.-positive man I met in Gaborone, Botswana. ''But you have to lie to them and tell them you have things you don't really have.'' Junior recounted for me a decade of philandering. You could see that girls must have loved him. He was athletic and witty and extremely good-looking, although he was now very thin, and his voice was raspy with pneumonia. ''The whole problem is love. It's a failure of love. I never had anyone I could pour my soul to.'' 
 A day after speaking with Junior, I met Natasha, a 28-year-old woman infected with H.I.V., in Gaborone. ''Botswana men aren't very loving and caring,'' she told me. ''They're just users.'' She was never beaten or raped by boyfriends, but she felt the sting of their infidelity. ''When someone doesn't tell you the truth, you've been abused mentally. All the guys had other relationships, some were married. I never met a guy who was just by himself. . . . I want a kind, loving person, an honest person, with a very open mind, who'll tell me what he wants,'' she said. 
 ''What if he doesn't have a lot of money?'' I asked. I was thinking of Junior, also H.I.V.-positive, also wishing to turn over a new leaf. 
 ''What?'' she replied. ''Why would I want that? How are you going to survive if he doesn't have money?'' 
No public-health campaign can change the economic conditions that motivate transactional relationships. But health campaigns can make people more conscious of the risks they are taking and encourage the kinds of discussions about H.I.V. that took place in Uganda. A growing number of health experts are asking why Zero Grazing campaigns for monogamy have not been emphasized in southern Africa. In his 2003 book, ''Rethinking AIDS Prevention,'' the Harvard anthropologist Edward C. Green attributes the relative neglect of Zero Grazing-style campaigns to the ethnocentrism of the mainly European and American health experts who advise governments about how to draw up policies to fight AIDS. Long before the AIDS crisis, international health agencies were largely dedicated to distributing health-related commodities, including vaccines, antibiotics and contraceptives, in poor countries all over the world. This approach was rapidly embraced to deal with AIDS. But condoms were not commonly used in Africa, and people have been slow to adopt them. If only these experts properly understood African culture and indigenous concepts of sexuality, disease, danger and death, Green argues, the power of the Ugandan Zero Grazing campaign might have been recognized years ago. 
 Playing down the role of infidelity -- particularly on the part of men -- in the spread of H.I.V. may also have been politically necessary for Western advisers. For years most African governments did little to address the AIDS crisis in their countries; President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa even questioned whether H.I.V. caused AIDS. Outside experts struggled to get policymakers to care about the crisis at all. Perhaps recommending a policy on AIDS that implied criticism of adult sexual behavior -- behavior the elite policymakers might well have engaged in themselves -- would have forced these bureaucrats further into denial. Last month, I sent an e-mail message to the director of the Joint United Nations Program on H.I.V./AIDS, Peter Piot, in which I asked, among other things, why the agency had not done more to promote partner reduction. He sent back a response but did not answer that question. I also asked Michel Carael, a sociologist and former team leader in prevention at the agency, about the silence on this topic. He denied that the U.N. AIDS program, which was established in the mid-1990's, played down fidelity, but when I read through the agency's documents about H.I.V. prevention produced over the past several years, I found almost no mention of either partner reduction or faithfulness. 
 There are obviously limits to a government's power to change sexual behavior, and Uganda may have been a special case. Whites never settled there in large numbers, never threw large numbers of poor blacks off their land and never subjected people to the particularly degrading conditions of migrant labor endured by people throughout southern Africa. The climate is rainy and the soil fertile, and although this is changing, many Ugandans still make their living on small farms. As a result, Ugandans are more likely to live near their families and know their neighbors, and this probably enabled a more compassionate, open response to AIDS and a more rapid acceptance of the idea that trust and mutual fidelity were possible. The far more brutal history of southern Africa had the opposite effect. It weakened people's sense of trust and undermined relationships between men and women. 
 Many experts contend that sexual-behavior change in Africa is complicated because women's fear of abusive partners inhibits private discussions of sex, condom use and H.I.V. But in Uganda, gender relations seem to have improved during the Zero Grazing campaign; reports of desertions and divorces declined, and one recent study suggests that domestic battery there, though frequent, is half as common as in South Africa. Similarly, in the wake of the AIDS epidemic in the United States, gay men came to relate to one another differently, placing far more emphasis on friendship and commitment than before. Hopeful changes may be under way in South Africa today. Promiscuity may be declining, according to Stoneburner and Low-Beer, and gender relations in general may be improving. When Jewkes first began her research 10 years ago, between 20 and 30 percent of young women in surveys claimed that their first sexual experience was the result of either rape or, more commonly, forced sex by a boyfriend. Today, she and other researchers find the frequency of forced first sexual intercourse is far lower, reported by some 10 percent of young women in repeated surveys, a rate only slightly higher than that in the United States. ''I think the level of forcing has genuinely fallen,'' Jewkes said. She also has noticed that young South Africans are much more likely to talk about sex and are developing ''a vocabulary for discussing feelings and desires.''
 These discussions are unfolding in the midst of a vast debate about sex and love throughout southern Africa. After the fall of apartheid in the early 1990's, it was assumed that South Africans would be preoccupied with issues of race. Instead, notes Deborah Posel, a sociologist at the University of Witwatersrand, gender relations, not race relations, have taken center stage in political and cultural debates. When I was in Botswana and South Africa, the battle of the sexes raged on radio call-in programs and in gossip and advice columns. When the soap opera ''The Bold and the Beautiful'' is televised at 6 p.m., both countries nearly grind to a halt. Reactions to these shows can be profoundly personal. Recently, Don Mlangeni, an actor who plays an unfaithful husband on the South African soap opera ''Isidingo,'' was slapped by a stranger in a shopping mall. He and the actress who plays his mistress have received a flood of hate mail and have found themselves ostracized at parties. In her book ''Talk of Love: How Culture Matters,'' Ann Swidler, a sociologist at the University of California, Berkeley, argues that culture -- meaning discussions, as well as artistic and other expressions of our humanity -- flourishes in the unsettled corners of our lives, where the rules are uncertain or changing. Perhaps the preoccupation with sex in South Africa and Botswana has something to do with the fact that the AIDS epidemic, sexual coercion and violence are forcing people to search urgently for greater understanding of the vicissitudes of love, and for solutions to their own personal dilemmas.
 I asked Nkululeko Nxesi, former head of the Johannesburg-based National Association of People Living With H.I.V. and AIDS, whether he thought a campaign to encourage monogamy along the lines of Uganda's Zero Grazing program would be a good idea. He said it would, as long as it was one of a range of prevention programs including condoms, H.I.V.-testing centers and so on. Even encouraging serial faithfulness as practiced in Western countries might make a real difference. But, he said, some people still felt promoting faithfulness might be unrealistic. The problem was history, he explained, and the destabilization of the southern African family by the upheavals of apartheid and the migrant labor system. 
 Even so, a fidelity campaign does seem worth a try, even if it might seem overly simplistic and preachy. Nxesi put it this way: ''I met a Ugandan AIDS worker a few years ago, and he told me, 'In Uganda we may not have highways and tall buildings, but we take care of our people.''' Nxesi has been thinking about that lately. ''Down the line, we will realize that development is not only about how good your infrastructure is, but it's also about the heart.''

HEADLINE: The Attraction of 'Interest-Only' Loans

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
ALMOST everyone dreams of owning that chalet in the mountains or cottage by the beach. But with mortgage rates creeping up and homes becoming pricier by the minute, owning vacation property may seem more out of reach.
 Some buyers are forging ahead anyway, with a little creative financing. Using a once-obscure loan option that lets them defer principal payments from 1 to 10 years, they're finding that they can borrow more than they might otherwise be eligible for, while at the same time free up cash for home repairs or other investments. 
 These are ''interest-only'' mortgages that also carry low variable rates tied to a short-term index like the Libor, or London Inter Bank Offering Rate. The one-month Libor is around 1.13 percent -- add a 2 percent margin, and you have a Libor adjustable rate mortgage at 3.13 percent. A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is around 6 percent.
 Of course, there's a catch: you build no equity during the interest-only phase. And if you cannot afford the payments after that period, when payments will begin to include the principal, you'll probably have to refinance, or sell the place. 
 But borrowers say it's worth the risk as demand for second homes rises. ''You make money in the appreciation -- that's how I build equity,'' said Thomas M. Crowder, 25, of Santa Rosa, Calif.
 Mr. Crowder, an associate for a venture capital group, plans to use interest-only loans to buy two homes in Florida -- a one-bedroom town house in Tampa, for $83,700, and a four-bedroom house in a gated lakeside community in nearby New Tampa, for $500,000. He plans to rent the house, which he is scheduled to close on this week, in the winter and vacation there in the summer; the town house, with a December closing date, will be rented year-round. Both are expected to be sold within five years. ''In four or five years I could see the house go for over $800,000,'' Mr. Crowder said. 
 Not all borrowers, though, are looking to make a quick profit. Some intend to make the principal payments, as many lenders allow you to do without penalty; they just like having the option of skipping a month or two. Maybe they're not sure they can rent the place. Or maybe their income fluctuates. 
 ''You can achieve greater flexibility than with a fully amortizing loan,'' said Keith Gumbinger, a vice president at HSH Associates in Pompton Plains, N.J., which tracks the mortgage industry. He said interest-only loans were common in the 1920's, but rarely used again until the 1980's. ''Savvy investors didn't want to pump all of their available money into real estate,'' he said. 
 Khalid Shams, 39, a banker with a home in Fountain Valley, Calif., said he was drawn to the loans because of the low rates. Last fall, when he bought his four-bedroom house for $489,000, he considered a 30-year jumbo mortgage, with a 6.5 percent rate, but instead chose a three-year A.R.M., with an interest-only option, at 4.375 percent. The difference between the fixed-rate payment and what he now pays is about $1,250 a month, he said, and he's applying the difference to reduce the principal. ''I make the fully amortized payment, and more.'' His goal: pay half the mortgage in five years, then buy a vacation home the same way.
 If you want significant cash relief, a low rate is crucial. ''You'll want to take advantage of the unusually wide spread between short- and long-term rates right now,'' said Henry Savage, president of PMC Mortgage in Alexandria, Va. 
 But mortgage bankers are cautious. Most of the loans carry adjustable rates, which are vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations, they say. Also, not everyone may qualify for the loan: an average borrower has a high net income, a better-than-average credit score and is usually required to put down a higher down payment, according to David Herpers, director of consumer affairs for Amerisave Mortgage, an online bank.
 Mr. Savage said, ''I always make sure that the borrowers know that if they pay interest only they must take the difference and do something constructive with that money.'' He added, ''People who make interest-only payments should be able to afford a fully amortized payment.''
 What concerns others is the economy.
 ''What happens if rates go up and the property values stop rising? If you're forced to hold the property, can you hold it?'' said Hank Madden, a financial planner in Jacksonville, Fla. ''In real estate you have to have a well-defined exit strategy.''
 Mr. Crowder says he does. ''When the housing market is down,'' he said, ''the rental market usually goes up, so I think I end up being O.K.''

The Devil's Playground:A Century of Pleasure and Profit in Times Square
By James Traub
 At the corner of Broadway and 42nd Street, with Disney duking it out with Viacom, and Reuters against Conde Nast, we feel that we are occupying ''an imagistic, virtual space.'' And it is a thrilling space, the crossroads of the colossal enterprise of pop culture -- just as it was, mutatis mutandi, a hundred years ago. It is both a particular place and a virtualized, electronic no-place.

HEADLINE: 'Hey Hey, Ho Ho, Those Old Protest Tactics Have to Go'

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

 BODY:
When protesters descend on the Republican convention this summer, Christian Herold will be there with bells on. Then, he will ring them.
 Mr. Herold has ordered hundreds of one-inch, gold-plated bells -- the kind that could easily adorn a Christmas tree -- that he plans to distribute to any takers. He will call participants in his Ring Out project to surround ground zero -- as close as they can -- and raise a cacophony to ''ring out the Republicans'' shortly before the convention opens on Aug. 30.
 ''The bell stands for different emotions -- anger, alarm -- and it's emblematic of the Liberty Bell,'' Mr. Herold, 47, said the other night as he and three companions readied dozens of bells to show at a meeting of protest groups. 
 Mr. Herold is hardly alone in making somewhat unorthodox plans to greet the Republicans, who will hold their convention for the first time in New York, from Aug. 30 to Sept. 2 at Madison Square Garden.
 Luke Kuhn, 38, a self-described radical who lives near Washington, has sent out e-mail pleas seeking a suitable kiln to melt a brass ring, about the size of a large wedding band, inscribed with Bush Uber Alles, at the start of the convention. Axis of Eve, a protest group formed in January to focus on women's rights, is selling underwear adorned with anti-Bush slogans and is organizing 100 women to flash them during the convention (The underwear will be worn over body suits or leotards to keep it legal.)
 Zoe Strauss, a Philadelphia photographer, is urging people to wear red bandannas en masse as a symbol of protest and plans to bring 10,000 to the convention to hand out. Wendy Tremayne, a performance artist, is recruiting volunteers for a Vomitorium, a re-enactment of a Roman orgy that she plans to stage as a protest against imperialism, consumerism and gluttony.
 Just what approach to take is debated among prospective demonstrators, in meetings and Internet chat groups, where calls to shut down the Republican gathering and confront the police are mixed with pleadings to march peacefully and in large numbers.
 Some organizers favor something in between, maybe not as confrontational as the anarchists' approach but an alternative to mass marches in which large groups, typically kept behind metal barricades, hold signs and chant familiar refrains: ''Hey hey, ho ho (insert objectionable entity here) has got to go'' and the like. Some 15 organizations have applied to the Police Department for permits for large street demonstrations just before or during the convention.
 ''There is an element among protesters who feel that classical tactics are stale,'' said Todd Gitlin, a professor of journalism and sociology at Columbia University who was a leader of antiwar protests in the 1960's and has studied protest movements. ''I think it is built into the protest process that especially younger people come along and want to stake a claim to novelty.''
 That was part of the motivation for Axis of Eve, organized by a group of young women to get disaffected voters, particularly young women, excited about politics and the possibility of defeating President Bush.
 ''We wanted to think of some unique, creative way to engage people in a different way, to reach out to people who weren't politically engaged,'' said Zazel Loven, 33, a founder of the group, who is known as Eve Angel. ''I had been to marches but I wanted to go beyond that.''
 Street theater has long been a part of demonstrations. But along with the drumming and mask-making -- and there is a group, Theater Against War, ready to help with that -- some see a growing role for humorous, irreverent, thought-provoking ways to draw attention to their messages.
 In apartments, over the Internet and, in the case of the Ring Out project, the back room of a West Village cafe, they are plotting.
 ''This brings up memories of the 60's when you saw this kind of thing all the time,'' said Joshua Spahn, a 49-year-old software programmer who is part of the Ring Out project. ''I think it's an exciting new way to energize people. It piques people's curiosity rather than hit them over the head with a political message.''
 The organizational sophistication varies.
 Billionaires for Bush, one of the better known of the theatrical protest groups, whose members dress to the nines and picket Republican events shouting slogans like ''Blood for oil'' and ''Corporations are people too,'' lists on its Web site more than 50 chapters in the United States and France, Korea , Australia and Germany. It sells T-shirts, CD's and ''fashion kits'' with top hats.
 By contrast, Mr. Kuhn, an unemployed bike messenger who wants to melt the protest ring, seems long on ambition but short on resources.
 Inspired by the ''Lord of the Rings,'' the ring ''makes a point that Bush is a dark lord,'' Mr. Kuhn said. Therefore, it must be destroyed, as in the book and movies, but Mr. Kuhn is not sure how to do it: maybe using a barbecue grill with coals fanned by a hair dryer.
 ''I can make a bellows, if nobody has a hair dryer, from salvaged wood that day, if necessary,'' he wrote on an electronic bulletin board. ''I can easily rig the grill to be an improvised 'forge,' as a blacksmith would know it, and that will easily handle the destruction.'' 
 Others have faith that the grass-roots spirit among protesters -- and the wide reach of the Internet -- will help their ideas catch on.
 After posting her red bandanna idea on a protest group e-mail list, Ms. Strauss, 34, received a ''deluge'' of support, she said, as well as messages from a few dissenters who objected to the idea because it smacked of a dress code.
 She said she chose red bandannas after reading that striking coal miners in the 19th century wore them as a sign of solidarity. It should make a powerful, ''all-American'' unifying emblem, she said.
 ''It is very important to have a grass-roots symbol people can connect to and people can see,'' she said. ''When Republicans come they can see a much bigger opposition.''
 Likewise, the organizers of the Ring Out project searched for a unifying symbol with patriotic overtones: the Liberty Bell.
 Mr. Herold, an adjunct drama professor at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, has bought nearly 800 of the little bells -- a packet of three is 99 cents -- and is aiming to corral enough supporters to deploy 50,000 bell ringers.
 The bells will be attached to ribbons and pinned to clothing, along with small cards of explanation. For more vigorous protesting, they can easily be taken off and rattled.
 Last week Mr. Herold and Mr. Spahn sat with other supporters, a lawyer and a fund-raiser for nonprofit organizations.
 Amid the jingle of the bells they discussed everything from the history of bells to their future: whether bell ringing would run afoul of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's campaign to reduce annoying noise in the city. 
 Mr. Spahn wondered aloud if people would understand the intent of the bells.
 ''How do we make the message real clear to people, to innocent bystanders?'' he asked.
 Mr. Herold replied that such symbols tend to catch on quickly.
 ''Look at the branding of the AIDS ribbons,'' he said.
 When the discussion turned to how far removed protesters would likely be from the convention site, Mr. Spahn sounded optimistic.
 ''Nice thing about a bell,'' he said, ''is you have hundreds of people with a bell like that, even a half-mile away they will be heard.''

HEADLINE: Seizing The Moment To Cash Out And 'Go Rental'

BYLINE: By AMY GUNDERSON

 BODY:
THE departure of Ron and Barbara Schneider from Greenwich Village this spring is right up there with the closing of the 80-year-old A. Zito & Sons Bakery. With retirement looming and with record high real estate values, the couple decided to take the money and run. They sold the home they bought 30 years ago, a sunny 2,000-square-foot apartment on West 12th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, and rented a two-bedroom penthouse apartment in Battery Park City. 
 ''We decided it would make sense now,'' said Mr. Schneider, who has taught in the city schools for many years and is retiring in July. ''Teacher pensions are pretty good,'' he said, ''but this really adds a lot to it, quite frankly.'' 
 The appreciation has been so ''enormous,'' Mr. Schneider said, that ''I can't even do the mathematical computation in my head.'' He said that he and his wife bought the apartment for less than $100,000 and sold it for nearly $1.7 million. 
 The Schneiders will use interest from their windfall to cover living expenses, including their $3,800 monthly rent. They will also use some of the profits for travel, and for college funds for their three grandchildren. 
 But even with such a stellar return on their real estate investment, the couple aren't eager to own anytime soon. ''If we bought something now, a year from now it might not appreciate or could depreciate,'' Mr. Schneider said. 
 Brokers say that the packed open houses and multiple bids of the spring have prompted a number of owners to sell and look toward the rental market for real deals -- and not just owners on the cusp of retirement. 
 ''People who have purchased homes realize that they can sell these homes and enjoy considerable profits to the degree of millions of dollars,'' said Neil Binder, co-founder of the Bellmarc Companies. And renting makes sense, he said, when prices are lower than the true costs for a comparable purchase. 
 However, the perfect moment to sell and then rent may be passing. Interest rates are going up, and rents, according to brokers, have started to rise in Manhattan. And at any time, there is no way to be sure that a big appreciation is not still to come. Roseann Torti, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman, and her husband sold their Lattingtown, N.Y., home two years ago. ''We bought it in the 1980's at the height of the market,'' Mrs. Torti said. ''For 10 years we couldn't make a penny on the house. So when the market came back, we looked at each other and said, 'Do we ride out another cycle?' '' The answer for the couple was a resounding no, so in 2002, they sold and moved into a rental home. ''We should have waited a year,'' said Mrs. Torti, who tries to have no regrets about the sale. ''We probably sacrificed $200,000. But at that point we were satisfied.'' 
 Because of 1997 tax law changes, married couples can keep up to $500,000 in profit from the sale of a primary home tax free as long as they have owned it for at least two years. Single people can take up to $250,000 tax free.
 Those with prime properties are especially eager to take their profits now. Patricia Whitehead, an associate broker with the Corcoran Group, said she was surprised when one of her clients told her he planned to sell his one-bedroom apartment in Carnegie Hill and then move into a rental. 
 ''There was an urgency to him when he called me,'' she said. ''I said, 'Don't be silly, you live in such a great building.' He said: 'Look I had two years' free rent. The market is doing well, I want to reap the benefits.' '' The 760-square-foot apartment near Lexington Avenue, which was in a prewar building and in mint condition, was snapped up for $500,000, $25,000 above the asking price and $92,000 more than what he paid for it two years ago. 
 But even less than perfect properties have been flying off the market, benefiting from the frenzy. Recently, Arleen Durso decided to sell an apartment on East 14th Street that she had bought 15 years ago to provide her with a steady stream of rental income. It was no great beauty, but it always had a tenant. ''It is a very nice apartment, but it does suffer from lack of light and no view,'' said Thomas Demsker, an associate broker with William B. May, which listed the apartment for $350,000. ''Yet it went over. People were bidding on it like it was the Taj Mahal.'' 
 For Ms. Durso, who will use the proceeds to live in a $650-a-month rental in Florida, the apartment means worry-free living. ''It has given me great security,'' said Ms. Durso, who had used an inheritance to buy the property. ''It tripled. I never thought it would triple.''
 She is glad she didn't put that money into frivolous purchases. ''I didn't go out and buy a pair of shoes, but now I can buy a thousand pairs of shoes when I sell this apartment,'' she said. 
 Of course, you don't have to look outside of New York to find a bargain rental. Malkit Hayun didn't even leave her Upper East Side building. Ms. Hayun's three-year real estate odyssey has taken her from apartment renter to co-op owner and back to a tenant again after selling her two-bedroom apartment this spring, all without ever moving out of her East 80th Street building. She is now renting an apartment in the building that is similar to but $500 less than the one she rented before buying. ''Paying $2,100 a month in rent is still a great expenditure, but the prices to buy are outrageous,'' she said. ''It is disproportional to the rents.'' 
 The relative attractiveness of some rentals can prompt a re-evaluation of the decision to buy. Kenneth Scheff, a director of sales for Stribling & Associates, said that one family just give up searching for a three-bedroom co-op and decided to take a $6,500 monthly rental instead. ''They did it as a temporary measure but they got something very lovely -- two floors in a town house,'' Mr. Scheff said. ''They might not go back to being owners. It is less than the after-tax cost of owning.'' 
 Deals like these may become harder to find in the next few months. Brokers say rents are rising, especially at the high end, and in apartments with three or four bedrooms. ''The rental market in that size is very tight,'' said Ronnie Russo Landau, an associate broker with Corcoran. ''In a high-rise building, the larger apartments are at premium.'' 
 The decision to sell and move into a rental is often preceded by months of number crunching and nail-biting bets on where the real estate market is headed. John and Valerie Reilly knew their 1,700-square-foot home in Glen Cove, N.Y., wasn't for the long haul. They wanted more space and a house in a different school district. But the question remained: sell now or wait two years? They decided to sell and rent a house in nearby Sea Cliff. In the end, Mr. Reilly called it ''almost a wash.''
 ''It's a little cheaper to rent if you are making money on the equity,'' Mr. Reilly said. Despite that, he figured it was time to sell because he worried that higher interest rates would make it harder to sell. ''My fear,'' he said, ''was that the pool of people that can afford a house that size was dwindling.'' 
 He acknowledges that the move was risky. If the house continues to appreciate rapidly, he said, ''I'm dead wrong.'' 
 For Cindy DiPrima, there is no looking back. ''There are some good opportunities for renting and it is a good time to sell, which seems it would be a bad time to buy,'' said Ms. DiPrima, a prop stylist for magazines, who paid $70,000 for her Perry Street apartment 10 years ago. She knew the apartment had appreciated in value, but she had no idea what the market would yield until she consulted with Jill Meilus, an agent with Corcoran. ''I almost fell off my chair when she told me what I could get for it,'' said Ms. DiPalma, who is in contract to sell the 350-square-foot apartment for $299,000. 
 She plans to rent in Manhattan or Brooklyn and pay at least $1,500 a month. The proceeds from the sale will not only provide her with more space to live in, but some peace of mind. ''It is a nice safety net that will allow me to be more bold in what I take on,'' Ms. DiPalma said. ''I'm excited to live in a big empty room with a big check in the bank.'' 
 In the second-home market, too, sellers are making their moves. Lee Schwartz sold her East Hampton home and is renting a three-bedroom house in July for $12,000. Despite her love for her home, she looked at the decision in a very practical way. ''I felt like I should strike while the iron is hot,'' Ms. Schwartz said. ''I knew that I could rent something for the amount of money that I spent to keep up the house every year.'' 
 While Ms. Schwartz has no plans to buy again in the Hamptons, brokers say that more people are selling with the intention of jumping back in when prices drop. ''Folks are trying to time the market,'' said Diane Saatchi, vice president of sales at Corcoran. ''Renting for one summer is no big deal if you figure the summer rent is 5 percent of the value of a house. So if you think the market is going to swing more than 5 percent it pays to rent. All of this makes a great cocktail conversation.'' 
 But she says that sellers often fail to account for the cost of getting in and out of the real estate market, including closing costs, moving expenses, and in the Hamptons, preservation taxes. ''It really erases the gain; you need a big sling in market prices,'' Mrs. Saatchi said. 
 Others have decided that the high real estate values in the area are a signal to pack their bags and leave town. In March, Elaine Hruska, a stock trader, sold her two-bedroom 30th floor apartment at Plaza 400 on East 56th Street, where she has lived for the last 25 years. (She wouldn't disclose the price, though a similar unit is on the market for $1.15 million.) Higher interest rates and talk about a real estate bubble persuaded her to put her co-op on the market. And the way she sees it, just in time. A May housing report showed that new home sales in April experienced the biggest monthly drop in 10 years, making her ecstatic. ''I was jumping for joy,'' Ms. Hruska said. ''All the stars were in alignment.'' She plans to buy again but isn't in any rush. ''I think time is on my side,'' she said.
 Now, she rents a $1 million home on a lagoon in Hilton Head, S.C., complete with fireplace and gazebo, for $2,200 a month. ''I have all of these amenities that I couldn't have in my apartment -- a laundry room and my own thermostat that I actually control so I don't freeze twice a year,'' Ms. Hruska said. ''And there is no co-op board telling me when I can vacuum.''

HEADLINE: By a Back Door to the U.S.: A Migrant's Grim Sea Voyage

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON and SANDRA OCHOA

DATELINE: PEDERNALES, Ecuador 

 BODY:
A red light, barely visible on the horizon, made the captain of the William turn as mean as the devil.
 It was the fourth day of an illegal sea voyage. Hector Segura was at the helm of a creaky old fishing boat overloaded with 205 passengers: all migrants from Ecuador, all hoping to reach the United States. The distant flicker, Mr. Segura thought, was the law on their tail.
 He rushed his human contraband into the foul, cramped darkness below deck and warned them not to come out. From that night on, he cut their rations of food and water because he was worried that to avoid capture, he might need to stay at sea longer than planned and he wanted to make the boat's meager resources last. 
 Their bellies aching, their tongues parched, some of the migrants began to call the captain ''El Diablo.'' Most, however, accepted him as a necessary evil.
 To them, he was a coyote, or coyotero, an operative in a chain of smugglers who guide migrants from the highlands of Ecuador up the Pacific Coast to Guatemala, then overland across Mexico and through border deserts into the United States. Many of the travelers on his ship were headed to Queens.
 In collaboration with The New York Times, a reporter from El Tiempo, a newspaper in Cuenca, Ecuador, took the eight-day voyage, covering 1,100 nautical miles from a cove near this scruffy Ecuadorean beach resort to the northern coast of Guatemala. Her journey as a client of smugglers -- and sometimes a hostage -- provides a rare look inside one small part of the vast pipeline that carries untold numbers of migrants to the United States each year.
 Up close, the typical migrant smuggler is unlike the sophisticated, violent mastermind portrayed by American law enforcement officials. Most never went to high school. They are often unarmed. They are motivated by the same poverty that drives migrants from their homelands.
 The smugglers run a business built for the poor by the poor, relying on willpower and wooden boats to move thousands of people. They do not always prey on migrants. Their business is based on trust that runs deep in communities that have sent migrants to the United States for decades.
 David Kyle, an expert on migrant smuggling at the University of California, said Latin American governments, which have grown dependent on money sent home by migrants, put up little more than symbolic fights against smugglers and even celebrated illegal migrants as national heroes. In the United States, the fight against the smuggling clashes with powerful economic interests that depend on illegal workers.
 Peter Andreas, author of the book ''Border Games: Policing the U.S.-Mexico Divide,'' called the border efforts a ''politically successful policy failure'' -- successful at conveying an image of aggressive action, but a failure in deterring either smugglers or migrants. 
 The United States Border Patrol reported in June that the number of migrants detained along the border with Mexico over the six months ended in April had jumped to nearly 660,000, from 505,000 a year earlier. The United States government often cites detention numbers as a way to measure illegal migration.
 ''We are basically swatting flies,'' said one high-level official in the United States Department of Homeland Security. ''Essentially we are completely overwhelmed by the numbers. They're just running over us.''
 Indeed, across Latin America, business is booming for people smugglers like the captain of the William, despite a multibillion-dollar security crackdown at the United States border after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks -- or rather, because of it. 
 Immigrants, driven by faltering economies at home and facing reinforced border controls and airport security all along the trail from Central America to the Rio Grande, are turning to smugglers to guide them along increasingly remote and perilous routes. Most of them cross Central America and Mexico. 
 American and Mexican officials report an alarming increase in Brazilians flying into Mexico City and then moving overland to the United States. The flow of Cubans seeking to reach the United States, where they almost automatically win asylum, has begun to shift from southern Florida to routes through Mexico's crowded tourist resorts in the Yucatan then north to Texas. 
 Migration officials have also begun to find Eastern Europeans in northern Mexico, heading for Los Angeles. 
 Among these smuggling routes, United States immigration and military authorities say, the Ecuadorean sea voyage is one of the least visible and fastest growing in Latin America. In the last four years, at least 250,000 people have left Ecuador on fishing boats, they say. That is nearly 10 times the 27,000 Haitians who embarked by boat for the United States during the 1990's.
 As demand for the smugglers' services has soared, so have their profits. Immigration authorities from Ecuador, Mexico and the United States estimate that people smuggling in the hemisphere generates some $20 billion a year, second only to drugs. 
 Ecuadoreans typically pay between $10,000 to $12,000 for passage to the United States, often putting up their homes or small plots of land as collateral to loan sharks, called chulqueros, who charge exorbitant interest. 
 For many, the monthlong journey begins with 8 to 10 days at sea. Migrants leave from beaches along Ecuador's poorly guarded coast, head west out to sea toward the Galapagos Islands, then north to Guatemala, where geography and rampant corruption make it as popular as Mexico as a transshipment point for drugs, guns and people. 
 The voyage is dangerous. Villages across southern Ecuador run rife with tales of people who left for the United States and disappeared along the way. Four years ago, Ecuadorean officials conducted a rare investigation into the drownings of at least 26 people off northern Guatemala. Most reported deaths are simply ignored.
 Hundreds of unidentified bodies, many believed to be Ecuadoreans, have washed ashore there and have been buried by residents in a seaside graveyard, marked simply ''XX.''

The Economics of the Smugglers
 Each illegal sea voyage from Ecuador involves collaboration among several groups of smugglers, who seek passengers and then join together to hire a boat. Many of the groups spring from extended families. Ties of kinship and community bind together the chiefs, the guides, the ships' crews, the drivers and the operators of safe houses as the migrants move northward, passed from hand to hand along the way.
 One of the most important groups involved in the January voyage of the William was led by a young woman named Rosa Hipatia Zhingri Angamarca. She runs her business from Cuenca, a quaint colonial town high in the Ecuadorean Andes.
 In a telephone interview, Ms. Zhingri, a 30-year-old mother of two, acknowledged that she smuggled migrants. But she described herself as a good coyote. She said she made sure her clients traveled safely, if not comfortably. If her clients are intercepted by the authorities before reaching their destinations, Ms. Zhingri said, she arranges for them to make two more attempts at no extra fee. 
 ''I am only trying to help people,'' she said, ''Not hurt them.''
 The rise and fall and rise again of her own family runs parallel to the struggling region where she runs her business. Until five years ago, she said, her father ran a successful bus company. A serious crisis in 1999, caused by plummeting oil prices and billions of dollars of damage from storms, plunged the economy into ruins. Ecuador adopted the dollar as its national currency to help stop soaring inflation. But the value of Ecuadorean wages fell by half, devastating families who could barely make ends meet. 
 Ms. Zhingri said her father's bus company went bankrupt. Friends invited him to get in on the booming migrant trade. Her father had been a migrant, she said. He traveled back and forth to New York to work in restaurants. So he had established contacts who could help move others, too.
 The smuggling business has been good for the Zhingri family, and brought new signs of life to an otherwise dying region.
 The Inter-American Development Bank reports that migrants send nearly $1.5 billion a year back to Ecuador, the second-largest source of foreign income after oil. The money has paid for New England-style mansions that sprawl across old potato fields. It has paved roads and paid for shiny sport utility vehicles.
 But there are few able-bodied men. Most have gone to the United States for work. Women and children are now going in droves.
 Ms. Zhingri said her family had made a decent but not extravagant living. She said she took over her father's business last year because he was 60 and suffering from diabetes.
 She agreed to speak to an American reporter, she said, because she wanted to make clear that she was not a smuggling kingpin. 
 ''The big coyotes are the ones with hotels and travel agencies and fancy cars,'' she said. ''I do not have any of that.''
 When asked if she had ever traveled to the United States, Guatemala or Mexico, along the same routes that she had sent so many others, she laughed and said, ''I have not even been to Guayaquil,'' Ecuador's port city in the south.
 United States immigration authorities in Ecuador, however, have linked Ms. Zhingri to several boats caught smuggling people out of Ecuador, and identify her family as one of the leading smuggling mafias in Azuay Province. In joint operations with other smuggling clans, the authorities estimate, Ms. Zhingri moves at least two migrant boats a month.
 ''I do not know why they say that about me,'' Ms. Zhingri said. ''I send people. I do not deny it. But I do not send the number of people they say I do. I send two, three, four people at a time.''
 At least 30 people on the William said they were clients of Ms. Zhingri. One of them, a woman named Blanca Chipre, said of the Zhingri family, ''They are millionaires.'' 
 The January voyage of the William, for which 205 migrants paid an average fee of $10,000 each, was worth at least $2 million.
 When asked to explain the division of that money, Ms. Zhingri said the owner of the boat earned about $1,200 a passenger, more than enough to cover the cost of the vessel if it was intercepted and sunk by the authorities.
 About $800 a person went to smugglers in Guatemala, she said, for retrieving migrants from the beaches and providing them food and lodging.
 Migrants pay an estimated $2,000 to guides and safe house operators that help them through Mexico. Then they pay a final $5,000 when they reach Los Angeles, a smuggling hub considered the beginning of the end of their journey. From there, the migrants take planes, buses and cars throughout the United States.
 Ms. Zhingri said her cut was $1,000 to $1,200 per migrant.
 ''It is good money if the migrant makes it on the first trip,'' she said. ''If he is caught and sent back, then I have to send him again at my own expense and I earn almost nothing.''
 Neither reporter ever saw Ms. Zhingri during the planning of the January voyage of the William. But the migrants and their guides talked about her frequently.
 The Ecuadorean reporter arranged passage through one of her intermediaries, a car salesman named Jorge Ordonez.
 The young Mr. Ordonez, gel in the hair and creases in his jeans, and wearing a plush leather jacket, spends his afternoons at a car lot on Cuenca's bustling Avenue of the Americas. But he makes his real money arranging illegal passage for would-be migrants. 
 The Ecuadorean reporter met with him in January to book passage as far as Guatemala. They negotiated in the back seat of a Jeep. The deal took less than 20 minutes. 
 Mr. Ordonez said the fee for the boat ride was $2,600. The price was much more than what most migrants pay but the only way, he said, to get her on the top of a long waiting list of people desperate to leave. He agreed to take cash and traveler's checks. When asked for guarantees that the boats were safe, he gave them. 
 ''There is nothing to worry about,'' he said. ''These boats are nothing like what you have heard. They are a little uncomfortable, but they are safe. They always make it.''
 On almost any afternoon, it is easy to find groups of poor, disgruntled fishermen and sailors gathered at a littered plaza next to the sea in the port town of Manta, hoping someone will pass by to offer them jobs. Work is scarce, they say. Pay is typically about $100 a month.
 To men like these, migrant smuggling offers a small fortune. Santo Cabeza, 55, said he served as a cook on several migrant boats, including the Ronald, and earned about $1,000 for each voyage. Fortunato Mero, in his 60's, said he earned the same amount as a machinist on a migrant boat called the Calamar. Angel Sevillana said he was promised $1,000 to captain the Narcisita de Jesus.
 One of the most outspoken fishermen in the plaza on a muggy December afternoon was Hector Segura, a tall and lanky man with a head full of spongy black curls, the father of two small children. In a conversation with the American reporter, he denied ever having worked on a migrant boat and, for the sake of his children, he said he never would.
 Still, he said he sympathized strongly with those who do. He said the fishermen were driven to smuggling for the same reasons that so many migrants are driven from their homeland.
 ''They do not think about this once or twice, but a thousand times, before they do it,'' Mr. Segura said of the fishermen's decision to ferry migrants across the ocean. ''But what else can they do: accept pennies for their work and let their children die of hunger? They either work with coyoteros, or they live in misery. It's simple.''
 In fact, that sad reality and the waves of migrants leaving Ecuador have transformed much of the country's 1,000-mile coastline. Gritty seaside towns like Pedernales, several hours north of Manta, bustle with prostitutes, traffickers and low-brow tourists and have become important areas for illegal migration.
 Residents say coyotes began bringing migrants to the isolated coves around Pedernales about five years ago, after a plague wiped out a promising shrimp industry. Unemployed fishermen rushed to sign up for service on the migrant boats. Families converted spare bedrooms into shelters and thatched roof bungalows into restaurants.
 On a Saturday morning in January, not a single plastic table was occupied at the seaside Magdalena Restaurant. But the owners, Jose Moreira and his wife, were busy frying a vat of fish.
 His customers, he explained, cannot always come to him. Often they are camped on beaches outside of town, waiting for boats. So he delivers.
 ''Sure, it hurts me to see so many people leaving, especially the ones who are very, very young,'' Mr. Moreira said. ''But what can I do? There is nothing I can do to stop them. So while they are here, we help them, and they help us.''
 On the second Sunday in January, a new stream of migrants began to arrive from the mountains. They came on commercial buses and cattle trucks. Some went straight to the beach. Others checked into local hotels for a shower and a nap. Then they lined up at public phones to make calls to relatives, or to their coyotes.
 ''Don't talk to anyone,'' Marco Zhingri told the Ecuadorean reporter who had booked passage and had arrived at Pedernales to await departure. ''If people ask what you are doing here, tell them you are a tourist visiting the beach.''
 It would soon become clear, however, that the migrants' plans were an open secret. 
 Desk clerks demand the $8 room fee in advance at the Hotel America, a five-story building that stretches across an entire block near the center of town. Strangers knocked on the doors to ask, ''Whose passenger are you?'' and to collect $2 for the bus that would take the migrants to the isolated beach where they would depart. 
 Maids pumped guests they had never met before for secrets. ''When are you going to travel?'' one maid asked as she hung a mosquito net in Room 217. ''Sometimes people stay here for weeks waiting for a boat.''
 One boy, about 10 and pressed and polished as if he were going to Sunday school, seemed to work light security detail, helping to watch over the migrants to make sure that no one bothered them and that they did not talk to strangers who might interfere with the plan. 
 The boy followed the Ecuadorean reporter each time she left her hotel. He stood outside a restaurant while she ate lunch. He stood at a nearby corner as she made calls from a public telephone. And he trailed her as she wandered through a street market.
 The American reporter, in town to keep watch over her colleague, was followed by at least five men in a red truck with tinted windows. Then they parked until dawn outside her hotel, taking long swigs from a bottle of Old Parr scotch.

The Economics on Board
 At 10 p.m., the sound of knocking filled the hallways at the Hotel America and guests were called from their rooms. They rushed single-file down the stairs, as if responding to a fire drill, to board a bus waiting out front. When all the seats were filled, Mr. Zhingri climbed aboard, a man with dark features and draped with gold jewelry.
 The bus took off at getaway speed, and without turning on its headlights careered north on a two-lane highway. About 20 minutes later, Mr. Zhingri ordered the driver to stop and told the migrants to run straight through the trees to the beach.
 ''Trust me,'' he said, ''You will be in Guatemala in a week.''
 The William awaited several miles off shore. From a distance, it was a reassuring sight: big and broad. But once the migrants were ferried there in small motorboats and began to get settled on board, they realized it was not big enough.
 As the hold began to fill, some of the passengers shouted that there was no more room. A couple tried to block the hatch.
 A crew member quelled the small uprising. He jumped down into the pit, and kicked the passengers out of the way.
 ''Move over,'' he growled, ''We have a lot more people who have to fit down here.''
 Then the floor at the front of the hold caved in, sending dozens of passengers tumbling onto the hull.
 One of them turned on a flashlight, allowing the migrants to see the insides of the vessel they had entrusted to carry them to better lives. It looked like a floating coffin: rotting floorboards, cracked beams and water dripping everywhere.
 The flashlight went out. Whispered prayers began to fill the darkness, and continued until sunrise. 
 Then the migrants began to crawl slowly onto the deck to stretch. They seemed shocked at how many there were: more men than women, most in their 20's and 30's. But there were also a few older faces, and some so young they looked as if they had not finished grade school.
 No one was more shocked by their numbers than the captain, who turned out to be Hector Segura, the same spongy-haired fisherman from Manta who claimed he had never been a smuggler, and never would be. The Ecuadorean reporter on board, however, was not the same reporter he had met in the park. The Ecuadorean managed to travel, at least for the first few days, without revealing her connection to The New York Times.
 It was immediately clear to everyone on board that Mr. Segura was an experienced smuggler. He took a quick visual count of the passengers and determined there were at least 50 more than he had planned. There was enough fuel, he indicated, and enough food and water, but way too little room for so many people.
 ''This is not going to be a comfortable trip,'' he said.

Grim Passage, Talkative Captain
 His words proved an understatement.
 Each hour that passed seemed more unbearable than the last. Meals were only big enough to whet the appetite: a handful of crackers and small cube of cheese at breakfast; a watery vegetable stew with a small plate of sardines and rice at lunch; about the same for dinner.
 The rough waves and asphyxiating humidity quickly took their toll on passengers who had never seen the ocean before, much less ridden across it. They became pale. Their lips cracked and blistered. They complained of dizziness, nausea and diarrhea.
 Rank smells drifted everywhere: in the boat's single bathroom, in the kitchen, especially down in the hold.
 By the third day, many of the passengers began running out of the bottles of water they had brought on board and the packages of nuts and dried fruit that sustained them between meals.
 Sickness spread. The water on board was clearly not safe -- there were floating particles visible in every glass -- but that was all there was to drink. Many of the passengers said that if they had known they would feel so bad, they would have never embarked on the journey.
 A young passenger named Vinicio said he had lived through worse. He looked about 15, but explained he was a veteran migrant. He had previously tried to reach the United States twice by land, and once by sea. Each time, the authorities caught him and sent him back to Ecuador.
 Home to him was Queens. Vinicio had never made it there. But that is where his parents and two older brothers live, he said, and he would take as many boat rides as necessary until he reached them.
 Most of the crew members expressed sympathy for the seasick crowd. They offered extra water, second helpings and safe places to sleep on deck to those in serious distress. They were a motley mix of toothless old men like the boat's engineer and his two 20-something sons, Fernando and Giovanni, who worked as cooks. Another older man, in his 70's, helped navigate and watched pornographic movies on a small television while he was at the wheel. The crew called him Don Juanito.
 Another navigator, in his 50's, was called Chapulete, and seemed to be second in command. 
 From the first night, the crewmen paid special attention to the prettiest women on board. They said it hurt to see the women so cramped below deck. They offered extra fruit and candies. They let the women watch a DVD of ''The Matrix.'' And each one invited a woman to sleep in his warm, dry bunk. 
 After four nights below deck, several desperate women accepted. After they fell asleep, the crewmen climbed into bed with them and pressed them for sex.
 Many of the crew had been living as smugglers on the William for years. They regaled each other with stories of outrunning the law with loads of appliances, whisky and clothing they had smuggled from Panama for sale at street markets in Guayaquil. 
 They said the William had made at least eight migrant voyages last year. In December, they recalled, United States Coast Guard officers stopped and searched the William. But the crew had already dropped its passengers in Guatemala, and they were allowed to go on their way.
 Captain Segura was new to the group. He had not worked with this crew and did not own the boat. He kept his distance, making clear to the crew that he was their captain, not their friend. He listened to their stories, but offered little about his own past. He avoided the passengers, unless there was trouble.
 He did not tell them his real name; he called himself Johnny. But on a star-filled night half way into the voyage he allowed a passenger, the Ecuadorean reporter, into the cockpit to ask about the basics of navigation. He showed her how to operate the satellite phone and use electronics to stay on course. He opened a map and explained their route to Guatemala.
 Contradicting what he had told an American reporter weeks before, he was unapologetic when asked why he had become a migrant smuggler. He said he did it for the money. Smuggling was the fastest, easiest way to make good money, he said. 
 Then, he asked where his passenger got the money to pay for her trip. She told him an American friend had put up the money, and she told him the friend's name. It was a name he recognized from the plaza in Manta. ''She is a reporter for The New York Times,'' he said.
 The Ecuadorean reporter froze. The captain only smiled and mumbled about the small world. But he did not threaten her. Out in the middle of the ocean with nothing more than a tiny notebook, the reporter must have seemed a minimal risk compared with the problems he could face if something happened to her.
 He did not say why exactly, but he opened up even more.
 ''My name is not Johnny,'' he said. He said he had been navigating migrant boats since the maritime exodus began booming when the economy plummeted at the end of the 1990's. He had been arrested six years ago aboard a migrant boat, and fined $3,000, and his navigator's license had been taken for life.
 He got a false license without any trouble, and went back to work. On this trip alone, he said, he would earn $8,000. He said he had already built a nice house for his children, and sent them to private schools.
 ''I do not want to be a millionaire and have a new car every year,'' Captain Segura said. ''I want a good life. I want to give opportunities to my children, and I am doing that.''
 Then he spotted the flickering red light in the distance. He jumped from the cockpit and ordered all the passengers below deck, no exceptions.

From Passengers to Hostages
 Everything changed after that. Tension filled the last days of the journey. The captain snapped at the crew when he caught them giving favors to sick, frail passengers. He pushed them close to mutiny when he ordered that women could no longer sleep in the crewmen's bunks.
 One of the crew, the middle-aged navigator, Chapulete, quit his post.
 ''I do not like the way you treat the passengers,'' he told Captain Segura. ''From now on, I am one of them.''
 It seemed clear that the crew's kindnesses were only partly genuine, and mostly a ploy for solidarity. Like the captain, they were also haunted by the red light. If they were caught, the migrants would be the key to their freedom.
 The plan was simple: if the authorities boarded the fugitive vessel, the migrants would claim that the crew abandoned them at sea. The crew would blend in and stay silent. If everyone stuck to the story, the crew would be sent back to Ecuador with the rest of the migrants.
 Few migrants, however, seemed willing to give cover to Captain Segura, so disliked had he become.
 ''If we are caught,'' Chapulete sneered at him, ''every migrant is going to tell the police that you are the captain of the boat. Because of you, we will all go to jail.'' 
 Two days later, the captain let it be known that they were close to their destination, and the tension eased off.
 Cesar Escandon, a guide from the Ecuadorean town of Naranjal, had been hired by the Zhingri clan to accompany a group of migrants on the William to Minneapolis and New York. He used Captain Segura's map to show the migrants the long journey that lay ahead. He coached them how to speak Spanish like Mexicans: a jacket in Mexico was called a chaqueta, not a chumpa. The president of Mexico is Vicente Fox.
 Then he instructed them to cut the labels from clothing or personal hygiene products that were made in Ecuador.
 The migrants helped the crew paint a new sign on the side of the William, dubbing it the Blanca Viviana, so the boat would not be recognized if they ran into the authorities. They sang songs, told jokes and even pulled out their last hidden stashes of goodies to celebrate a birthday.
 Instead of a cake, the migrants presented a 22-year-old named Norma a plate piled with raisins, nuts and gummy candies. In honor of the new life ahead, they sang ''Happy Birthday'' in English, and gave the guest of honor a scarf with the American flag's stars and stripes.
 At sunrise on the eighth day, the passengers finally reached dry land, a remote beach at Puerto Ocos, a short walk from Guatemala's border with Mexico. Their tongues were parched and their legs were weak. But before they could catch their breath, they were being ordered to run. A scruffy pack of armed men barked at the weary travelers and herded them.
 ''Get up! Let's go!''
 Another man, Wilber Guerra, with a buzz cut and white jeans, supervised the stampede from a shiny red sports car perched on a dune ahead. He got off his cellphone as the migrants approached and ordered them to stay calm and low.
 ''If anyone sees you,'' he said, ''you will all be deported.''
 An old red cattle truck plowed through the palm trees. Then the barking began again.
 ''Get up! Let's go!''
 The armed men loaded the migrants onto the back of the truck. Some of the migrants joked that they would rather ride with guy with the buzz cut.
 ''Pretty car,'' one man whispered. ''That's the kind I'm going to have after I find work in the United States.''
 In less than 15 minutes, the handoff was complete. The beach was clear. The only signs of the covert landing were the bottles of Ecuadorean water and wrappers from Ecuadorean candies left in the sand. Another 205 migrants had moved farther along the illegal pipeline to the United States.
 Guatemala would be but a pause for many of them. They would stay in safe houses for a few days, and then be passed on to new smuggling cells, whose job was to sneak them across the largely unguarded border into Mexico. 
 Police officers, who Mr. Guerra said had been bribed, waved the cattle truck filled with migrants through a checkpoint at the edge of Puerto Ocos. Half the migrants were then driven to a ramshackle two-story dwelling behind the municipal cemetery in Tecun Uman. 
 It was dank and empty, furnished with only a few plastic chairs and a television set. The migrants were given sheets and told to sleep on the concrete floor.
 Mr. Guerra ran the house with his wife, Yomara. After eight days on the William, it seemed like paradise. The migrants were thrilled by promises of medicine for the sick, clean bath water, fresh T-shirts and jeans, food that did not come from a can and enough space to stretch their legs.
 Then the Ecuadorean reporter asked to leave. She stuck to the story that she was a migrant, and explained that she had paid for transport only as far as Guatemala, thanked Mr. Guerra for picking her up, and asked to go on her way.
 But Mr. Guerra and his wife refused. The reporter then realized that she had in effect become a hostage, like all the other migrants, until he checked that all her fees had been fully paid.
 There was a heavy lock and chain on the front gate. Security cameras were posted at the entrance and above each of the bedrooms to monitor the migrants' movements.
 After a telephone call to Ecuador, Mr. Guerra told the reporter she owed another $500. When she protested, saying she had made full payment, Mr. Guerra stood firm. She was eventually released after a flurry of telephone calls between Tecun Uman and Cuenca, where an editor at El Tiempo, the reporter's paper, delivered the additional money to Mr. Ordonez, the car salesman. He gave the money to Ms. Zhingri, who took part in some of the negotiations herself. Once Ms. Zhingri confirmed the payment, Mr. Guerra released the Ecuadorean reporter. 
 The situation was much the same for the others who had traveled on the William. Most had paid only half the $2,000 fee for the boat ride. They, too, would be allowed to continue their journey only after relatives sent the balance to smugglers in Ecuador. Meanwhile, they belonged to Mr. Guerra.
 He charged them for every phone call: two minutes to the United States or Ecuador cost $5 to $20, depending on his mood. Travel-size bars of soap and bottles of shampoo cost $1 each. A second-hand pair of blue jeans cost $17 -- three times what the average Ecuadorean earns in a day.
 Three days after their arrival in Guatemala, the safe house was still buzzing with activity. Some hovered by the telephone, waiting for word from their relatives, while others prepared to leave.
 A steady stream of new smugglers arrived to pick up the migrants in groups of three and four and guide them through Mexico. 
 The smugglers pulled wads of cash from their socks or pouches inside their underpants to pay Mr. Guerra for any last-minute incidentals. They inspected their clients. One migrant was stripped of an Ecuadorean soccer shirt. Another was scolded for wearing his baseball cap backward. Then they were loaded onto the back of big tricycle carts that operate as taxi cabs, and carried away.

Treks and Trucks, Then the U.S.
 As several migrants later recounted the remainder of their journey, the leg through Mexico was not without dangers of its own. Migrants have fallen beneath moving trains and lost limbs. Last year, an average of one migrant died each day trying to cross the desert into the United States. 
 One migrant said she was taken in the back of a tractor trailer with 150 others to a safe house in the jungle province of Huehuetenango, in Guatemala. The human load was then broken down into two groups, she said. Hers left at sunset and walked until dawn through the jungle into Mexico.
 From there, she rode in tractor trailers, first to Puebla. She said she and the other migrants were offered pills so they would not have to go to the bathroom during the 20-hour ride, and buckets in case the pills did not work. Then they traveled by truck onto Guadalajara and then to Cananea, on the border with the United States. 
 She walked two days and two nights across the desert into Arizona, a trek she described as ''the most painful part'' of the entire journey. Then she stayed for several days in a safe house in Los Angeles, before flying to Minnesota. 
 Others from the William are now working as dishwashers, cooks and maids in Chicago, Newark and Queens.
 The United States 2000 census reported a threefold increase in undocumented Ecuadoreans in the United States over the previous decade, a rate matched by few other countries. But since Ecuadorean boat people do not land directly on American shores, their movements have attracted little attention. Lt. Cndr. Michael Trevett, the United States Coast Guard attache in Quito, Ecuador, said that no American patrols had been assigned to intercept migrant boats from Ecuador, although occasionally cutters on narcotics duty come across them.
 Ecuadoreans fleeing their country seem to disappear once they leave their own shores. Among the hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants intercepted at the United States border, fewer than 1 percent are Ecuadoreans, American authorities say.
 But Mexican officials report a surging number of Ecuadoreans intercepted along their border with Guatemala. They say that often the Ecuadoreans claim to be Guatemalans, to avoid being deported all the way back to their homeland. 
 Last month, Gabriela Coutino, a migration spokeswoman in southern Mexico, said the authorities intercepted 17 Ecuadoreans hidden in a lumber truck. The migrants initially insisted they were Guatemalans, she said.
 ''That's why it's important that we stop them here at the source,'' said Salvador Briceno, the leading immigration officer at the United States Embassy in Quito. ''Once they get into Mexico and the United States, they're gone. They disappear.'' 
 Some migrants disappear for good, killed in accidents or in flashes of violence among smuggling gangs fighting for control of routes and clients in Arizona. Bloodshed, however, is bad for business, and so there is little of the violence that has, for instance, become a signature of the drug trade.
 Still, unscrupulous behavior takes a heavy toll, as does the callousness of many of the smugglers who treat their human charges as little more than cargo. To them the numbers of dead matter less than the numbers on the wadded American dollars they receive. 
 Mr. Guerra, at the end of what appeared to be a good business day at his safe house in Tecun Uman, barely looked up from a stack of $20 bills to bid farewell to a group of migrants from the William.
 ''I know you all are going to forget me when you get to New York,'' he said. ''If you are lucky, you will forget everything about this trip.''

About the Reporting
 Sandra Ochoa, a newspaper reporter for El Tiempo of Cuenca, Ecuador, who has contributed to The New York Times in the past, arranged passage on the fishing boat William at the request of The Times after its correspondent Ginger Thompson was told by migrant smugglers that they would not take her. Ms. Ochoa identified herself as someone seeking economic opportunity in the United States. She was not asked her profession and did not volunteer her occupation or her Times connection. 
 Ms. Thompson reported from Ecuador, Guatemala and Mexico for this article; Ms. Ochoa reported from Ecuador, the William and Guatemala.

Alors! Spilling Wine To Chastise France
 They were Americans exercising their right of protest, and they poured out their anger at France.
 As the French fought early last year to block United Nations approval for an invasion of Iraq, some Americans responded by boycotting anything French. Occasionally, they made a public splash of it, emptying bottles of French wine into sewers and rivers, while fellow Americans hailed or assailed their actions.
 Anthony M. Tola, above, drew a media spotlight when he poured a bottle of merlot into a toilet at his New Brunswick, N.J., restaurant and said he had earlier done the same with six bottles of Dom Perignon -- flushing away $1,000 in sales. He also returned the rest of his stock of French wines to his supplier.
 Also in New Jersey, John Koppenaal invited the public to his wine and liquor shop in Plumsted Township, then led the scores of people who showed up in pouring his entire stock of French wine into a storm drain -- several hundred bottles whose wholesale cost he put at more than $5,000.
 Last week, both men said they still were not selling French wines, though Mr. Tola said he ''probably will'' do so again at his restaurant, the Old Bay.
 ''As good friends have disputes, good friends make up,'' he said. He is encouraged, he said, by France's action last week in joining the rest of the United Nations Security Council in support of an American and British resolution to transfer sovereignty to an interim Iraqi government. 
 Of 500 mailed and telephoned comments he got, ''about 70 percent were in favor,'' Mr. Tola said. ''But a lot of people called me a warmonger, and that was not my intention,'' he said. As for patronage, ''I lost some, but gained some.''
 Mr. Koppenaal said his Plumsted Buy Rite shop would never again sell French wine, which had accounted for only 5 percent of its wine sales in any case. And 98 percent of the comments he got supported his dumping session, he said, adding, ''It helped my business, but this is not why I did it.''
 Where did the dumpings fit in to the overall picture?
 ''They were isolated instances,'' said Greg Deligdisch, vice president and marketing director of Sopexa USA, a company that promotes French wine and food in America. But he acknowledged that last year was a ''difficult time for French wines on the U.S. market,'' though he attributed this to economic factors as well as to the tensions over Iraq.

A 19th-Century Pier, A 21st-Century Vision
 Is that a breeze of hope caressing a deteriorating landmark pier?
 Jutting into the Hudson River at the northern edge of Battery Park in Lower Manhattan, Pier A, known for its architectural gem of a maritime building, is off limits to the public.
 Dating from the 1880's, the pier served for many years as headquarters for the harbor police, who ferried visiting dignitaries to shore after they had arrived by ocean liner. 
 Later, it was a base for city fireboats, as when the picture above was taken in 1981. That use ended in 1992, by which time the city had designated a development company to turn the pier's building, an official city landmark, into restaurants and a visitors' center. But financing problems thwarted the project, and the city and the developer, Wings Point Associates, began a court battle over the city's attempt to repossess the pier.
 It has been largely unused since 1992, the city says. It was temporarily used for commuter ferry service after the 2001 terrorist attack.
 Last week, however, representatives of the city and Wings Point said the court battling had given way to efforts to resolve the pier's future. And the National Park Service said it wanted to be part of any solution by using part of the pier as a permanent security-screening and embarkation site for people boarding boats for the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.
 ''It's our first choice'' to replace the tents now being used in Battery Park, said James Pepper, the Park Service's assistant regional director. But the state authority that runs Battery Park City, just north of the pier, has also wanted to acquire it.
 Whatever is decided, the devil will be in the details, and the devil, the parties indicated, has not disappeared into the river.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Residents Want Ford to Do It Right This Time

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

DATELINE: RINGWOOD, N.J. 

 BODY:
When the Ford Motor Company closed its plant in Mahwah in 1980, the last car made there -- a two-tone beige Futura -- rolled off the assembly line and came to rest beneath a sign that exhorted workers to ''Do it Right the First Time.'' 
 More than two decades later, people who live on land where Ford dumped thousands of cubic yards of chemical wastes from the plant are angry that the company did not live by its own rule. 
 They say Ford did not get it right the first time, when it responded to federal orders to clean up the lead-based paint sludge and other wastes left over from the manufacture of 4.6 million cars. Or the second time. Or the third. 
 Today, it takes no more than a stroll through the woods to see that parts of Ringwood, about 10 miles from Mahwah, are still heavily polluted. Chunks and slabs of hardened paint can be found where residents hunt, in the ponds and streams where they play and even in Bob De Groat's front yard and the properties of other residents. 
 ''They just didn't do what they were supposed to do,'' said Patricia Mann, a Ringwood resident who belongs to the close-knit group recognized by New Jersey as the Ramapough Mountain Indian Tribe. ''They didn't do their job, and everybody knows it.'' 
 The prolonged Ringwood cleanup is the classic example of how getting it right the first time is not always possible in environmental matters, especially when regulators are overextended and corporate polluters are in a hurry to close the books on an embarrassing episode.
 There is no question that the site remains heavily polluted. Both Ford and the federal Environmental Protection Agency acknowledge that substantial amounts of toxic paint sludge and other hazardous materials remain, even though officials had given the site a clean bill of health in 1994 when they took it off the Superfund list. 
 Ford has promised to return, yet again, to take care of whatever wastes remain. 
 ''Ford is aware of and is working closely with E.P.A. to address residents' concerns,'' the company said in a statement. 
 Yet, two years ago, Ford filed a formal request to be relieved of responsibility for monitoring of the site, appearing to indicate that the cleanup was complete. The federal agency denied the request.
 Joseph A. Gowers, Ringwood project manager for the environmental agency, could not explain how a site that had been cleaned up and removed from the Superfund list could still be so contaminated. 
 ''None of the waste should be there,'' he said. But he noted that the cleanup was complicated because Ford kept no records of what it dumped in Ringwood, and the site itself, more than 500 acres, is larger than most. 
 ''It's almost like trying to find a needle in a haystack,'' Mr. Gowers said. 
 Prompted by the most recent sludge discoveries, the agency is again studying the site, and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry plans an updated health assessment of the area, but only by looking at death and disease statistics, not going door to door. 
 People who live in this rugged wooded area near the New York State line say they do not believe this effort will be any better than the other cleanups, which they described as halfhearted at best. Had Ford really meant to clean up, they say, it would have asked them exactly where the hazardous material was buried, since they lived close enough to hear the dump trucks and see the debris spilling out of them. 
 Had the E.P.A. truly watched out for the health of the residents as it was supposed to, they say, it would never have allowed itself to be manipulated and deceived by a large corporation with no real commitment to cleaning up after itself. 
 And there is another, darker suspicion: residents say that their concerns have been repeatedly ignored or minimized because they are a poorly understood minority group with no political or economic power. 
 Some historians believe that many of the families who live here are descendants of slaves freed by Dutch owners before the American Revolution. Members of the enclave say their ancestors were Native Americans who mixed with African-Americans working in mines that dated back to the Revolutionary period.
 ''If this was a different group of people, it wouldn't have happened, or it would have been cleaned up 30 years ago and not be allowed to continue until now,'' said Wayne Mann, 44, president of the Ringwood Neighborhood Action Association. 
 Mr. Mann said that in the two decades since Ford's pollution was officially recognized, no government health agency has offered physical exams or studied the high rates of illness in the community. Had they looked, he contends, they would have noticed that many residents have learning disabilities -- something he attributes, possibly, to exposure to lead. Many residents also have come down with cancer and other illnesses, he said, which they fear were caused by their contact with Ford's toxic residue. 
 Serious skin problems and rashes are common around here, but few people have been as afflicted as Mickey Van Dunk, 33, who spends most of his days either in bed or smoking cigarettes on his front porch, shying away from other people because his skin looks as if it is being eaten away. 
 Mr. Van Dunk has been through many painful operations to remove infected patches of skin all over his body. He believes his condition was caused by exposure to the paint sludge, which looks like hardened gray dough and was so commonly seen when he was a boy, he said, that he and his friends molded it into balls and threw it at one another as they played in the woods. 
 Mr. Van Dunk's illness has been diagnosed as hidradenitis suppurativa. It is not known to be caused by exposure to chemicals, and people with tightly curled hair, like Mr. Van Dunk and many of his relatives, are known to have a genetic predisposition to it, according to studies on the condition. Many people in the community, including his mother, his cousin, Jared, and Mr. Mann have the same condition, though not as severely. But they say they believe that Ford's chemicals are the cause. 
 Mr. Gowers, of the E.P.A., said the presence of the paint sludge in the Ringwood community by itself does not necessarily present a health risk because most of it has been found in the woods, not next to homes, and has been exposed as the ground erodes. Repeated testing has not shown any groundwater contamination in the area or in the Wanaque Reservoir, about a mile away. 
 Government officials say Ford has cooperated fully in the cleanup efforts from the beginning. The company acknowledges that it dumped paint sludge and car parts on an area of several hundred acres and in two old mine shafts in Ringwood that it bought in 1965. Ford had planned to build a housing and light industrial development there, but when that project fell through the company started dumping wastes there instead. 
 ''I remember dump trucks and roll-offs come up here all the time to dump copper, batteries and paint sludge,'' Mr. Mann said. ''They'd open the big back doors and the sludge would just slide out. It looked like clay, but it had a sheen, like a rainbow.'' 
 Ford officials say they did not keep records of what was dumped or where. 
 In 1987, contractors hired by the company removed 7,000 cubic yards of paint sludge that was highly contaminated with lead and other hazards. In 1990, 17 steel drums filled with chemicals and a number of crushed barrels were also removed. 
 In 1994, the E.P.A. took the Ringwood site off the Superfund list, but ordered Ford to monitor the site for at least five more years. 
 After the initial monitoring period ended, only small amounts of contaminants were detected, but the government ordered Ford to continue monitoring for another five years. Traces of lead and arsenic were found in some wells. Though it was thought to have occurred naturally, the government ordered the company to continue testing. When Ford asked for permission to end the monitoring in 2002, the government again denied the company's request. In recent months, as Mr. Mann and other residents found more paint sludge, they brought in a Philadelphia law firm to represent the community. 
 ''The fact that the E.P.A. claimed that this site was cleaned up is mind-boggling,'' said Stephen A. Sheller, of the law firm, Sheller, Ludwig & Badey. 
 A chemical engineer hired by Mr. Sheller's firm is sharply critical of Ford's $2.5 million cleanup effort, and of the E.P.A.'s oversight of the project. The engineer, Melvyn Kopstein, has done a chemical analysis of paint sludge recently found by residents and determined that it contains lead and arsenic well in excess of federal safety standards. ''The E.P.A. applied a 'see no evil, hear no evil' theme to this site,'' Dr. Kopstein said in a long memo summarizing his investigation. 
 Ford has already submitted a work plan for continued water sampling, and has told residents it will remove the sludge found on Bob De Groat's front yard and anyplace else it can be found. 
 Mr. Mann remains skeptical about the company's commitment, and the government's oversight. ''Ford keeps coming back to clean up stuff that isn't supposed to be there,'' he said. ''Unless something changes, they'll be coming back forever.''

Q. This winter the Tad's Steaks on 42nd Street east of Seventh Avenue closed to make way for construction of the Bank of America tower. I remember when there were Tad's all over the place. Is the chain still in business?

A. Tad's is grilling away at three Manhattan locations: Seventh Avenue at 47th Street, Seventh Avenue at 50th Street and 34th Street east of Seventh Avenue. The Riese Organization, which bought Tad's in 1988, will soon start construction on a Tad's in the Fulton Mall in Downtown Brooklyn, said Jamie B. Galler, executive vice president of Riese.
 Tad's was founded in 1957 by Donald Townsend on the theory that a T-bone steak, baked potato, garlic bread and tossed salad could turn a profit at $1.09. So what if the meat wasn't exactly Peter Luger quality? For less than a tenth of the price of a fancy steak dinner, a customer could watch their entree being grilled over hissing flames and tiles made to look like charcoal.
 Tad's has stayed true to its price roots. That $1.09 price works out to $7.73 today with inflation. But today, a T-bone steak dinner at Tad's can cost as little as $6.99 on weekdays. More expensive steaks and options like rotisserie chicken, pork chops and salmon steak are available. 
 At its peak, before fast-food competition whittled it down, Tad's had 28 locations, 8 in New York.
 Mr. Townsend, who died in 2000 at age 91, was said to have given this advice: ''You make more money selling to the Indians and not to the chiefs.''
 True Premieres

Q. Being a frequenter of the theater district, I was wondering: What was the first play produced in New York?

A. During the first half of the 18th century, performances were amateur and some were staged at the New Theater, also known as the Theater in Nassau Street, which opened in 1732. The first confirmed professional performance of a play took place at that theater on March 5, 1750, when an English company led by Walter Murray and Thomas Kean staged ''Richard III.''
 During the Revolution, the only plays were amateur theatricals for British troops. According to the New-York Historical Society, on April 16, 1787, ''The Contrast,'' by Royall Tyler, was performed by the American Company at the John Street Theater in Manhattan. It was the first play by a native-born American to be professionally staged.
 Subway Origami

Q. One morning on a crowded New York bus, I watched an elderly gentleman fold The New York Times in a manner I had never seen before. He never brushed the person next to him. It was almost like watching a ballet. Ever since, I have been in search of someone who knew how to fold the paper this way, to no avail. Any advice?

A. There are many who, like you, lament the decline of what is known as the subway fold.
 According to The Times's Newspaper in Education program, the key is to first fold the newspaper vertically, from top to bottom, to create a crease down the middle. If you are reading the front page, fold again horizontally to create a quadrant. Flip and fold as necessary to read each portion of the page.
 To jump to an inside page, open the top corner to that page and peel the front half back, so the paper remains folded vertically. If you want to read the center columns, peel back the inside once more, creating two lengthwise portions. Then fold again into four parts.
 Keep your elbows close to your body. And stand clear of the closing doors. MICHAEL POLLAK

HEADLINE: From Top of the Head to the Bottom Line

BYLINE: By Daniel J. Wakin. 
This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SOME industries are more recession-resistant than others. Include wigmaking among them: vanity, and the hair-loss effects of chemotherapy, are powerful buying incentives. 
 But not all recession-proof businesses also have God on their side.
 More precisely in the case of wigmakers, it is the belief of Orthodox Jewish women that God requires them to conceal their own hair for reasons of modesty upon marriage. 
 The economic effects of religious law, however, are not foolproof. The wig business fell into turmoil last month when several leading rabbis in Israel and in Brooklyn, where there are large numbers of Orthodox Jews, ruled that wigs made from Indian hair were to be forbidden.
 Such hair, the rabbis said, is connected to Hindu temple activities and thus tainted by idolatry, which is a violation of Jewish principles. Much of India's hair exports come from the Tirupati temple, the country's most popular shrine, where pilgrims cut their hair as part of a ritual visit.
 Many small Orthodox wigmakers were said to be in financial difficulty.
 But several high-end wigmakers, like Raffaele Mollica and the operators of the Joseph Fleischer Company in Manhattan, jumped forward to declare that their wigs were the good stuff -- pure European. 
 Joseph Fleischer reported an increase in business, selling about 25 wigs a week instead of 20. ''I have people just walking in and saying, 'Do you sell synthetic wigs?''' Carolyn Scott, the president of Joseph Fleischer, said. But sales are all by appointment, and the prices are high, up to $5,000 for wigs made from European hair.
 ''When I tell them the price, they want to have a minor coronary,'' Ms. Scott said. But even in hard economic times, people pay. ''To a woman, there is nothing more important than her hair,'' Ms. Scott said.
 Mr. Mollica reported no boon from the rabbinical rulings.
 ''It's normal business,'' said Mr. Mollica, whose wigs are known as ''Ralphs.'' Mr. Mollica has a workshop in Long Island City, Queens, and a retail outlet in Manhattan. Some 40 percent of his customers are Orthodox Jewish women, he said, and they mostly request European hair.
 A specially made wig, fitted to a person and made from high-quality human hair, costs $3,000 to $7,000, Mr. Mollica said. The price of the raw European hair for him is $30 to $100 an ounce, depending on the length and texture. Unrefined Indian hair goes for roughly $100 a pound, Mr. Mollica said.
 Chinese hair is even cheaper, $60 a pound. It is often refined into hair extensions for African-Americans, a trade that Mr. Mollica called a ''gigantic market.''
 Mr. Mollica said he weeded out the broken strands of hair in preparing it for use. Five ounces of what appears to be a 16-inch length of hair may yield 1 ounce of uniformly 16-inch strands, he said.
 He said he did a half-million dollars in business last year, and has a staff of four or five, including a hairdresser, seamstress and weavers. He produces two or three wigs a week. Joseph Fleischer employs 30 people, and takes in well over $1 million a year, Ms. Scott said.
 The wait for a wig can be a month or more, although the makers cut the time considerably for chemotherapy patients. 
 Mr. Mollica's customers choose the hair they want and come back for a first cutting once the basic wig is prepared, and then styling. First-timers learn how to pin the wig to their head, how to wash it and how to brush it out. 
 For all human hair wigs, ''ventilators'' -- often dexterous South American women -- double knot each strand of hair to the base. ''They must have tiny fingers and loads of patience,'' Ms. Scott said.
 Like other wigmakers, Mr. Mollica also provides side curls for Orthodox men with alopecia. He attaches the hair pieces to a skullcap. The difficulty of the condition becomes more acute when hair growth -- like the side curls and beards -- are called for by religious custom. Fleischer has even produced beards of hairless Orthodox men. Joseph Fleischer, which sells about a third of its wigs to Orthodox women, will even use a customer's own hair to make a wig
 For Ms. Scott, it is a business fraught with emotions. There is the satisfaction of helping cancer sufferers, particularly children. But painful scenes also play out in her Midtown shop, like the fitting for an Orthodox mother and daughter who is to be wed.
 ''The girl is crying, doesn't want it cut, the mother's saying you have to have it cut,'' she said. ''We've gone through it all here.''

HEADLINE: Shoe Leather and Hustle Snag an Apartment

BYLINE: By JOYCE COHEN

 BODY:
LUCKILY for them, they had no idea what they were getting into. So Eric Yanagi and Peter Cioni, college friends planning to room together after graduation, figured they could just come into the city one day and rent an apartment.
 ''Our knowledge of the city was about as limited as it gets,'' said Mr. Yanagi, who is from Fresno, Calif. 
 ''I'm a Midwesterner who doesn't know the housing market in New York City -- it may be that for $2,700 all you get is a room the size of a bathroom,'' said Mr. Cioni, who is from the Chicago suburbs.
 But the pound-the-pavement approach worked for them. They went door to door in their targeted neighborhood, speaking to doormen, concierges and on-site agents, until they found something that made them happy. They ended up with a one-bedroom apartment in a fancy condominium high-rise -- a bargain, in their eyes, at $2,300 a month.
 The roommates, both 22 and economics majors, had similar investment-banking jobs lined up after they graduated from Princeton University on June 1. Mr. Yanagi would be working near Madison Square Park, while Mr. Cioni would be in Midtown. 
 ''I left the hunt up to Eric because he had all the answers,'' Mr. Cioni said. ''Eric says it is good to have a roommate who's also in investment banking because they understand each other. Misery loves company.''
 Sure enough, Mr. Yanagi had decided that they should expect a total monthly rent of up to $2,500, and to live in the Murray Hill or Kips Bay areas.
 Still, much of their knowledge about their impending lives in New York was based on hearsay.
 They required a place within easy walking distance from work because, ''according to rumor, we work a good 80 hours a week, and every minute counts when you are sleep-deprived,'' Mr. Cioni said.
 They wanted something nice. ''From what I gather, the majority of my year will be spent in my office or in my bed,'' he said.
 And they wanted a concierge. ''From what we understand, the only time we leave the office is when everything is closed and we can't pick up our dry cleaning,'' he said.
 Though Mr. Yanagi had been gleaning information from the Internet, he felt ill-informed. ''It was amazing how difficult it was to get straightforward answers,'' he said. ''On Craigslist, I found an incredible number of brokers who didn't seem too knowledgeable.''
 He decided on-site research would be more fruitful. So, in late April, the two friends began zigzagging their way through the East 30's, inquiring at every building that seemed suitable, which to them meant high-rises.
 Early on, they came across the Murray Hill at 115 East 34th Street. But they found the building uninviting and pricey, with one-bedrooms offered for $2,400 to $2,700. 
 As the day progressed, they learned quite a bit: That rents at the Murray Hill, now their benchmark, were on the high side. That newer meant nicer. That a great lobby often masked a not-so-great inside. That condominiums were often available to rent, not just to buy. The two decided to focus on new buildings.
 In the late afternoon, they found it. They passed the Sycamore, at 250 East 30th Street, with a big sign touting its availability and its amenities -- rooftop garden, gym, TV lounge and laundry on every floor.
 The doorman told them of a vacant alcove studio, for $1,900 a month, and gave them the key.
 ''It was gorgeous, brand-new, untouched -- but it was small for the two of us,'' Mr. Cioni said. ''I was distorting reality in my head because it was so beautiful, and I was, like, 'Yeah, we could definitely fit.' It was $600 a month below our threshold. That was another piece of information distorting my view of reality.
 ''After we were done drooling, we were, like, 'Let's go to the roof deck.' The sun was setting and it was just perfect. We went to the lounge and were blown away by the plasma TV. We turned on the Cubs game.''
 They returned to the lobby to talk to the doorman. Meanwhile, a man emerged from the elevator, dropping a key on the doorman's desk. It was for a $2,300 one-bedroom that the doorman assumed was too expensive for them. They headed upstairs again. ''Absolutely perfect,'' Mr. Yanagi declared.
 The doorman gave them the number of the owner, who faxed an application. They filled it out -- all 15 pages -- took a deep breath, and mailed a certified check for some $7,000, which included a security deposit plus the first and last month's rent. The only downside was the May 15 lease date, which was a few weeks before they started work. That meant they would have to pay for the apartment a month before they needed it.
 Under the circumstances, they didn't mind. ''One reason we decided to pull the trigger and go for this deal was we knew what was out there,'' Mr. Yanagi said.
 They made a handful of car trips to drop off clothes and books, bought two beds online and discovered a nice thing about a full-service building. The beds were delivered to their new apartment while they stayed in Princeton preparing for graduation.
 The two will return later this month to buy furniture, settle in and invite friends to see their new digs.
 ''Some of our classmates were shocked,'' Mr. Yanagi said. ''People think that for that kind of money you can get two full bedrooms and a living room, but I don't know where you can find that.''

HEADLINE: South Korea Dissolves Ties That Once Bound the Press to the Powerful

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
As a vigorous, debate-filled democracy becomes entrenched here, South Korea is rapidly dismantling the press club system, an enduring symbol of the collusive relationship between the government and the news media.
 Starting a year ago at the presidential offices, known as the Blue House, press clubs -- in which reporters from major media outlets excluded other journalists and decided what to report, sometimes in conjunction with government officials -- have been eliminated in one government office after another. Where they survive, as in Seoul's Police Department, they are expected to go soon.
 Instead, shiny new briefing rooms have been built, their doors flung open to all. Although journalists and government officials are still groping for a new balance in their relationship, most believe that the changes will lead to the emergence of something rare in East Asia: a fiercely independent press. 
 The dismantling of the deep-rooted press club system, a vestige of the Japanese colonial rule that ended in 1945, resulted from the confluence of several events. In 2002, President Roh Moo Hyun was elected despite the fierce opposition of traditional outlets, especially conservative newspapers and television networks. At the same time, Internet-based alternative sources of information, popular among the young and generally supportive of Mr. Roh, have emerged as rivals to the traditional media here in the world's most wired nation.
 The speed of the change is particularly stunning because, in Japan, the press club system survives intact. Hyun Seung Yoon, 39, a reporter for The Korea Economic Daily and the former vice president of the Finance Ministry's press club, which was abolished on Dec. 29, said that in the past the government and the media were united.
 ''Fundamentally, it's better now,'' Mr. Hyun said. ''It's healthier now. The relationship that existed before was a collusive one.''
 When Mr. Roh came to power a year and a half ago, a priority was to make the government's relationship with the media more open, and to give ''equal opportunity to all media,'' said Jung Soon Kyun, the minister of the government information agency, who traveled to the United States, Japan, Germany and Britain to study how each government dealt with the media. The press club system had allowed the big media outlets to ''monopolize information'' and sometimes ''offer and receive personal favors,'' said the minister, a former reporter.
 For Mr. Roh, a political outsider who had not won the backing of the mainstream media during his election campaign, the abolition of the press club system also worked to his political advantage.
 Under the old system, members of the major news outlets controlled membership and expelled organizations that failed to abide by club rules. The club decided, sometimes through a senior member acting as a liaison with the government, what news to focus on, what to play down or, in some cases, what to suppress.
 The government paid for all the expenses the press club incurred, including phone bills, and even provided a secretary for the members. Until a few years ago, the government also paid for the reporters' air fare, hotel bills and other expenses whenever the president traveled.
 Under the new system, the government charges each reporter assigned to the Blue House about $50 a month to cover various fees. With reporters for any news organization, big or small, free to register, the number of Blue House reporters has increased to more than 300 from 90. 
 Press clubs exist all over the country, from the Blue House to the ministries to police precincts, said Lee Jae Kyoung, a journalism professor at Ewha Womans University and a former television reporter.
 ''The loser was always going to be the reader, the people's right to know,'' Mr. Lee said.
 Years ago, when Mr. Lee was a cub reporter covering a police precinct, the press club discovered some bad news involving a local tea manufacturer, he said. Instead of reporting the news, the club's senior members met with company officials, pocketed some cash and then treated the club members to a lavish dinner and drinks, he said.
 South Korea's press club system, like its bureaucracy and legal systems, was a holdover from Japanese colonialism, said Youn Jung Suk, a professor at the Sejong Institute specializing in Japan-Korea relations. After the end of World War II and the end of Japanese colonialism, South Korea's American occupiers decided to retain the press club system.
 ''It was easy to control Korea through this system,'' Mr. Youn said.
 South Korea's military leaders and a largely compliant press also shared the same belief, experts say, and so the movement to reform the press club system started only after South Korea began democratizing in the late 1980's.
 In Japan, a de facto one-party state for the last half century, only maverick politicians in a few places, like Kamakura and Nagano, have abolished the press clubs, saying they are not appropriate in a democracy. Press clubs still exist in government agencies, companies and institutions all over the country, curtailing the nature and level of information available to the public.
 The media revolution in South Korea has been almost completely ignored by Japan's own media, even though almost all have bureaus in Seoul. Japan's Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association argues that press clubs have officially been opened to non-members since 2002, though most Japanese journalists will acknowledge that, in practice, little has changed.
 Hiroshi Wada, an official at Japan's newspaper association, went so far as to deny the changes occurring here.
 ''We checked the Korean situation and we do not think press clubs in South Korea have been abolished,'' Mr. Wada said. ''It is that they allow everyone's participation freely, but press clubs still exist.''
 He added: ''So it is not that Japan is more conservative with regards to press clubs. We understand that South Korea has caught up with us.''
 Here in South Korea, there had been previous attempts to abolish the press club system, notably under former President Kim Dae Jung's administration. But the resistance from the established media was too strong.
 But in recent years, Internet-based news services, like OhmyNews.com, rose to challenge the big media outlets, and their influence has grown, particularly with the young.
 In 2001, one of OhmyNews's reporters was barred from attending a news conference at Inchon Airport because he did not belong to its press club. Oh Yeon Ho, the news service's chief executive, sued and won.
 ''Only a few years earlier, people's acceptance of privileged media had been embedded in our culture,'' Mr. Oh said. ''Now the idea of abolishing the press club has become mainstream.''
 In fact, Mr. Roh granted his first domestic interview as president to OhmyNews, signaling the beginning of a new era. The changes have been hard to swallow for the mainstream media, but most acknowledge that they have been positive.
 ''Without the press club system, we can no longer maintain embargoes or -- it's an extreme example -- even abolish news items,'' said Shin Kyoung Min, deputy managing director for MBC, a major television network. ''Inside the press clubs, we did sometimes do that, though not often. The fact that everything is now open to all the media, that's a good change for everybody.''

HEADLINE: Building the Bones of a Downtown Nassau

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
ON Long Island, which has myriad suburban communities but no downtown, and where cars are seen as extensions of their owners' personalities, talk of expanding mass transit has never been warmly received or deemed necessary.
 Now Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, has presented an ambitious plan to create a downtown in central Nassau that will include a major public transit system that connects this ''hub'' to the rest of the county at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars. Many call him visionary, but others see his efforts as completely impractical.
 ''This is one of the most ambitious projects in the country around the idea of smart growth,'' said Jon Orcutt, executive director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a transit advocacy group. ''It's just revolutionary in the way it looks at a suburban county in terms of creating a whole new dense center with mass transit.'' 
 But even fans of the plan wonder if it will ever become reality.
 ''I think it's great,'' said Viki De Jong, chairwoman of the Citizens Committee for Civic Action, a group in central Nassau. ''And this is not an attack on their commitment or ability, but I just don't know if it's possible to pull it off.''
 Lee E. Koppelman, the executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, said linking the hub to other parts of the county by rail would make sense. But in 1998 he helped oversee a hub study for Mr. Suozzi's predecessor, Thomas S. Gulotta, that met with considerable local opposition. ''I suspect Mr. Suozzi will run into the same conflict,'' Dr. Koppelman said. ''It's relatively easy to put these concepts down on paper. The difficulty is in getting them accepted.''
 Mr. Gulotta's hub proposal essentially went nowhere. Mr. Suozzi revived discussions about the Nassau hub about a year ago and will spend about $1 million, mostly in federal grants, to study how best to move people into and out of the area without increasing congestion on the county's clogged roads.
 The goal, Mr. Suozzi said, is to encourage transit-oriented development in the center of the county, which, he added, is fundamental to the ''new suburbia'' he envisions. Mass transit will make property around the hub more valuable and more attractive for development, he reasoned.
 The hub area includes the 70-acre Nassau Coliseum property, which is owned by the county. Mr. Suozzi and the owner of the New York Islanders hockey team, Charles B. Wang, have been negotiating for months over the building of a new arena and possible additional redevelopment of the property.
 ''We have to figure out a way to continue to grow while still preserving the quality of life that allows us to keep our neighborhoods with single-family homes and beautiful front lawns,'' Mr. Suozzi said. ''We have to do something dramatic, because if we don't change the way we look at things, property taxes will continue to go up, services will go down and traffic will get worse.''
 The hub proposal is still preliminary. Patricia Bourne, the county planning director, and Robert M. Brickman, the manager for the hub study, said they hoped to narrow the alternatives for more detailed study sometime in September.
 The plan now includes a mass transit loop around the hub with lines connecting the hub south to Freeport along the Meadowbrook Parkway, north to Oyster Bay and Glen Cove and southwest to Valley Stream along existing Long Island Rail Road lines, and east to Hicksville on an old railroad right-of-way. County officials have not determined what mode of transportation would be used but are considering light rail trains, automated guideway trains that run without drivers or rapid transit vehicles, which are buses designed to look like trains and run in special lanes to bypass traffic.
 Many questions remain. These include where the money to build the system and operate it would come from; who would operate and maintain it; whether communities along the routes would allow a new transit system to run through their neighborhoods; and whether Long Islanders would even be willing to get out of their cars to ride such a system.
 ''People say this is crazy and that suburbia and cars are one and the same,'' Mr. Suozzi said. ''But 20 years ago, people would have said that being required to wear a seatbelt was crazy, and 10 years ago, people would have said that a smoking ban in restaurants was crazy.''
 He is convinced, he said, that if given a transit system that can get them to the Nassau Coliseum or to work in the hub in less time than it takes now to drive on the county's congested roads, people will opt for a transit pass. ''There's enough frustration with traffic,'' he said. ''And especially with gas prices where they are now, people are beginning to realize that this is something we have to do.'' 
 The notional hub runs east to Eisenhower Park, south to Hempstead Turnpike, west to Garden City's Franklin Avenue and north to the L.I.R.R. Main Line. It includes parts of Mineola, Carle Place, Westbury, Garden City and Hempstead. Major institutions and locations include the Nassau Coliseum, the Mitchel Field athletic complex, Hofstra University, Nassau Community College, the Cradle of Aviation Museum, several major office complexes and the Roosevelt Field mall and other large shopping areas along Old Country Road.
 The transit loop that Mr. Suozzi envisions is similar to the one proposed by Mr. Gulotta, but he has greatly expanded the system by proposing connections to Oyster Bay, Freeport, Hicksville and Valley Stream, connecting to or annexing parts of the Long Island Rail Road. ''We wanted to make the hub the downtown of Long Island,'' he said. ''To do that, it has to have spokes connecting it to the North Shore, the South Shore, New York City to the west and Suffolk County to the east.''
 The 1998 study was financed largely by the Town of Hempstead and was done mainly by the Long Island Regional Planning Board. It proposed using either light rail trains, an elevated ''people mover'' or elevated trolleys in a loop around a hub that also connected to the Long Island Rail Road. The study foundered when civic groups harshly criticized plans to build a main station for the new line in Carle Place, but it nonetheless helped obtain much of the federal funding that Mr. Suozzi has been using for his planning effort.
 Many civic and business leaders who have participated in the county's exploratory meetings on the current proposal praise Mr. Suozzi's efforts as an improvement over the earlier study because the process has been more open to the public and has had a broader focus on the hub's impact on the rest of the county.
 ''The original study was too limited in scope to be of any value,'' said Neal Lewis, executive director of the Long Island Neighborhood Network, a civic group in Massapequa. He called the 1998 plan ''a glorified parking lot shuttle'' because it would have mainly appealed to people headed to the Coliseum who would avoid traffic at the Coliseum by parking farther away. By expanding the study to include connections to other parts of the county, Mr. Lewis said, the plan now also addresses the mass transit needs of thousands of Long Islanders with jobs in the office complexes in the hub.
 But since the study now takes in planning and development issues that affect the entire county, it has come under fire for being too simplistic and for not adequately considering the myriad concerns of villages and hamlets along the proposed routes.
 ''We would have anticipated an even broader range of people involved and more creativity on the land use side,'' said Eric Alexander, director of Vision Long Island, a nonprofit group that promotes ''smart growth'' initiatives. He said, for example, that proposed stops for the new system should be located where there might be land use changes that would be appropriate for transit, like new housing or office developments.
 ''The magic connection between land use and transportation is what we're looking for, along with some real civic input, and we haven't seen that yet,'' he said. ''I'd hate to see another 500 angry people at a hearing two years from now, because if you have one bad hearing on this, people will run for the hills. We lost five years after 1998, and we should be doing everything we can to make sure that doesn't happen again.''
 But Mr. Suozzi says that combining transportation and land use needs are a priority for his staff and the consultant hired to complete the study, STV Inc. -- an engineering and architectural firm that has also worked on the AirTrain at Kennedy Airport and the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail line in New Jersey. ''We know that the only way for the county to have some targeted development and to fix the traffic is to marry the two concepts,'' Mr. Suozzi said.
 Bertram Donley, a former president of the Garden City Chamber of Commerce, said that he feared that although county officials had made a point of inviting representatives from different municipalities and interest groups, they had not worked hard enough to completely win them over. ''They need to do more to reach out to the zoning authorities, the towns and villages, and the landowners that would be affected by this system,'' he said.
 Officials of Garden City, for example, have already expressed concern about the plan because it would involve converting a freight rail line that runs through the village and is now used only once a year by Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey to transport circus animals and equipment to the Coliseum.
 ''It would be easier to tell the civic groups in Garden City that we're trying space travel for the whole village to Mars,'' Mr. Donley said, ''and it would probably be more accepted.'' 
 Mr. Suozzi said he knew village opposition would be a big hurdle to overcome, but he said he hoped to find the funds to place the new rail or bus line essentially below grade, so that local residents would neither hear nor see it.
 Mineola officials also have concerns about the county's plan because it would use the Mineola train station as the main connection from the Long Island Rail Road to the hub loop. ''I think it's unfortunate that the county has not yet looked at our downtown area to see if we could absorb the additional cars and traffic that kind of connection would bring to Mineola,'' said Mayor Jack Martins. ''The county has an obligation to make sure it doesn't negatively impact on our residents.''
 County officials said such concerns would be addressed as the study continues and the plan becomes more specific and detailed. 
 County officials face many considerations like those of Garden City and Mineola. But while balancing the concerns of the county and the more narrow interests of villages and homeowners, the county also must referee the contest between what is achievable and what potential riders might want.
 Just choosing the mode of transportation is fraught with potential for disagreement. Some residents have pushed for a trolley system, which would be more picturesque and therefore more palatable. But county officials have ruled trolleys out because of low passenger capacity and because they would still have to steer through congestion. A light rail system could keep costs down but would be much more expensive than a rapid transit bus system, which is unlikely to appeal to suburban travelers but is the most likely given current federal financing possibilities.
 Many of the major players in the future of the system remain guarded in their assessment of Mr. Suozzi's plan. Mike Deery, a spokesman for the Town of Hempstead, which controls zoning for much of the area included in the proposed system, said: ''While the town supports the concept in general, there's still very little detail available because the study is so preliminary and we would have to assess how the details will impact on neighborhoods and business districts before we made any decisions.''
 Under the proposal, the Long Island Rail Road would have to cede its Oyster Bay and West Hempstead lines to the new system, and L.I.R.R. officials also remain circumspect. The railroad ''is supportive of the study's objectives to improve mobility and economic vitality in our service area in the Nassau Hub,'' it said in a statement, but it added that the study was still in a ''very early conceptual stage and would require additional study.''
 Mr. Orcutt, of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, said, ''There will be many nimby fights to fight and territorial battles to wage before anything gets done, but that would be true anywhere.''
 The competition for federal dollars is also a concern, but Mr. Orcutt noted that funds had already been secured for major transportation projects for Long Island like the plan to connect the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal and for a third track on the railroad's Main Line. ''The important thing is to get the first round of capital projects for the hub identified and when the time comes, to get the towns and villages to deal with the zoning issues,'' he said. ''It's all very complex and will require a lot of consensus, but this could be the next big thing for Long Island.''
 To continue the study process, Representative Carolyn McCarthy, whose district includes much of the hub area, has included $7 million for a comprehensive environmental impact study of the proposed system in the proposed federal highway and transit bill. She said she was a strong supporter of the project because ''the only way we can continue to bring industry into the county is to lay out lines for transportation.'' She has taken the lead on securing federal funds for the project, but she said she felt she had the support of her colleagues in the Island's Congressional delegation.
 For her part, Ms. McCarthy does not think that the hub proposal is too ambitious. ''They made fun of the Big Dig in Boston too, but it's making a big difference now,'' she said, referring to a huge highway project in downtown Boston. ''Sometimes it takes being a little visionary to see something gets done.''
 Mitchell H. Pally, the vice president for government affairs at the Long Island Association, said business leaders were behind the hub project because ''that's the center of the Nassau County economy and one of the major centers of Long Island's economy and you can't sit around and say we're not going to try to do something ambitious just because we might not get the funding for it.''
 He pointed to plans for new subway and rail lines in New York City and said, ''We should do no less on Long Island.''

HEADLINE: Mad Words Ping-Pong Across the Sound

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER

 BODY:
IN an association that predates the Revolutionary War by more than 100 years, Long Island and Connecticut have had some scrapes but have generally coexisted peacefully on opposite sides of Long Island Sound.
 No more. Not just one but three intertwining disputes, all involving the Sound, have caused a rupture like none before. ''I don't know of any other era in which relations were worse,'' said Christopher Collier, the Connecticut state historian. 
 In a sign of how deep the enmity runs, Steve Levy, the Suffolk County executive, is accusing Connecticut of conduct unbecoming a neighbor. ''We always expected it would be OPEC that would cut our power supply, not our own neighbors in Connecticut,'' Mr. Levy said last week. 
 It may take a scorecard to track the three disputes. In brief, they involve the cross-Sound electric cable, a rapidly escalating battle over a plan to dump mountains of dredged spoils from Connecticut into the Sound and a proposed natural gas pipeline. 
 There was a furious dispute over the Cross Sound Cable, which was shut down by Spencer Abraham, the federal energy secretary, on May 7, just as the weather was warming and Long Island was entering a period of high demand for electricity. The 330-megawatt line carries power in both directions, but during summer's heat, the flow is overwhelmingly to Long Island.
 Mr. Abraham, ruling that the energy emergency that began with the blackout last August had passed, rescinded an order that had allowed the cable to operate since then. Connecticut officials say the 24-mile cable, which runs from New Haven to Shoreham, has not been buried deep enough and violates state environmental laws.
 Although the energy secretary's action clearly delighted Connecticut officials, there was anger across the water. The Long Island Power Authority and Nassau and Suffolk Counties said that they would cooperate in trying to reverse Mr. Abraham's decision. Richard M. Kessel, the chairman of the authority, warned that without the cable, Long Island faced electric shortages and up to $18 million in extra costs to pay for more expensive replacement power.
 Bad feelings about Connecticut ran rampant. In Washington, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, proposed a bill that would put the cable back in operation, and the Long Island delegation in the House joined in seeking a reversal of Mr. Abraham's ruling. 
 Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut's attorney general, lambasted Suffolk for going into federal court last month to try to have the line reopened. He said Connecticut would fight to keep it turned off. ''The cable isn't buried at the right depth, and therefore it is illegal,'' he said. ''Blasting to put it at the right depth threatens the Sound.''
 Mr. Levy said that Connecticut was being a stickler about the cable's compliance with its environmental laws but was willing enough to countenance a far greater environmental insult: a proposal to dump 20 million cubic yards of contaminated spoils, mostly dredged from Connecticut harbors and marinas, into the Sound.
 ''This is the ultimate hypocrisy for Connecticut to complain about a cable with no evidence of any environmental problems while looking the other way as millions of cubic yards of heavy metals and fill are dumped in our Long Island Sound,'' Mr. Levy said.
 The proposal, which is awaiting further action by the Environmental Protection Agency, is to dump dredged spoils at two underwater sites over a 20-year period. One site is two miles north of Lloyd Point in the Village of Lloyd Harbor and 2.5 miles south of Long Neck Point near Stamford, Conn. The other site is 10 miles north of Shoreham and 5.6 miles south of South End Point near East Haven, Conn. Both are in Connecticut waters and have been used before for dumping dredged spoils but never in such quantities.
 The E.P.A. says the spoils will be tested before dumping to screen out the worst contamination. An environmental study has said that no lasting damage would result, but New York officials, groups and residents opposed to the dumping have called the study flawed. 
 In Washington, sometime allies were at odds over the matter. Senators Christopher J. Dodd and Joseph I. Lieberman and the Congressional delegation from Connecticut vigorously support the dumping plan. The dredging of Connecticut harbors, Mr. Lieberman said, is ''critical to Connecticut's maritime industry and the state's ability to ensure the safe navigation of the Sound.''
 But New York's senators, Mrs. Clinton and Charles E. Schumer -- Democrats, like Senators Dodd and Lieberman -- strongly oppose the plan. ''We cannot let short-term economics overtake long-term environmental concerns,'' Senator Clinton said in a statement announcing the bill to prevent dumping of contaminants in the Sound. 
 The bill would require that New York sign off on any dumping plan even when the dump site is in Connecticut waters. Representative Timothy Bishop, Democrat of Southampton, filed a companion bill in the House, and other House members from Long Island lined up to oppose the dumping plan. 
 On the matter of the natural gas pipeline, roles have reversed. The Connecticut Congressional delegation and state officials are up in arms about a May 6 decision by Commerce Secretary Donald Evans overruling Connecticut's environmental objections. 
 The Islander East pipeline, a project of KeySpan and Duke Energy, would bring natural gas from Canada to Suffolk County by way of Connecticut. Senator Lieberman expressed outrage over Mr. Evans's decision, saying that it usurped state powers. ''Through this decision, the Department of Commerce has signed off on the creation of a 23-mile scar across the heart of the Sound,'' he said in a statement.
 The underwater section of the pipeline would extend from Branford, Conn., to Shoreham. The project has been approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, but it will require a permit from the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection before the Army Corps of Engineers grants permission for construction to begin.
 As the intra-agency jousting continued, matters turned rather personal for two members of Congress. Representative Steve Israel, the Democrat who is chairman of the Long Island Sound Congressional Caucus, said a Connecticut colleague in the House -- he would not identify him -- gave him a private talking-to recently:
 ''He became rather irate, and said to me, 'Listen, you Long Islanders made the decision to shut down Shoreham, and now you want Connecticut to bail you out.'
 ''I said to him, 'You Connecticutters made the decision to dump dredged spoils in Long Island Sound, and now you want Long Island to bail you out.' And the conversation ended there.''

HEADLINE: Another Step For New Haven

BYLINE: By JANE GORDON

 BODY:
HARD up for a place to open a regional theater 39 years ago, two Yale graduates were pleased to find an empty warehouse among the slabs of ribs and sausage in a food terminal directly off Interstate 95, on the Long Wharf in New Haven. Theatergoers, particularly suburbanites scared by tales of high crime in New Haven, pulled off the highway into the Long Wharf Theater's parking lot, watched the show, got back into their cars and headed home. They could hardly say they had visited New Haven. But back then, not being downtown was better for the theater's business. 
 New Haven's reputation has changed in the past few years. The city's nightlife has a brighter cast, and people walk the streets after dark in many neighborhoods. An arts district stretches from Yale University down into the Ninth District neighborhood that borders the New Haven Veterans Memorial Coliseum. Restaurants are flourishing. 
 So on June 3, when the Long Wharf Theater announced that it planned to leave its longtime home for the inner city, it reflected another step in the city's cultural shift. It also helped that the state promised the theater a $30 million grant as part of a larger project that some say confirms New Haven's status as a vibrant work in progress, but that others say will be a capstone of its revitalization. 
 Gov. John G. Rowland was battling in court last week to avoid the spotlight at House impeachment hearings, but he stepped readily onto the stage at the Long Wharf Theater June 3 to announce the state's commitment to a $230 million development project in downtown New Haven. 
 Along with the $30 million grant to Long Wharf, Mr. Rowland pledged another $150 million to move Gateway Community College downtown and create parking for both sites. The plan also includes a 300-room hotel and conference center, retail shops and 280 residential units. A crucial part of the deal was the city's promise to level the Coliseum, a Modernist landmark that many in New Haven, including its mayor, believe to be little more than a Great Wall that blocks the view into their city.
 Some in New Haven see the project as a small piece of the puzzle that is New Haven -- a city of about 125,000 people -- and that includes Mayor John DeStefano Jr. ''What strikes people is that this is four blocks of city land -- big in size, in scale -- but does it change New Haven? No,'' Mr. DeStefano said in a telephone interview. ''What drives me nuts is that people think that one or two projects will change the city. I'm excited about it, but let's keep it in perspective.'' 
 Mr. DeStefano, who on June 3 praised Mr. Rowland for supporting his city, in January had called for his resignation. 
 But others see the project as the final piece in New Haven's revitalization. And that includes Marc S. Ryan, the state's budget director. ''If you look at New Haven, there's one remaining redevelopment area that hasn't really been touched,'' Mr. Ryan said in a telephone interview, ''the Coliseum and the Ninth Square area. And that's why this was extremely important to New Haven. It's not the end, but my point is that this is one of the last remaining areas of downtown that needs to be developed in a major way.''
 A new Long Wharf Theater will, optimistically, take its place downtown for the 2009-2010 theater season, after it completes its own drive to raise another $30 million. It will include a 500-seat theater featuring classic plays and contemporary works with wide appeal, and a 300-seat theater staging ''more adventurous work,'' said Michael Stotts, Long Wharf's managing director.
 ''What's attractive is the long-term opportunities, being close to other cultural amenities, to restaurants, to retail,'' Mr. Stotts said. ''There's an energy in New Haven that frankly didn't exist 5 to 10 years ago, and it's exciting.''
 The project is also the last in the state's refurbishing of its college campuses. The state has committed $3.8 billion over 15 years to the renovation of public colleges, which include the University of Connecticut, the Connecticut State University system and the community college system, Mr. Ryan said, including the Gateway-Long Wharf project. ''It was a hefty price tag,'' he said, ''and the final anchor.'' 
 The new project is also the final one in a number of large downtown revitalization efforts backed by Mr. Rowland that mix education and the arts. Adriaen's Landing, a large mixed-use development being built in downtown Hartford, will include a science center. A few blocks away, a recently relocated Capitol Community College draws thousands of students into the city daily. In downtown Waterbury, the University of Connecticut opened a satellite campus, a magnet school for the arts will be open this year nearby and the 2,700-seat Palace Theater is being renovated. Bridgeport, New London, Torrington and Stamford have all had a significant numbers of state dollars marked for arts and education initiatives. 
 The New Haven project had been in the thinking stages, then the talking stages, among state and local leaders for at least four years, Mr. Ryan said. As other cities had drawn community colleges to their downtowns and received large infusions of state money for arts institutions, the Ninth District plan in New Haven had been stuck on a couple fronts. 
 First, New Haven didn't want to pay millions of dollars to raze the Coliseum. Neither did the state. The potential demolition of the Coliseum, which has been closed for business since 2002, had also attracted vocal opponents. The controversy created a stalemate. The Coliseum sat, unused, a deteriorating 20th-century architectural landmark that New Haven's economic development administrator, Henry Fernandez, characterized in a New Haven Advocate interview as ''a landmark to architectural failure.''
 The city gave in first. ''It was a case of investing $6 million to get $180 million,'' Mr. DeStefano said, referring to the cost of demolishing the Coliseum. ''A community college, a great theater, parking, a hotel, housing, hundreds of jobs and increased tax revenues, for 6 million bucks. A pretty good leverage of resources, I'd say.''
 At least one New Haven preservationist is staying levelheaded about the Coliseum's demise. ''There may be people who value the Coliseum, and I may even be one of them, but their population in New Haven is very small,'' said Robert Grzywacz, an architect, a member of the New Haven Preservation Trust and a former volunteer at the Long Wharf Theater. ''The mayor hears from people outside the city that the Coliseum is a wonderful building, but not from people inside the city. Bringing more arts to downtown is obviously what downtown needs. Even though the Coliseum was conceived as a gateway to downtown, it also creates a sort of no-man's land.''
 The state avoided the dispute. ''In one sense, I don't believe the Coliseum is viable for refurbishment,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''But clearly the controversy had something to do with the state's decision on the issue. With the exception of very few instances, we don't put our money into something like that.''
 State officials also had not been not sure whether the Long Wharf Theater would be able to raise a matching $30 million to put up a new building on the Coliseum site. The theater's attendance was 100,000 this year, counting 9,000 subscribers. The past season was a difficult one for single-ticket sales, Mr. Stotts said, who faulted the war in Iraq and the overall economy. To compensate, the theater will open its next season with a musical that has broad appeal, ''Guys and Dolls.'' Theater officials said they hoped that works by playwrights with greater name recognition, like Eugene O'Neill and Tom Stoppard, would also help ticket sales. The theater, which has sent 16 plays to Broadway and produced three Pulitzer-Prize-winning world premieres, announced recently that it will have balanced its budget and eliminated a deficit by the end of this month. A study done by an independent consultant, Catherine Creager, in 1998, determined that a move downtown would increase the theater's annual attendance by about 20,000 people. 
 Still, Long Wharf officials were not sure that they wanted to leave the sides of beef to move to the Coliseum site. ''There was a little bit of back and forth with the Long Wharf,'' Mr. Ryan said. He said the state also did not know until a few months ago what bringing Gateway Community College downtown would cost; the school has 11,000 students between its Long Wharf and North Haven campuses. 
 The downtown location, at the edge of Ninth Square, provides a distinctly different feel from Long Wharf. In Ninth Square, brick and brownstone buildings in a hodgepodge of architectural styles -- from Queen Anne to Georgian Revival to Italianate -- form a contiguous facade that fronts the street. Starting at the southeast edge of the New Haven Green, the neighborhood is on the National Register of Historic Places and is part of the oldest section of New Haven. Although redevelopment efforts have focused on Ninth Square at least since 1994 and restaurants and galleries have opened, the neighborhood has still struggled. 
 Despite the omnipresence of Yale and the geographic solidity of the city's original plan, which divvied up New Haven into a grid of nine squares with the New Haven Green at its center, many New Haven neighborhoods have suffered since the end of World War II. Thousands of residents moved to the suburbs, and highways chopped the city into pieces, shredding the original grid. 
 With state and New Haven money, those pieces are being reunited, if sometimes only metaphorically, Mr. DeStefano said. ''This project is a piece of the puzzle,'' he said. ''The Long Wharf Theater in the downtown core will add value where it never did out in Long Wharf, and so it's a piece. Just like all the apartments we're building downtown, all the restaurants, the Pfizer building, the retail. All the pieces that make a whole.''
 Mr. Grzywacz, the architect, likened the project to the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, a $125 million three-theater project being built in an old railroad yard on the banks of the Mississippi River. The State of Minnesota gave the theater a grant of $25 million, about 20 percent of the total cost. ''We're a large regional theater, and Long Wharf is also,'' said Tom Proehl, the Guthrie's managing director. ''But they're getting 50 percent funded, which is amazing.''
 Mr. Rowland has been generous, Long Wharf officials said. Mr. Stotts said he had not seen that level of financial commitment to the arts in other places. 
 ''These expenditures are unprecedented in 15 years,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''We didn't put more than tens of millions into these systems before he came into office. This is part of the legacy of the governor.'' 
 That, and the threat of impeachment. With Mr. Rowland accused of ethics violations, a federal investigation and an impeachment inquiry dogging his administration and 23 percent of the state's residents saying in a recent University of Connecticut poll that the most important issue facing state government right now is ethics and corruption (just 20 percent said the budget situation was the foremost issue), arts and education may be the legacy that Mr. Rowland prefers.

HEADLINE: Sarah Margon, Samuel Chaltain

 BODY:
Sarah Michelle Margon and Samuel Spelman Chaltain were married last evening at the Seven Hills Inn in Lenox, Mass. Charles C. Haynes, a friend of the couple, received permission from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to officiate at the ceremony. 
 Ms. Margon, 27, is keeping her name. She graduated from Wesleyan University and is a candidate for a master's degree in foreign service at Georgetown University. From 2001 to 2003 she was policy analyst at the Center for National Security Studies, a civil liberties organization in Washington, where she specialized in counterterrorism legislation. She is the daughter of Marilyn and Arthur Margon, of Brooklyn. Her father is the principal in charge of the Manhattan office of RCG, a company based in Berkeley, Calif., that does real-estate economic forecasting. Her mother is a health-care consultant in Brooklyn. 
 Mr. Chaltain, 33, works for the First Amendment Center, a program in Arlington, Va., of the Freedom Forum; he is a director of the First Amendment Schools Project, a national school-reform initiative. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin and received a master's degree in American studies from William and Mary. 
 His mother, Cornelia Maude Spelman of Evanston, Ill., is a former clinical social worker and the author of ''The Way I Feel,'' a series of children's books about grief, jealousy and other topics published by Albert Whitman & Company. His father, Victor H. Chaltain Jr. of Hanover, N.H., is a building contractor.
 Ms. Margon first heard about her future husband in the fall of 1997, when he was a soccer coach at the school her brother, Andrew, attended in Brooklyn. 
 ''My mother kept telling me I needed to come home and meet my brother's cute new soccer coach,'' recalled Ms. Margon, who was at college when the suggestion was put forth.
 Picturing some sort of nerd, she did not race home. In the meantime, Mr. Chaltain got to know the other members of Ms. Margon's family. He saw them at school events, strolled the sidelines with her father before soccer games, and even came to their house for an end-of-year team party. 
 In June 1998, Ms. Margon chaperoned her brother's eighth-grade graduation dance. At the end of the dance some of the other chaperones invited Ms. Margon to attend a party Mr. Chaltain was giving in his apartment.
 She went. ''I thought, 'I might as well at least see what he looks like,' '' she said.

HEADLINE: Flying Is No Fun, but It May Get Better

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
ON June 1, the day after Memorial Day and the traditional start of the summer travel season, the scene at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the nation's busiest, captured the state of the American flying experience in a nutshell. 
 Holiday traffic overwhelmed security guards, and thousands of passengers waited two hours or more to be screened. Lines of travelers wound past the ticket counters and through baggage claim areas.
 One thing to note: The counters at Delta were packed, but so were those of its low-fare challenger, AirTran. The difference was, the new guy is making money. Delta could soon go bankrupt. 
 The crowds seem to bear out forecasts of the busiest travel summer in four years, but even that may not save America's traditional airlines -- the companies that sold the country on air travel in the first place. 
 That may be bad news for the tens of thousands of employees of those companies, but consumers may be looking at a considerably brighter future -- one in which they will be offered more choices in how they fly, where they leave from and what they pay. 
 Almost all the major airlines have suffered deep losses since summer 2000 -- the so-called summer of hell when delays and congestion clogged the nation's airports, enraging passengers and causing concern among regulators that the air traffic system was becoming overburdened. And then came the plunge in air travel after 9/11. 
 Since then, the airlines have collectively laid off more than 100,000 employees, mothballing more than 1,200 aircraft and banishing free cocktails and food from their flights. They also got a $15 billion bailout from Congress after the attacks.
 This is the year the airlines hoped they would recover. Instead, they could lose $3 billion, and what's more, the business they're in seems to be changing right out from under them. 
 The changes, said Alfred E. Kahn, who oversaw airline deregulation in the late 1970's as the chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board, have combined ''to turn a relatively prosperous and pretty competitive industry into a basket case.'' 
 The major companies were booming as recently as the late 1990's. Since then, however, deregulation has, in effect, hollowed out the old industry and begun building a new one. 
 The primary problem, said Mr. Kahn, a professor in political economy at Cornell University, is that the major carriers have been unable to find a strategy for competing against low-fare airlines like Southwest, JetBlue and AirTran, which grow stronger each year.
 For example, last month Southwest began flying out of Philadelphia, long dominated by US Airways. US Airways charged as much as $1,400 for a last-minute round-trip flight to Las Vegas, but Southwest charges no more than $598, and often hundreds of dollars less for the same trip. Southwest, given its lower costs, can make money on those fares, while US. Airways cannot. With low-fare carriers handling 25 percent of the industry's business now -- compared with just 6 percent at the start of the 1990's -- some experts see that figure climbing to 40 percent by the end of this decade. 
 Thus far, the major airlines have fought back primarily by adding flights and slashing their fares, as they did to defeat People Express, the first of the no-frills carriers, over a decade ago. But they are bleeding red ink on each of those flights.
 Among the most troubled is United Airlines, which is in bankruptcy protection. US Airways, which technically defaulted on the loan package that helped it emerge from Chapter 11 protection last year, is warning it might go back into bankruptcy unless it gets union wage cuts. Delta Airlines says it, too, may seek bankruptcy protection. 
 The rise of the small airlines is sweet vindication for Donald Burr, the creator of People Express, which became an instant success in the 1980's with minimal service and cheap prices, only to vanish a decade later in the face of the major carriers' counterattack. 
 Mr. Burr says he believes that more change is coming. And he adds that it could be good for consumers. He foresees travelers finding alternatives to crowded terminals and jets backed up on runways, and has teamed with the former American Airlines chief executive Robert Crandall to form an air-taxi service that will serve underused small airports. 
 To Mr. Burr, the future lies in decentralization, with more small carriers serving different kinds of customers, at different levels of luxury and convenience. In other words, people may be able to shop for the kind of air service they want, just as they shop for, say, the kind of car they want.
 ''We had a era when everyone believed bigger was better,'' said Mr. Burr. ''That's not true anymore.''
 Professor Kahn, who cheerfully accepts the blame for breaking up the old aviation system, says that system ''had all kinds of advantages, but it was predicated on people being willing to sit still and accept prices that were outrageous.'' 
 Airports may be crowded, lines may be long, but the prices have put air travel in the reach of more and more people. ''That's why we deregulated,'' Mr. Kahn said.

HEADLINE: The Changing Face Of Society Hill

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
EVERY city has its neighborhoods that speak of comfort and affluence, of historic architecture and idiosyncratic businesses that create a distinct sense of place. In Philadelphia, the archetypal one may be Society Hill, which is famous for its cobblestone streets, its charming houses and, increasingly, its high real estate prices. 
 In part because of the demand for town houses there, a developer is now beginning to put up 35 new town houses with bay windows and mansard roofs that will be inspired by their historic counterparts but not exact duplicates. Although new town houses have been built here and there in Society Hill, this is the first such large development in decades. 
 This month, the roofless shells of six town houses will be leveled to make way for the new houses, which will also sit on land now occupied by a parking lot. 
 ''There is a trend back to city living, and I'm betting prices in Philadelphia will continue to escalate,'' said Arthur Fefferman, president of AFC Realty Capital of Manhattan, which is developing the homes with the Altman Group of Philadelphia. He said the site -- on Lombard Street close to where the Declaration of Independence was signed -- is among the last development parcels in Society Hill.
 The houses, with three and four bedrooms, are expected to sell for $900,000 to $1.4 million. That is in line with prices for similarly sized houses in that area, according to Mary Hall, a regional sales and marketing manager at Prudential Fox & Roach, which will be marketing them. She said that of the 92 houses that have sold so far this year, 26 were priced from $500,000 to around $1 million. 
 The housing development is part of a burst of new construction in a city that like so many others in the Northeast is trying to regenerate rundown neighborhoods. 
 Philadelphia has devised tax incentives to help stem the flow of people out of the city, which lost 4.3 percent of its population from 1990 to 2000. Starting in 1997, developers were offered 10-year tax abatements to convert commercial buildings downtown to rentals and condominiums, and now they are being offered similar incentives to build new housing. 
 For developers the abatements ''take some risk off the project and for buyers they mean a savings,'' said Joanne Davidow, a vice president at the local Prudential Fox & Roach Realtors. She said buyers of homes in the $1 million range, for instance, could save up to $100,000 in taxes over 10 years. 
 Initially, the wave of new and converted housing washed over established areas like Rittenhouse Square and Society Hill, but in recent years it has gained momentum and spread to neighboring downtown districts like Northern Liberties and Bella Vista.
 In Center City alone, 100 commercial buildings have been or will be converted to produce about 5,000 market-rate rental and condominium apartments. And some 849 one-family houses as well as rental and condominium apartments have been or are being built with 2,900 more proposed, according to the Center City District, a private downtown planning and advocacy group.
 Among recent buyers in Society Hill are Raymond Sterling and Beth Markward, both in their 50's, who are getting a two-bedroom duplex condominium. She is selling her house in Yardley, Pa., and they are keeping his home in Margate, N.J. They will use it as a pied-a-terre because it is close to his work as a dentist and hers as a designer. 
 Mr. Sterling said he liked the central location of Society Hill, and the nearby restaurants and theaters. The couple is paying in the $1 million range for the apartment and expects to close on it in September. Mr. Sterling said he was happy to get the tax abatement that the city has offered developers to encourage new construction, but that wasn't the central reason for his choice -- it is just ''icing on the cake.''
 Tania Rorke, who moved to Society Hill with her husband, Tom, in 1997, and who is president of the Society Hill Civic Association, said she paid in the $400,000 range for her home in 1998 and today it could fetch $800,000 to $900,000. She added that all the new housing developments, assuming they sell, will make the city ''a more vibrant place to live.'' 
 In Society Hill, for instance, she said, Mr. Fefferman's town house project -- which will feature the old-style Franklin street lamps that are a neighborhood fixture -- will be ''a significant improvement'' and help keep alive the charm of the area's past. 
 Although Mrs. Rorke moved to Philadelphia from Hilton Head, S.C., and at first didn't like the city, she has come to love its distinct rhythms. 
 ''Our little enclave has all the conveniences of the city and all the benefits of the suburbs, but it is more close knit,'' she said. ''I come out my front door and see my neighbors and many nights we sit on our stoops and talk.''

HEADLINE: And Now, for the Next Act

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
IN the early 90's, morning commuters used to pour out of the Port Authority Bus Terminal on Eighth Avenue like a swollen river, coursing across 41st and 43rd Streets on their way east. They skirted 42nd Street as if it were blocked by a huge boulder, and the reason was obvious: the prostitutes, pimps, drug dealers, chicken hawks and other hustlers who presided on the parched sidewalks of the Deuce.
 Who among those workers could have imagined that, by the end of the decade, 42nd Street and Times Square as a whole would be safe, even desirable, territory for big media companies, white-shoe law firms and investment bankers? Who could have imagined that the Crossroads of the World would be reborn as a dizzying kaleidoscope of full-color electronic signs and billboards, that the shuttered storefronts along 42nd Street would give way to soaring towers, the B.B. King nightclub, an Internet cafe and a carpeted multiplex. And who could have imagined that, after several decades of slow decay, the transformation would be as fast as a game of three-card monte. 
 Just like those early 90's commuters, we can't conceive of the shape of tomorrow's Times Square. It may remain a vibrant mecca for tourism, entertainment and commerce, or it may assume a totally different shape, like some kind of urban chameleon. 
 Historians, urban planners and Times Square promoters offer an array of predictions, many contradictory. 
 Thomas Bender, author of ''The Unfinished City: New York and the Metropolitan Idea'' and chairman of the history department at New York University, sees the fate of Times Square hinging on the fate of the surrounding area. ''It all depends on whether Midtown Manhattan continues to have the same function 100 years from now as it does today,'' he said, alluding to the area's role now as a place where people live, work and play 24-7. If, like other city centers, Midtown evolves into an office area, then Times Square may be largely vacant after quitting time or serve as an entertainment center mostly for tourists. 
 If any force can turn Times Square into just another bland intersection, it may be the march of real estate activity to the west. Developers today are doing what was unthinkable 20 years ago: building residential towers along a once-industrial stretch of 42nd Street from Eighth Avenue to the Hudson River. There are plans to enlarge the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, and the Jets want to build a new stadium on the West Side. Also, the city is pushing its Hudson Yards project, a plan to transform the tenements and factories of the far West Side into a high-rise residential and office district over the next 30 years. 
 ''To some extent, the future of Times Square is tied up with the far West Side,'' said Mike Wallace, co-author of ''Gotham: A History of New York City to 1898.'' ''What's to prevent these footloose operations from moving west if the Hudson Yards becomes the new hot spot? They hopped from Lower Manhattan to Midtown with alacrity.'' 
 The theater district, a Times Square mainstay, is also under pressure. The district almost died in the 1970's when Times Square became a danger zone for tourists and New Yorkers alike. Today, the theater buildings themselves are old, small and ill-suited for modern musicals. Landmark laws prohibit demolition, but even if they didn't, the theater owners need larger parcels to build up-to-date playhouses. 
 The theaters survived the movie palaces' onslaught, but Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, which operates 17 of Broadway's 35 theaters, said one-third of Broadway houses have been unprofitable for more than a decade.
 Could the district move? ''The environment in Times Square is safe, clean and attractive,'' Mr. Schoenfeld said. ''So I don't see theaters being threatened by anything other than economic strictures created by constantly rising costs and an unsympathetic government. If they wanted to create a cultural center at Battery Park City, the theaters could go there.''
 Moreover, even in the new Times Square, change has already crept in. The golden age of theme restaurants in the late 90's came and went in a blink. Gone are the All Star Cafe, David Copperfield's Magic Underground, Bar Code and World Wrestling Entertainment's restaurant and nightclub. And while developers were encouraged to echo the square's heritage by bringing entertainment ventures to storefronts, the pool of such tenants was shallow and some spaces have been filled with the cellphone stores, drug stores and bank branches common to the street corners of every city. 
 The rejuvenation of Times Square and the arrival of 20,000 new office workers have also driven up rents. A glamorous bar scene flourishes at the Blue Fin in the W Hotel, but with Fleet Bank willing to pay an unheard-of $515 a square foot to rent 5,000 square feet at Broadway and 44th Street, replacing some fast-food restaurants, the square may be in danger of getting bland. 
 Despite all these pressures, some people see a future for Times Square much like its present. Rebecca Robertson, the former president of the state's Times Square redevelopment project, who oversaw the square's transformation in the late 80's and early 90's, doubts that office workers in Times Square will ever go home at 5 p.m. Times Square will always be about entertainment and leisure, she said, even as the specifics change from year to year.
 For example, the giant McDonald's on 42nd Street is only the current incarnation of the popular restaurants and cafeterias of yesterday, Toffenetti's, White's and Bickford's. Similarly, the electronic billboards for men's underwear, musicals and Nasdaq in the 90's mirror the billboards and the neon spectaculars for musicals, toothpaste, pickles and chewing gum in the 30's.
 ''It's a place where its mythology is so embedded,'' Ms. Robertson said. ''Times Square was live theater and movies. One hundred years later, guess what? It's movies and live theater.'' 
 Policymakers are relying on more than the square's heritage. Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, the business improvement district, said his group was addressing the needs of the new office workers by enticing clothing chains to the area, and of tourists, by creating an amphitheater at Duffy Square. 
 The geometry of Times Square, with the broad lanes of Broadway and Seventh Avenue crisscrossing in the ''bow tie,'' also ensures that the intersection will always be special, he said, not to mention the fact that underground, a dozen subway lines converge, bringing more than 250,000 people on the average weekday. Moreover, the square is the only spot in the city where the large illuminated signs that give the area its razzmatazz are not only permitted but required.
 ''Physically, Times Square will always be one of the largest public spaces in New York City,'' Mr. Tompkins said. ''We have a lot of raw ingredients.''

HEADLINE: Pitching Coach Blends Science and Art

BYLINE: By LEE JENKINS

 BODY:
The remaining pieces from Rick Peterson's collection of seascape paintings still hang in his home, subtle reminders of a time and place when they were just about all he had.
 Through his years as a self-described starving artist, Peterson would paint and read and sometimes fast in an attempt to clear his body and mind in a struggle to find the right line on his life.
 Baseball coaches can seem born out of the diamond, carved from fungo bats, polished over the years like glove leather. Ask them when they decided to become coaches and they shrug, as if there was never really a choice.
 Peterson remembers the day, the place and the moment. It was the starting point for a career that has taken him from minor league towns to major league cities, enabling him to advance the science of baseball and open the mind of an industry resistant to change. 
 Peterson, 49, is best known for developing a nucleus of young pitchers in Oakland who led the American League in earned run average the past two seasons. But perhaps more stunning is what the pitching coach has accomplished this season with an aging staff in New York, taking the Mets to the top of the major leagues in E.R.A. and helping them remain competitive despite an inconsistent defense and a relatively unproductive lineup.
 This has all been in the works for more than the past 25 years, since the day Peterson woke up with an empty stomach and decided to take a walk on the beach.
 At the time, he was living in an apartment in San Diego about the size of a freight elevator, just steps from the bustling boardwalk and raucous roller coaster on Mission Beach. He was collecting unemployment, gathering food stamps and working part time as a physical education instructor at a local elementary school for $60 a week.
 On the other side of the country, his father, Harding Peterson, was assembling a team that would win the 1979 World Series and make ''We Are Family'' a civic theme song. Harding Peterson was the Pittsburgh Pirates' general manager, but his son was just another kid on the beach, promising his parents he could make it on his own.
 Back then, Rick Peterson was a pitcher still laboring through the minor leagues every summer, but his arm was injured and his spirit was restless. He headed to San Diego in the winter of 1978, not for any reason other than that he was from New Jersey, and San Diego sounded like a place you could warm up and start over, even if you only had $1,000 in your savings account.
 Outside of his dingy apartment, Peterson noticed a flier one day promoting a free seminar with a holistic chiropractor. He wondered if the chiropractor could somehow heal his ailing arm. After Peterson served as a volunteer at the seminar, he asked for a regular appointment. He paid with the only assets he had -- his Impressionist oil paintings of the ocean.
 The chiropractor treated several professional athletes in San Diego and had many prescriptions, including a weeklong fast. Peterson would be allowed to eat raw fruits and vegetables at the start of the week, then only liquids. For a 23-year-old who was looking for something, and did not know exactly what, it was a suggestion worth trying.
 As it turned out, that fast sped up the course of his career. Near the end of the week, he strolled out of his apartment and onto the sand. He has always been tightly built, a fitness fiend, but he was about 25 pounds lighter than normal because he had eaten so little solid food during the winter.
 ''I was walking on the beach and it was like an epiphany,'' Peterson said. ''I wasn't thinking about anything, but all the answers just came to me. You're a teacher. Go teach. Put on your uniform and go teach.''
 For a while, he had wanted nothing to do with that uniform ever again. He had worn it since he was a child, when his father was playing for the Pirates and when he would go into the clubhouse thinking of Roberto Clemente and Willie Stargell as uncles.
 He was still wearing a uniform on what might have been the worst weekend of his career, nearly two decades later, when he threw 200 pitches in a game for Gulf Coast Community College in Florida, and was called to pitch in relief the next day. From then on, Peterson played with a tendon in his throwing arm that was detached from the bone.
 He transferred to Jacksonville University the next year to study psychology and art, but he could still paint the corners of the plate and eventually graduated to the minor leagues with the Pirates, where he spent more time as a player-coach than as a player.
 After one of his final pitching appearances as a regular player, he sat on the floor of a janitor's closet in Alexandria, Va., his arm resting in a dirty sink. The Pirates executive Murray Cook walked into the room, took one look at Peterson and said, ''I think that's it.''
 Peterson spent a large portion of that night staring into a mirror in his hotel room, tears rolling down his cheeks, asking himself, ''So now what?''
 ''I didn't know what I was going to do?'' Peterson said. ''I was going through some serious soul-searching. I wanted to find my life's work and I didn't know what it was going to be.''
 No matter how far he strayed from baseball -- into art and psychology and Eastern philosophy -- he could not leave it altogether.
 When Cook offered him his first job with the Pirates as a minor league coach in 1979, not long after that winter in San Diego, Peterson made it his mission to use baseball as his platform, merging East with West, modern science with old-school hardball. 
 The game was not altogether ready for him. Even his father pushed him to be a doctor or a lawyer, fields better suited to a stable future. After spending over a decade with the Pirates and the Cleveland Indians, and bouncing from the minors to the majors, the Chicago White Sox and the Toronto Blue Jays hired Peterson in the mid-1990's, then fired him in the span of two years. Executives in Toronto said he was too advanced. People in Chicago wondered why he had pitchers throw with their eyes closed, even though the organization's most prominent minor leaguer, Michael Jordan, practiced free-throw shooting with his eyes closed.
 ''There were times then that I thought I'd be out of baseball,'' Peterson said. ''I was frustrated to the point where I didn't know anymore if anyone would let me do what I do.''
 Peterson seemed to fit in better on the team at the American Sports Medicine Institute in Birmingham, Ala., a biomechanics lab where he first joined Dr. James Andrews and Dr. Glenn Flesig 15 years ago to analyze pitching motions, to identify trouble spots on the elbow and the shoulder and to evaluate methods to prevent pitching injuries, particularly in young people. Even now, Peterson has not allowed any of his three sons to pitch until they turn 15.
 ''I saw a real drive back then to use his brain as well as his experience,'' said Flesig, who still works regularly with Peterson. ''He wasn't another piece fitting into the system. Other pitching coaches were doing it their team's way, or the way it had been done for years. Rich was questioning that, not just accepting it. Talking to him is different than talking to other pitching coaches. I find it's more introspective and analytical.''
 Peterson remained in baseball partly because he still hungered to improve it. The A's Billy Beane, already forging a reputation as a rebel general manager, fired the team's pitching coach, Bob Cluck, late in spring training of 1998, even though Cluck was best friends with Manager Art Howe. Beane then promoted Peterson, whom he had hired to be a roving instructor, and watched him cultivate the best young rotation in baseball, helping them avoid the sort of arm trouble that cut short his own career.
 ''It was a tough spot for Rick, but we hit it off right away,'' said Howe, who was also reared in Pittsburgh and has been reunited with Peterson in New York. ''I think he has always appreciated that I gave him the reins and let him do his job.''
 Howe and Peterson can come across as complete opposites, one a mild-mannered traditionalist, the other a high-energy revolutionary. Peterson cannot be confined to the stadium, using his spare time to develop a baseball-specific laptop computer and a software program that computes data on every hitter. Peterson tells his pitchers what a given hitter is batting against 1-2 changeups on the inside corner of the plate, and what they should throw as a result.
 ''There's a reason why we have the best pitching staff in baseball,'' said Tom Glavine, who is making a bid for comeback player of the year. ''When you have a lot of veteran guys, people think they won't listen and buy in. That's not necessarily true. We're smart enough to realize that there are things we can do better, and Rick can teach us those things.''
 Glavine remembers how Peterson gathered the Mets pitchers after a rare rough spot in Arizona this season and presented them with a bag of fortune cookies. Each pitcher took out a cookie and read his fortune. Instead of rolling their eyes, they started joking that their fortunes would change, and, sure enough, Glavine went out and beat Randy Johnson in a 1-0 masterpiece.
 With his mound mantras, his running catch phrases and the motivational sayings that he keeps pasted in his celebrated black book, Peterson has been easy to parody over the years. But Mets pitchers, the only critics who really matter, have become almost protective of their new coach. Not only do they defend his practices, they resent any implication that he is some sort of baseball radical.
 ''What we've done in his first year is not a coincidence,'' Al Leiter said. ''His passion for what he does burns so hot, it's like a white flame. Sometimes I think it's frustrating for him because he wants everyone to have the same passion he does.''
 Leiter is 38, pitching with a frayed labrum in his left shoulder and at that stage of his career when he is starting to wonder what he will do when it is over. He will undoubtedly have opportunities in television, business and politics, but someday soon, he too could be standing in front of a mirror, asking himself, ''So now what?''
 Peterson, the coach who reminds Leiter to rotate his hips, keep his hands low and throw only changeups on 1-2 counts, can also help answer that eternal question.

HEADLINE: Owning vs. Renting? You Can Do the Math

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

 BODY:
THERE'S a belief that spending money on rent is always wasteful, while buying a home is always smart. This is nonsense. 
 My wife and I recently sold our apartment downtown because we needed a larger one and decided that it made more sense to move into a rental than to buy again. 
 Let's assume you're buying an apartment for $750,000, and that you have $500,000 to invest and must borrow the additional $250,000. While tax deductions on interest payments are helpful, the after-tax expense of borrowing that much money is conservatively about $700 a month, based on a 5.5 percent mortgage rate.
 If you can earn a 4 percent after-tax return on your money, the ''opportunity cost'' of investing $500,000 is $1,666 a month. You have to factor that into your decision as well.
 And then there are the monthly fees after you buy. Most New York City apartments have maintenance fees that, for a $750,000 apartment, often equal about $1,150 a month. On an after-tax basis, this ends up being about $1,000. Insurance is about $250 a month.
 Many people also overlook the one-time costs involved with selling when they consider buying. The broker's fee in Manhattan on that $750,000 apartment will be about $45,000. There's a city transfer tax of $7,500 and lawyers' and closing fees that can add up to $5,000. Then there is the flip tax, which is not really a tax but a fee for the sale of a co-op unit; when we sold our apartment, it was $9,000. 
 Altogether, the one-time costs of selling add up to $66,500, and the monthly costs equal $3,616. There are costs of buying like legal fees, too, that vary. 
 My wife and I figured that we would keep our next apartment for about three years. That meant our true monthly costs for the period would have been about $5,463.
 We got a better apartment by spending $3,400 a month in rent than we ever could have gotten by spending $750,000 to buy -- saving more than $72,000 over the three-year period. 
 Of course, if real estate prices continue to soar, my wife and I are out of luck. But with the average price of a two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan already passing the $1 million mark and interest rates rising, that seems unlikely over the next three years. GARDINER HARRIS

HEADLINE: Is the Stock Market Too Focused on Rates?

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
INVESTMENT advisers have been warning, to little dissent, that with inflation on the rise, the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates aggressively, creating a harsh climate for stocks. 
 But some contrarian investors say that inflation fears have been overstated and that while consumer prices and interest rates may rise further, they are unlikely to climb as swiftly as many people think.
 As a result, the contrarians say, there are bargains to be found, particularly among stocks in industries highly affected by interest rates. They cite industries like construction and financial services that are trading substantially lower than they did in the recent past. 
 ''There has been quite a shakeout,'' said Tim Harris, equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in London. He said he had been predicting that the economy would hit ''a sweet spot'' with 3 to 4 percent growth and low to moderate inflation.
 ''The market seems to have jumped straight through that,'' he said. ''It's gone from one extreme to the other,'' meaning from fear of deflation to fear of rapid inflation.
 Mr. Harris is sticking with his benign picture. ''I don't think high inflation or stagflation are factors we'll be living with,'' he said. In an economy afflicted with stagflation, inflation is accompanied by slow growth and high unemployment.
 ''There may be some Fed tightening, but the market's overreacting,'' he said. 
 He estimated that the federal funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend to one another overnight -- will rise gradually over the next 18 months to 4 percent, from its current level of 1 percent, with little negative effect on stocks. ''I don't think the U.S. economy is a runaway horse,'' Mr. Harris said. ''I do see it growing at a nice, gusty pace.''
 Economists at Gartmore Global Investments in Conshohocken, Pa., also expect the Fed to raise the rate to 4 percent by the end of 2005. They predict small, gradual moves, with all but two quarter-point increases coming next year.
 ''We think rates will go up 50 basis points this year, one rise before the election, one after,'' said Simon Melluish, head of the American equities desk at Gartmore. ''The market's pricing in a good deal more than that,'' he added, maybe 100 basis points, or one percentage point. 
 If the market is overestimating the Fed's tightening, or its impact on the economy, home builders should be worthy investments, Mr. Melluish said. They are now trading at six to seven times his estimate of 2005 earnings. That is very inexpensive, he said, and similar to the valuations in 1984 and 1994, he recalled, when rates rose for several months before reversing course.
 Two builders' stocks he owns are Centex and Lennar. Centex recently had a price-to-earnings ratio of 6.8, and Lennart's was 8.2. 
 Mr. Melluish also likes credit card issuers including MBNA and Capital One. Their prices may be due for a bounce, he said, because enough time has passed since the last mortgage refinancing binge.
 ''Normally a year after a refi boom, credit card companies do well because people start running out of cash,'' he said.
 If rates rise only moderately, Mr. Harris expects companies like insurers, drug makers and food producers to do well. Pharmaceutical and food producers tend to beat the market in times of steady economic growth because their products are necessities, and insurers fare better when prices rise on bonds, which form a big portion of their investment portfolios. Bond prices, which have been falling as interest-rate anxiety has increased, may recover somewhat if those fears prove to be exaggerated.
 He likes several European insurers, including Generali of Italy, Royal and Sun Alliance of Britain and AXA of France. Among food producers, his recommendations include Nestle and Kellogg. And he favors Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer in the pharmaceutical sector. 
 Edward Maran, associate portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management in Santa Fe, N.M., has no specific interest-rate forecast, but said he expects that rates will stay low enough not to appreciably depress economic growth. He recommended four stocks that he said should flourish amid such a backdrop: Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Southwest Airlines and Lowe's.
 Citigroup is his choice among big banks because it is involved in activities -- like mortgage lending, investment banking and asset management -- that are especially profitable if rates remain low, he said. 
 ''If rates stay low, consumer and mortgage lending would be strong, as well as commercial lending,'' Mr. Maran predicted.
 Such strength is not factored into Wells Fargo's stock, he said. It trades at 12 times his estimate of earnings next year, and he expects long-term earnings growth of 11 to 12 percent annually, making the valuation look low, he said.
 HE also considers Southwest Airlines relatively cheap at 22 times his estimate for 2005 earnings; its typical multiple is 20 to 40. Airlines are highly affected by changes in economic growth and interest rates, Mr. Maran said, but investors in Southwest seem to be focusing on the prospect of higher rates, not on the economic strength that would produce them. 
 If the economy performs well and rates don't soar, Southwest's stock could double, he said.
 Shares in Lowe's, the home-improvement chain, have fallen with construction stocks and now trade at about 15 times his estimate for 2005 earnings, compared with their usual range of 30 to 40.
 ''People are associating Lowe's with home builders, but we think they're less sensitive to interest rates,'' Mr. Maran said. ''But if rates stay moderate, Lowe's could have a big bounce back.''
 Bill Nygren, manager of the Oakmark and Oakmark Select funds, prefers Lowe's rival, Home Depot. ''The fears are that as rates go up, consumers will have less money for refinancing,'' he said. That, in turn, would mean less money for home improvements. But if rates don't rise much, he said, Home Depot's earnings should increase.
 Mr. Nygren suggested two other beneficiaries of continued strength in housing: Washington Mutual, the bank and mortgage lender; and Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored giant in mortgage lending. Both have fallen on ''concerns that increasing rates will bring an end to the building boom,'' he said.
 Mr. Nygren prefers leaving interest-rate forecasts to others. He called the shift in the rate consensus ''one of the most amazing I've ever seen,'' though he noted that the recent change of mind was not the first.
 ''These are the same people who were telling us a year ago not to be in stocks because of the possibility of deflation,'' he recalled.

HEADLINE: Healthier and Wiser? Sure, but Not Wealthier

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH; J. Alex Tarquinio contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
BY many measures, today's older workers appear better equipped for retirement than any previous generation. Their homes are worth more than their parents' homes were. Their bank accounts are fatter. And study after study suggests that typical late-middle-age employees have accumulated more wealth than their counterparts did a quarter-century ago.
 But virtually all of these studies have a flaw, a crucial asset that is left out of the equation. Add it back in, and the rosy picture suddenly darkens. 
 That asset is the traditional pension, an employee benefit that was widely available until the early 1980's but has been vanishing from the American workplace ever since. More than two-thirds of older households -- those headed by people 47 to 64 -- had someone earning a pension in 1983. By 2001, fewer than half did. The demise of the old-fashioned pension has been much discussed, but the effect on family finances has not. That is because the impact has been hard to measure. 
 New evidence suggests, though, that the waning of the pension has, imperceptibly but surely, stripped older workers of an immense store of wealth -- much more than they probably guessed, if they thought about it at all. Retirement benefits today, particularly the 401(k) account, simply are not worth as much as the older kind of benefits. Some studies suggest otherwise, but they tend to rely on average balances of retirement accounts, and the averages have been skewed upward by the extraordinary gains of a few wealthy households.
 When the holdings of more typical households are tracked instead, today's near-retirees turn out to be a little poorer, in constant dollars, than the previous generation was when it approached retirement in 1983. The sweeping change in employee compensation appears to be the reason, according to new research by Edward N. Wolff, an economist at New York University who analyzed 18 years of household financial data collected by the Federal Reserve. 
 Mr. Wolff found that the average net worth of an older household grew 44 percent, adjusted for inflation, from 1983 to 2001, to $673,000. But much of that growth was in the accounts of the richest households, which pushed the averages up. When Mr. Wolff looked at the net worth of the median older household -- the one at the midpoint of the economic ladder, a better indicator of what is typical -- the picture changed. That figure declined by 2.2 percent, or $4,000, during the period, to $199,900. 
 For a generation to emerge from two bullish decades with less wealth than its parents had ''is remarkable,'' Mr. Wolff said. Based on economic growth and market returns over those 18 years, he said, their wealth ''should be up around 30 or 40 percent.'' 
 The Fed's household-finance data also show that when pensions were more common, they served as a social leveler. Companies that offered them had to use the same pension formula, involving years of service and salary, for all workers in a plan; otherwise, the companies risked losing their tax break. The rich in those days bought big houses and invested in stocks and other assets that were out of reach for the middle class. But pensions would offset, to some degree, the difference between how these groups lived in old age. Traditional pension plans were part of a system that reduced the poverty rate among the elderly to just 1 in 10 in 2002, the lowest in half a century. 
 The advent of self-directed retirement plans, by contrast, is giving rise to an elite minority who are well prepared for retirement, and a majority who are falling behind, the numbers show.
 ''The people at the top did better than they ever would have under the old system,'' Mr. Wolff said. ''Basically, they made out like bandits.''
 JANE NOBILETTI, who sells long-term care insurance in Manhattan, has not done the math, but she senses some of this already. Earlier in her career, she earned a partial pension when she worked at a large insurance company. But after she had spent more than 20 years there, the company merged with another and began cutting costs, and Ms. Nobiletti felt compelled to leave. 
 By resigning, she walked away from the biggest part of her pension; traditional plans normally pay the maximum to those who stay 30 years. She said that she enjoyed her new job, and that she had never tried to calculate how much of a pension she forfeited by leaving her former employer.
 ''Once you've lost it, there's no point in thinking about it anymore,'' she said. Her current employer, a small insurance wholesaler, has a 401(k) plan, and Ms. Nobiletti, who is in her early 50's, is using it to supplement her reduced pension.
 ''The pension that I do have, I'm glad it's going to be there, but it's no big deal,'' she added, estimating that she will receive $1,000 to $2,000 a month when she is old enough to collect the benefit.
 ''I'm not set up, by any stretch of the imagination. I won't have the lifestyle that I now have. I will have to sell my apartment and move out of New York, and I don't want to do that.'' 
 Ms. Nobiletti's experience is just part of a much broader trend. Countless American workers have relinquished part of a pension by moving from one job to another over the last two decades, reducing the years of service that traditional pensions reward. Many more have stayed in place as their companies have merged or reorganized, but they have seen their benefits sheared off anyway because new corporate leaders decided to do away with the plans. 
 In some sectors, like commercial aviation, pension plans began falling like dominoes after deregulation, because companies could no longer build pension costs into the prices they charged for their products. Still other workers lost out because their industries -- especially unionized ones like textiles or steel -- died or moved offshore. The new industries that have grown up in their place, like technology, have tended to offer other forms of compensation, like stock options.
 In 1985, about 115,000 American companies had traditional pension plans. As of last year, only about 31,000 did. Of those, many are thought to have frozen the benefits, pension specialists say, so that additional years of service no longer build a bigger pension. Others have closed their plans to new employees, or reduced their benefits formulas. Precise data on such changes are nonexistent, but Daniel L. McCaw, chief executive of Mercer Human Resource Consulting, said in Congressional testimony this year that as many as a quarter of surviving pension plans were either frozen or on the brink of a freeze. 
 As companies have moved out of the pension business, many have set up self-directed retirement programs instead, like 401(k) plans. Traditional pensions were paid out of a pooled pension fund, which was managed by professionals, but the new plans call for employees to set up their own accounts, deposit a portion of their earnings and manage the money themselves. Some companies make matching deposits. The old pension plans were automatic; the new ones are voluntary.
 In 1983, only a tiny fraction of households had 401(k) accounts. But by 2001, about 62 percent of older households had one. Some analysts hail the new plans, saying that they ultimately may prove better than pensions. The new plans allow employees to change employers without forfeiting part of their benefit, as Ms. Nobiletti did, for example. And because they do not involve a fixed, predetermined benefit, as traditional pensions often do, they can be less vulnerable to inflation. 
 The new retirement plans also free workers from having to tie their fate to the fortunes of a single company.
 Marcus Weaver, a manager at an industrial services company in Florida, said he was disappointed at first when his employer froze his pension during a merger in 1992. But then he saw a documentary on the collapse of the pension fund at Bethlehem Steel, in which many steelworkers lost part of their pensions. That made Mr. Weaver think that maybe it was just as well that he hadn't been relying on a pension. 
 ''If somebody that huge could have imploded like that, it shows you that for the individual, it's probably better to go the 401(k) route,'' he said. ''Then all your eggs aren't in one basket.'' 
 To many people, the 401(k) account simply looks bigger than a pension. Pensions are less tangible than other forms of wealth. Their value is hard to grasp, because it is usually expressed as a formula -- some multiple of future salary and years of service, perhaps with other factors. For many workers, that is meaningless until retirement looms.
 A 401(k) balance, by contrast, is expressed as a simple amount in dollars. It is easier to understand and therefore seems more substantial.
 Philip Merten, who owns a small video production company in Miami, says he has been trying in recent years to make the most of the various self-directed retirement programs at his disposal. His company has a small-business retirement plan, called a SEP-IRA, and he contributes to that. He also continues to manage a 401(k) account that he built up in a previous job as a television cameraman. His wife has a 401(k) balance, too, from a past job at Telemundo, the Spanish-language television network. Through careful stewardship, these various retirement accounts add up to several hundred thousand dollars. 
 ''We've been diligent,'' he said. The couple have also done well on other investments, particularly in real estate. They own their home, which they bought in 1999, and a condominium in Coral Gables, Fla., which they bought in 1989 when they were newly married. 
 ''That's probably the best investment,'' Mr. Merten said. ''Property values have just gone through the ceiling.'' 
 He said he thought that the condominium had quadrupled in value from the $50,000 they paid 15 years ago, and that their house had more than doubled in five years, to more than $500,000. 
 MR. MERTEN is happy with his decision to go into business for himself, he said. But it has forced him to go out and shop for health insurance on his own, and that process has given him doubts about retirement, and whether he is building a nest egg quickly enough. ''My own gut feeling is that we need to speed up the rate a bit,'' he said. 
 His father spent his career at Bank of America and earned a substantial pension. He often urges Mr. Merten to set aside more. Mr. Merten does not think that there is any chance he will have retirement resources like his father's. 
 ''Working for a big company like that, he knew exactly what he'd make, and he could plan,'' Mr. Merten said. ''I think it's a lot harder now.''
 The Fed's household-finance data back Mr. Merten's impression that his family has done reasonably well with self-directed retirement benefits. The central bank has conducted regular, detailed surveys of the value of various assets held by households going back to 1983. Self-directed retirement accounts were just starting to appear in the workplace then, and, by the Fed's count, the average older household had about $8,000 in such a plan. By 2001, it had $96,600 -- an impressively bullish increase.
 Of course, households were losing access to pensions at the same time. But that side of things usually does not show up in the statistics. The Fed does collect detailed information about pensions in its surveys, but because the pensions are expressed as a formula, and other household assets are expressed in dollar amounts, it does not add the two together. Instead, it tracks most household assets -- real estate, bank accounts, securities and so on -- in its regular reports. The information on pensions is kept separate, in an appendix. 
 It is not impossible to convert pension values into dollars. Actuaries build their careers on doing precisely such calculations for their corporate clients. Mr. Wolff said he applied standard actuarial methods to the Fed's undigested pension data, and added the resulting values to the other household assets, for a complete picture of household net worth. That is how he arrived at the 2.2 percent decline in wealth for median older households.
 Actuaries who were told about Mr. Wolff's research said the findings made intuitive sense to them. ''The concept sounds right,'' said Steven G. Vernon, a vice president and consulting actuary at Watson Wyatt Worldwide.
 People like Mr. Vernon calculate pension values routinely. They say that there are reasons traditional pensions hold more value than the newer benefits. For one thing, it is more efficient to run a pooled trust fund than a lot of individual accounts. In a pooled pension fund, employees who die before collecting much of a pension effectively pay for the benefits of those who live longer. Arguably, pooling the purchasing power of many participants reduces money-management fees and brokerage costs, as well. Mercer Human Resource Consulting estimates that for that reason, the performance of the typical pension plan is one to two percentage points better than that of the typical 401(k) plan.
 Mercer and other retirement specialists say that complex federal regulations have driven many companies away from traditional pension plans, and that relaxing those rules might bring the companies back. So far in Washington, there has been talk about such a change, but no action. It took two years for Congress to make just a single modification in the pension rules, changing an interest rate that companies use when calculating pension values. Pension advocates say that Washington tends to react only in a crisis, and that this generation's unpreparedness for retirement won't be a crisis until people actually retire and feel the pinch.
 As it dawns on workers that they don't have enough to live on, some are simply deciding to delay retirement. The Society of Actuaries recently reported that the number of people who say they will never retire, while small, doubled from 2001 to 2003, to 8 percent.
 Pete Miller, 64, a computer program manager who lives in Northborough, Mass., recently did some of the calculations and discovered how important a pension can be. He taught at Boston University for many years, building up a large individual retirement account, and joined Lotus Development in 1993. Lotus had a traditional pension plan, ''as good as you could get at that time,'' Mr. Miller said. I.B.M. took over Lotus in 1995 but brought employees like Mr. Miller into its own pension plan and gave them credit for their years at Lotus.
 IN 1999, I.B.M. changed its pension plan, reducing some people's anticipated benefits and setting off a firestorm. Some employees sued; I.B.M. restored some of the benefits, but the controversy is still in court. Mr. Miller continues to work for the company.
 Because he has his individual retirement account from his previous job, he said, the I.B.M. lawsuit is not a make-or-break issue for him. His wife also teaches and has a retirement account. With those assets, Social Security and the pension, he estimates that he and his wife will have retirement income of $4,000 to $5,000 a month, as long as they live frugally and do not draw down their principal. The I.B.M. pension will pay him about $500 a month, he said. He calculates that it would have been $1,000 a month if the terms of the plan had not changed.
 ''Five hundred dollars isn't that much, but it actually adds up,'' he said. His real estate taxes recently went up by about $500 a year. His two children are in high school, so they will need college tuition money just when he would normally retire. 
 ''That $500 a month extra would have more than taken care of our property taxes,'' he said. ''An extra $500 would have paid the property tax and the insurance on our home and auto.''
 Mr. Miller says that changes in retirement benefits have hit many American workers harder than him -- and that he wonders how people who have no pensions at all will manage.
 ''There's no question that I've got to work as long as I possibly can,'' he said. ''I don't make any secret of the fact that my aim is to maintain full-time employment until I am 69.'' 
 He's likely to find many of his generation working right alongsidehim.

HEADLINE: A Hamstrung Market Fights Global Warming

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
IN ''The Day After Tomorrow,'' the disaster movie, millions die while politicians and scientists squabble about global warming.
 Real life, of course, is a bit more complicated. For more than a decade, there has been a fierce international debate over how to curb the buildup of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. While the environmental results of the dispute may not be clear for years, some economic consequences are already apparent. 
 On one side of the argument is the United States government, which opposes mandatory caps on emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. On the other are more than 100 nations, including most of the developed world, that have signed the treaty known as the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto signatories have agreed that developed nations will cut greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 to a level 5.2 percent below the total in 1990. To reach that goal, each nation is expected to establish caps on its various polluters, caps that add up to the requisite cuts.
 The Bush administration rejects this approach, arguing that mandatory caps and big cuts in emissions may damage the economy. Instead, it has set a more modest goal: slowing the growth rate of emissions. It proposes to do that by subsidizing new technology and by encouraging voluntary programs in private industry.
 The chasm between the two approaches appears to be having an unintended effect. It may be undermining the development of what all sides agree is one of the most effective available tools for reducing pollutants in the atmosphere: the trading of pollution allowances. Use of that tool, strongly advocated by the United States during the Kyoto negotiations, is embodied in the Kyoto agreement.
 In the United States, trading in pollution allowances has already helped reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, the main contributor to acid rain, and has helped speed up the elimination of ozone-depleting chemicals. The principle behind it is simple: if a utility, for example, finds that it would cost $1 million for equipment to meet government standards for sulfur dioxide emissions, it has two choices: buy the equipment, or buy a pollution allowance from a company that has already cut emissions by more than the standards require. 
 The trading has helped clarify which companies can cut emissions the most for the dollars they invest, and has given efficient companies an incentive to get started. 
 But successful trading has been confined to a handful of pollutants emitted by a relatively small number of businesses that must comply with specific emissions caps set by the government. Most policy experts are dubious that such trading can solve a global problem affecting a wide range of gases and industries, particularly if the United States, the world's largest emitter of such gases, refuses to set any caps.
 ''From an economic view, emissions aren't a true market,'' said Peter Fusaro, chairman of Global Change Associates, an energy and environmental risk consulting service. Without regulated caps, and penalties for failure to comply, companies have no way to know what an investment in curbing them is worth, according to Mr. Fusaro and other experts.
 Some trading in emissions allowances for greenhouse gases has begun anyway. While the Kyoto Protocol isn't binding on its signers -- it won't become so unless Russia makes good on President Vladimir V. Putin's pledge that his nation will join -- the European Union has already adopted an emissions program that complies with the treaty's terms. In Europe, trading has started in the emissions allowances issued by European Union members, and in credits given for projects that cut emissions. 
 In the United States, California and states in the Northeast are moving to impose regulations that may fill the void in emission caps left by the Bush administration. In the meantime, a group called the Chicago Climate Exchange has been formed to pursue a private approach to trading in emissions allowances, and the Bush administration has endorsed its efforts. Led by members like American Electric Power, DuPont, International Paper and Ford Motor, the exchange created a framework defining how to measure, report and audit emissions and credits for cutting them. 
 Each participating company agreed to cut emissions 1 percent annually for four years, starting last year, either through its own projects or by buying credits for cuts made by others. They began trading in December. The exchange calls itself a pilot program and says its goal is to explore trading in greenhouse gases, not to set itself up as the arbiter of which cuts are needed to combat global warming.
 SO far, the results suggest that businesses and investors do not see the makings of a serious market in this voluntary approach. How can one tell? Even though trading is thin everywhere, prices are far higher in Europe, where government-mandated emissions caps begin taking effect next year.
 At the Chicago prices, the signal from the market is that only the most minimal investments make economic sense. 
 Some environmental advocates say opposition from the Bush administration to emissions caps has heartened companies that are trying to roll back the emissions limits in Europe. In this view, prices have declined in Europe this year because of market fears that European policy makers will retreat, reducing the incentive for companies to invest in emissions cuts.
 This may not be a disaster, but it is hardly a recipe for reducing the risk of global warming.

HEADLINE: The Damage May Be Done On Interest-Rate Policy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 The investment strategist James W. Paulsen is absolutely correct to question the Federal Reserve Board's interest-rate policy (''Will the Fed's Slow-Mo Approach Backfire?'' Gretchen Morgenson, May 30). But at this point, whether the Fed raises rates gently or aggressively is likely to be moot in the long run.
 The virtually free-money environment promoted by past policies will probably lead to an implosion of the mountain of debt which they unhealthily created. While there may be a brief inflationary spike initially as a result of the Fed's largess, ultimately the American economy has a very good chance of entering a deflationary recession with an attendant liquidity trap.
 The question to be asked is: What will happen at the Fed's next liquidity party, when no one shows up to borrow anything?

HEADLINE: Proposed Millionaire's Tax Could Drive Out Millionaires 

BYLINE: By John Sullivan

 BODY:
Watch out for Land Rovers speeding for the border if Governor McGreevey gets his millionaire's tax. Or so says an economics professor at the Wharton School, who warns that if the governor picks on rich people, the rich people may pick up and leave. 
 "This is a really bad idea," said the professor, Robert Inman. ''The increase in the top tax rate falls proportionately harder on the more successful of the state's entrepreneurs and CEO's, and these are the individuals who make the decisions for the relocation of firms.''
 Professor Inman, who spoke at the State House last Wednesday in a forum sponsored by the Center for Policy Research of New Jersey, a nonprofit research organization, said the governor's plan to raise the state income tax for people earning more than $500,000 a year could stifle growth as the economy rebounds, mainly by discouraging executives who may be considering moving their companies to New Jersey.
 ''There is always somebody sitting on the fence for whom tax increases could mean the difference,'' he said later in an interview.
 But Micah Rasmussen, the governor's press secretary, said budget analysts had already studied tax rates in neighboring states and determined that New Jersey would remain competitive -- even with an increase. 
 And anyway, Mr. Rasmussen said, the new tax was a short-term solution and that the governor was working on more substantial changes to the tax code that could be worked out at a proposed constitutional convention.
 ''It is not like we did not look at New York or Pennsylvania before we made this proposal,'' he said. John Sullivan

HEADLINE: Ladies and Gentlemen, Start Your Engines

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ. 
JOHN SCHWARTZ reports on science and technology for The Times.

 BODY:
KRISTEN McGILLIVRAY is ready for adventure this summer -- so long as it doesn't cost too much. Ms. McGillivray was, until recently, in the human resources department at an Internet company, LookSmart, in San Francisco. Now laid off, she has decided to use part of her severance package to take the kind of vacation that she might have denied herself during her years on the job.
 Since she is single and has no children, she says she is free to use the severance, and the time, for fun and reflection. ''I'm going to have some time to go and explore for a little while before deciding on the next step for my career.''
 Having said that, she is not planning to follow her first inclination and head to Europe, because ''things are looking a little pricey these days,'' she said. Instead, she will head for Australia, where she has friends who will put her up and show her around. Despite the high air fare, she said, ''It would be a cheaper vacation than I would have if I had to pay for hotels and rental cars.'' 
 Thus begins the summer of the adventurous penny pinchers, said Henry Harteveldt, who watches the travel industry at Forrester Research, a market research company. ''We're going to see a lot of people clamoring to travel, and they're going to pay as little as they possibly can,'' he said.
 That will make international travel especially challenging, with exchange rates going strongly against the dollar, he said. ''It's no fun to go to Europe when you're shelling out 12 bucks for a pot of tea,'' he said.
 But people want to go somewhere. Anywhere. 
 After suffering through economic blahs and uncertainty around the world since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the lingering fretfulness surrounding the Iraq war last year, Americans are eager to travel this summer, said Cathy Keefe, a spokeswoman for the Travel Industry Association of America. ''Summer travel is going to be up a substantial amount,'' she said. According to her group's surveys, travelers expect to spend 4.4 percent more on summer vacations this year than last year. Travelers, she said, will spend just over $1,100 total on their longest trip this summer, an average of 7.6 nights away from home, a bit lower than last year. ''This year will be the first since 2000 that we're going to see increases in every travel category,'' including inbound and outbound tourism and overall spending, she said.
 America's national and regional parks are feeling the beginnings of a boom, said Bruce Fears, president of Delaware North Companies Parks & Resorts, a company that runs restaurants and hotels at Kennedy Space Center, Yosemite and other major locations. ''Last year we really took a beating'' in part because of war jitters, he said, but this year the company has seen a 10 percent increase in sales ''pretty much across the country,'' adding that it was ''the first time since 9/11 that we've been up in every spot.''
 Melissa Derry, a travel expert with Expedia.com, said her company's sales figures show big increases for leisure trips over last year, with travel bookings for the parent company, InterActive Corporation, up 51 percent in the first quarter of 2004 over the same quarter a year before.
 ''The travel rebound is huge,'' she said. ''People feel better about the economy, so they're more willing to take off and spend a little money,'' she said.
 For many travelers, it seems, the point is not extravagance but a sense of discovery. This year, Dr. Marcia Angell feels like hitting the road. So she is kicking off her summer with a cross-country drive with her partner, Dr. Arnold S. Relman. They could go anywhere -- both Dr. Angell and Dr. Relman are former editors of the New England Journal of Medicine and now teach at Harvard Medical School. They have been all over the world, and Dr. Angell jokes that Dr. Relman is ''the sort of person who thinks that all vacations must be London or Paris.'' 
 This year, she recalled, ''I said, 'This is your country -- you should see it.''' 
 Yes, the song of the open road is less sweet at more than $2 for a gallon of gas, conceded Ms. Keefe of the travel association. Still, 86 percent of summer travelers in the United States are expected to drive to their destinations, and on the 700- to 800-mile round trip that is typical every year for summer travel, the gas price increase will add about $30, she said. ''Nobody is going to cancel a trip because of $20 to $30 extra,'' she said, though she added that some families ''may take a more economical car than their Lincoln Navigator.'' 
 According to the association's projections, 77 percent of vacationers will visit friends and relatives over the summer, 73 percent will go to a beach or a lake, and 65 percent will head to small towns or rural areas to kick back in peace.
 Other travel costs will also take a bite, Ms. Keefe said, with air fares, hotel rates and entertainment up about 8 percent overall within the United States since December.
 Despite the best intentions of travelers to be frugal, the spike in demand means that bargains will be harder to come by than in recent summers, Ms. Keefe said. ''Consumers are continuing to wait till the last minute to make their plans, and this is not the summer to do that,'' she said, because the best fares will go quickly. ''If you find what you think is a great deal, book it. Don't wait and expect the price to go down.''
 The increased demand has squeezed air fares upward, said Tom Parsons, the chief executive of BestFares.com. The move by many airlines to smaller airplanes means that there are fewer seats available, and fewer cheap seats available, than in the past. That translates into higher prices, he said, citing recent fare jumps between Baltimore and San Diego. In January and occasionally since then, round trips could be had for $189, he said, but these days, the fares more commonly bounce between $318 and $400. ''If you want to get the refinance-your-home air fare, no problem -- they've got those seats,'' he said. ''If you bought early, you'd have gotten a two-for-one-sale.''
 The signs of wanderlust show up in the numbers from the travel industry. Recreational vehicle sales are booming, said Amy Shelton, a spokeswoman for the Recreational Vehicle Industry Association of America, with sales up 19 percent for the first quarter over the same period in 2003. In the first quarter, nearly 321,000 recreational vehicles were shipped to sellers by manufacturers -- $12 billion worth, and close to the 25-year high for shipments, in 1999.
 For those still planning their trips, Mr. Harteveldt recommends a close look at package deals, which he called ''a very good way for the traveler to hedge his bet.''
 Ms. Derry of Expedia agreed. ''That's really going to be the best way for customers to save money this summer and beyond,'' she said, because travel companies like hotel chains prefer to offer discounts under the cloak of a package so that full-fare guests don't see -- and get angry about -- the amount of the discount others are getting. ''They are willing to provide us with discounts that customers do not see. That way those guys aren't cannibalizing their existing channels.''
 Corprew Reed, a software engineer in Seattle, said that he was doing his usual handful of summer trips this year, but less extravagantly than he did during the go-go days. Mr. Reed, 33 years old, said that he would attend a family wedding in New York and would make his annual pilgrimage to the Burning Man festival in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada. There is also a run down to San Francisco to see friends who try to get together now and then, sometimes in exotic locations. Not this year. ''Typically, the trips might be bigger,'' he said. ''This year I'm likelier to go to a large group of friends where everyone is getting together,'' rather than make trips to more far-flung places.
 ''It's partially the economy, it's partially that it's harder to get the cheap tickets and travel conveniently when you've got work,'' he said. 
 All but 3 percent of summer vacation travel is domestic, according to the federal Bureau of Transportation Statistics, and many Americans tend to shy away from trouble spots. But not Eric and Suzanne Pilsk, he a lawyer and she a librarian, who live in the suburbs of Washington, who are going to Israel and to Peru this summer. And, like 38 percent of summer travelers, they will take the kids, ages 8 and 14, along. Their friends, they say, are aghast. ''We're going to Israel, where there is a lot of shooting and blowing up,'' said Ms. Pilsk, ''and we're going to Lima, where there was a mudslide, and we're hoping that that will be cleared up before we get there.''
 THE Israel trip is built around attending a relative's bat mitzvah, and will include a tour of the country. The Peruvian trip is to attend the wedding of a family friend. ''We really adore his fiancee, and he said, 'The wedding will be in Lima,' and we said, 'O.K., we're there.'''
 Ms. Pilsk said they never thought twice about attending either event, or about taking their two children. ''We spin it to the relatives who look at us cross-eyed and the friends who ask, 'Are you sure?' by saying, 'We can't miss these events. They mean too much for us.'''
 For her part, Dr. Angell said that she and Dr. Relman were not motivated in their cross-country trip by concerns about the possible risk of travel abroad. ''This is our first choice and not our second choice,'' she said. ''We're drawn to the West.'' 
 Indeed, while Americans might have let security fears curb their travel plans in previous years, they have given themselves permission to take to the skies and the road again, said Mr. Harteveldt of Forrester. ''We've all learned to process the insanity of the geopolitics,'' he said. ''They've learned to put that into perspective, which is on the one hand, commendable -- and on the other, a sad reflection on the world we live in.''
 The potential for terrorist attack is statistically slight, but will not go away, Mr. Harteveldt said. Still, ''We've learned to live in the world we've been given. ''The biggest threat to Americans going abroad right now,'' he said, ''is the weakness of the dollar.''

HEADLINE: Sex, Art and Videotape

BYLINE: By Guy Trebay. 
Guy Trebay is a reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
' My first thought was, If I'm going to have to sell it, I might as well sell it,'' the artist Andrea Fraser said last week, speaking from a downtown studio. Fraser was referring in a starkly literal sense to her work's medium: a fit 38-year-old brunette in a sexy red V-necked dress, who is in fact herself.
 Fraser's videotape ''Untitled'' (2003) was scheduled to go on view at the Friedrich Petzel Gallery in Chelsea on June 10. In it, the artist is seen having sex in what some have characterized coyly as ''every imaginable position,'' with an unidentified American collector who paid close to $20,000 to participate in this curious 60-minute work of art. 
 As ''Untitled'' begins, Fraser enters a hotel room, her hair swept fetchingly to one side. The setting is standard-issue Hip Hotel: the videotape was filmed, using a single overhead camera, in a room Fraser identified as being at the Royalton Hotel in Manhattan, owned by Ian Schrager. The artist is carrying two glasses, white wine in her left hand and what looks like a highball in her right. The collector enters, and then begins a filmed seduction whose detailed contractual terms were worked out in advance by the artist's gallery. Among the requirements for participation in ''Untitled'' were that the artist's potential collaborator be heterosexual, unmarried and, of course, willing to underwrite the transaction. ''All of my work is about what we want from art, what collectors want, what artists want from collectors, what museum audiences want,'' Fraser explained. ''By that, I mean what we want not only economically, but in more personal, psychological and affective terms.'' 
 It would be easy to conclude that Fraser's intellectual apparatus might have cooled the ardor of the most passionate suitor. That it did not may say less about Fraser's persuasiveness than about the seductive spell that contemporary art-making seems to cast. 
 For Fraser, ''Untitled'' was, she explained, ''not a literalization of what is, in fact, a very old metaphor, that selling art is prostitution,'' a point that was made with pithy precision by Baudelaire. ''This is not 'Indecent Proposal,''' Fraser added quickly. And it is not -- or not quite.
 In Adrian Lyne's notorious (and highly successful) stinker about a billionaire (Robert Redford) who pays for a night with someone else's wife (Demi Moore), Moore says to Redford, ''You can't buy people.'' He replies: ''That's a bit naive, Diana. I buy people all the time.'' 
 There may be some Demi Moore naivete operating in Fraser's work, peering from behind the verbiage of a brand of thinking known as ''institutional critique.'' ''Andrea's work has been about exposing the mechanism of the whole art system,'' explained Dan Cameron, senior curator at the New Museum. ''In this case, she's playing a little bit with what the act really is that takes place between an artist and a collector. It underscores the paradox of ownership and pushes it into a realm that hasn't been so pointed before.'' That may be. But when Fraser remarked that she wanted the transaction underpinning ''Untitled'' to be ''normal to the extent that it could be,'' she was perhaps forgetting that, in any number of ways, it already is. Article 230 of the New York State penal code refers, quite straightforwardly, to the sort of exchange ''Untitled'' immortalizes as prostitution. It is safe to assume that transactions just like it are taking place this very minute in hotel rooms around the world. But those enterprises, unlike Fraser's, lack the frisson of what the art press tends reflexively to call ''transgressive.'' 
 Far from being the first artist to use her body as a medium for producing art or polemics, Fraser is one in a long -- if not in every case distinguished -- line of provocateurs. Back in the 1970's, Carolee Schneemann pulled a paper scroll out of her vagina at a performance, and Hannah Wilke adorned her body with sculptural multiples of vulvas cast in hardened chewing gum. A decade later, the performance artist Karen Finley smeared her naked torso with chocolate syrup and publicly performed acts -- using a yam -- that are not advisable to mention in these pages. For many years, Annie Sprinkle, a sex worker turned artist, gave performances at which she invited members of the audience to examine her cervix through a speculum.
 Stunts designed to set art-world sensibilities aquiver are practically a rite of career passage. Who can forget the stir caused when a buffed-up Jeff Koons transformed sexual acrobatics with his wife at the time, the Italian porn actress Cicciolina, into a highly lucrative series of glass sculptures and photographs? Or when the godfather of transgression, Vito Acconci, in his legendary ''Seedbed, 1972,'' secreted himself naked beneath a ramp on the floor of the Sonnabend Gallery in SoHo, muttering obscenities as he . . . well, never mind.
 You might have imagined that most people would be inured by now to shock art and accustomed to the notion that works like ''Untitled'' are no more morally challenging than an average episode of ''Temptation Island.'' But you would be wrong. As soon as Fraser's show was announced, the tabloids went on high alert. ''Talk about interactive art,'' huffed the lead item in The Daily News's gossip column, later putting the word artwork in scare quotes, lest anyone miss the point.
 The oddest thing about all this is that Fraser is both a savvy and a fairly well regarded artist. (A midcareer retrospective of her work, organized by the Kunstverein in Hamburg in the fall of 2003, is currently on view at the Dunkers Kulturhus in Helsingborg, Sweden.) What's more, she has demonstrated a certain knack for skewering the foibles of the contemporary art world in her pieces, mostly videotapes of performances that hilariously depict her lampooning the bloated lingo of much art critique; the egomaniacal ravings of artists who believe their own fawning press; and the orgiastic cult of museum worshipers.
 In her 2001 video, ''Official Welcome,'' taped at a private collector's house, Fraser delivered a monologue that mimicked, as one critic noted, ''the banal comments and effusive words of praise uttered by presenters'' during gatherings intended to introduce avant-garde artists to wealthy patrons. Then she gradually stripped to her Gucci thong and high heels and portentously announced: ''I am not a person today. I'm an object in an artwork.'' Any resemblance to persons living and working under the name Vanessa Beecroft -- who once posed numerous models, some in thongs and Gucci stilettos, some in nothing at all, in the atrium of the Guggenheim in New York -- was altogether intentional.
 ''This is one of the most complicated pieces I've ever done,'' Fraser confessed to me, laying out her considerable fears for the anonymous collector -- that his reputation might be damaged, his feelings hurt, his identity exposed. If Fraser's emotional engagement tends to compromise a project based on satire and debunking, it also calls up another, older sort of story -- that of the hooker with the heart of gold.

HEADLINE: A Former Big-Leaguer Displays a Quiet Kind of Courage

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SOKOLOVE. 
Michael Sokolove is the author of ''The Ticket Out: Darryl Strawberry and the Boys of Crenshaw'' (Simon & Schuster, 2004).

 BODY:
You have to pay only a little attention to pro sports to grasp its model of American manliness, one that is heavy on aggression, physical toughness and verbal posturing. On nearly any football telecast, you'll hear that the game will be ''won in the trenches'' by the venerated gladiators of the offensive and defensive lines. Basketball, once a game of elegance and grace, has become a contest of blunt force, with muscled-up players administering ''hard fouls'' to anyone who dares take the ball all the way to the hoop. 
 Even misbehavior is explained in terms of one's masculinity. When you hear an athlete say that he just had to respond ''as a man,'' you can be pretty sure he has just done something really stupid -- like choke his coach. 
 I have been thinking about all of this as I reflect on my friend Chris Brown, who is driving a fuel truck in Iraq for the private contractor Halliburton. Brown played major league baseball for the Giants, the Padres and the Tigers. If you followed his all-too-brief career, you might remember that he did not score well on the sports scale of manliness -- the public was made to understand that he was something of a wimp, a soft competitor who wouldn't play hurt.
 Without a doubt, Brown had huge talent. At Crenshaw High School in Los Angeles in the late 1970's, he was a teammate of Darryl Strawberry, and every player from that team believed that Brown was the superior player. A third baseman with soft hands, a rifle arm and home run power at the plate, he was a gifted athlete. The scout who signed him, George Genovese, said Brown's all-around baseball skills reminded him of the Hall of Fame third baseman George Brett.
 Just two years after Brown made it to the San Francisco Giants in 1984, he played in the 1986 All-Star Game in Houston. But later that season, the troubles began. His shoulder hurt, and he began to sit out some games even as doctors could not immediately pinpoint the injury. Team management hinted that Brown was malingering, and the news media and the fans turned against him. After the season, he needed surgery. When Brown reported to spring training the next season, he figured that people would understand that the noted sports orthopedist Frank Jobe would not have cut into him if he had not had a real injury. He actually thought that management and writers might apologize, which he knows now was naive. ''You get that label,'' Brown says, ''and you can't get rid of it.''
 He was traded to the San Diego Padres, but his reputation followed him. After missing a game with an eye infection, his manager told the press that Brown had ''slept on his eye wrong.'' Everyone had a good laugh about that. A toothache was termed a ''bruised tooth.'' One newspaper called him Chris (Downtime) Brown, and he was out of baseball by age 28.
 I met Brown more than a decade later while researching a book on his high school team. The person I came to know was solid, thoughtful, dutiful -- a man, in some traditional sense. He and his wife, Lisa, and their two children were living in Missouri City, Tex., outside of Houston. Weekday mornings, he rose at dawn, gathered his hard hat and lunch pail, and set off to his job operating a huge crane at a power plant. He had settled into an after-work routine -- he came right home, bathed and changed, then took a long walk around the neighborhood with his children. 
 ''I try not to talk too much,'' he said, ''so I can hear about how their day was.'' 
 Brown had made good money in baseball, close to a million dollars, but not enough to be set for life. (And much of what he did make went to taxes, his agent and his family in need back in Los Angeles.) ''I been in poverty,'' he said, ''and I ain't ever going back.''
 I knew that Brown respected money. He has a competitive, tangled relationship with his old friend Strawberry, but with all that Darryl has been through, the thing that rankles Chris the most is that his old high school teammate blew through career earnings of close to $30 million.
 So when I got a call a few weeks ago with the deep voice saying, ''Mike, this is Chris; I'm in Iraq,'' I was certainly shocked, but on some level, I understood. The local economy had slowed, and Brown, without a lot of seniority, had lost his job operating the crane. He would not tell me his Halliburton salary, saying only that it was lucrative. 
 In Iraq, Brown is comforted by his deep Christian faith. ''The Lord has my back,'' he said. ''I just have to try to not do anything to make him mad at me.''
 But there has been danger, plenty of it. One day he was driving his 18-wheeler, hauling diesel fuel from a depot to a military base, when his long fuel convoy drove into a sandstorm. When the sand lifted, Brown was alone and spotted a man in a face mask off to the side of the road, pointing an AK-47 at him. He swerved, and a bullet pierced his windshield. In April he was about a mile behind a convoy that was ambushed; seven Halliburton drivers and security guards disappeared in the attack.
 Brown's one-year contract is up in September, and although he is lonely and many of his co-workers have gone home early, he will not. He calls home to talk to his wife and children. He looks at digital pictures on e-mail messages, ''so I can see the expression on my kids' faces, and how they're growing.'' 
 A few of his co-workers know he played pro baseball, that he hit a double in the 1986 All-Star Game, but he never talks about it unless asked. ''I'm not ashamed of it,'' he said, ''but if I were to raise it, I would look at it as bragging on myself.''
 I asked him if, based on his reputation in pro sports, going to Iraq was in any way an effort to prove something to others. Or to himself. ''I know who I am,'' he said. ''I would never do nothing to prove myself to anybody. I'm here providing for my family and for our future. Isn't that what a man's supposed to do?''

HEADLINE: Market Welcomes Good News on Profits

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
Bolstered by strong profit reports, the stock market rose in its four days of trading last week, despite the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates later this month.
 Markets were closed on Friday in observance of Ronald Reagan's funeral. 
 By the end of trading on Thursday, all three major market indexes were up for the week. The Dow Jones industrials gained 167.28 points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 10,410.10. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 13.97 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,136.47. The Nasdaq composite climbed 21.25 points, or 1.1 percent, to 1,999.87.
 FedEx had quarterly profits that beat expectations and gained 3.7 percent for the week. Electronic Data Systems rose 9.1 percent on upbeat profit projections. 
 Department store chains rose after May Department Stores agreed to pay $3.24 billion to buy Marshall Field's from Target, a price that caused some analysts to revalue competing companies upward. The biggest gainers in the S.&P. 500 were Dillard's, up 16.9 percent, and Sears, up 9.2 percent. 
 The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.82 percent from 4.77 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Why America Sees the Silver Lining

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

 BODY:
IN the rolling tributes to Ronald Reagan last week, a question lingered: why was he revered by not only those who had fared well in his America, but by many who had not. 
 One answer, no doubt, lies in a conviction that runs throughout American history. It is the faith that we are all on the verge of joining the favored class ourselves. In a 2003 book, ''Something For Nothing: Luck in America,'' the cultural historian Jackson Lears wrote that two archetypes have defined America's sense of destiny. One is the self-made man (rarely woman), who believes he will get rich through his own hard work. The other is the gambler, who believes that with the next turn of the cards, providence will deliver the Main Chance. 
 The first, of course, provides one of America's official scripts, the stories Americans tell about themselves. In a global poll conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2002, 65 percent of Americans said their success depended on forces within their control, more than double the percentage in old world countries like Italy and Germany, and triple that of India, Turkey or Pakistan. 
 But it was a mark of Mr. Reagan's optimism that it tapped the idealistic in both types. Though we often think of the hard worker as rational and the gambler as deluded, both involve a characteristically American leap of faith. 
 ''Americans have always had a stronger belief in the ability of the individual than reality would support,'' said Alan Brinkley, a professor of history at Columbia University. ''The key is the idea of social mobility, the Horatio Alger vision. There's enough truth to that idea for it to survive, but never as much social mobility as the myth suggests.'' 
 Mr. Reagan's optimism was itself a paradox, a message neatly borrowed from liberalism, said Steven F. Hayward, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and the author of ''The Age of Reagan: The Fall of the Old Liberal Order 1964-1980.'' 
 ''He said, 'Big government is a bad thing, get rid of it,''' Mr. Hayward said. ''But he also said, 'This country is great, we can fix it.''' Many conservatives only get the first part, he said, but miss the optimism of the second. ''It could only be a former liberal Democrat who understood that,'' Mr. Hayward said, because ''liberalism is always an optimistic creed.''
 The faith that the poor are just rich people whose time has not yet come harbors a founding American contradiction, said Bruce J. Schulman, a professor of history and American studies at Boston University. 
 ''That optimism is related to two oddly contradictory but, in America, somehow complementary values of liberty and equality,'' Mr. Schulman said. ''As critical thinkers, we can see how liberty and equality are sometimes conflicting values. But in America we somehow balance the sense that everyone is at root pretty much the same, with the potential to make it big, and the sense of having liberties, not being in fixed hierarchies that hold you in place, whether these are class, state or church.'' 
 This optimism is not easily shaken. In 2002, shortly after the dot-com flameout and the terrorist attacks of the previous September, 81 percent of American college students said they would be richer than their parents, and 59 percent said that they would become millionaires, according to a poll conducted by Ernst & Young.
 To some extent, American optimism is an accident of timing. The nation arose at the same time as the Enlightenment, noted Kevin Starr, a professor of history at the University of Southern California. Our history, he said, exists as a ''a dialogue between the Enlightenment faith in progress and the Puritan heritage, or Anglo-Protestant legacy, that there is evil in the world and people do fall from grace.'' 
 In both varieties, this optimism took shape in the nation's westward expansion, said Stanley Fish, the departing dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois at Chicago. 
 ''It's built on the premise of progress, that the next horizon will open on the perfect valley or grazing land,'' Mr. Fish said. While Europeans sought to protect their boundaries, Americans saw their destiny in endless expansion. 
 ''If you watch Western movies,'' he said, ''you know the power of that mythic moment when the camera pans over that landscape that the audience feels like it is discovering for the first time.''
 If paradise is not over the next hill, he added, then it is over the one after that.
 This optimism also belongs to the nation's population of immigrants, who are both consumers and producers of the myth.
 America is ''addicted to a sense of new beginnings,'' said Gregory Rodriguez, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation, a policy institute in Washington. 
 ''We're not really a mature culture, and newcomers are an integral part of this process of becoming,'' he said. ''Someone can tell us it's morning in America, and we seem to need that to go forward. Stagnation is the worst thing that can happen.''
 For immigrants, especially those on the lowest rungs of the economic ladder, optimism functions as a consolation for what they have had to leave behind. ''Even if the dream didn't pay off, the optimism is that which seems to make it all worthwhile,'' Mr. Rodriguez said. ''It is a sine qua non for survival.''
 American religion has fed into this sense of providence, said Martin E. Marty, professor emeritus at the University of Chicago Divinity School. 
 ''Jonathan Edwards was a cosmic optimist, declaring that God's latter day glory will begin in the west, not the east,'' Mr. Marty said, referring to the 18th century theologian. 
 The Disciples of Christ movement, in which Mr. Reagan was steeped, arose in the 19th century as a particularly optimistic movement that sought to tear down denominational distinctions to create a purer faith, Mr. Marty said. The nation's progress was taken as a sign of divine manifest destiny. 
 In the early 20th century, evangelical Protestants like Dwight Moody, reacting to modernism and urban decay, flipped this message, preaching salvation for individuals while declaring society at the Biblical end times.
 But even this ''pre-millennial'' eschatology, which is rare in Europe but now predominant in America, was marked by exuberance, Mr. Marty said. ''It was the idea that America is in decline, but don't worry about yourself because you will be saved, or raptured. You can trace that exuberance back to Moody, a shoe salesman.'' 
 But where this optimism bred initiative on the frontier, it can simply be escapist in a modern consumer culture, said Mark Crispin Miller, a professor of media studies at New York University.
 ''There's an important difference between rugged optimism that is willing to take tremendous risks for the sake of a just and free society and mere fantasies of endless conquest and continuous victory,'' Mr. Miller said. 
 The juxtaposition of individual providence and collective decline has shaped America's signature cultural forms, from the blues to the Western. It unites the frontier huckster with the Internet entrepreneur, the ad executive with the indefatigable sports believer.
 As Mr. Fish said, deep down, ''We're all Cubs fans.''

HEADLINE: The Netherworld of Nonproliferation

BYLINE: By James Traub. 
James Traub, a contributing writer for the magazine, is the author of ''The Devil's Playground: A Century of Pleasure and Profit in Times Square.''

 BODY:
President Dwight D. Eisenhower saw nothing even remotely paradoxical about the expression ''Atoms for Peace'' when he delivered a speech of that name to the United Nations General Assembly on Dec. 8, 1953. Eisenhower had come to disclose ''a new conception'': that ''if the fearful trend of atomic military buildup can be reversed, this greatest of destructive forces can be developed into a great boon.'' Atomic energy could be applied to ''agriculture, medicine and other peaceful activities'' and ''provide abundant electrical energy in the power-starved areas of the world.'' This speech led directly to the establishment of the International Atomic Energy Agency, under the aegis of the United Nations, and, 15 years later, to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Both were founded on a grand bargain: countries that agreed to place their nuclear programs under a system of international inspection and forgo the development of nuclear weapons (if they didn't already have them) would gain access to the expected atomic bounty. 
 Today the premise of that bargain seems almost quaint. Nuclear energy has never achieved anything like the World of Tomorrow promise it enjoyed half a century ago; meanwhile, the world feels menaced by the threat of nuclear weaponry in a way unimaginable in Eisenhower's day. Authoritarian and, even worse, potentially unstable states like Pakistan and North Korea have opted out of the nonproliferation system in order to develop a bomb; terrorist groups seek weapons of mass destruction; and a global black market delivers nuclear fuel, equipment and weapons designs to states that aspire to join the nuclear club. The United States has already fought what may be thought of as the first war of counterproliferation; the fact that Iraq turned out not to possess weapons of mass destruction shows, among other things, how extraordinarily difficult it is to gain certain knowledge of an adversary's nuclear capacities.
 Tomorrow the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency will meet, and the principal item on the agenda will be, as it has been for the last year, Iran's nuclear program. The Bush administration is convinced that Iran is secretly trying to build a bomb. The Iranian officials I spoke with in a visit to Tehran last month insist that they are merely trying to improve their ''energy mix'' by adding nuclear power to their abundant oil supplies. But even in the unlikely event that that is so, an Iran capable of producing weapons-grade uranium is plainly unacceptable, not only to the Bush administration but also to its chief allies. What is not at all clear is how to make the Iranians surrender that capacity.
 The nuclear bargain has become hopelessly one-sided, and the instruments created to sustain that bargain seem unequal to the task. Bush administration officials describe the current impasse over Iran as a test that the international community, and specifically the I.A.E.A., is failing. Even the I.A.E.A.'s director general, Mohamed ElBaradei, says that the entire nonproliferation system is in danger of collapse, though he would include American bellicosity among the forces that are endangering it. President Bush and ElBaradei, along with a wide range of scientists and policy makers, have proposed a variety of designs for a new and much more comprehensive nonproliferation system. Whether a new network of laws and institutions can plug the holes faster than terrorists, brokers, freelancing scientists and rogue states can fill them is an open question.
The bargain at the heart of Atoms for Peace made the I.A.E.A. a very conflicted agency from the start. It was responsible for developing peaceful uses of nuclear energy and ensuring the safe handling of nuclear materials, but also for monitoring the facilities and stockpiles of the world's nuclear powers. Even today, the curving halls of the agency's circular headquarters building in the urban hinterland beyond Vienna's Ringstrasse are lined with the offices of scientists working out nuclear applications for seed development and medical imaging. Until the last decade, nuclear verification routinely gave way before the demands of nuclear promotion. Inspectors were to serve as accountants, not policemen. Over the years, they logged countless hours earnestly cross-checking the statements of harmless countries like Canada and Sweden. As ElBaradei put it, ''Inspections were often Mickey Mouse.''
 It was an almost invisible organization until the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war, when it discovered that Iraq had advanced its nuclear weapons program beyond the gaze of inspectors and under the noses of the world's intelligence services. This past March, when I was at I.A.E.A. headquarters in Vienna, I went to the office of Olli Heinonen, the agency's head of verification for the Middle East and much of Asia, and he showed me an aerial photograph of Iraq's Tuwaitha complex taken after it was bombed in 1991. In the years before the war, Heinonen explained, the Iraqis would lead inspectors on a mazelike journey through the one-kilometer-square complex and then deposit them at an innocuous building. And every year the I.A.E.A. gave Iraq a clean bill of health. After the war inspectors returned to Tuwaitha with a license to roam at will. Heinonen pointed to the map and said: ''The building next to that is where they did the centrifuge testing. This is where they first separated plutonium. Here in these two buildings they did the electromagnetic separation.'' And so on. 
 I asked Richard Hooper, who conducted inspections in Iraq from 1991 to 1993, if the inspectors couldn't have demanded to see a neighboring facility before the war, and he said, ''The Iraqis would have just refused.'' Visits were governed by elaborate agreements and subagreements that stipulated exactly where, when and how inspectors could operate. The agency could have invoked its power of ''special inspections,'' but this would have constituted an act of confrontation wholly foreign to the I.A.E.A.'s nature. 
 The I.A.E.A. had no intelligence-gathering capacity of its own, and the 35-nation board of governors was reluctant to let the agency use data gathered by national intelligence services. This changed in 1993, when inspectors in North Korea scrutinized a fuel-reprocessing plant designed to recover plutonium. Tests showed that the North Koreans had produced plutonium more frequently than they declared. Inspectors were at a loss to explain the discrepancy until the Clinton administration made available to Hans Blix, then the I.A.E.A.'s director, a series of satellite photos that showed, first, a waste-storage facility, then a row of trees tall enough to screen the facility from the road to the reprocessing plant, then finally a patch of fresh sod where the facility had been buried.
 Blix showed the pictures to the board of governors to support his request for a special inspection. As Richard Hooper recalls: ''Blix arranged to show the photographs in the boardroom. The board members were literally stunned into silence.'' The North Korean delegates ''sat there with their mouths open -- but not for long. They walked out, and then they announced that they were withdrawing from the safeguards.''
 In some ways, North Korea's withdrawal was more mortifying to the I.A.E.A. than Iraq's duplicity had been. The agency had, for once, been successful in exposing a clandestine program -- and for that very reason, it lost control over the program. ElBaradei, who was then the I.A.E.A.'s chief legal official, says that the ensuing approach to the issue ''was really a model of how things should not be done.'' At the time, the North Koreans might have responded to harsh criticism from the United Nations Security Council, but the Chinese blocked any action. Looking for an alternative, the Clinton administration agreed in 1994 to help the North Koreans build up their nuclear-energy program in exchange for halting work on weapons. But the inspectors were no longer on hand to monitor compliance. As ElBaradei says, the North Koreans ''got five, six, seven years without inspections, and they managed to keep the spent fuel'' -- the plutonium -- ''as a Damocles sword.'' A nuclear-armed North Korea may now be a fait accompli. Worse yet, the North Koreans may already have gone into the proliferation business. Inspectors recently unearthed evidence that suggests that the country shipped two tons of uranium to Libya in 2001. 
 The agency never got a second chance in North Korea, but it did in Iraq. After the gulf war in 1991, when I.A.E.A. inspectors returned to Iraq as part of Unscom, the United Nations body whose chief responsibility was chemical and biological weapons, inspectors quickly found evidence of Iraq's secret weapons program not only in Tuwaitha but also across the country. Iraqi officials tried to frustrate the inspectors at every turn, and critics charged that agency officials were all too willing to climb down from confrontation -- proof of the institutional timidity that came of years of passive monitoring. Yet by the time Unscom left Iraq in late 1998, inspectors believed that they had discovered and eliminated virtually every vestige of Iraq's nuclear program. (They were subsequently proved right.)
 It was, of course, the run-up to the Iraq war last year that afforded the I.A.E.A. its first real taste of public notoriety. In November 2002, the Iraqis let inspectors return to search for weapons of mass destruction. It took only a few weeks for inspectors to realize that Iraq's technological capacity had, if anything, deteriorated since 1998. ''It was embarrassing when we came back,'' one of the inspectors told me recently. In his report to the Security Council on Jan. 27, 2003, ElBaradei said that his inspectors had, at that point, found no evidence of renewed activity, and he asked for a ''few months'' more as ''a valuable investment in peace.''
 This was, of course, precisely what the Bush administration did not want to hear. Vice President Dick Cheney said the previous September that he knew ''with absolute certainty'' that Saddam Hussein was actively seeking to purchase uranium-enrichment technology. President Bush had told the American people about ''high-strength aluminum tubes'' that Saddam was trying to acquire for his nuclear program, and about the uranium Saddam had sought to buy in Africa. (Secretary of State Colin Powell would repeat many of these claims in his speech to the Security Council in early February.) The I.A.E.A. investigated each one and found them baseless. The most flagrantly unsubstantiated, of course, was the tale of the uranium from Niger. It was Jacques Baute, a veteran I.A.E.A. inspector, who discovered that the underlying documents were fraudulent. This triggered an internal debate that spoke volumes about the agency's relationship to the Bush administration. Could they say ''forgeries,'' which is just what they were -- or would that provoke the administration? ElBaradei, ever the peacemaker, opted for ''not authentic.'' Nevertheless, Baute says, ''I feared that I was sending him to the front to be blown up.''
 The I.A.E.A. did come under full assault from the Bush administration. On March 16, 2003, days before the war began, Vice President Cheney said on ''Meet the Press'' that the I.A.E.A. had ''consistently underestimated or missed what it was Saddam Hussein was doing,'' though he did not elaborate on those supposed mistakes. The vice president added, ''I don't have any reason to believe they're any more valid this time than they've been in the past.'' There were public broadsides as well from Powell and from Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser. Some I.A.E.A. officials say that they had several very bad weeks in the spring of 2003, waiting to see if the U.S. military would find something they had missed. But nothing turned up. And then came vindication: in October, David Kay, a former I.A.E.A. official and longtime thorn in the agency's side whom the administration appointed to hunt for W.M.D. in Iraq, stated that he found no evidence of significant post-1998 nuclear activities. He also said that ''the inspectors in the early 1990's did a tremendous amount.'' 
 ElBaradei, who guards his feelings closely, does not admit to a sense either of resentment or of vindication. (Others in the agency freely admit to both.) He does, however, view the war in Iraq, like the current impasse in North Korea, as an instance of failed diplomacy. The Iraqis, he said, ''had been cheating the system for years'' and needed to be constantly challenged and confronted over their duplicity. At the same time, he added: ''We never gave the Iraqis the feeling that there was light at the end of the tunnel. They complained that it didn't matter what they did.'' ElBaradei said that he recognized that closing the nuclear file, or lifting some sanctions, might have affixed to Saddam's rule precisely the seal of approval that he sought. But he also argued (if not altogether convincingly) that doing so might have afforded Saddam an incentive to cooperate on his chemical and biological weapons programs. It is in ElBaradei's nature, as it is in the nature of Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations, to err on the side of engagement, and to acknowledge the interests and concerns of even the most odious interlocutor. At the end of a long conversation in his elegant apartment in Vienna, ElBaradei said: ''One of the supreme lessons you learn in life is compromise. And you have to compromise by putting yourself in the other person's shoes.''
Like Iraq in the 1980's, Iran through much of the 1990's received a clean bill of health from the I.A.E.A. Iran reported that it had only a ''limited nuclear program,'' and inspectors duly certified that it was so. American and foreign intelligence agencies felt certain that Iran was hiding something, but the agency, as one inspector put it to me, ''was sleeping on its ear.'' Then, in the summer of 2002, an Iranian resistance group disclosed the existence of several secret nuclear facilities, chief among them an enrichment plant in the town of Natanz. ElBaradei and a team of inspectors visited the compound the following February and discovered a highly sophisticated facility with an array of the centrifuges necessary for enriching uranium. 
 The Iranians claimed that Natanz was intended for civilian purposes; and since the exact same technology is used to make the low-enriched uranium required for a power plant and the highly enriched uranium required for a bomb, this was a plausible claim. But Iranian officials began to make matters much worse by lying about almost everything else. The inspectors immediately recognized that the centrifuges were a Pakistani variation on a Dutch design, known as the P1, but the Iranians insisted they had been domestically designed. The Iranians called Natanz a ''pilot plant,'' though plainly it was intended for large-scale enrichment. The Iranians said that they had never run uranium through the machines, though the inspectors later found evidence that they had. And this pattern of deceit, evasion, delay and literal-minded legalism continued for months.
 At the time, the Bush administration had its hands full with war in Iraq, and European diplomats seized the situation as an opportunity to affirm the virtues of diplomacy. In October of last year, the foreign ministers of England, France and Germany journeyed to Tehran, where they offered trade opportunities that Iran craved in exchange for a suspension of nuclear activities and a complete disclosure of the program. This surprising display of deference, possibly coupled with growing American threats to bring the matter before the Security Council, persuaded the Iranians to sign a joint statement with the E.U.-3, as the delegation has come to be known. In the so-called Tehran Declaration, issued in October, the Iranians agreed to suspend all activities associated with enrichment; to offer a complete accounting of the nuclear program; and to accept an ''additional protocol'' to the Nonproliferation Treaty that expands the ability of inspectors to look for facilities that the host country has not disclosed. 
 So by last fall the Iranians, the Europeans and the I.A.E.A. all had reason to feel that a new, cooperative paradigm might be at hand, an alternative both to war (as in Iraq) and to the stalemate in North Korea. At that very time, however, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi decided to trade Libya's secret nuclear program for better relations with the West. One by-product of his decision was a bumper crop of information about the nuclear-arms trade. Agency experts became convinced that the Iranians must have received the same designs for an advanced centrifuge, known as the P2, that the Libyans had. And when Olli Heinonen confronted Iranian officials in December, they admitted that it was so. The Iranians then made matters worse by concocting one of their legalistic defenses; they didn't think ''research and development'' had to be disclosed.
When I arrived in Vienna for the board meeting in March, the Americans and their allies -- chiefly, the Canadians, the Australians and the British -- were demanding a resolution harshly criticizing Iranian noncompliance. Rumor had it that John Bolton, the U.S. under secretary of state for arms control and a scorching critic of international bodies generally (and the I.A.E.A. in particular), had been sighted haunting the hallways. A few weeks earlier, Bolton sent a spine-stiffening letter to his chief European counterparts designed to remind them of the threat Iran posed to international peace and security. The rumor turned out to be the product of a fevered imagination; but Mohamed ElBaradei seemed to be hearing footsteps. In remarks to reporters before the session, he said that Iran was in ''violation'' of its obligations to fully disclose its nuclear program -- unusually strong language for him. 
 When I first spoke to ElBaradei, at the beginning of the week, he said that he welcomed a tough resolution to keep pressure on the Iranians, though he also felt that the moderates in Iran needed some gesture to keep the conservative clerics at bay. Above all, he was hoping to stay clear of the rhetorical battlefield. I said to ElBaradei that his situation was very much like that of Kofi Annan, forever trying to prove to Americans that he is not hopelessly conflict-averse without making developing countries dismiss him as a stooge of the West. ''Actually,'' he said, ''it's even worse than that. I have the right to sit in judgment, where Kofi Annan does not. And that makes many countries uncomfortable. We're in the driver's seat, and they're not. That's why impartiality for us is an absolute key. If we try to offer our own interpretation of the facts, we'll be shot down in no time.''
 ElBaradei, who is 61, is a habitually cautious man, with a lawyer's faith in process as well as a diplomat's belief in engagement and compromise. He earned his Ph.D. in international law at New York University, and his father was the president of the Egyptian Bar Association. You hear grumbling among hard-liners in the Bush administration that ElBaradei is a third-world man or an Egyptian nationalist, but he has spent far more of his adult life in New York and Vienna than in Cairo. We had a lengthy colloquy on the merits both of the Yankees' acquisition of Alex Rodriguez and the Knicks' of Stephon Marbury.
 With his large head, shining pate, little round glasses and bottlebrush mustache, the director general is an endearing rather than an imposing figure. He seems perpetually flustered, falling all over his own sentences and darting off in new directions. He is fond of American idioms, which he occasionally mangles. He is, according to his aides, very shy and has only slowly adapted to the public demands of his job. And yet he is given a great deal of credit for changing the culture of the agency. Gary Milhollin, a nonproliferation expert who has often mocked the I.A.E.A. for its timidity, says that ElBaradei has projected ''a much more muscular image'' for the agency and that inspectors have ''done a good job of challenging the Iranians and demanding that the Iranians explain the inconsistencies in their story.'' Senior Bush administration officials tend to be less charitable. One confidently assured me that the Iranians ''are stiffing the inspectors, but ElBaradei won't say it'' -- which the inspectors themselves deny -- and speculates that he is soft-pedaling the truth in service to ''higher ambitions'': to head the Arab League, or even to qualify for the Nobel Peace Prize.
 ElBaradei spent much of that week in Vienna fielding complaints from the Iranians, who wanted him to stand up to the Bush administration. But they had lost him after the discovery of the P2 centrifuge design. ElBaradei told me he had said to top Iranian figures, ''I stick my neck to try to help you, and then we see that.'' ElBaradei worried about the damage the revelation had done to the I.A.E.A. ''It goes to our credibility as an institution,'' he said. ''We are balanced, and we are weighing our words carefully, but we do not want to be fools.'' ElBaradei would be going to Washington at the end of the week to meet with President Bush as well as with George Tenet, the C.I.A. director; the I.A.E.A. receives intelligence from U.S. agencies as well as from the intelligence services of several other nations, but only intermittently. ''We must communicate that the agency is not a blue-eyed bureaucrat sitting in Vienna,'' he told staff members one morning. Also, he instructed, no gloating about who was right about Iraq, and no meeting during the visit with emissaries from the John Kerry camp. ElBaradei wanted to lay out a vision for putting the nuclear genie back in the bottle that was different from President Bush's; but, he said, ''we need to get them to see that our view complements their view.'' 
 The week ended on a good note for ElBaradei. The Iranians had won the support of countries in the Non-Aligned Movement, few of whom evince much concern with nonproliferation issues; and the two sides had been hopelessly deadlocked on language for the resolution. It didn't help matters that the Americans and Iranians refused to be in the same room with the other, so the Canadian ambassador had to run back and forth, bearing proposed changes. Late on Thursday night, ElBaradei was awakened by a call from Secretary Powell asking him to become personally involved. ElBaradei would go to almost any lengths not to say no to a request from Powell, whom he considers his greatest champion inside the Bush administration. The following day, the two sides began meeting -- separately, of course -- in ElBaradei's office, and by Saturday morning they had agreed on a draft that had enough ''deplores'' in it to satisfy the Americans, and enough caveats to mollify the Iranians.
 ElBaradei flew off to Washington the next day. I had a cup of coffee with him in the midst of his tour, and he said, with no little relief, ''We're coming at a good time, because they're very pleased.'' He had already met with Republican congressmen, several of whom seemed to be under the impression that the I.A.E.A. was denying that Iran had a nuclear program; he tried to explain the difference between a nuclear program and a weapons program. He met with several administration officials and was delighted by the professional and nonideological tone of the discussions. ''Now that we have this relationship,'' one moderate said, ''don't be surprised if we turn to you even more in the future.'' ElBaradei then left for his meeting with President Bush. When he returned, ElBaradei said that the president, obviously well briefed, broke the ice by saying, ''So, I hear you're a Yankees fan.'' They talked about A-Rod and then about family. In the course of a 40-minute discussion, ElBaradei raised the need to secure nuclear material in Russia; to criminalize the export of nuclear weapons technology; and to improve the quality of intelligence. I asked whether he carried a message from the Iranians, as I was told he might have, seeking a deal with the United States. ElBaradei declined to answer. He did say that the president was obviously pleased about the resolution on Iran. He realized, however, that the mood could prove transitory. 
When I visited Tehran last month, my plan was to accompany the I.A.E.A. inspectors as they visited the country's nuclear sites. The agency agreed to let me do so, and so, apparently, had the Iranians. On my first morning, however, it became plain that officials from the Foreign Ministry had no idea what to do with me. They sent me across town to get a press card from the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, which ultimately refused to give me credentials. When I returned to my hotel, I was told that a caller, who had not identified himself, left instructions that I was to appear at a police station the following morning. Still later, the I.A.E.A.'s chief inspector in Iran, Christian Charlier, knocked on my door to let me know that the general director of the Foreign Ministry himself approved of my plans for the next day. But by the following morning, that official had been overruled by the Atomic Energy Organization. And that was the end of my nuclear tour of Iran.
 Iran turns out to be a very peculiar kind of totalitarian state, one that seeks iron control over public behavior and expression yet is subject to constant improvisation. The Islamic Revolution never fostered an entirely coherent authority structure. Underneath the supreme authority, Ayatollah Khamenei, are councils and ministries that have a more or less horizontal relationship and continually vie to fill whatever vacuums are left by the Leader. Ali Salehi, a nuclear physicist who was serving as Iran's representative to Vienna when the truth about his country's nuclear program first began to come out, told me that ''at the outset, there was not one particular organization that would say the last word; one would not know where to get the authorization and permission. This is because high officials here are all on an equal footing and power is shared among so many.'' Salehi said he grew so frustrated with the secrecy back home that he began leaking information to the Iranian press, at which point he was swiftly relieved of his position.
 I had been caught up in the same internal contest that Salehi had -- that between the forces of more-or-less transparency and those of defensive withdrawal. The Foreign Ministry, which apparently gained control over the nuclear program from the Atomic Energy Organization, generally pushes for openness toward the world; sometimes it wins, often it loses. In my case, it seemed to have lost, to both the Atomic Energy Organization and the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. But Iran is not a one-man state, like Libya or North Korea. Diplomats point out that the Tehran Declaration represented a major victory for the forces in Iran that, however tentatively, seek engagement with the larger world; if Iran is seen to get nothing in exchange for the risk it took, those forces will be discredited. 
 The Iranians were, in fact, very eager to let the world know how thoroughly they had been misunderstood, and I received a call from Ali Asghar Soltanieh, deputy director general of the division of international political affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, asking me to meet with him. I was bowed into Soltanieh's office by various supernumeraries. It was a very big office filled with ponderous, high-backed, carved wooden chairs. On one wall was the official photographic triptych: Ayatollah Khomeini and Ayatollah Khamenei flanking Mohammad Khatami, the country's increasingly marginalized president. 
 Soltanieh heard of my travails, and he was profoundly apologetic and solicitous. Tea was served, as were sweets. Soltanieh also had prepared a monologue for my benefit. He was, he said, a nuclear physicist who had served in the Atomic Energy Organization in the days of the shah. America was then eager to support Iran's fledgling nuclear program, and Germany was all too happy to begin work on a reactor in Bushehr. ''At that time, we had oil,'' Soltanieh observed; ''but nobody questioned, 'What is the justification for going nuclear if you have oil?' '' He then went on to serve as his country's representative to the I.A.E.A. from 1982 to 1987, a period when the West was blocking all shipments of uranium to Iran. How was Iran to acquire fuel to get its nuclear power program under way? ''The country had no option other than working on the fuel cycle,'' he said. (The fuel cycle is the process required to transmute uranium metal mined from the ground into fissionable material.) ''We had to try all the routes possible -- plutonium, gas centrifuge, laser enrichment.'' And of course it had to be clandestine, since the West wouldn't stand for Iran having its own nuclear ability. 
 Soltanieh proceeded to offer me a litany of patently absurd explanations for Iran's undisclosed nuclear facilities. He explained, for example, that Natanz could not be described as ''clandestine'' because the villagers all around knew very well what it was. I could see why Iran is so widely believed to be harboring a secret weapons program; why else would authorities be concocting such laughably transparent lies? And yet, Soltanieh himself may have been kept in the dark about the nuclear program, and then did his best to brazen it out. Inspectors say Iranians from the Foreign Ministry often seemed as amazed as they were by many of the discoveries.
 Is it possible, then, that all those lies don't add up to a terrible truth? John Bolton ridiculed ElBaradei last fall for reporting that no evidence had yet emerged that Iran was developing a nuclear weapons program. And yet ElBaradei was stating a fact. Last summer inspectors found particles of uranium enriched as high as 54 percent, far above the 3 to 4 percent needed to produce energy; but the material may have entered as contaminants on foreign equipment the Iranians purchased from their intermediary. Officials like Soltanieh have been so oblique on the subject that it's impossible to tell. Nor have the Iranians yet provided convincing explanations for experiments involving polonium and other radioactive materials. But inspectors have found no weapons, no weapons drawings, no evidence of weapons research. ''Everything seems to be lined up to support enrichment of 3 to 4 percent to produce fuel,'' said Christian Charlier, an I.A.E.A. inspector. While he finds all the lies maddening, ''so far, we don't have any facts that say they have a nuclear weapons program.''
 You would think, given the humiliating experience in Iraq, where no evidence of an active nuclear weapons program has been found, that the Bush administration would subject the evidence in Iran to exacting scrutiny. But it hasn't. In fact, its position amounts to ''Where there's smoke, there's fire.'' One White House official explained to me that ''there is no other rational explanation'' for Iran's nuclear program than the development of weapons. But of course there was no other rational explanation for Saddam Hussein's stonewalling of inspectors. You would think that by now ''no other rational explanation'' might have been discredited as a cause of action. 
 One Western diplomat I met with in Tehran said: ''The Americans are right in saying that a nuclear energy program in this country with these enormous oil reserves does not make sense. At the same time, what is clear is that this country for national security reasons wants to have a nuclear industry. There is agreement across the board to the point of saying, 'We need to have a nuclear capacity to a certain level.' The level is not clear. I am absolutely not sure that there is a decision even by the religious leadership to go for a bomb.'' 
If Iran is developing a bomb, the Iranian officials I talked to are much better liars than I give them credit for being. On this subject, there was not a hint of waffle. The official line is that Iran must have the capacity to produce its own enriched nuclear fuel. When I asked why they couldn't just buy fuel from others -- they are already working on a deal with Russia to do just that for the Bushehr reactor -- I was told that experience taught them they couldn't rely on others. But that wasn't really the point. When I pressed Dr. Seyed Hossein Mousavian, a top official with Iran's Security Council, he said bluntly, ''To stop Iran from a legitimate right of NPT [the Nonproliferation Treaty], which is to enjoy the peaceful technology of nuclear power, is not acceptable to Iran.'' Mousavian spoke -- repeatedly -- of ''the double standard,'' of ''discrimination.'' Why should Iran, he asked, be denied benefits available to Japan? The answer, of course, is that Japan is not a theocratic state with a history of support for terrorism, and it is not located in the Middle East. Mousavian was not much impressed with this point. He said he expected that ''in a very short time -- I would say two years -- we should reach the full transparency and confidence'' promised in the Tehran Declaration, and then the suspended fuel-enrichment activities would resume. 
 But this almost certainly will not happen. The reason it won't happen is that the bargain enshrined in the Nonproliferation Treaty -- the bargain Iranian authorities wish to see fulfilled -- is effectively defunct. The distinction between peaceful and warlike uses of nuclear power has become hopelessly blurred. The threshold issue in nuclear nonproliferation is not the hardware -- bombs are no longer so hard to make -- but the capacity to enrich uranium. In the case of the ''fuel cycle,'' the same technology serves military as well as civilian uses. It's only a matter of time, and not much time at that, to go from the harmless to the lethal. If Natanz is permitted to go back online, and if the Iranians go back to manufacturing centrifuges, they could soon have a facility capable of converting low-enriched uranium to the highly enriched uranium needed for a weapon. Nobody would know until it was too late. And that is why what is nonnegotiable to the Iranians is unacceptable to the Bush administration, the E.U.-3 and ElBaradei himself. 
 Can the Iranians be persuaded to mothball their entire enrichment industry? That depends on whether you think the Iranians are a pack of unscrupulous liars, as many Bush administration officials do. For them, the debate over Iran offers more proof that the international community and its institutions are not up to the challenge of confronting evildoers. Administration policy makers are growing increasingly impatient with both the Iranians and European diplomats who have, they say, a ''delusional'' faith in the value of further negotiations -- just as they did with Iraq. This time, of course, there will be no calls for war -- Iraq has seen to that. What the administration wants the I.A.E.A. board to do is refer the matter to the Security Council as a threat to international peace and security, though officials recognize that they have not won that battle. Instead, as one says, ''We have to raise the issue higher than we have'' by calling on allies to at least threaten to impose economic sanctions and political isolation on Iran. 
 The Europeans take a very different view -- and this time the British, who have taken a fearful pasting over Iraq, will not stray far from the French and the Germans. For one thing, American credibility on the issue of weapons of mass destruction is not what it used to be. The Europeans, too, see the smoke, but they are not convinced of the fire. As one E.U.-3 diplomat says, ''We have been through so many surprises that I cannot rule out'' a clandestine program, but ''we have never seen any additional convincing evidence.'' Nor do the Europeans agree that the Iranians have grossly abused the commitments they made last October. Neither is there an appetite either for Security Council resolutions or for sanctions. ''We consider that the I.A.E.A. process is the best game in town'' is how an official with the British Foreign Office put it. 
 The European approach is to keep the pressure on the Iranians but to offer them a glimpse of light at the end of the tunnel -- a limited expansion of trade relations, perhaps, when the Iranian Parliament ratifies the additional protocol, thus committing Iran to transparency. And the problem of the fuel cycle? Keep the ''temporary'' suspension in place for as many years as it takes for the mullahs to finally go home in favor of a new government able to see the light of reason. In other words, stall. A Western diplomat in Tehran suggested to me that this is not a moment to seek ''truth, justice and clarity'' but rather ''what is pragmatically possible.'' This is, of course, just the kind of counsel that registers as the moral fatigue of Old Europe in certain quarters of the White House and the Pentagon.
 Iran is unlikely to make good on its threats to eject the I.A.E.A., which would lead to just the kind of isolation the Bush administration would like to impose. But a policy of unyielding pressure would almost certainly lead the Iranian Parliament to refuse to adopt the additional protocol and generally strengthen the hard-liners. Iran also has the capacity to cause enormous mischief among the Shiites of Iraq. Perhaps something of ElBaradei's empathy is required. Iranians feel encircled by unfriendly countries and threatened by Israel and are now surrounded by U.S. troops. The fuel cycle has taken on a talismanic power for them not only as a matter of national pride and autonomy, but perhaps also as a deterrent (though they won't admit as much). That doesn't mean they get to keep it, but their motivations and political worries and calculations go well beyond ''evil.'' 
Each of the shocks of the last 15 years has exposed a different failure in the nonproliferation system -- in Iraq, the absurdity of the gentlemen's agreement; in North Korea, the benefits of noncompliance as well as the dangers of diplomatic irresolution; in Libya, the ease and impunity with which the black market in nuclear supplies operated; and in Iran, the legal protections extended to fuel-cycle activities. A new international architecture of nonproliferation, if there is to be one, must address all of these problems.
 The I.A.E.A. began to rewrite the gentlemen's agreement when it began promoting the additional protocol in 1997. The additional protocol permits I.A.E.A. inspectors to visit any building that they have reason to believe might contain nuclear facilities, and to conduct spot inspections with as little as two hours' warning. Inspectors say that the protocol gives them all the latitude they need to find what is findable. The problem is that some countries with nuclear programs (including the U.S.) have signed but not yet ratified it. President Bush has proposed that many of the benefits that flow from the Nonproliferation Treaty should be made conditional on ratification of the protocol. But even the countries that do sign up can still bamboozle the inspectors, as the Iranians may or may not be doing. The I.A.E.A. will always have to rely on surveillance conducted by the major intelligence agencies, as it has, sporadically, since the North Korean incident in 1993; officials say that the C.I.A. has promised to work closely with the agency in the future.
 And if a country withdraws from the NPT, as North Korea did, or refuses to sign it, as Pakistan, India and Israel have, or blocks inspectors, as Iraq did, the I.A.E.A. is helpless. ElBaradei has proposed making the Nonproliferation Treaty obligatory, like the convention on genocide, so that withdrawal would be illegal. But the international community has to be prepared to deal with the outlaws, as it was not with North Korea. Jessica Mathews, head of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, points out that the mechanism for referring nuclear delinquents from the I.A.E.A. board to the Security Council is hopelessly creaky, but that is largely because most of the members of the 35-nation board care much more about getting access to peaceful technology than about blocking proliferation. Countries like Malaysia have consistently taken Iran's side over the last year. The problem, at bottom, is political will; nonproliferation must move closer to the top of the global agenda than it is now, and not just for nations that see themselves as potential victims of nuclear terrorism.
 How can we choke off the black market in nuclear material and know-how? The Bush administration, which is given higher marks for its engagement with this issue than it is on most other international fronts, has promulgated what it calls the Proliferation Security Initiative, a set of agreements with a widening range of countries to work together to interdict nuclear materials; the seizure of centrifuge parts from a ship bound for Libya late last year was the most spectacular success of the P.S.I. so far. The administration also promised to spend $450 million to secure tons of uranium and plutonium originally manufactured by the United States and Russia. (In a speech earlier this month, Senator John Kerry said securing this nuclear material would be his highest security goal as president, and vowed to do it much faster than President Bush would.) But Russia is scarcely the only proliferation problem. Many countries do not now ban the sale of nuclear material, and ElBaradei often speaks of the need for a new regime of export controls.
 Clearly the nuclear bargain must be rewritten so that states no longer have the right to make their own enriched fuel. ElBaradei has proposed that the manufacture of enriched uranium for export be placed under multinational control. The supply of nuclear fuel would be guaranteed by international agreements, giving countries like Iran no legitimate grounds to insist on a program of their own. President Bush laid out an alternative vision in a speech last February in which he proposed to vest control over enrichment in the Nuclear Suppliers Group, a 40-member community of nations with nuclear programs. ElBaradei says that the problem with allowing only some countries to sell enriched fuel is that ''the representative from South Africa'' -- a country that volunteered to surrender its nuclear program -- ''is going to say, 'How can we accept that Pakistan, India and Israel, which are rogue states so far as the NPT is concerned, are in and we are out?' '' And how will Iran be induced to dismantle its own nuclear program if others -- Brazil and Japan -- get to keep theirs?
 ElBaradei insists that the differences between him and the Bush administration are matters not of ''ideology'' but of ''perception.'' But it is also the difference between a preference for universal, treaty-based solutions as opposed to ad hoc ones like the Bush administration's Proliferation Security Initiative. Nonproliferation would seem, in fact, to constitute the supreme test of the world's ability and willingness to act in concert. A proposal for a ''Strategy of Universal Compliance,'' to be issued next week by the Carnegie Endowment, gives the Bush administration credit for forcing a change in ''international threat assessments'' and in the calculus of noncomplying states, but also notes: ''The core problem is that stopping the spread of nuclear weapons requires more international teamwork than the Bush administration recognizes, and more international resolve than previous administrations could muster. . . . The United States cannot defeat these threats alone, or even with small coalitions of the willing. It needs sustained cooperation from dozens of diverse nations to broaden, toughen and enforce nonproliferation rules.'' 
 How can we get that cooperation? Many nonweapons states complain that the U.S. wants to rewrite the rules so that they cannot produce nuclear fuel and must sign the additional protocol -- but itself flagrantly violates the commitment to pursue disarmament enshrined in the NPT. What's more, the Bush administration has begun research on a new generation of tactical nuclear weapons. Is this not, as the Iranians would have it, a double standard? ElBaradei says he believes that it is. In a speech last month before the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, he said, a bit more provocatively than is his custom, ''There are some who have continued to dangle a cigarette from their mouth and tell everybody else not to smoke.''
 This is not considered a serious argument inside the Bush administration. One official said that the professed concern about American disarmament was ''rhetorical'' rather than real, and in any case failed to account for the destruction of weapons and fuel stocks. (John Kerry says he would also stop development of any new nuclear weapons.) When ElBaradei came to Washington, Brent Scowcroft, the Republican sage and Bush family friend, suggested he keep a lid on the disarmament stuff, and ElBaradei was prudent enough to do so. After all, no responsible president would ever expose the United States to the possibility of nuclear blackmail. Nonetheless, just as we are unlikely to persuade Iran to eliminate its fuel-cycle program through a campaign of threats, so we are unlikely to enlist allies in erecting a new global nonproliferation order if we treat ourselves as wholly exempt from some of its central requirements. 
 In his ''Atoms for Peace'' speech, Eisenhower said, ''I know that the American people share my deep belief that if a danger exists in the world, it is a danger shared by all; and equally, that if hope exists in the mind of one nation, that hope should be shared by all.'' It is, perhaps, an archaic sentiment. And yet Eisenhower recognized a central tenet of a world into which the destructive power of the atom has been unleashed: as we are collectively menaced, so we must collectively act. 


CORRECTION-DATE: July 4, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on June 13 about the possibility of a nuclear-weapons program in Iran referred imprecisely to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors nuclear energy and weapons. The agency's inspectors collaborated with the United Nations Special Commission in Iraq in 1991 but were not part of it.

HEADLINE: Behind the Scenes, a Restless and Relentless Kerry

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN

DATELINE: BOSTON, June 12 

 BODY:
Like a caged hamster, Senator John Kerry is restless on the road. He pokes at the perimeter of the campaign bubble that envelops him, constantly trying to break out for a walk around the block, a restaurant dinner, the latest movie.
 Landing one sunny day in St. Louis, Mr. Kerry wandered off the airstrip to stroll through a grass patch, leaving his security detail trying to keep him in sight while scores of staff members, supporters, police officers and journalists waited without explanation for an hour. Another afternoon on another tarmac, he tossed a baseball, then a football, then hopped on a policeman's motorcycle for a spin, all in the space of 30 minutes. Late one evening in Harrisburg, Pa., Mr. Kerry jumped from the motorcade to greet some children on a street corner.
 ''Can we walk over there?'' he had asked an aide earlier that day, heading for a fund-raiser after a series of radio interviews from a hotel. ''I'd love to get outdoors and remember what it's like.'' 
 This restlessness is one of many facets of Mr. Kerry's style and personality that is all but invisible to most voters in this era of stage-managed politics, where authentic insights into the people who would be president are precious few. Though it is impossible to know what Mr. Kerry is like when no one is watching him, observations on the campaign trail over several months, combined with interviews with politicians and aides who spend time by his side, help flesh out the one-dimensional portraits of Mr. Kerry as war hero or waffler proffered by the two sides' television advertisements.
 He is a relentless polisher, going over and over even well-worn sections of his stump speech until moments before delivery. 
 He is a diligent greeter, never speeding through a hotel kitchen without handshakes. He is chronically and unapologetically late -- for campaign events, for meetings, even for church. On Memorial Day, he showed up a half-hour into an hourlong parade in Portsmouth, Va., his only scheduled stop for the day.
 At 60, Mr. Kerry is an avid and able athlete, though he sometimes seems physically awkward, with custom-made clothes hanging off his lanky frame as he pumps a fist at rallies. A former prosecutor, he employs a Socratic style in policy talks with aides, though he rarely goes beyond chitchat in conversations that could be caught on camera.
 His formal statements are filled with multisyllabic upper-crust phrasing -- his campaign had an intern whose main responsibility was to look up all the unfamiliar words Mr. Kerry uttered -- but one on one, he calls strangers ''man'' or ''brother.'' He is careful to use people's names -- he has interrupted himself more than once to introduce sign-language interpretations -- yet he rarely remembers them. 
 And where former President Bill Clinton plays cards and President Bush turns to the treadmill, Senator Kerry strums his Spanish classical guitar in a kind of musical meditation. Lately, in the private front cabin of his campaign plane, he has been learning a new (old) song, ''This Land Is Your Land.''
 ''He's a weird mix of both the very refined taste of elite schools and all that but also eating Hostess cupcakes and watching dumb comedies on TV,'' observed Andrei Cherny, who spent more than a year as Mr. Kerry's chief speechwriter and now works for the Democratic National Committee. ''It's sort of a mix of those two things: Up on pop culture more than most people running for president; at the same time, he's read all these books by people whose names I can't pronounce.''
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who has both relaxed with Mr. Kerry on the beaches of Cape Cod and campaigned with him in a working friendship spanning 30 years, said, ''An awful lot of what appears to be standoffish is a sort of shyness in him.''
 Mr. Kerry is anything but simple and straightforward, a man of many sides and surprises, some seemingly contradictory.
 There is the John Kerry who starts his speeches with throat-clearing thank-you's that last 5, 8, even 10 or 12 minutes, and he often runs on for several paragraphs or pages after a promised, ''finally.'' He almost always works in a local line -- a reference to the Bedford Angels, for example, at a high school commencement last Sunday. He uses archaic phrasings and words like ''fare thee well'' and ''folderol'' but tries to soften his stiff seriousness with a joke or two, however canned.
 ''Now, they're running on the promise that they'll keep doing more of the same,'' Mr. Kerry said of the Bush administration's economic policies, speaking in Las Vegas last month. ''This is like the Red Sox saying, 'Let's see if we can go another 86 years without a World Series.'''
 There is also the John Kerry who is constantly on a cellphone, seeking counsel from a wide circle or conveying concerns to staff members. Everyone around him and several people back at his campaign headquarters heard him grouse the other day about having to give a formal speech, in a suit, outside in steamy 92 degrees in West Palm Beach, Fla.
 Bob Farmer, the campaign treasurer who previously served in the same post for three presidential contenders, Michael S. Dukakis, Bill Clinton and John Glenn, recalled a long-ago cross-country flight about which Mr. Kerry complained that he had wasted five hours because the small plane lacked a telephone.
 ''I've been on planes with four presidential candidates,'' Mr. Farmer said. ''Dukakis would always be reading a policy paper, Clinton would always be telling stories. John Kerry is always on the phone,'' he said. (Mr. Glenn, the former astronaut, he added, ''was flying the plane.'')
 Several aides said that Mr. Kerry was the least interested in polling data of any politician they had known. But he is deeply involved in tiny details on policy, and spends hours on speech drafts. (This is an improvement; before a speech at Georgetown that helped open his campaign in January 2003, Mr. Kerry was so preoccupied with the speech that he had to trim his fund-raising activities for three days.)
 ''Polishing and polishing and polishing until he's satisfied,'' is how one senior campaign official described the process. ''He doesn't take anything as a given. He wants to understand and internalize and come to grips with everything in his own way and understand everything as completely as possible. He's not satisfied until he's achieved a level of perfection he's willing to call his own.''
 Then there is John Kerry the father figure, who drove an hour after an overseas flight to attend the 2001 nuptials of his press secretary, David Wade, who has not seen his own father since he was a baby. And Mr. Kerry arranged his schedule last month to attend the Washington wedding of Jill Alper, a longtime political aide, sitting next to her single mother during the ceremony. He took a break from the Iowa Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinner to give a toast via telephone to the Florida marriage of a Navy crewmate, Del Sandusky.
 Mark Mellman, Mr. Kerry's pollster, recalled sending a bouquet to Mr. Kerry when he had prostate surgery early last year, and getting back a two-sided handwritten card. ''I barely knew the guy,'' he said. ''His gesture was more complete than mine.''
 John Kerry the athlete is constantly on display. In New Hampshire in January, there were hockey games with the pros. This spring, there were ubiquitous pictures of him snowboarding. And now, a day off here in Boston rarely passes without a photo opportunity of him whizzing by on a bicycle. It is not, as with Mr. Bush, mainly an exercise regimen; there remains in Mr. Kerry a prep-school cultivated competitive sensibility about sports.
 Senator Kennedy recalled a few years back when Mr. Kerry showed up at his family compound on the Cape, nearly blue from cycling the 76 miles from the Kennedy library in Boston in the May chill, one of only a handful of participants to complete the charity ride. He took precious time off the trail this spring to have shoulder surgery to ensure he could windsurf this summer. He is always looking for a ball to throw.
 ''He is the Renaissance man,'' Senator Bill Nelson of Florida said, noting that on a recent flight, Mr. Kerry indulged in the campaign pastime of ''orange bowling'' down the aisle, managing to roll a piece of fruit the entire length of his plane during takeoff without hitting anything.
 And there is John Kerry the cautious conversationalist. Ever restless and curious, Mr. Kerry rarely lets a flight pass without checking in on the press cabin, and aides often have to corral him back to his seat for takeoff and landing. But he is loath to commit to even casual chit-chat about anything other than sports. One night while most passengers were imbibing, he rebuffed a question about his cocktail of choice.
 ''Isn't that amazing?'' was Mr. Kerry's comment one morning at a West Virginia diner, both to the fact that the restaurant had been open 56 years and then, a few moments later, that one of the patrons had survived the 1945 sinking of the U.S.S. Indianapolis.
 He subscribes to Time, Newsweek and Sports Illustrated, and right now is working his way through biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Lyndon B. Johnson as well as David Halberstam's ''The Teammates,'' about the friendship of four Boston Red Sox players in the 1940's. Though Mr. Wade said his boss reads newspapers thoroughly each morning and even points out articles for him, Mr. Kerry frequently deflects questions about news developments by saying he has not read about them.
 When he tried that the other day, in response to a question about Mr. Bush's speech at the Air Force Academy, a reporter who had been therepulled out a copy of the text for him to peruse. As he flew to Minneapolis, Mr. Kerry stared at the pages for several minutes, flipping through front to back, then back to front, but said little more than, ''long speech.''
 He was happy when the conversation turned back to baseball, chatting with a fellow Sox fan about the pros and cons of the seats now available above the Green Monster, the short left field fence at Fenway Park. ''I would miss the thwack of the ball and the crack of the bat,'' he mused.
 But Mr. Kerry was still chafing at the confines of his celebrity. He had been to a Sox game a few days before, in the fourth row between the plate and third base, with a stop at the owners' box. He spent much of the afternoon signing autographs and saying hello. 
 ''I hardly got to see any of the game,'' he lamented.

POWER, TERROR,
PEACE, AND WAR
America's Grand Strategy in a World at Risk.
By Walter Russell Mead.
226 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $19.95.
 WALTER RUSSELL MEAD is the Henry A. Kissinger senior fellow in United States foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. Despite the crushing respectability of that title, Mead has earned a deserved reputation as one of the country's liveliest thinkers about America's role in the world. And in ''Power, Terror, Peace, and War,'' his originality has led him dangerously -- but gratifyingly -- away from respectability. 
 Mead says, ''A mix of incredulity, outrage, shock, anger and despair is running through the foreign policy establishment as many of its most cherished ideas and institutions are impatiently brushed aside.'' As one of the leading lights of that same establishment, Mead might have been expected to join in the keening and wailing. Instead, he has concluded that President Bush has been right on just about everything important in the war on terror. 
 For those who support the president and his policies, ''Power, Terror, Peace, and War'' is interesting not only in itself but also as evidence of how dramatically Bush has transformed the American foreign policy debate. For those who do not support the president, this book is a sharp reminder that, in Mead's words, opponents have ''not yet managed to present a cogent and convincing alternative strategy.''
 In tandem with the eminent historian John Lewis Gaddis, the author of the equally arresting new book ''Surprise, Security, and the American Experience,'' Mead has done something that academic experts rarely do: defy their professional consensus and open their minds to new ideas. Yes, Mead can be critical of the White House. He writes, ''The Bush administration's conduct of affairs has been too choppy and uncertain, its ability to formulate and express its strategic direction too crude and unconvincing.'' But on the specifics, he is almost entirely approving. 
 Employing overwhelming force against terrorist enemies? Check: ''Those who cannot stand us must learn at least to fear us.''
 Invading Iraq to rebuild the Middle East? Check: ''Taking Iraq's political weight out of the radical Sunni Arab camp would make a permanent and probably beneficial change in the political geometry of the Middle East.''
 Threatening pre-emption as a tool against nuclear proliferation? Check: ''The European nations . . . who engaged Iran in the process that led to the Iranian agreement to accept weapons inspectors would never have taken this issue so seriously if they had not feared that the alternative to European demands was an American invasion.'' 
 Grounding decisions in national values? Check: ''Foreign policy can't be conducted over the heads or against the basic instincts of the American people.''
 De-emphasizing the Israeli-Palestinian dispute? Check: ''The Palestinian peace party cannot reliably deliver Palestinian society unless peace offers concrete benefits for the overwhelming majority of displaced Palestinians, and since there is no peace party in Israel if the return of millions of Palestinians is the price of a deal, peace remains tantalizingly out of reach. In a situation where neither of the parties is willing to accept any of the feasible solutions, there is very little that an outside power can do to force an agreement.'' 
 Understanding the conflict with militant Islam as an ideological struggle? Check: '' 'Arabian Fascism' is a totalitarian ideology inspired by a mythologized vision of the past. . . . And it aims by force to restore this past not only in the world of Islam, but ultimately throughout the world.'' 
 If anything, Mead's basic views are even starker than those of the Bush administration. Europe is fading -- militarily, economically, demographically. America is rising. The Europeans sense that their positions will count for less and less in the world of the future, and so, while they still can, they seek to lock the United States into arrangements and institutions that will grant them an effective veto over American decision making. 
 Mead is not quite ready to hammer a Bush/ Cheney sign into his front lawn. Despite his admiration for most of the administration's actions, he finds its personality and style ultimately off-putting and alien. 
 Yet if Bush presents his ideas too bluntly for Mead's taste, some will find Mead's own presentation too circumlocutory. Short as this book is, it could have been shorter still, especially in its opening chapters -- as if Mead were cushioning his expected reader against the audacious thoughts contained in the second half. 
 Thus he lingers over a lengthy discussion of the changes in the world economy since 1970, retelling the familiar story of how the shift from a mass-production economy has lifted America's position relative to that of Europe, Japan and Russia. However, Mead does not have a good deal to add about the question that obviously follows: why did America do so much better than the other industrial countries? The answer to that question is crucial to the next -- and even more important -- question: how long can the American advantage be expected to continue? 
 But if Mead's opening drags, his ending dazzles. He closes with a fascinating prediction about how the war on terror will change the country. Just as the struggle against the Soviet Union prodded Americans to prove that capitalism ''could do better than Communism at improving the lives of working people and enhancing the lives of the poor,'' so, Mead suggests, the struggle against Islamic extremism will intensify the trend toward greater piety in American public life. 
 The Islamic extremists, Mead says, have falsely accused the United States of having lost touch with its spiritual roots. ''As part of our grand strategy . . . we shall have to take steps to make these charges less plausible in the future. Inescapably, this will lead many Americans to renew their personal faith commitments and make the moral and social ideals of their religious roots more relevant in their daily conduct and in their assessments of politicians and of political ideas.''
 If Mead is right, then it is not only President Bush's foreign policies that begin to look visionary, even inescapable. So too does his religious style. It could be the future. Get ready.

A Cold Morning In Vermont
 IGNAT SOLZHENITSYN understands why so many people have warm thoughts of Ronald Reagan, but one of his earliest memories is on the frigid side.
 In 1980, Ignat was an 8-year-old transplanted to Vermont by his father, the famous chronicler of Siberia's gulags. As Ignat tells the story, on the morning after the presidential election he got a taste of American political re-education at the progressive private school he and his brothers attended.
 In response to the Reagan victory, the school's flag was lowered to half-staff, and the morning assembly was devoted to what today would be called grief counseling. The headmaster mourned ''what America would become once the dark night of fascism descended under the B-movie actor,'' recalled Mr. Solzhenitsyn, who is now the music director of the Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia. ''At one point he interrupted himself to inquire if anyone present did not share his gloomy view of the Reagan victory.''
 The only students to raise their hands were Ignat and his two brothers, Yermolai and Stephan. After a stony silence, he recalled, they were sent outside, without their coats, to meditate on the error of their ways underneath the lowered flag. Vermont in November was hardly Siberia, but there was frost on the ground, and they spent an hour shivering and exercising to stay warm. Still, Ignat said, their political exile was a relief from sitting in the auditorium listening to the party line.

What Would He Have Done in Iraq?
 THE Bush campaign has been stricken with a case of modesty. On Monday the campaign manager, Ken Mehlman, noted on the campaign Web site that George W. Bush shared Ronald Reagan's ''moral clarity about the enemies of freedom'' as well as the knowledge ''that if a nation ever chooses peace over honor, it will end up with neither.''
 But then those words vanished from the site, putting the campaign in sync with the message Tuesday from Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director. ''We will leave it to other people,'' Mr. Bartlett said on CNN, ''to try to draw contrasts or parallels or similarities.''
 So let's turn to others to handle the question: Would Mr. Reagan have done what Mr. Bush did in Iraq?
 The longest answer comes in a new critique of neoconservativism, ''America Alone,'' by Stefan Halper, a professor at Cambridge University, and Jonathan Clarke, a fellow at the Cato Institute. Their book faults neoconservatives for calling the Iraq war an example of ''neo-Reaganite'' foreign policy. 
 ''I do not believe Reagan would have proceeded with this war in Iraq,'' Professor Halper, who was a deputy assistant secretary of state in the Reagan administration, said in an interview. ''Reagan sought to exhaust every possible alternative before proceeding to commit troops to achieve his policy ends. He would have had doubts about the intelligence on W.M.D. and seen the war as a very uncertain enterprise.''
 Professor Halper said Mr. Reagan wanted to be assured of military success, as he was in the invasion of Grenada, and showed his wariness by withdrawing troops from Lebanon after the bombing of a Marine barracks. ''If you look at how Reagan handled the cold war, the leitmotif of the second term was one of negotiation,'' he said.
 The book catalogs complaints made by neoconservatives in the 1980's about Mr. Reagan's caution in applying pressure on the Soviet Union and Poland. Norman Podhoretz, the neoconservative editor of Commentary, lamented ''the Reagan road to detente'' and wrote an article titled ''The Neoconservative Anguish Over Reagan's Foreign Policy.'' In 1984, he published an article called ''Mistaken Identity'' in which he recalled neoconservatives' initial hope that Mr. Reagan shared their dream of not merely containing but rolling back Communism.
 ''The truth, however, is that Mr. Reagan as president has never shown the slightest inclination to pursue such an ambitious strategy,'' Mr. Podhoretz wrote.

Same Question, Different Answer
 TODAY, though, Mr. Podhoretz has a more charitable view of Mr. Reagan's neoconservative credentials. ''In retrospect, I would cut him more slack,'' he said. ''After I wrote that article, he called me and spent half an hour on the phone assuring me he was serious about the Soviets. What he basically said was: Trust me, they're in more economic trouble than people realize, and I'm going to put the squeeze on them. Which he did, and he turned out to be right. If he were president today, I don't have the slightest doubt he would have reacted as Bush has and sent troops into Iraq.''
 Former Attorney General Edwin Meese III, Mr. Reagan's longtime adviser, agreed that Mr. Reagan shared Mr. Bush's moral clarity. ''I'm not going to say what Ronald Reagan would have done about Iraq, but these days the equivalent of the Soviet Union is global terrorism, and his overall response would not be unlike President Bush's,'' he said. 
 A Reagan invasion, though, might have been different tactically. Mr. Meese and Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Mr. Reagan, both recalled his instruction to the military during the planning for the Grenada invasion: Double the number of troops you think you need so there will be fewer casualties on both sides.
 Would Mr. Reagan have put more emphasis on diplomacy before invading? ''I'm not going to speculate what he would done in today's environment,'' said George P. Shultz, who was secretary of state under Mr. Reagan. ''What he practiced was the interplay of diplomacy and strength. He understood that your diplomacy would be effective when you were dealing from strength.''
 Edmund Morris, the author of ''Dutch,'' Mr. Reagan's authorized biography, said he could imagine Mr. Reagan taking neoconservatives' advice on Iraq. ''Reagan was susceptible to strongly held opinions if they coincided with his own,'' Mr. Morris said. ''If the need to go to war had been expressed in terms of Christianity versus barbarism, that's the kind of argument he would have listened to.''
 But Mr. Morris said the aftermath of the invasion could have changed Mr. Reagan's mind. ''I feel that he would have pulled out, as he pulled out of Lebanon after our marines were blown up,'' he said. ''It's just a matter of historical fact that when we were in the Middle East pursuing a foreign policy that had become an embarrassment and had begun to be a lethal commitment, Reagan was decisive in pulling out. He was an idealistic president, but also an extremely pragmatic one.''

HEADLINE: First Reagan, Now His Stunt Double

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
''BOY, if life were only like this,'' says Woody Allen in ''Annie Hall'' after he brings out the actual Marshall McLuhan to silence a pontificating McLuhan expert with whom he's trapped on a movie line. Well, last weekend life was like that.
 George W. Bush was all suited up in Normandy to repeat Ronald Reagan's 1984 blockbuster elegy to ''the boys of Pointe du Hoc'' (screenplay by Peggy Noonan). It was not the first time that the current president had taken a page from his fabled predecessor's script, but it may have been the most humiliating. The D-Day-eve timing of Reagan's death had pushed the replay of his original oration to center stage on TV, much as the real McLuhan is yanked on screen in ''Annie Hall.'' And as the McLuhan wannabe soon slinks away in that movie, so Mr. Bush's would-be Reaganesque speech atomized into white noise, to the limited extent that it was broadcast at all. 
 Some would argue that no politician in his right mind would even invite comparisons to the Great Communicator. In the aftermath of Reagan's death, his fans and foes alike remain agog at his performance chops. Kennedy may have brought the Rat Pack to the White House, but no one has ever arrived there with Reagan's particular gifts as an entertainer. They were a product of training, not accident. He had first performed as a child in church skits put on by his mother. Later came the legendary path through baseball announcing, 52 feature films, ''General Electric Theater'' and the conservative speaking circuit, where he honed what became known as the Speech. Not even other Hollywood-spawned politicians, whether George Murphy before him or Arnold Schwarzenegger after, can match this resume. To see the difference between an acting professional and an aspiring amateur, just look at the one recent president who had show business on the brain, Bill Clinton. Though Mr. Clinton's act may be better than any Reagan successor, he nonetheless lacks the master's disciplined ability to hit his mark, not to mention his timing, ready wit and brevity.
 Mr. Clinton went so far as to incongruously appropriate Reagan ideology (''The era of big government is over'') for political expediency. But no one has more strenuously tried to emulate the 40th president in both style and substance than George W. Bush. Reagan's body was barely cold when Ed Gillespie, the Republican chairman, said: ''The parallels are there. I don't know how you miss them.'' Yes, the parallels are there -- hammered in by Mr. Bush's packagers so we can never miss them. But Karl Rove and company may have overplayed their hand. The orgiastic celebration of Reagan's presidency over the past week, an upbeat Hollywood epic that has glided past Iran-contra, Bitburg and the retreat from Lebanon with impressive ease, has brought into clear focus the size of the gap between the two men. To say that difference in stature is merely a function of an actor's practiced skill at performance is both to understate the character of Ronald Reagan and to impugn the art of acting.
 The White House's efforts to follow the Reagan playbook have been nothing if not relentless. As Michael Deaver's crew famously would have Reagan cut ribbons in front of nursing homes even as he cut funds for their construction, so Mr. Bush can be found communing with nature each time his administration takes a whack at the environment. To pass himself off as a practiced hand at proletarian manual labor, Mr. Bush clears brush on camera at his ranch in Crawford just as Mr. Reagan did in Santa Barbara. In Washington, the Bush speechwriters strain to equate an ''axis of evil'' with the ''evil empire.'' 
 Even his personality is presented to the public as a clone of Reagan's. Mr. Bush is always characterized by his associates as a ''big picture'' guy who leaves any detail that can't be fit on a 3-by-5 card to his aides. As Donald Rumsfeld says in Bob Woodward's ''Plan of Attack'': ''This president has a lot of the same quality that Ronald Reagan did where he'd look out, way out to the horizon and plant a standard out there and then point toward it.''
 To some who admire both men, the analogy is plausible. Mr. Bush's certitude about his war on terrorism matches Reagan's unyielding anti-communism. Both presidents made a religion out of big tax cuts, talked of curbing government even as they increased spending and then serenely ignored the daunting deficits that ensued.
 Those who dislike both men see less salutary parallels. Both presidents tried every stunt imaginable to create the illusion that their wartime service had not been confined to the home front. Both pandered to the religious right by impeding urgently needed federal medical research that would have saved lives (Reagan with AIDS, Mr. Bush with stem cells). Where Bush and Reagan boosters see both men as refreshingly disdainful of intellectuals, critics see a smug lack of curiosity in any ideas but their own. The ur-text of today's profuse Bushisms can be found in such Reaganisms as his remarks upon returning from a trip to South America: ''Well, I learned a lot. . . . You'd be surprised. They're all individual countries.'' Both presidents inspired ''Tonight Show'' gags about their endless vacations. 
 But whether one likes either president or not, the difference between them remains far greater than any similarities, and that difference has more ramifications during a hot war than a cold one. Reagan may have been an actor, but in Garry Wills's famous phrase, he played ''the heartwarming role of himself.'' Though he never studied with Lee Strasberg, he practiced the method; his performance was based, however loosely, on the emotional memory of a difficult youth as the son of an itinerant, sometimes unemployed alcoholic. That Reagan triumphed over this background during the Depression, developing the considerable ambition needed to work his way through college and eventually to Warner Brothers, informed the sentimental optimism that both defined (and limited) his vision of America as a place where perseverance could pay off for anyone. It was indeed the heartwarming role of himself (with the New Deal backdrop of his own biography eventually stripped out). 
 Yet there was more to Reagan's role than its Horatio Alger success story. Reagan may have stayed in Culver City during the war, but as a teenage riverfront lifeguard in Illinois, he rescued 77 people, demonstrating early on the physical courage that would see him through an assassination attempt. And for all Reagan's absorption in show business, he was always engaged in politics (to the point of alienating his first wife, Jane Wyman, who found his preoccupation a bore). As president of the Screen Actors Guild in the late 40's, he was at the center of fierce labor and blacklisting battles. 
 Nor was he wholly isolated from the America beyond Hollywood. A contract player who became ''Errol Flynn of the B's,'' he wasn't a big enough star to merit all the perquisites of top show-biz royalty. As his movie career dwindled in the early 50's, he was briefly reduced to serving (at age 42) as the baggy-pants M.C. to a cheesy, showgirl-laden revue at the Last Frontier casino on the Vegas strip. Once he was reborn as a G.E. spokesman, he spent years meeting workers in the company factories that he repeatedly toured when off camera.
 Whether you liked or loathed the performance that Mr. Reagan would give as president, it derived from this earlier immersion in the real world. The script he used in the White House was often romanticized and fictional; he invented or embroidered anecdotes (including that ugly demonization of a ''welfare queen'') and preached family values he didn't practice with his own often-estranged children. But even the fiction was adapted from experience. While he had arrived in politics in middle-age with the aid of a kitchen cabinet of wealthy financial backers, there had been decades when he lived in an America broader than that of Justin Dart and Alfred Bloomingdale.
 Mr. Bush's aw-shucks persona, by contrast, has been manufactured from scratch. He has rarely, if ever, ventured out of the cocoon of privilege. He ''lost a lot of other people's money in the oil business,'' said Ron Reagan Jr. in 2000. ''What is his accomplishment? That he's no longer an obnoxious drunk?'' While the young Ronald Reagan used his imagination to improvise play-by-play radio accounts of baseball games based on sparse telegraphic accounts, Mr. Bush made a killing on a baseball team with the help of cronies and sweetheart deals. He has no history of engagement with either issues or people beyond big oil or the Andover-Yale-Harvard orbit until he belatedly went into the family business of politics.
 He does the down-home accent well, and he dresses the part. In the new issue of The Atlantic, a linguist hypothesizes to James Fallows that Mr. Bush, a smoother speaker in his Texas political career than now, may have ''deliberately made himself sound as clipped and tough as John Wayne'' since then ''as a way of showing deep-down Nascar-type manliness.'' It's as if he's eradicating his patrician one-term father to adopt the two-term Gipper as his dad instead. But unlike Reagan, Mr. Bush is so inured to the prerogatives of his life of soft landings that his attempts to affect a jus' folks geniality are invariably betrayed by nastiness whenever someone threatens to keep him from getting his own way. It's impossible to imagine Reagan countenancing the impugning of the patriotism of war heroes like John McCain and Max Cleland as the Bush machine has done in the heat of close campaigns.
 Last weekend in Normandy, the president sat for an interview in which Tom Brokaw challenged his efforts to pull off a bigger flimflam than impersonating Ronald Reagan -- the conflation of the Iraq war with World War II. ''You referred to the 'ruthless and treacherous surprise attack on America' that we went through during our time,'' Mr. Brokaw said. ''But that wasn't Iraq who did that, that was al Qaeda.'' With the gravesites of the World War II dead behind him, the president retreated to his familiar script (''Iraq is a part of the war on terror''). Even if you think the lines make sense, the irritated man delivering them did not sound like someone who had ever experienced pain of the life-and-death intensity that comes with war. The problem is not merely that Mr. Bush lacks Reagan's lilting vocal delivery. As any professional actor can tell you, no performance, however sonorous, can be credible if it doesn't contain at least a kernel of emotional truth.


CORRECTION-DATE: June 15, 2004

 CORRECTION:
A front-page column in Arts & Leisure on Sunday comparing the styles and policies of Ronald Reagan and President Bush misstated the name of Mr. Reagan's younger son. Because of editing errors, the error also appeared in a front-page article and a picture caption on Saturday about the former president's funeral and a related article that day about his burial. The son, known as Ron, is formally Ronald Prescott Reagan. He is not ''Jr.''; his father was Ronald Wilson Reagan.

HEADLINE: Diversity Plan Shaped in Texas Is Under Attack

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., June 8 

 BODY:
Texas lawmakers thought they had found the ideal alternative to race-based affirmative action.
 Seven years ago, after a federal court outlawed the use of race in the admissions policies of the state's public universities, the Legislature came up with an answer: It passed a law guaranteeing admission to the top 10 percent of the graduating class from any public or private high school. After a few years of hard work, diversity was restored and other states, including California and Florida, adopted similar approaches. The law looked like a success.
 But the 10 percent rule, which seemed to skirt the tricky issue of race so deftly, is coming under increasing attack these days as many wealthy parents complain that their children are not getting a fair shake. A consensus seems to be building that some change is necessary. 
 Parents whose children have been denied admission to the University of Texas at Austin, the crown jewel of Texas higher education, argue that some high schools are better than others, and that managing to stay in the top 25 percent at a demanding school should mean more than landing in the top 10 percent at a less rigorous one. The dispute shows how hard it is to come up with a system for doling out precious but scarce spots in elite universities without angering someone.
 The president of the University of Texas at Austin, Dr. Larry R. Faulkner, says the law -- which has pulled students from rural areas and from battered urban schools onto his campus -- may need adjustment. The rule, he says, takes away discretion from the university's admissions office, making it harder to shape a class and ensure that certain kinds of students, like musicians, are included.
 He has endorsed the idea of capping the number of students who may be admitted under the rule at, perhaps, half of all first-year students.
 Gov. Rick Perry has also expressed concern, saying the rule was prompting qualified students to leave the state. ''I really don't see how it has worked the way people projected it would work,'' Governor Perry said this month. ''And I think, across the board, Texans see it as a problem.''
 Modifying the rule will be the subject of a State Senate committee hearing this month; the soonest any change is likely to be made is when the full Legislature meets early next year.
 What Texas decides may hold lessons for other states. The approach embodied by the law, which was passed while President Bush was governor, has been championed as a model by Rod Paige, the United States secretary of education.
 In many ways, the 10 percent rule has transformed the student population on the campus here. For one thing, the number of schools that send their graduates to the University of Texas has risen by a third, from just over 600 to more than 800.
 And, according to the admissions office, the new freshman class will be, for the first time, more diverse than classes were before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit struck down affirmative action in higher education in 1996.
 Of the 6,341 students who have sent in deposits so far, the university classifies 3,536 as Anglo, 298 as African-American, 1,146 as Hispanic and 1,128 as Asian. (In addition, 23 are classified as Native American and 210 as ''other.'')
 Opinions about the 10 percent rule do not fall neatly into predictable categories. While affirmative action -- historically used only at the state's two flagship schools, the University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M University -- drew harsh attacks from political conservatives, the 10 percent rule has critics and supporters from different places on the ideological spectrum.
 Any change in the rule raises the touchy subject of class, because those demanding change tend to be concerned about students at the state's elite high schools in wealthy areas, while defenders of the rule say they are worried about students from poorer rural and urban neighborhoods.
 ''It's a big-time social class story,'' said Marta Tienda, a Princeton University professor of sociology and public affairs who has studied the effects of the rule. ''School type is the proxy for social class.''
 Guidance counselors and administrators at rural schools question the motives behind changing the rule.
 ''The State of Texas has done a great thing by offering this opportunity to get our most gifted students into a challenging educational setting,'' said Cherri S. Franklin, principal of the public junior and senior high school in Marfa. ''And the rich people don't want them there.'' She emphasized that she was speaking for herself and not the school system.
 The school in Marfa, about 200 miles southeast of El Paso, is small, graduating about 30 students a year, so only a few become eligible under the rule, Ms. Franklin said. But without the rule, she said, that opportunity might vanish.
 Critics of the rule say that students from poor high schools without the resources of wealthier institutions are not ready for the work at an elite public university, and that too many graduates of high-powered high schools are leaving the state for college when they do not get into the University of Texas.
 ''Those kids are not prepared,'' said Douglas S. Craig, a lawyer in Houston whose son, Charles, was not accepted at the university. Charles Craig went to the University of Colorado at Boulder instead, Mr. Craig said, adding that getting into the top 10 percent at his son's selective private high school was very difficult. ''His class was two-thirds National Merit scholars and semifinalists. Their scores are all very, very high.''
 But Bruce Walker, vice provost and director of admissions at the University of Texas, said data collected by the university showed that students admitted under the 10 percent rule consistently get better grades than other students. Critics question that data, however, and argue that SAT scores are a better measure of students' abilities. The SAT scores of students in the top 10 percent there have fallen slightly over the last several years, according to the admissions office.
 Bianca Williams, 22, a graduating senior, said that some of her friends had struggled initially in college-level classes, but that they all adjusted and have done well.
 ''I felt like I was prepared,'' said Ms. Williams, who described her Houston high school, Klein Forest High, as economically and racially mixed. ''Just because you're from an inner-city school doesn't mean you're not equipped to handle'' the University of Texas, she added.
 Russell Lloyd, an incoming first-year student from an elite public high school in the Austin area, said the admissions process should take into account a high school's strengths and weaknesses. ''There ought to be a way to rework it so you can admit students from these small schools'' in poorer areas, he said, without penalizing students from elite public and private schools.
 Settling on an alternative to the 10 percent rule could be difficult. California, which has had a version of an automatic admissions system for years, may offer a useful example.
 For years, California guaranteed that those in the top 12.5 percent of graduating students statewide would be admitted to the University of California system, and since 2001, the state has extended that guarantee to students in the top 4 percent of their high school class. But students still must be admitted by a specific school, like Berkeley, while students in the top 10 percent in Texas can choose the school they attend. 
 Even so, because of a lack of money, California for the first time had to turn away more than 5,000 students who would have started next fall. Those students will be able to transfer into the system after two years at a community college.
 Neither in California nor in Florida have the rules generated the kind of opposition that has developed here.
 Todd Staples, a Texas state senator who has questioned the 10 percent rule, said he was not sure what kind of change would be appropriate.
 ''My senatorial district is sprawling across a part of 16 counties, from rural to suburban fast growth,'' Mr. Staples, a Republican, said. ''So I have a mixture of high schools that are impacted differently on this issue. My goal is to have a win-win policy.''
 As a result of Supreme Court decisions last year, the University of Texas plans to resume using race as a factor in admissions decisions, so it would have a way to maintain diversity independent of the 10 percent rule.
 At Texas A&M, which does not plan to use race as a criterion in undergraduate admissions, the president, Robert Gates, said he would support a cap on the 10 percent rule. More than half of his incoming class is selected automatically under the rule, but another quarter gets in under another automatic program for students who score at least 1300 out of a possible 1600 on the SAT and who are in the top half of their class.
 ''We only get to choose about a quarter of our freshman class based on looking at the whole person,'' Mr. Gates said. Outreach efforts over the past year have helped the school draw more minority students than in prior years, he added.
 State Senator Royce West, a Democrat from Dallas, predicted that reaching consensus on changes to the 10 percent rule would be difficult. Senator West, who heads the committee that will hold the hearing on the rule, conducted an end-of-session filibuster to block a cap on it. 
 ''I am not going to stand here and let this rule be abolished when it has not served its purpose yet,'' he said. He said any changes would have to continue some form of preference for students at schools that have historically been underrepresented.
 Mr. Walker of the University of Texas said, ''The only thing that would satisfy everyone is an open-door policy and an unlimited number of spaces.''

HEADLINE: NEWS AND ANALYSIS; Would a Stronger United Mean a Weaker Industry?

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
THE wounded on the battlefield are the most dangerous, according to the old saying, because they distract attention. Though said about war, it could apply to the airline industry, too, where the competitors of United Airlines face just such a hazard. 
 United, which filed for bankruptcy protection in December 2002, is expected to receive an answer soon on its application for $1.6 billion in federal loan guarantees. Though United says its bid for approval appears on track, some analysts have begun questioning whether its case is strong enough, given the cloudy atmosphere surrounding the troubled industry. Whether United wins or loses, competition among airlines will only become tougher, whether in fare wars or in the search for badly needed financing.
 Industry officials, including those at United, are nervous because they have no way to know when the Air Transportation Stabilization Board will rule -- or what it will decide. 
 Since its creation in 2001, the board, whose three members are from the Treasury Department, the Transportation Department and the Federal Reserve, has operated mostly in secrecy. It emerges only when it issues a ruling or, in rare cases, seeks more information from an airline seeking its assistance. 
 The board, which turned down United's original application for $1.8 billion in loans, sending it into bankruptcy protection, may be preparing to make its final decision about the airline. Its staff, though still seeking information from United, a unit of the UAL Corporation, has competed a number of interviews with industry officials and experts. 
 Just a month ago, the prevailing wisdom was that United's request for loan guarantees would be granted, with conditions. That thinking was spurred as much by politics as by the steps United had taken to streamline its operations. Its bid has had the tireless support of J. Dennis Hastert, the House speaker and a Republican of Illinois, the airline's home state.
 Perhaps emboldened by expectation, UAL's chief executive, Glenn F. Tilton, and his management team set off on a barnstorming publicity tour in May. Mr. Tilton said repeatedly that the airline had met the requirements for a loan -- and that it deserved it, given that it had cut labor costs $2.5 billion a year and had saved billions more in operating costs.
 But that may have been a premature victory lap. United also disclosed last month that fuel costs in 2004 would be $750 million more than it had projected. That news came only months after US Airways, which received a $900 million loan guarantee, the biggest so far, fell technically into default on its loans and was forced to renegotiate their terms.
 Moreover, United remains in a court battle with unsecured creditors over prices it pays to suppliers, although it reached agreement with its unions last week on another thorny issue, health care cuts for retirees. 
 A bankruptcy judge, Eugene R. Wedoff, is expected to act on United's request for more time to put its emergency plan in place. Mr. Tilton, who once said United might be able to exit bankruptcy protection by December 2003, now says this fall is more likely, assuming the loan application is approved.
 Approval is still the most likely outcome, industry officials grudgingly acknowledge, because United is a powerful economic force. It has 80,000 employees, many at its big operations in Chicago, Washington, San Francisco and Denver.
 If the loan guarantee is approved, the greatest impact may be on American Airlines, which is in a cutthroat battle with United at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, where together they control 80 percent of the traffic. Both have had their wrists slapped by the Transportation Department for packing in too many flights, prompting modest cutbacks.
 Yet American is in better shape, having cut its costs over the last year and wrested concessions from its unions on the threat of bankruptcy. Its operating costs are now lower than United's, according to an estimate by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services.
 Philip A. Baggaley, an airline analyst at S.&P., said he saw a strong possibility that United would have to make further cost cuts even if it got the loan guarantee, given the stiff competition from low-fare airlines.
 Those carriers have raised deep concerns about United's application, saying it would provide an unfair advantage. A replenished United would have more resources to battle them through its low-fare service, Ted, and cheaper tickets on mainline routes. 
 Executives at one airline, who insisted on anonymity, voiced alarm at some United fare cuts, which, for instance, have meant $60 one-way tickets between Salt Lake City and Cody, Wyo., a low-volume route that normally fetches top-dollar fares.
 These executives said United could hurt itself and rivals on routes that could be lucrative. Indeed, many in the industry say rising fuel expenses alone could cost United its bid for a loan, because it cannot offset those expenses elsewhere.
 If its bid does fail, one thing is clear: United will not vanish anytime soon. Airlines have hung on for years in bankruptcy protection, even surviving several filings; Continental sought protection twice, in the 1980's and early 1990's.
 In an interview last month, Mr. Tilton suggested that competitors might face a worse situation if United stayed in bankruptcy protection, where it is shielded from certain expenses and can always cut costs further.
 United says it has no Plan B. It must take that position publicly; otherwise it would technically not be eligible for a loan guarantee, reserved for airlines without access to capital markets. Yet it has undoubtedly been considering its alternatives. Mr. Tilton and UAL's chief financial officer, Frederic F. Brace III, have said United will emerge from bankruptcy ''one way or another.'' 
 To do so, it will eventually have to find capital. Its bankruptcy financing, already extended once, runs out at the end of this year, and it needs to come up with at least $2 billion to emerge on its own.
 A prospective lender could dictate severe cuts at the airline, which has steadfastly clung to its assets, even though Eastern, T.W.A. and others had to shed routes and operations in their ultimately unsuccessful struggle to survive. 
 United's drive to become solvent is also likely to threaten Delta Air Lines, which has warned that it, too, may have to seek bankruptcy protection unless its pilots' union agrees to cuts. There is no line of investors waiting to snap up airlines, so United and Delta could be dueling for risk takers.
 And a desperate but still-breathing United means that the rest of the industry reaps no benefit from a reduction in capacity, something that economists say is long overdue. In an interview last month, the chairman of Southwest Airlines, Herbert D. Kelleher, said the loan board had distorted the industry by interfering with supply and demand.
 As it tries to bounce back, United will face ever more treacherous skies, given the relentless push by low-fare airlines. Last week, JetBlue picked up options to buy 30 more Airbus planes, on top of 100 Embraer regional jets that it will add in coming months.
 Southwest is taking delivery of a dozen planes a month over the next few years, while AirTran, Spirit and others have new planes on the way.
 Mr. Kelleher, whose airline has not taken a stand on United's application, refused to discuss its prospects. But he said it would be dangerous for any airline to go into bankruptcy protection more than once.
 ''You soon run out of assets to finance outside,'' he said, ''and then it may become a question of what you have left.''
 That is a situation United hopes to avoid. Otherwise, instead of simply being an injured player, it could become the next victim.

HEADLINE: Betting on the Betrothing

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
SHORTLY after Jennifer Lopez married Marc Anthony on June 5, British bookmakers began offering 3-to-1 odds that the couple will divorce by the end of the year. On the other hand, the odds are 1 to 2 that Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher will marry by the end of December, said Warren Lush, the chief oddsmaker for the gaming company Ladbrokes of London.
 ''I've done Justin Timberlake and Cameron Diaz, at 5 to 1, to marry by the end of this year,'' Mr. Lush added. ''Obviously, we have done Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles.'' The chance of a royal wedding this year is 8 to 1. 
 Celebrity wedding wagers go back at least to 1980, when British bookmakers offered odds on when Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer would marry. Today, Ladbrokes says it takes in over 1 million pounds, or $1.8 million, from celebrity-related wagers annually. American regulators frown on the practice, but its popularity in the United States has risen with the availability of gambling on the Internet. 
 Gambling on the famous ''is very similar to betting on a football game,'' said William Eadington, an economics professor who studies gaming at the University of Nevada at Reno. While most marriages are not ''observable contests with well-defined rules,'' he added, bettors get a steady supply of information on celebrity couples through paparazzi and tabloid newspapers to help them make their wagers.
 Mr. Lush, too, said that calculating the odds, whether on a celebrity relationship or a horse race, is pretty much the same. He combs the tabloids for information, looks at prior performance (J. Lo has been divorced twice, Mr. Anthony once) and speaks to well-informed confidential sources. 
 Of course, sometimes the bookies are wrong. ''I assumed from the papers that David and Victoria Beckham had the safest marriage in show business,'' Mr. Lush said about the possibility of a divorce. ''I gave them 50 to 1 at the beginning of the year.'' But when rumors arose this spring that Mr. Beckham had once had an affair, Mr. Lush quickly cut the odds to 2 to 1. They have since risen to 8 to 1, as the Beckhams seem to be on firmer footing. ERIC DASH

HEADLINE: A New, Inclusive Europe Yawns, And Picks a Fresh Parliament

BYLINE: By CRAIG S. SMITH; Ariane Bernard contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: PARIS, June 13 

 BODY:
One of the world's biggest exercises in democracy the European Union's parliamentary elections -- concluded Sunday after a dismal turnout and with widespread apathy over the outcome. In many countries, though, the elections served as a rebuke to the incumbent government administrations.
 The elections, which were spread across 25 countries over four days, were less a referendum on Europe's future than a series of local popularity tests for hundreds of parties and thousands of politicians. Members of the European Parliament individually wield little power because, though the Parliament has the power to pass legislation, the process of writing laws at the European Union level depends largely on consensus building among the union's member states and consultations with governments at home. 
 Even in the union's newly minted members -- 10 countries joined on May 1 -- enthusiasm for the elections was muted. Participation was low in Latvia (about 40 percent), lower in the Czech Republic (around 25 percent) and lower still in Poland (less than 10 percent according to early estimates), the biggest of the union's new members.
 Nearly 350 million people were eligible to vote in the elections, in which nearly 14,700 candidates ran for 732 seats of the legislature, based in Strasbourg, France. It helps regulate European trade, helps set environmental, labor and transportation policies and helps decide how to spend the union's $120 billion annual budget. Candidates included many established politicians but also several professional athletes, two astronauts, a Nobel laureate and a pornography star.
 By late Sunday, preliminary results suggested that the Parliament, elected to a five-year term, would retain a center-right political cast, though issues at the European level played a minimal role in most of the elections.
 Voters in many countries used the poll to express their dissatisfaction with their incumbent governments.
 The voting in Britain, which took place on Thursday, was read by many as a protest against Prime Minister Tony Blair's support for the United States-led war in Iraq. A similar sentiment was expected from the polls in Italy, while Spanish voters were expected to reward the new government of Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. 
 In Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder's Social Democrats were on their way to their worst defeat in a quarter-century of direct European elections as voters cast ballots for the opposition to protest against the country's stalled economy and slashes in social benefits.
 Preliminary results also suggested that French voters were echoing the irritation during elections in April about shrinking social benefits. 
 Anecdotal evidence suggests, however, that such decisions were mostly emotional and had little to do with policy.
 ''I used my national beliefs and applied them to my European vote,'' ''said Elisabeth Castex, a 55-year-old doctor from Paris.
 More typical, perhaps, was Anne-Claire Gross, a 20-year-old native of Strasbourg. She said she did not vote and has ''no idea at all'' about what the Parliament does, even though it is the most important institution in her hometown.

HEADLINE: Among the Open's Hazards: Securing Rentals

BYLINE: By WARREN ST. JOHN

 BODY:
The eastern end of Long Island is known for its stately mansions, clean sea breezes and sweeping vistas over just-tilled farm land. But there is one thing it is not known for: megahotels of the sort that can be host to, say, 156 golfers and their caddies, families and friends should a big golf tournament come to town.
 It is for that reason that long before tournament organizers of the United States Open could get around to worrying about the precise texture of the greens, the heartiness of the rough or the consistency of the sand in Shinnecock's bunkers, they were working frantically to deal with a logistical complication New Yorkers and Hamptons denizens know all too well: the housing problem.
 ''Shinnecock is a lot more difficult than a lot of areas because of the lack of hotels,'' said Vicky Palmer, an account executive at the sports management firm IMG who handles accommodations for the firm's professional golfers. ''It's all economics.'' 
 The economics, of course, are driven by the fact that even in a year with no United States Open in Southampton, hotel rooms and houses for summer rentals are in short supply. To get a jump on the looming housing problem, two years ago the tournament blocked off hundreds of hotel rooms on the East End to accommodate golfers and tournament officials. They also sent word to local homeowners that they were looking for houses to rent. If homeowners were keen to do so, staff members from the United States Golf Association and from the offices of individual sports agents showed up with notepads to catalog the amenities.
 ''The Hamptons has everything from small cottages to homes with tennis courts and basketball courts and pools and rec rooms,'' Palmer said. ''There's a wide range.''
 Many pro golfers are wealthy, but a vast majority are members of the pro golf proletariat; they are not household names and have no significant sponsorship deals. For the United States Open, the U.S.G.A., which sponsors the tournament, put in place a form of price control to protect its golfers from the Hamptons gouge: a $5,000 limit on the amount homeowners could charge for a weekly house rental. That left homeowners in the Hamptons with a choice: they could hold out, and possibly get three to four times that from corporations in search of housing for their tournament guests, or take the sure money. 
 Palmer's pitch to homeowners was that golfers pose less of a risk, because they spend most of their time on the course and turn in early. Corporate guests, on the other hand, could be a bit rowdier.
 ''With a golfer there's not going to be a big party,'' she said. ''But you're not going to make as much money.''
 About half the players in this week's tournament are renting houses for the week, said Tricia Solo, the manager of the United States Open. That is a much higher percentage than for most tournaments, where most golfers simply stay in hotels. Some players are soloists, while others pack in family members and caddies. Caddies left to fend for themselves, Solo said, are piling into homes in a manner similar to the typical overcrowded Hamptons share, where beds are first-come, first served.
 In the old days, it was not unusual for club members to vie to be host to certain celebrity golfers, while the others were left to fend for themselves. These days, the U.S.G.A. pursues a more equitable course: everyone pays, and unless a member has a relationship to a particular player, the homeowners are expected to clear out. 
 It does not always work out that way. The biggest complication in the arrangements between golfers and their hosts, Palmer said, ''is the homeowners try to come up with an excuse so they can meet the golfer, like, 'Oh, I forgot this or that and I need to come and get it.'''
 Homeowners who are vetted by the U.S.G.A. are also expected to sign confidentiality agreements. Solo said disputes between golfers and homeowners have been rare. Occasionally, though, she said homeowners will make a last-minute price increase, just as a golfer shows up at the door, presumably on the hunch that the golfer will have few options and will give in. For such situations, she said, tournaments keep a supply of backup hotel rooms.
 Palmer said there can be other unexpected complications. One client showed up at his rental near Augusta National before the Masters last year only to discover that all the beds in the home were waterbeds. He was provided with other arrangements.
 Some golfers forgo the entire housing problem by taking their homes directly to the golf courses, in the form of recreational vehicles. 
 Davis Love III rides to tournaments in a motor home that cost about $1.3 million; it sleeps four comfortably, has a satellite television, high-speed Internet access, a full-size refrigerator, a washer and dryer and a plasma television, amenities on a par with the best Hamptons beach rental.
 ''The main thing is to be able to play better, and to spend more time with my family,'' said Love, who is married with two children. ''After 9/11, travel is so much harder, and this makes it easier. You don't have to worry about missing flights, losing luggage, things like that I have my bed, my pillows, and I can go week after week without having to pack and unpack. It's like having an apartment.''

HEADLINE: New Jersey Bounce Helps Lead Region Toward a Recovery

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

 BODY:
The economic powerhouse leading the region out of the doldrums of recession and unemployment, adding new jobs at a rapid clip and winnowing its jobless rate to near prerecession levels, turns out to be New Jersey. 
 Sure, Wall Street had a good year last year, racking up $16.8 billion in profits after several bust years, and New York City has begun to recoup some of the nearly quarter-million jobs it lost in more than 30 months of recession. 
 Yes, the signs of a nascent recovery in New York are everywhere and modestly robust, with sales of everything from Broadway tickets to blue jeans rising steadily. 
 That is all the good news. But New York is not even close to keeping up with its neighbor across the Hudson River. 
 ''New Jersey is surging ahead,'' said Joseph J. Seneca, an economist at Rutgers University and chairman of the New Jersey Council of Economic Advisors.
 Of almost 60,000 new jobs in the region between March 2003 and March 2004, two-thirds were created in New Jersey, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The state has added nearly 60,000 jobs in the past year, recouping almost all of its jobs lost in the recession, Professor Seneca said. 
 Companies across the state -- from tiny Heliport Systems of Morristown, a four-person firm that builds helicopter landing pads for hospitals and is adding another engineer because it is so busy (it cannot take on any new work until 2006), to big pharmaceutical and financial firms -- are adding workers, according to economists and employment agencies.
 ''These companies are blossoming over there,'' said Edward Fleischman, president of the Execu/Search Group, a staffing company based in Manhattan that has clients in New Jersey. ''It's unbelievable what is going on down there.''
 New York City has added just 12,600 new jobs since April 2003, according to the State Department of Labor, and is still more than 200,000 jobs short of its employment peak, which came in December 2000. 
 In April, the last month for which data is available, New Jersey's unemployment rate was 5.3 percent, compared to New York's 7.5 percent, according to figures released by each state's Labor Department. 
 New Jersey ranked 4th in the nation in job creation over the past year, Professor Seneca said, well ahead of New York, which ranked 10th, and New Jersey was the only Northeastern state to crack the top five. 
 New Jersey also did better than any other locale in the region, beating out the Westchester, Connecticut and Long Island suburbs. In terms of job creation, it is beating the national economy, too. Of the 2.6 million jobs shed nationally since January 2001, 1.4 million have been regained, a little more than half. 
 But rather than being an anomaly, economists say, New Jersey's rapid growth is a return to the norm after an unusual period in which New York overtook its neighbor to the west. 
 ''It was unusual in the late 1990's that New York City was growing faster than New Jersey,'' said Jason Bram, regional economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ''It was driven by the financial sector and the dot-com sector. To some extent, New York City was operating above full capacity in late 1990's. If you look at almost any decade, you see New Jersey growing a bit faster than New York.''
 By one important measure, New York City's economy has not grown appreciably since 1950. That year, there were about 3.5 million workers in the city, roughly the same number as there are today.
 New Jersey has been adding jobs at the rate of 50,000 a year since World War II, more than doubling its work force. In 1950 the state had 1.7 million workers; it now has more than 4 million. 
 Of course, New Jersey in 1950 had plenty of land for new businesses and residents, whereas New York City in 1950 was already quite full. Another important difference between the two states is that New Jersey's economy -- unlike New York's, which is dominated by Wall Street -- is diverse and less susceptible to sudden shocks, like the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001. 
 ''I think what that really speaks to was how hard New York was hit'' in the recession of 2001 and 2002, said Timothy A. Blake, an analyst at Moody's Investor Service who follows the regional economy. ''New Jersey's employment numbers did not come down nearly as much as New York's. They have a more balanced economy, which is not as tied to the financial services sector. They have the pharmaceutical sector, which has been much more consistent, and it has a big telecom sector and a biotech sector as well.''
 New York's fortunes, by contrast, rise and fall largely with Wall Street, he said. 
 And historically, economists say, New Jersey's wealth and job creation would simply not exist to the extent they have were it not for the humming economic engine of the New York financial industry. 
 A good portion of the growth in Jersey City and other communities near Lower Manhattan, for example, has come from Wall Street overflow, with firms relocating so-called back-office workers to New Jersey. New York City's loss has often been New Jersey's gain, said Robert Kurtter, who tracks the city economy for Moody's Investor Service. 
 ''It is a bedroom community for New York and Philadelphia, so consequently it is an area that has benefited from suburbanization from both cities, and has also benefited from companies that suburbanized as well.''
 But in a larger sense, New Jersey's economy survived the recession better and recovered more quickly because New York's role as the beating heart of the regional economy, pumping money into suburbs in the form of Wall Street bonuses and stock options, has steadily declined, said Marc M. Goloven, senior regional economist for J.P. Morgan Chase and the author of a monthly newsletter on the city economy. 
 In the past, ''when New York City fell into a protracted economic slump, we all received an equal opportunity clobbering,'' Mr. Goloven said. ''This time it did not happen that way. It is as if there has been a figurative sea wall built around five boroughs beyond which New York City's recessionary tide did not spread. No longer are the overarching tentacles of New York City's economy felt everywhere.''

HEADLINE: Military Bases in Germany

 BODY:
The Pentagon is proposing sharp cuts in U.S. forces in Germany, which for more than half a century has been America's biggest military outpost in Europe. It's a bad idea, particularly at a time when the United States is struggling to rebuild its relations with its NATO allies.
 Washington is hoping to cut its military presence in Germany -- a little more than 70,000 soldiers -- roughly in half. Two heavy divisions now based there, and the soldiers' families, would return to the United States. They would be replaced by a much smaller light combat brigade, while other units would be rotated in and out, at considerable cost, for short-term exercises. The Air Force is also thinking of moving some of its F-16 fighter jets from Germany to Turkey, where they would be closer to Middle East trouble spots but subject to restrictions by the host government. 
 The large American military presence in Germany has long symbolized the understanding at the heart of NATO -- Washington's commitment to remain permanently engaged in Europe's security and to integrate its military operations with those of its major European allies. Recent history has only reinforced how important that relationship is to the United States. NATO is the only alliance capable of sharing some of the global military burdens that have now overstretched America's ground forces.
 Many Germans, remembering Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's scornful ''old Europe'' put-downs of their country last year, will see these withdrawals, and the accompanying German job losses, as payback for Berlin's diplomatic opposition to the invasion of Iraq. Washington denies that. But the Pentagon does seem to have a growing preference for stationing troops either at home or on the territories of allies ready to embrace President Bush's notions of unilateral preventive war.
 Despite its criticisms of the Iraq war, Germany imposed no restrictions on the use of American bases during that conflict. It continues to deploy thousands of German soldiers to protect those bases, freeing American troops for other uses. Berlin also contributes $1 billion a year to the bases' support. Economically, the plan to bring the soldiers home is a loser.
 The German bases have other advantages as well. They are much closer to the Middle East and Central Asia than bases in the United States and are in a safe country with a stable democracy and the modern conveniences that make life easier for troops on long tours overseas. Soldiers stationed there have access to a variety of training exercises and can enjoy down time with their families. The American military hospital at Ramstein Air Base, the largest outside the United States, provides specialized care for battlefield casualties from Iraq and Afghanistan as it did for those from Bosnia, Kosovo and the U.S.S. Cole. 
 There is nothing sacrosanct about maintaining particular Army divisions in Germany. The role of American military forces there has evolved considerably over the decades -- from occupying a defeated enemy to deterring Warsaw Pact aggression to symbolizing Washington's post-cold-war commitment to remain militarily engaged in Europe. Along the way, the size of the American presence has evolved as well. In the nearly 15 years since the Berlin Wall fell, United States force levels in Germany have dropped by roughly 75 percent. Further reductions should not be ruled out. But the Pentagon's current plans are unduly drastic, unfortunately timed and suspiciously motivated.

HEADLINE: Putting Students First

BYLINE: By Thomas E. Petri. 
Thomas E. Petri, Republican of Wisconsin, is a member of the House of Representatives.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Republicans in Congress will soon have an opportunity to show that they value efficiency over ideology: they can increase student aid without adding to government spending. When they vote to renew the federal Higher Education Act, which expires this year, lawmakers should use the opportunity to strengthen the direct student loan program.
 For years Republicans have supported the government's other loan program, the expensive guaranteed student loan program, because it uses banks as middlemen, and too many of my colleagues believe private enterprise is always better than a government program. But the direct loan program, which lends directly to students from the United States Treasury, has proved to be far less costly. Greater use of this program would free up resources that could be used to provide students with more money. 
 I recognize the efficiency with which market forces and for-profit businesses operate. So when I entered Congress in 1979, I was inclined to believe that a student loan program that encourages private banks to lend is a better deal for taxpayers than the government lending directly. But then I learned how our guaranteed student loan program works. No fiscal conservative or free-market supporter could justify embracing it.
 Consider an analogy. A friend asks you to lend him some money. You want to help him, but instead of lending him the money yourself, you ask a bank to do it. You'll guarantee the bank is paid back (plus interest) and even kick in extra money to ensure the bank makes a nice profit. Seeing a deal, the bank agrees, and your friend gets his loan. Over the next year the bank collects its principal and interest, along with the extra money you agreed to contribute.
 This is how the federal government provides loans to college students under the guaranteed program. For banks, it's a guaranteed return -- and profit -- with almost no risk.
 This is hardly a market-oriented approach; it's more like a government-assistance program for lenders. Tax dollars even go toward special payments that ensure banks don't lose money when interest rates rise. What's more, interest paid on the loans is set in law, above lenders' costs. And if a borrower defaults on a loan, banks have a government guarantee that they will get their money back. Because of that guarantee, banks have no incentive to spend resources trying to collect from difficult borrowers -- and taxpayers end up subsidizing private agencies to recover bad loans.
 Most of these rules, by the way, are set by Congress; no market forces are involved. Moreover, no competitive bidding takes place to determine who can provide the loans at the lowest cost to taxpayers. All banks are entitled to the same subsidies.
 There is a simpler and less costly way to help students get loans. The government provides about a third of current federal college loans by raising capital through the sale of Treasury bonds -- a remarkably efficient process -- and then lending it directly to students. There's no need to subsidize banks or private guarantee agencies. And all major functions under direct lending are run by private companies through competitively bid contracts, minimizing the costs to taxpayers.
 As one would imagine, the savings under the direct loan program are immense, actually earning money for the Treasury in some years. Over and over, government budget analysts -- both in Congress and at the White House -- have concluded that direct loans cost the government far less (including the costs of contracting with the private sector for loan collection) than guaranteed loans.
 My fiscally conservative colleagues must learn to cast aside their prejudices and support this low-cost alternative to guaranteed loans. Saving taxpayers money should not be a partisan issue.

HEADLINE: In Race to Give Power to Iraqis, Electricity Lags

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, June 13 

 BODY:
Tripped up by problems ranging from sabotage to its reliance on by-the-book engineering, the United States has failed by a wide margin to meet its long-stated goal of reviving Iraq's electricity output for the start of the searing summer.
 The American-led occupation missed its goal by as much as 30 percent, starving air-conditioners, lights, factories and oil pumps. That has damaged the occupation's efforts to foster stability and good will among a populace already traumatized by the failure to guarantee their security.
 The goal, one of the American-led civilian administration's highest priorities, was set soon after occupation forces overran the country in the spring of 2003. It seemed within reach, but with little progress so far, the occupation is now talking about succeeding well into this summer. 
 The United Nations estimated that before the war, Iraq could produce 4,500 megawatts of electricity at any given time. With the fighting and looting, the production capacity plunged wildly, before beginning to rebound.
 Capacity has been stuck in a range around 4,000 megawatts for months. Not only is that less than during the Saddam Hussein era, but it is also far below the American promise of 6,000 megawatts.
 Even if that level is attained, demand is leapfrogging higher. That could portend a difficult season, just when the interim government takes up its duties and tries to claim popular support.
 The reasons for the shortfall are both obvious and subtle. They include insurgents' attacks on plants and power lines, the harassment and killing of engineers, pullouts by companies doing repair work, and problems finding spare parts for outdated Iraqi equipment.
 Some Iraqis also complain that Western engineers have been unable to grasp the complexities of a creaky electrical grid that is a patchwork of ancient Russian, German, Yugoslavian, Chinese and American equipment. The Iraqis say that the engineers, often Americans, reflexively reach for fancy new gear costing tens of millions of dollars that can take months or years to order, ship and install.
 Iraqis are skilled at balancing the vast swirl of electrical supply and demand on their grid with phone calls and intuition, while Americans rely on computerized sensors and automatic control circuitry.
 The Iraqi way of doing business is equally strange to American engineers. Beneath a yellowed, sagging drop ceiling in the control room of one electricity plant in Baghdad, a swarm of technicians in grimy blue jumpsuits laughed at a man sleeping on cardboard as an alarm for high oil temperature in an ancient turbine began to sound.
 Another man sat finishing a cigarette, his feet in a puddle of dirty oil, before throwing the glowing butt into the middle of the puddle and then crushing it out. A nearby banner called for revenge for the death of Imam Hussein, a martyr of the year 680. Meanwhile, two huge turbines groaned away, and workers struggled to fix another.
 The shortage has left ordinary Iraqis seething, particularly in Baghdad. The city was generously supplied with electricity at the expense of the rest of the country under Saddam Hussein, but now receives a more proportional share of the smaller pie, and is subject to frequent cutoffs.
 ''They said early March, and then they said early May, and finally they said early June the electricity would be perfect,'' said Feras al-Rubae, a money changer who sat sullenly in his shop in the middle-class shopping district of Outer Karada during a power failure. ''But now it is early June, and where is the promise?''
 As for how important electricity is for resuming a normal life and getting his business back on its feet, Mr. Rubae said: ''I would put it first. No. 1.''
 As reconstruction money flows in, that importance to the political and economic life of Iraq has hardly been overlooked.
 L. Paul Bremer III, the top American administrator in Iraq, has long emphasized the importance of restoring electricity, engineers and construction managers said. In an interview last Monday, Mr. Bremer said it was for that reason that $5.5 billion of last fall's $18.4 billion emergency spending bill was apportioned to restoring electrical power.
 ''It's quite important, mostly because, first of all, it affects our capacity to deal with other problems like being able to pump oil,'' Mr. Bremer said. Electricity is needed to produce the oil, exports of which are the lifeblood of the economy.
 Besides that, Mr. Bremer said, ''it's important because it affects the lives of ordinary Iraqis.''
 The money from the emergency bill comes on top of hundreds of millions of dollars that were dedicated to the power grid last year. The United States Agency for International Development budgeted $1.3 billion for work on the grid, and $500 million of that was budgeted earlier last year.
 The United States Army Corps of Engineers, which began some of its work as early as the spring of 2003, has budgeted $1.36 billion for electrical work.
 Estimates of the ultimate cost of restoring the Iraqi grid have varied wildly. In an assessment last year, the United Nations and the World Bank estimated that Iraq would need about $12 billion to repair its electrical system through 2007. The Iraqi electricity ministry has quoted numbers as high as $35 billion for the overall cost, without giving specific dates.
 The money is being spent rapidly, but the goal is unmet. Mr. Bremer said he now expected capacity to reach 6,000 megawatts during the summer. (By contrast, a single American plant often produces 1,000 megawatts, and production in Texas can soar to 60,000 megawatts during an exceptionally hot day.)
 Tom Crangle, the Coalition Provisional Authority's acting senior adviser for electricity, said, ''We see the air-conditioners in the back of pickup trucks, and we see a lot more economic activity. So we're chasing an upwardly rising target.''
 The lower-than-expected output was the result of ''a combination of factors,'' said Mr. Crangle, who was a senior manager at the Tennessee Valley Authority, the largest public power company in the United States. 
 Rebuilding older generators, ordinarily time-consuming, has been drawn out further after engineers discovered that Saddam Hussein's government had left them in a decrepit state, Mr. Crangle said. Importing new generators into a country in chaos meant new challenges.
 Sabotage has been directed at transmission lines, power plants and some oil and gas pipelines that provide fuel for the plants. According to an internal Iraqi government report obtained by The New York Times last week, more than 100 of the main electrical lines and nearly 1,200 of the towers supporting them have been damaged or destroyed since the invasion.
 Mr. Crangle said that about 90 percent of that damage has been repaired, and that the destruction from new attacks is being fixed nearly as fast as it occurs. 
 A Web site of the Coalition Provisional Authority used to give daily scores of electricity production beginning Aug. 1, 2003. But it abruptly stopped giving updates on May 18, when the peak production was listed at 4,039 megawatts.
 Officials of the Coalition Provisional Authority say they halted the updates so that saboteurs could not see the impact of their strikes. 
 In an interview this month, Abdul Wahab, chief engineer at the General Establishment for Electricity Generation within the Iraqi Ministry of Electricity, said that current production was running at just under 4,000 megawatts, but that because of damaged transmission lines, not all of that could be delivered and used.
 A spokesman for the provisional authority, Dallas Lawrence, said Iraq was producing 4,273 megawatts on June 7, compared with 3,222 megawatts exactly one year before. 
 ''No matter how you dice this,'' Mr. Lawrence wrote in an e-mail message, ''either by peak megawatts or by megawatt-hours, we are providing 24 to 25 percent more power today than one year ago.'' 
 But those numbers failed to impress many Iraqis.
 ''The Americans, all of them, move very slowly,'' said Raad al-Haris, the deputy minister of electricity. ''We thought before that the Americans will do some excellent job and they can cover the demand,'' he said, spitting out the words in slightly imperfect English. ''But until now,'' he said, his voice rising, ''we have only peanut.''
 Mr. Haris, the deputy minister, said that demand was running at just over 5,000 megawatts and that he expected it to rise to 7,000 this summer. Mr. Wahab, the chief engineer, said demand could soar even more, to 8,000 megawatts.
 ''In July and August there will be a huge demand,'' said Raqi Rahem, director of the Baghdad South power plant. 
 Although some Iraqis congratulate the Americans and their allies for technical successes, like replacing hundreds of the damaged transmission towers and shipping new parts that were unobtainable under Mr. Hussein, many others suggest that engineers from economically developed countries do not have the jury-rigging skills of Iraqi colleagues.
 Iraqis engineers are masters at taking from one damaged piece of equipment to make another piece work. Instead of employing the careful American method of erecting wooden poles to support lines while towers were rebuilt, Mr. Crangle noted with undisguised admiration, Iraqis had found a way to do it safely with mobile cranes.
 Carrying out a project by the book, with brand-new equipment, ''might take you six months,'' said Saad Shakir Tawfiq, an engineer at the Iraqi Ministry of Industry who is involved with several power plants.
 ''You need power because it's the people's lives,'' Dr. Tawfiq said. ''I don't care about the book; you need power. Just do it, the basics, with what you've got.''

HEADLINE: Saudi Security Forces Search for a Missing American

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR

DATELINE: CAIRO, June 13 

 BODY:
The Saudi Arabian security services hunted Sunday for an American electronics engineer believed kidnapped in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, during a seemingly choreographed operation in which one of his American colleagues was shot dead elsewhere in the city.
 The kidnapping, which would be the first of its kind in Saudi Arabia, and the rising toll of dead Westerners raise the stakes in the militants' goal of driving non-Muslims from the kingdom, damaging its economy and causing the collapse of the ruling family.
 Most of the details about the kidnapping of the American, Paul M. Johnson Jr., a specialist in Apache helicopters who is originally from New Jersey, came from a statement posted on an Islamist Web site by a group called Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which has claimed responsibility for much of the violence of the past two months.
 ''They don't really know much about it right now,'' the man's son, Paul M. Johnson III, said in a telephone interview from Florida, referring to efforts by the State Department and the Saudi authorities to find his father. ''They said that they are trying to follow leads.'' 
 The younger Mr. Johnson said he spoke to his father last weekend and although his father expressed concerns about the mounting violence, he did not say anything about being worried about his own safety.
 Mr. Johnson, an employee of Lockheed Martin, had worked in Saudi Arabia at a local company whose specialty included manufacturing elements of electronic warfare systems. One of the company's American employees, Kenneth Scroggs, was shot in the back outside his home in a Riyadh residential neighborhood on Saturday afternoon, becoming the third Westerner gunned down in a week and the 29th killed since May 1.
 A statement on Sunday from the company, Advanced Electronics, said the slain man was the firm's business development manager, who had worked there for 12 years, training some of its Saudi staff members. Advanced Electronics was portrayed on the Web site of the Saudi Embassy in Washington as an example of a successful small Saudi private company.
 But what apparently drew the attention of the militants was the company's work with military aircraft, specifically the Apache helicopter.
 ''Everybody knows that these helicopters are used by the Americans, their Zionist allies and the apostates to kill Muslims, terrorizing them and displacing them in Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq,'' said the Web site statement by the group claiming responsibility for the kidnapping.
 The man who was kidnapped, Mr. Johnson, 49, had a picture of an Apache helicopter on his business card, which was posted on the Web site notice announcing his abduction, along with a Saudi driver's license that said he worked in a military area. The card listed his specialties, including a pilot night-vision system for the helicopters.
 The kidnappers' statement threatened Mr. Johnson with violence like that suffered by Iraqi prisoners held by the American military at Abu Ghraib prison. It referred to him as a Christian ''parasite,'' using an obscure Arabic word made popular by the former spokesman for Saddam Hussein's government. 
 Mr. Johnson's business card identified him as an employee of Lockheed Martin, but the telephone number was for Advanced Electronics. The company did not respond to telephone or e-mail messages on Sunday.
 In the United States, Lockheed Martin confirmed that Mr. Johnson was an employee and was believed kidnapped, but a company spokesman had no other details.
 The militants' statement said Mr. Johnson was one of four experts in Saudi Arabia working on the helicopter systems. Mr. Johnson, whose son said he had worked in the kingdom for more than a decade, was apparently grabbed from his car, which was found abandoned.
 In addition to his son, Mr. Johnson has a daughter, three grandchildren and a former wife living in Florida. His current wife, a Thai citizen, was with him in Saudi Arabia, his son said. ''It is just a wait-and-see thing,'' said the younger Mr. Johnson, 28. ''I am praying that everything is going to work out. I just want him to be safe.''
 The militants' Web site statement did not identify Mr. Scroggs, but noted that the other American had been killed at his house.
 The kidnapping and killing showed signs of careful planning, as the American Embassy noted in a new statement to residents warning them about the growing threat.
 ''The recent terrorist attacks on Westerners in Riyadh appear to have involved extensive planning and preparation and were likely preceded by extensive pre-attack surveillance,'' the embassy said in a warning to all American citizens to be on the lookout for strangers following them.
 Only one militant has been arrested in a string of violent attacks, including four recent shootings in Riyadh and the attack on a Western expatriate compound in Khobar on May 29, which left 22 people dead, including 19 foreigners. One of the four Saudi gunmen was captured but the others have eluded capture.
 Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, appearing on Sunday news programs in the United States, said there was a ''dangerous situation'' in Saudi Arabia but that the country was not unraveling. He said the Saudis could be doing more to fight terrorism, but praised their efforts thus far.
 ''They can build up their forces; there is probably more that we can do with respect to intelligence exchange,'' Mr. Powell said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' The American Embassy greatly reduced its staff in April and suggested then that all Americans leave.
 ''The Saudis now know that they have a very serious problem within the kingdom and they know that it is going to require all their resources -- not only their military and police resources,'' Mr. Powell said. ''They have to cut off funding to the kinds of organizations that might have given comfort to these sorts of terrorists activities.''
 Material posted on Islamist Web sites late Saturday included images that seemed to show the shooting death of a third American, Robert Jacobs, 62, apparently singled out because he worked for the Vinnell Corporation, an American company training the Saudi National Guard.
 Mr. Jacobs was killed last Tuesday at his home in Riyadh. The short videotape, introduced as the ''beheading of a Jewish American,'' opens inside a garage in which a man is heard yelling in English, ''No, no, please!'' before shots ring out and a heavyset Westerner tumbles to the ground in one corner of the frame.
 Two gunmen then rush to his side and fire an additional 10 or so shots into the man's back, then kneel and make a cutting motion as if beheading him. Everything was filmed from the back of the action, and there were no reports at the time that Mr. Jacobs had been beheaded. It was impossible to verify the authenticity of the videotape.
 The violence over the past six weeks has prompted a steady stream of Westerners to quit Saudi Arabia, although it is difficult to gauge the extent of the flow, and American businesspeople say it has not become an exodus. The kingdom, with a population of 17 million people, relies on some 6 million foreign workers, but most are laborers.
 The approximately 35,000 Americans and 30,000 Britons are the largest Western groups, most working in the oil or financial sectors. Westerners tend to be employed in the more technical engineering aspects of oil production, like oil field management, so their departure would not immediately affect the vast Saudi oil output, but might in the longer term.

HEADLINE: A Mighty Diva's Humbling Fall To Rough Roots In the Projects

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
How you gonna keep a girl down in the projects after she's seen Park Avenue? That's the high-concept question posed by ''Fabulation or, the Re-Education of Undine,'' the busy, robustly entertaining comedy by Lynn Nottage that opened last night at the Peter Jay Sharp Theater at Playwrights Horizons.
 It's true that this satiric tale of the humbling of a self-invented public relations diva trades neatly on a well-worn chick-flick formula: career-driven, glamorous woman forced to confront the lowly life she thought she had left behind. (Think of Reese Witherspoon in ''Sweet Home Alabama'' or, if your memory stretches farther, Diana Ross in ''Mahogany.'')
 But while ''Fabulation'' may follow a much-traveled route to a guaranteed destination, the view along the way is far less predictable. In charting the social fall and moral rise of Undine Barnes Calles, nee Sharona Watkins, ''Fabulation'' subverts its comic and sentimental glibness with punchy social insights and the firecracker snap of unexpected humor. 
 It has been a very good year for Ms. Nottage, whose ''Intimate Apparel'' recently won best play from the New York Drama Critics Circle. A gentle, historically rich portrait of an African-American seamstress in New York in 1905, ''Intimate Apparel'' showed a narrative grace and economy rarely evident in Ms. Nottage's earlier work (''Mud, River, Stone,'' ''Por'Knockers''), which tended to bombast on self-consciously important topics.
 ''Fabulation'' lacks the structural cleanness and symmetry of ''Intimate Apparel.'' Staged by Kate Whoriskey, with a lively ensemble that exults in quick-sketch characterization, Ms. Nottage's latest offering is a sprawling, picaresque play that could benefit from tightening. But it also possesses a freedom of imagination that ''Intimate Apparel'' barely hinted at. While both works deal with disorienting social flux and imprisoning ethnic stereotypes, it is their differences that bode so well for Ms. Nottage's creative future. It seems that having found her feet as a playwright, she is not about to stand in one place.
 You wouldn't necessarily intuit this from the opening scene, in which Undine (an intense Charlayne Woodard) is presented as the kind of social-climbing businesswoman who shows up regularly in sitcoms. The head of a public relations firm -- ''catering to the vanity and confusion of the African-American nouveau riche,'' as she puts it -- Undine is given to barking familiarly fatuous commands to her secretary. (''If you can't find a celebrity, you get me someone celebritylike!'')
 Then Undine's accountant shows up to tell her that her handsome gigolo of a husband has vamoosed with her money. And who and what Undine encounters on her subsequent drop from the top often has the exhilarating dizziness of Alice's fall down the rabbit hole.
 Undine returns to the Brooklyn housing development where she grew up, to the family she hasn't seen in 14 years. Her mother, father and brother, Flow, now work as security guards, while her grandmother is a sweet old thing whose vagueness arises not from senility but from heroin. Having reluctantly agreed to buy ''white lace'' for Grandma, Undine is arrested and ordered to join a drug therapy group.
 ''My entire life,'' she tells the audience, ''has been engineered to avoid this very moment.''
 Ms. Nottage graphs the distance between surface and substance to convey the fluidness of identity in a whirling, people-eating society. There are the great pretenders from Undine's glamour days, like her pal Allison (formerly Tameka Jo Green of Harlem, who ''aspired to the black bourgeoisie after a family trip to New Rochelle'') and a rapper boyfriend named Mo' Dough.
 But more surprising are the denizens of Undine's Brooklyn, from the prison cellmate who is not the hooker everyone assumes her to be to the jump-rope champions of Undine's youth, the Double Dutch Twins, who have taken divergent paths to adulthood. A sense of blurred lines between aspiration and actuality is given ingeniously varied life throughout.
 This dualism is evident in the grandmother's heroin-fueled escapism, in Flow's unfinished epic poem about Br'er Rabbit and in the ways Undine keeps being transformed by the perception of others. When she makes up a history of drug abuse to fit in with her therapy group she tells us, ''I am touched by my own invention and regret not having experienced the emotions firsthand.''
 The punch lines rarely come when and how you expect them to, giving ''Fabulation'' a welcome syncopated breeziness. The seven supporting cast members, who include Myra Lucretia Taylor (late of ''Nine''), have a delightful time portraying what feels like half the population of New York, and Walt Spangler's set admirably summons urban bedlam on a tiny stage.
 Ms. Woodard, known for autobiographical performance pieces like ''Pretty Fire,'' is better at sincerity than parody. The play is burdened by overextended monologues. And Ms. Whoriskey's direction, while admirable in its affection for shaggy-dog diffuseness, could use sharper punctuation.
 None of these flaws keep ''Fabulation'' from being one of the livelier comedies available at the moment. And while the play trafficks in social burlesque and caricature, its human warmth and restless imagination mean that it never exists only on the surface.
 It is typical of the show's generosity that dopey Flow's poem about Br'er Rabbit turns out to be pretty compelling. The final verse captures the essence of a play that defines contemporary life as a distorting hall of mirrors:
 ''It's a circle that been run. That ain't no one ever won. It that silly rabbit grin, 'bout runnin' from your skin.''

HEADLINE: Senate Committee Questions Actions By Smithsonian

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
Documents provided by the Smithsonian Institution to the Senate Finance Committee suggest that the museum lent credence to an 10-fold increase in the value of four Stradivari instruments donated in 1997 without any formal independent appraisals. The instruments were said to be worth $50 million, a figure that has been challenged by some experts.
 The high-profile gift, one of the museum's largest ever, allowed its donor, Herbert R. Axelrod, a New Jersey businessman, to claim what his lawyer confirmed was a tax break of around $32 million. Mr. Axelrod fled to Cuba in March after being indicted on unrelated charges of tax evasion. 
 Smithsonian documents relating to the Axelrod gifts were requested by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the chairman of the committee, which is looking into whether donors nationwide are inflating the value of such gifts as tax dodges. The Senate committee is to hold hearings on the tax implications of inflated values of charitable contributions on June 22 in Washington. 
 The internal Smithsonian documents were attached to a four-page cover letter dated May 19 from Lawrence M. Small, the Smithsonian's secretary. Mr. Small wrote that the museum did not provide donors with appraisals or fair market valuations of donations, citing its policy as industry standard, endorsed by the American Association of Museums. ''While the I.R.S. is ultimately responsible for enforcement of the tax laws,'' he wrote, ''the Smithsonian would never condone or ignore any attempt to commit fraud.'' 
 By law, institutions that accept such gifts have no duty to inquire into either their value or into the tax deductions taken by donors, and the art world has fought proposals to hold the institutions accountable for facilitating tax fraud through donations. 
 ''The letter raises more questions than it answers,'' Senator Grassley said in a written response to a request for comment, adding, ''I want to understand why the Smithsonian refers to values of these instruments that are all over the map.'' 
 Linda St. Thomas, a spokeswoman for the Smithsonian, said the senator had been sent the museum's complete file on the Axelrod Quartet, as the instruments have come to be known. She said the museum had also turned over documents to those investigating Mr. Axelrod's unrelated tax evasion charge and added that the Smithsonian was not under investigation. She declined further comment. 
 Mr. Axelrod's lawyer, Michael Himmel, was interviewed several times since last month and declined to comment on the documents.
 The Axelrod Quartet consists of two Stradivari violins, one viola and one cello, all made between 1677 and 1709. Each instrument has decorative inlays, with three decorated by Stradivari himself. In a move that has provoked controversy, Mr. Axelrod had decals applied to the cello to make it appear part of a matched set.
 The internal Smithsonian documents suggest that from April 1986, when Mr. Axelrod lent the instruments to the museum, to December 1997, when the gift was formally made, the value placed on the instruments kept going up, from about $5 million to $55 million. 
 In an April 1986 memo, Gary Sturm, a curator of stringed instruments at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History and the key figure in bringing the quartet to the museum, wrote that the insurance for them ''would be roughly for something in the neighborhood of a $5 million market value.'' 
 In June 1988 a memo from the museum's registrar to Mr. Sturm asked ''if Mr. Axelrod is going to raise the value of the instruments,'' adding that the insurance department ''would want an appraisal in order to raise the value.'' 
 A Sept. 11, 1997, memo from an employee in the Smithsonian office of membership development cited the ''estimated value of Strad quartet'' at $25 million. 
 And less than three months later, on Dec. 1, 1997, a form signed by Mr. Sturm said, in his handwriting, ''Stradivari Quartet -- estimated value, $30 million.''
 On Dec. 31, 1997, an in-house Smithsonian lawyer, Ildiko P. DeAngelis, wrote a memo referring to ''a representation by Mr. Axelrod that the quartet is valued at $50 million.'' Ms. DeAngelis wrote that ''his attorneys informed me yesterday that the actual valuation for appraisal purposes is $55 million,'' the figure she said the Smithsonian would use for insurance purposes.
 In the August 1998 issue of the museum's monthly magazine, Smithsonian, the appraisal value of the instruments was stated to be $50 million. The article went on to say that Mr. Axelrod ''has also turned down offers as high as $55 million.'' The museum repeated the $50 million figure in a winter 2002 quarterly research report available to the public. In January 2001 the I.R.S. cited the $50 million for the quartet as a guideline in valuing at least one other Stradivari instrument for another taxpayer.
 The next month the $50 million figure was cited by Mr. Sturm, the curator, when he wrote to Mr. Axelrod saying he had been contacted by an I.R.S. agent who was verifying the tax break associated with the donation. In that Feb. 6 letter to Mr. Axelrod, Mr. Sturm wrote that he had told the agent that ''in the fall of 1988, you had an offer from a Japanese buyer for the quartet for $50 million (U.S.).'' Mr. Sturm also wrote that he told the agent that in 1996 or 1997, Mr. Axelrod had mentioned to him an offer of $55 million by the Austrian government. 
 In interviews, Mr. Sturm declined to comment on the value of the instruments. 
 A prominent violin dealer, Geoffrey Fushi of Bein & Fushi in Chicago, called the notion of an 11-fold increase for the quartet from $5 million to $55 million ''preposterous,'' adding that it may have tripled at most during that time. He estimated the value for all four Axelrod instruments as $10 million.
 Dr. Neil Fitzgerald, a Phoenix-based economist for a merchant bank in Denver that finances antiques dealers and the first person to alert the I.R.S. to what he calls fraud on the part of Mr. Axelrod regarding the Smithsonian and other donations, said the quartet could be worth as little as $6 million and at most $12 million. 
 But Dietmar Machold, a German violin dealer who said he had been contracted by Mr. Axelrod in fall of 1997 to appraise the quartet, put the value at $50 million. 
 In a telephone interview Mr. Machold said there was a second appraisal, also of $50 million, also performed ''around 1997'' by another dealer, Jacques Francais of New York. Mr. Francais, who died in February, sold Mr. Axelrod two of the quartet pieces in 1979, according to the Smithsonian records. Mr. Sturm said Mr. Francais had the decals applied to the cello in his shop. 
 Earlier this spring Mr. Axelrod's sale of 30 rare Baroque-era Italian stringed instruments to the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra came under federal scrutiny. Though he said they were appraised at $50 million, he sold them to the orchestra for $18 million. Because of the difference between the appraisal and the sale price, the transaction was considered a gift, allowing him to take a sizable federal tax deduction. 
 Mr. Axelrod, who built his fortune publishing books on tropical fish and pet care, sailed to Havana in March as investigators issued a warrant for his arrest
 Mr. Himmel, his lawyer, said the I.R.S. had examined Mr. Axelrod's tax claims for the donation and ''chose not to go forward'' in challenging them. ''This is conjecture, but I gather that they recognized that I had experts who would weigh in on the value of the violins,'' he said.
 In 1997, on the eve of the Smithsonian donation, Mr. Axelrod sold his publishing company for $70 million in cash and a $10 million loan. Mr. Sturm said that Mr. Axelrod told the museum that he would make the quartet a gift only when he sold the company, to help offset taxes generated by the sale. 
 The Smithsonian's May 19, 2004, cover letter to Senator Grassley discloses that the museum never received from Mr. Axelrod a crucial tax form, Form 8283, that would have included an independent appraisal. Typically this form is signed by the receiving institution in order for the donor to receive the tax break. 
 Ralph Lerner, a leading arts lawyer, who is a partner at law firm of Sidley Austin Brown & Wood in New York, said that ''it would be very unusual for a large public charity like the Smithsonian not to have this form in their records, since the taxpayer would need the donee's signature on the Form 8283 to properly claim the charitable deduction.'' 
 Museums argue that they cannot seek or give appraisals, because doing so could create conflicts of interest that ally donation-hungry institutions and tax-break-hungry donors. 
 In 1984 the Smithsonian pledged to take steps to avoid lending credence to inflated, donor-provided values. That pledge came one year after the I.R.S. challenged the value of gems and minerals donated to the museum that were appraised at five times their value.

HEADLINE: Report Finds Social Security Is Better Off Than Forecast

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14 

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office said Monday that it foresaw a significant, growing deficit in the Social Security program, but concluded that the long-term outlook was less dire than the administration had projected.
 The results of the study by the nonpartisan budget office are significant because President Bush has strongly suggested that given Social Security's problems, he will make a major effort to overhaul the system if he is re-elected. 
 In that overhaul, workers would be allowed to set aside some of their payroll taxes in individual savings accounts, to be invested in stocks and bonds. Under current law, Social Security payroll taxes not needed for today's benefits are invested by the Social Security trust fund in government securities, mainly long-term bonds sold only to the fund. 
 In its first comprehensive analysis of Social Security's finances, the budget office said the program was currently running a surplus. But it also said that as baby boomers retire, ''outlays will continually grow faster than revenues, resulting in significant annual deficits.''
 ''Outlays are projected to begin exceeding revenues in 2019, with the gap growing ever wider thereafter,'' the budget office said.
 In its latest report, in March, the Bush administration said the Social Security trust fund would be exhausted in 2042. By contrast, the Congressional Budget Office said it would not be depleted until 2052.
 The Bush administration estimated the program's long-range deficit -- the difference between revenue and outlays over the next 75 years -- at 1.9 percent of the nation's taxable payroll in that period. By contrast, the budget office put the long-range deficit at 1 percent of taxable payroll.
 Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, seized on different parts of the report as evidence to support their views.
 Representative Robert T. Matsui of California, the senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security, said the report showed that the program was facing a financial challenge but not a crisis. Moreover, he said in a letter to Mr. Bush, the challenge is manageable, and ''radical reforms are unnecessary.'' Democrats describe privatizing any part of Social Security as a radical reform.
 By contrast, Thomas R. Saving, a public trustee of Social Security who described himself as a libertarian Republican, said the report was confirmation that the program in its current form was unsustainable.
 And the chairman of the House subcommittee, Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., Republican of Florida, said the report showed that ''Social Security's Depression-era pay-as-you-go financing cannot sustain the program for future generations.''
 The administration's estimates were prepared largely by government actuaries, civil servants whose work is respected on Capitol Hill. But Democrats said they needed an independent perspective because of their experience with Medicare legislation last year. In that episode, an administration official instructed the chief Medicare actuary to withhold cost estimates sought by Democrats in Congress; support for the bill, which in the end passed narrowly, might have eroded if those estimates, larger than the administration's projections, had been widely known. 
 For the new report, the Congressional Budget Office developed its own Social Security model, which assumed that earnings and productivity would grow faster than the administration assumed and that inflation would be somewhat lower and interest rates somewhat higher. (Dr. Saving said the higher interest rates meant that as long as Social Security enjoyed a budget surplus, it would earn more from investing trust fund money in government securities.)
 In 2003, the budget office said, Social Security spending equaled 4.4 percent of gross domestic product, somewhat less than the tax revenue dedicated to the program. Revenue, it said, will remain around 5 percent of gross domestic product for the next 100 years, but outlays will rise sharply, to 6.1 percent of G.D.P. in 2030 and 6.8 percent in 2100.

 BODY:

Journals Are Said to Seek Registry of Drug Trials
A group of top medical journals is considering a proposal that would require drug makers to register clinical trials at their start in a public database in order for results, whether successful or not, to be considered for publication later, three people working with the group said.
 Pharmaceutical companies are not generally required to disclose results of a trial or even whether one was conducted. Some academic researchers have argued that fuller registries of drug trials are needed because companies, as well as medical journals and scientists, tend to spotlight only trials that show positive results. [Page A1.] 

QLT Agrees to Acquire Atrix
QLT, maker of the eye disease drug Visudyne, agreed to buy Atrix Laboratories, which makes drugs for prostate cancer and skin conditions, for $855 million in cash and stock. The deal provides diversity for QLT, whose main product is Visudyne, the only approved drug for a form of age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. [C12.]

Trade Gap and Retail Sales Rise
The United States trade deficit widened in April to a record, and retail sales rose 1.2 percent in May. [C2.]

Stocks Fall as Rate Fears Intensify
Stocks retreated as a stronger-than-expected retail sales report increased fears that the Federal Reserve would take a more aggressive stance toward raising interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 75.37 points, to 10,334.73. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 11.18 points, to 1,125.29. The Nasdaq composite index decreased 29.88 points, to 1,969.99. [C12.]

Decision on Phone Fees Stirs Alarm
Consumer groups, long-distance providers and state utility commissions are alarmed by the Bush administration's decision to side with the regional Bell companies in their legal fight over the access fees. [C4.]

The Supreme Court declined to extend the rules that require the four regional Bell telephone companies to lease their networks at deep discounts to rivals in local markets. [C4.]

House Panel Passes Tax Bill
The House Ways and Means Committee approved a long-stalled bill that would sprinkle $143 billion worth of corporate tax breaks over the next 10 years. [C16.]

Chief of WB Network to Leave
After a year of disappointing ratings, the WB network announced that Jordan Levin, left, would leave his position as chief executive. Garth Ancier, the chairman who had shared overall management responsibilities with Mr. Levin, will now have sole oversight of the network. Mr. Levin will become an independent producer affiliated with the network. [C11.]

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Widened in April As Car Imports Set Record

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit unexpectedly widened in April to a record of $48.3 billion as imports of cars were the highest ever, the Commerce Department said yesterday.
 The department also reported that retail sales rose 1.2 percent in May, the seventh gain in eight months.
 The higher demand reflected in the trade and retail data adds to evidence of a healthy economy. The creation of 1.2 million jobs so far this year is increasing incomes and lifting demand for cars, electronic goods and other products made outside the United States. While the wider trade gap may restrain second-quarter gross domestic product, it remains on pace to exceed 4 percent for a fourth straight quarter. 
 The trade deficit was more than any economist had estimated in a Bloomberg News survey and followed a March deficit of $46.6 billion, the data showed. Exports were the second-highest on record. 
 Imports rose 0.2 percent for the month, to $142.3 billion. Exports fell 1.5 percent, to $93.9 billion.
 Imports of goods and services rose 0.2 percent for the month, to $142.3 billion. Imports of autos and parts increased in April, to a record $19 billion. Americans bought $31.7 billion worth of imported consumer goods, led by pharmaceuticals, furniture and televisions.
 The value of oil imports fell in April to $9.7 billion, from $10.2 billion the previous month, because refiners imported fewer barrels of crude oil as prices increased. The average price of oil was $31 a barrel, the highest since February 1983, from $30.64 in March, according to the Commerce Department.
 The United States imported $30.8 billion worth of industrial supplies and materials, which include oil, $1 billion less than in March.
 Exports fell 1.5 percent, to $93.9 billion. United States companies' shipments of civilian aircraft, industrial machines, consumer goods and chemicals declined during the month.
 The dollar has lost 15 percent of its value against currencies from the United States' biggest trading partners. The decline makes United States products cheaper and contributes to improved sales abroad.
 Prices of goods imported into the United States rose 1.6 percent in May, led by higher costs for petroleum, building supplies and metals. Excluding petroleum, the index rose 0.4 percent, the Labor Department said last week. In April, import prices rose 0.2 percent total and 0.3 percent excluding petroleum.
 Rising consumer incomes increased sales at American retailers like J.C. Penney, Neiman Marcus and Wal-Mart. Retail sales increased in May as purchases rebounded at auto dealers and record gasoline prices bolstered service station receipts. Excluding autos, sales rose 0.7 percent after a 0.1 decrease a month earlier.

HEADLINE: Hospitals, Eager to Build, May Find Funds Scarcer

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
After years without enough money to make capital improvements, hospitals say they want to go on a spending spree -- building surgery centers, renovating operating rooms, buying the latest medical equipment and even putting in badly needed new computer systems. The big question is how long this can last.
 Hospital executives plan to increase their capital spending by an average of 14 percent a year for the next five years, according to a recent survey. 
 ''I think what sits out there is a pent-up demand for capital,'' said Robert Lux, chief financial officer of the Temple University Health System. 
 Temple, an inner-city hospital system in Philadelphia, is spending about $75 million on a new ambulatory care center that had been discussed for more than five years though ground was broken for it only last year. Temple has already borrowed $50 million and is in talks with lenders about borrowing the rest.
 But consultants say the industry's planned splurge, no matter how long overdue and badly needed, could be short-lived. 
 The expected rise in interest rates will make borrowing much more expensive, because hospitals, typically run as nonprofit organizations, frequently raise money by issuing tax-exempt bonds. And hospitals that plan to finance the projects with cash from operations could see future revenue squeezed as private insurers balk at paying ever-higher prices for care and the federal government looks for ways to cut the budget. 
 ''Hospitals are going to have to prioritize,'' said James Callanan, chief executive of the ImPart Group, a Boston consulting firm that advises hospitals. ''We're not going to be able to do our wish lists.''
 What hospitals are likely to spend money on, consultants say, are the areas that return the favor: moneymakers like operating rooms, surgical suites, and medical and diagnostic equipment. ''Everything else will get pushed to the back burner,'' said Mark Wietecha, a health care consultant with Kurt Salmon Associates in Atlanta. 
 The deferred items are likely to include some of the computer systems and other information technology that might help finally bring the administration of health care into the 21st century. 
 Also needed but likely to be delayed are the replacement or renovation of old facilities -- aging hospital wings or decrepit elevators in need of makeovers.
 ''When push comes to shove, what typically happens is infrastructure tends to suffer to medical technology,'' said Richard L. Clarke, president and chief executive of the Healthcare Financial Management Association, a group of hospital finance executives based in Westchester, Ill., that is studying hospitals' capital needs with GE Healthcare Financial Services, a lender and adviser to the industry. 
 The spending urge comes as hospitals react to a long period of scant buying and building -- a result of lower payments from Medicare that followed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Some systems also used their capital for investments like physicians' private practices in hope of gaining patients. 
 In recent discussions with hospital administrators, the executives indicated that they had delayed making critical capital investments as long as they could, said Randy Fuller, the hospital segment manager for GE Healthcare. Spending, he said, ''has become an absolute imperative.'' 
 In fact, hospitals have already started. Construction alone reached $15 billion last year, roughly 50 percent more than annual construction spending through much of the 1990's. 
 Last week, St. David's HealthCare Partnership, a system in Austin, Tex., announced plans to spend $100 million on capital projects, including a new intensive-care unit and outpatient surgery center as well as the purchase of a gamma knife, specialized technology that uses gamma radiation to treat brain tumors.
 Hospitals seem to be having no trouble finding money for construction projects, said Robert Levine, an executive specializing in health care clients for Turner Construction. Even for-profit hospitals that do not raise money by selling bonds are picking up the pace, he said. Those hospitals tend to finance the projects from operating revenue. 
 ''There's a lot going forward,'' he said. ''But there are some storm clouds.''
 Some hospitals are struggling to come up with the money for these investments. And analysts and others say that a growing number of hospitals are shut out of the bond market because of heavy losses or debt loads that make them unattractive to investors. A quarter of those surveyed by PricewaterhouseCoopers for the Healthcare Financial Management Association and GE Healthcare also have too much current debt to borrow more. These hospitals, in particular, may suffer if the federal government reduces payments, consultants say, and could end up being acquired by stronger systems. 
 Some nonprofit hospitals say they plan to find the money by asking for it -- persuading people to donate for various projects. But while consultants say that medical research can be a popular area of philanthropy, individual hospitals, particularly those that are not well known, could have difficulty persuading people to make donations for a new operating room or an outpatient clinic.
 With the bursting of the stock market bubble and the downturn in the economy in recent years, there tends to be more competition for fewer charitable dollars. 
 ''I think raising philanthropic dollars today is a lot harder than it was five years ago,'' Mr. Lux of the Temple University Health System said. ''I would not want to count on that.'' 
 So it remains unclear where some hospitals are going to get the money to do everything they want, particularly in areas like information technology -- new computer systems and software that would make them more efficient and could reduce medical errors. 
 Some consultants argue that such investments are so vital that hospitals will scrape to find the money. But others say spending on information technology could easily be deferred, as it has been in previous years, as hospital executives wait to see how the technology evolves. 
 ''For ages now, hospitals have said they will spend on I.T. and they never do,'' said Sandy Lutz, the national health care research director for PricewaterhouseCoopers.
 What may be different this time is more pressure from the federal government and from employers, some of which have begun paying hospitals more if they have computer systems that could improve patient care. President Bush, who is creating a position in the administration to oversee information technology within health care, has talked about spending $100 million to explore how technology could improve care. 
 Hospitals may be persuaded to make these investments, Ms. Lutz said, adding, ''It really depends on government policy and how much they push it.''

HEADLINE: Hearings Open on Taxing Rich To Raise Property-Tax Rebate

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 14 

 BODY:
The Legislature opened hearings Monday on Gov. James E. McGreevey's proposal to raise the tax rate on New Jersey's wealthiest residents, in the first income-tax increase in this tax-averse state in 14 years.
 The added tax, known as the millionaire's tax even though it would kick in at $500,000 in household income, would be entirely dedicated to property tax relief -- a proviso that has won it the backing of consumer advocates and retired taxpayers. 
 ''Property taxes in New Jersey increased 52 percent over the last 10 years,'' Marilyn Askin, the president of the New Jersey chapter of the AARP, told two legislative committees. ''People on fixed incomes cannot afford this situation to continue.''
 Ms. Askin was among representatives of more than a dozen groups that addressed the General Assembly Appropriations Committee and the Senate Budget Committee. The panels also heard complaints about the measure, although many came from tenant groups that did not oppose the millionaire's tax but said the plan did not increase property tax rebates for renters. Several committee members said they would consider amending the bill to raise the rebates for renters.
 Both committees are scheduled to take up the bill again on Thursday. Votes are expected to follow party lines, and Mr. McGreevey's party, the Democrats, control both houses. 
 ''It is wildly popular with voters,'' Staci Berger, the program director of New Jersey Citizen Action, a nonprofit advocacy group, said of the plan. Ms. Berger said many people gave checks to the group in its nightly door-to-door canvassing. Ms. Berger said Citizen Action members had made 500 calls to legislative offices just on Monday and had collected thousands of postcards. In a similar campaign, Ms. Askin said, the AARP routed more than 500 callers to their legislators in nine days. 
 The plan would raise the income tax rate in the highest tax bracket to 8.97 percent from 6.37. The increase would raise about $800 million, to be distributed in annual property tax rebate checks. The maximum rebate would increase to $1,200 from $775 for elderly, disabled and low-income people, and to $800 from $250 for other middle-income homeowners.
 Some business groups told the committees that a tax increase would discourage entrepreneurs, and an economist, David Shulman, called it ''a powerful message to corporate decision-makers: stay away.''

HEADLINE: New York Outpaces U.S. Economic Growth

BYLINE: By MARY SPICUZZA

 BODY:
New York City's economic growth is finally outperforming the nation's after four years in which it lagged behind, according to a report issued yesterday by the city comptroller.
 The comptroller's office said the city's economy grew 7 percent during the first quarter of the year, its highest quarterly growth rate since late 1999. The office cited 21,100 new payroll jobs during that quarter and a 27 percent jump in personal income tax revenues as the main factors indicating growth. 
 But the news is not all good. The report said that the rate of job growth in the city was the fifth-weakest of the nation's 20 largest metropolitan areas, leading only Pittsburgh, Boston, San Francisco and Detroit. 
 ''We have a glass that's half-full, and hopefully filling,'' said Andrew M. Joseph, the deputy comptroller for budget. ''This continues to support the analysis that the recovery is on.''
 Mr. Joseph said the comptroller's office measured economic growth using wages and the number of jobs created as well as factors like personal income tax data included in a combination of federal, state and industry statistics.
 The city added 21,100 jobs in the first quarter of this year compared with 4,100 jobs added during the previous quarter. Most of the new jobs were private, with such areas as education and health services, professional and business services and information providing the greatest number.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg hailed the numbers as indicative of the city's economic resurgence and said they reflected policies aimed at making the city more hospitable to business.
 ''Our five-borough economic development strategy of making New York more livable, more business-friendly and diversifying our economy is leading to job creation and opportunity,'' he said in a statement. ''However, although unemployment is at its lowest rate in two years, far too many New Yorkers are not participating in the American dream and we will continue to work day and night to change that.'' 
 Doug Turetsky, communications director for the city's Independent Budget Office, also warned against reading too much into the generally positive news. 
 ''The city's economy is recovering, but it's probably a bit premature to start singing 'Happy Days Are Here Again,''' he said. ''It is certainly great that figures are pointing upwards, but in comparison to the nation, it's important to remember that we have fallen farther and started recovering later.''
 Jobs and income tax revenues aside, other economic indicators were mixed. New York City's inflation rate fell during the first quarter, dropping from 3.2 percent in late 2003 to 2.8 during the first three months of 2004. The inflation rate in the United States in that same period dropped from 1.9 to 1.8 percent. 
 Similarly, the city faces unemployment rates far higher than the national average. Unemployment in the city was 8.1 percent during the first quarter of 2004 while the national unemployment rate, seasonally adjusted, was 5.6 percent.
 Still, John Tepper Marlin, the chief economist for the comptroller's office, said the increasing growth rates were positive signs that things are on the right track. ''We've been through a lot of pain since 9/11'' he said. ''There's still some nervousness, but having this one quarter is a sign that we're going to stop lagging.''
 Kathryn S. Wylde, president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, said she shared the comptroller's optimism. She helped organize a ''State of the City's Economy'' panel yesterday morning, where the comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., served as moderator.
 ''There was general optimism there,'' she said. ''Everybody agreed that mid-2003 had been the low point.''

HEADLINE: A Lover of Urban Life Fears Decline and Fall

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:

DARK AGE AHEAD
By Jane Jacobs
241 pages. Random House. $23.95.
 Jane Jacobs's 1961 classic, ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' was a prescient and enormously influential jeremiad against the deadening fallout of modernist urban planning. But it was also an evocative ode to the messy cacophony of city life, a paean to the resilience and imagination of city dwellers.
 Over the years Ms. Jacobs has tackled increasingly sprawling topics (from the economics of city life to the moral foundations of politics and commerce) and the optimism of ''Great American Cities'' has given way to a more pessimistic tone. Indeed her new book, ''Dark Age Ahead,'' is both wildly ambitious in scope and gloomily portentous about the direction of North American culture.
 ''The purpose of this book,'' she writes, ''is to help our culture avoid sliding into a dead end, by understanding how such a tragedy comes about, and thereby what can be done to ward it off and thus retain and further develop our living, functioning culture which contains so much of value, so hard won by our forebears. We need this awareness because, as I plan to explain, we show signs of rushing headlong into a Dark Age.'' 
 In the course of this extremely sloppy book, Ms. Jacobs identifies ''five pillars of our culture'' that she says show ''ominous signs'' of decay: 1. community and family, 2. higher education, 3. ''the effective practice of science and science-based technology,'' 4. responsible and responsive tax policy, and 5. ''self-policing by the learned professions.'' Other frequently cited signs of social decay (e.g., racism, a growing gap between rich and poor, environmental destruction, voter cynicism), she argues, are simply symptoms of the five larger problems she has identified.
 Unfortunately Ms. Jacobs does not manage to make a plausible case for this thesis in her haphazard book. She does not convince the reader that North America is in danger of entering a Dark Age: either a big one like that following the collapse of the Roman Empire, or a smaller, slower decline. Nor does she persuade the reader that her ''five pillars'' incorporate all today's most pressing problems.
 Part of what's wrong with this book is its methodology, or lack of one. Ms. Jacobs's most powerful writings have always embodied the same qualities she has celebrated in urban life: they have a spontaneous, ad hoc nature, eschewing a systematic approach in favor of a more intuitive one. This approach worked brilliantly in ''Great American Cities,'' as it remained grounded in the author's firsthand observations of city life and her wonderfully tactile descriptions.
 ''Dark Age,'' in contrast, tackles a much larger, more abstract subject that does not lend itself to her looping, discursive style. Instead of giving us observations of phenomena she has seen firsthand, Ms. Jacobs gives us observations about books she has read (like Jared Diamond's ''Guns, Germs, and Steel'' and Karen Armstrong's ''Islam''). Worse, she serves up flimsily anecdotal evidence in support of her broader arguments.
 For instance, in illustration of her belief that science is being betrayed, she cites three cases: one dealing with the failures of traffic engineering in New York City and Toronto; the second dealing with an ineffectual study of a Chicago heat wave carried out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the third dealing with difficulties Canadian economists had in explaining a 2002 economic boomlet.
 From these isolated and arbitrarily chosen examples, Ms. Jacobs goes on to draw this doleful and unearned lesson: ''If the rot of bad science continues to spread, to be tolerated, and even to be rewarded by corporations and centrally administered government grants, the heyday of scientific and technological achievement is inevitably drawing to its end in North America.''
 Other chapters in this book devolve into meandering discussions of the author's favorite hobbyhorses, from the perils of urban planning and suburban sprawl to the importance of feedback in restoring economic equilibrium. A chapter about the breakdown of the nuclear family, for example, features a lengthy and familiar digression in which Ms. Jacobs assails the automobile as ''the chief destroyer of American communities'' and General Motors as an enemy of public transit.
 In the course of ''Dark Age'' Ms. Jacobs raises a lot of interesting questions about the nature of dark ages: why certain cultures fall prey to assaults from outside or to rot from within; how a fortress mentality can lead to isolation and technological retreat; how memories of traditions, values and language can fade. She also discusses a lot of troubling recent developments, including corporate corruption, weakening academic standards, the prevalence of imagemaking and spin in politics and business, and the lack of affordable housing in cities like New York. But these discussions are cursory in the extreme, and they are never connected to one another, much less to some larger theory about a coming Dark Age.
 Despite its Cassandralike title, this book reads less like a convincing wake-up call than a collection of random jottings, glossed with unnecessary daubs of hyperbole and only occasional flashes of vintage Jacobs insight.

HEADLINE: A Glass Bubble That's Bringing Beijing to a Boil

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, June 14 

 BODY:
Some compare it to a globe severed at the Equator. To others it resembles a phosphorescent egg floating in a crystal sea. One prominent Beijing architect said that when the desert dust kicks up around Beijing, lathering the expansive glass dome in a pall of gray grime, it resembles nothing so much as dried dung.
 But the most apt analogy for the $300 million National Theater of China, now nearing completion in the political heart of Beijing, near Tiananmen Square, may be a hot potato.
 The building's French architect, Paul Andreu, has come under investigation in France and intense scrutiny in China after a terminal he designed at Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Paris partly collapsed in May, killing four people, two of them Chinese. 
 His troubles were taken as a green light for China's state-controlled news media and a few leading architects to raise questions about the approval process, the safety standards and the aesthetic sensitivity of Mr. Andreu's Beijing project, which is regarded as a favorite of China's semiretired senior leader, Jiang Zemin.
 Beijing's cultural community is also complaining that less than 18 months before the titanium-and-glass complex is scheduled to open, there is no opening act lined up. In fact, no public or private group has agreed to operate the theater at all. 
 China is treating the 2008 Olympics, to be held in Beijing, as an occasion to remake the capital. The government is razing old neighborhoods, laying hundreds of miles of roads and subway lines, and constructing monuments of modern architecture that the Communist Party hopes will stand as tributes to its leadership.
 But as billions of dollars of public money are spent on skyscrapers, stadiums and transportation facilities designed by the world's leading architects, local designers are complaining that many of the projects are overpriced and out of touch with Chinese history. Even in a place where challenges to the leadership's priorities are rarely permitted, voices of dissent are growing louder. 
 ''We are a poor country, not a fancy country, and we should not be wasting our money on monstrosities,'' said Xiao Mo, an architectural historian at Qinghua University in Beijing who has campaigned against the theater project. ''I believe it is an insult to the people of China.''
 China is not alone in seeking to advertise its rising power through architecture. Societies on the rise, like the United States in the 1920's and Japan in the 1980's, often spend lavishly on new designs that critics consider too grand or iconoclastic.
 Yet the building boom here is in some ways unusual. Since 2000, floor space in China has doubled, according to Construction Ministry statistics. Some projects are public works and office complexes of such scale and cost that it seems unlikely they would be undertaken anywhere else. 
 China also sets itself apart because it is still relatively poor, with an annual per capita income that surpassed $1,000 only last year. Its most ambitious projects are often financed with public money or by state-owned enterprises whose profits come from concessions bestowed by the government. And the architects chosen for the highest-profile projects are usually foreign.
 Two Swiss architects, Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, won the competition for Beijing's main Olympic stadium. They designed a bowl of interwoven metal mesh that resembles a bird's nest with a price tag of $543 million. The British architect Norman Foster is renovating Beijing's airport, using a dragon motif, in a project valued at $1.9 billion.
 Rem Koolhaas and Ole van Scheeren, Dutch architects, designed an enormous new headquarters for China's dominant state broadcaster, China Central Television, that has drawn almost as much scrutiny as Mr. Andreu's National Theater.
 Mr. Koolhaas proposed building two 55-story Z-shaped towers angled toward each other, with the top horizontals linked in a gravity-defying tango. He told the Chinese state news media that his vision is a ''hyperbuilding of unimaginable scale and complexity'' intended to house all of the television station's functions.
 The design won praise among some Chinese architects, but the price offended many others, with some critics arguing that the estimated cost of $730 million may be understated. Beijing is abuzz with speculation that the project may be scrapped as a symbol of the new leadership's determination to cut back on excessive state investment and slow the overheated economy.
 Mr. van Scheeren and China Central Television officials say that the approval process is moving ahead and that the new building will be the base of China's Olympic broadcasts.
 ''I know there's been a lot of high-level political discussion about how China should spend its money and the gap between rich and poor,'' said Mr. van Scheeren. ''But I can assure you it is by no means dead.''
 Wu Liangyong, a senior architect who has helped the government select designs for state-financed projects, has supported importing foreign talent to remake China's cities. But he argues that the country has also squandered state assets on quirky notions of modern grandeur.
 ''In my view, some Chinese cities have become experimental sites for novelty for novelty's sake by some foreign masters,'' he said.
 Reflecting the sensitivity, the Construction Ministry announced a new regulation this month requiring foreign architects to enter joint ventures with local architectural firms before taking on Chinese projects.
 Even before the Paris airport accident, Mr. Andreu's National Theater had become a flashpoint in the debate. The complex has one large 2,500-seat hall and three smaller auditoriums. They are arranged under a soaring glass dome, which is notable for having no central supporting columns. The dome is set like a floating bubble in a lake. The entrance is an underwater tunnel.
 Supporters say the design is stunning and luminescent, offering a welcome contrast to the Stalinist wedding-cake architecture of Tiananmen Square next door. Critics say it fails even to nod to Chinese tradition and violates every rule of feng shui, the traditional art of harmonizing people and their environment.
 Critics got a boost when a section of a new terminal Mr. Andreu designed at Charles de Gaulle airport collapsed last month. The accident prompted a flurry of criticism of Mr. Andreu's design principles.The French news media also reported that French authorities were investigating whether the Paris airport, Mr. Andreu's employer, paid bribes to win the Beijing theater contract.
 Mr. Andreu, who was not available for comment, has also built the new Shanghai airport, a stadium in Guangzhou and the Shanghai Opera House, making him one of the most prolific foreign architects in China.
 ''We have confidence in Paul Andreu,'' said Wang Zhengming, a spokesman for the committee overseeing construction of the theater. ''The accident in Paris will have no effect on our building.'' Mr. Wang also denied any corruption.
 But Mr. Xiao of Qinghua University, who compared the theater to dried dung, is one of several dozen critics who have lobbied against the project even after it won final Politburo approval in 2001. He and other opponents have begun a fresh campaign to have it demolished.
 Beyond aesthetic issues, opponents say it will prove impossible to run efficiently. The central dome needs to be illuminated and air-conditioned even if only the smallest of its performance centers is in use. They say the underwater entrance poses an unacceptable safety risk in the event of fire, earthquake or terrorist attack.
 At least partly for this reason, critics say, the theater has become an orphan, with no agency willing to run it. With potentially enormous maintenance expenses, neither the Culture Ministry nor the Beijing city government, much less smaller theater groups, want to accept the responsibility, according to Wu Zuqiang, a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Congress, an advisory body to the central government.
 ''We've got this amazing piece of hardware in place but no one thought about the software,'' Mr. Wu said. ''You need to book first-rate international acts two or three years in advance.''
 Unless the government acts quickly, Mr. Wu said, ''We are going to raise the curtain on an empty house.''

HEADLINE: The Bells and the Ruling on Access Fees

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
The decision by the Bush administration last week to side with the regional Bell companies in their legal fight over the access fees they charge others to lease their phone lines has set off alarm bells among consumer groups, long-distance providers and state utility commissions.
 The groups say that an appeals court decision to remove the cap on these access fees, which goes into effect today, will give the Bells a free hand to raise the prices they charge AT&T, MCI and hundreds of other companies trying to get into the local phone market. It will also push many smaller phone companies out of business, they say, and ultimately lead to higher phone rates for consumers.
 When SBC Illinois won the right last week from the Illinois Commerce Commission to raise its wholesale access rates by 30 percent, or about $4 a line, to $16 a line a month, anxieties about runaway rates seemed to be vindicated. Though Illinois has some of the lowest access rates in the country, many fear the rate increase will usher in similar increases in other states. 
 The truth is murkier. Some evidence suggests that scrapping the limits on access fees may not immediately translate into more expensive local phone service. For starters, long-distance carriers have not said how much of the higher fees, if any, they will pass on to consumers.
 Confusing matters, there are a vast array of access fees and both sides in the tussle -- the Bells and their rivals -- have been known to exaggerate them. Each state sets its rates using complex formulas. On top of that, the Bells negotiate hundreds of deals with carriers and often offer volume discounts. This makes predicting the impact of any rate increase on consumers or the market over all difficult.
 For simplicity's sake, though, most states have three tiers of access fees, with the cheapest in cities, and the highest in rural areas, where it is more expensive to provide service. Though each state sets its limits on access fees, rates can vary by 50 percent or more between towns and cities, as well as between neighboring states.
 Given the disparity in rates and the politically charged atmosphere around them, analysts are coy about publicizing their calculations. One leading consulting firm that advises both the Bells and big long-distance carriers crunched the numbers in several big states, but asked that its name not be used for fear of being accused of choosing sides.
 Its data showed that in California, for example, phone companies pay the Bells on average $11.11 a line a month to lease lines in the state's cities. In suburban areas, they pay $14.06, and in rural areas, $22.56.
 In Texas, where rates are higher, average lease rates in the biggest cities are $16.14 a line, while fees in rural areas are $25.61 a line. Assuming long-distance companies pass on all the increases to their customers, and the Bells increase rates by 30 percent, consumers in Texas would pay from $4.84 to $7.68 more a line per month, a not insignificant hit.
 But most analysts say that if and when they start charging higher fees, the Bells are unlikely to raise rates by more than 30 percent. Anything higher would be viewed as politically unpalatable and probably push long-distance companies to move even faster to use new phone technology, like Internet calling services, that bypass the Bell networks altogether.
 At the same time, a fee increase may have a limited impact on the market over all simply because there are relatively few customers getting local phone service from long-distance companies and other rivals to the Bells -- even with the discounted access rates the Bells provide. As of June 2003, more than 19 million consumers received their local phone service from companies that leased lines from the Bells, but only 13 million lines, or 7.4 percent of all phone lines in the United States, are directly affected by the recent legal changes.
 Long-distance providers contend that total customers aside, their mere presence in the local phone market keeps pressure on the Bells to maintain service at reasonable prices. Most analysts say that the Bells will hold off raising fees until next year, after the elections this November, except in states where fees are exceptionally low, like Illinois. The Bells may also want to avoid raising rates too much because that could drive small phone companies out of business, reducing the fees it receives. State utility commissions, too, may try to block the Bells from moving too fast too soon.
 All this means that consumers are unlikely to see bigger phone bills anytime soon. The Bells have hundreds of long-term contracts with their rivals that would take months, if not years, to renegotiate entirely.
 For their part, long-distance companies often sell their local phone service as part of a bundle. Many may decide to lose a few dollars on the local part of the bundle to keep the customer who pays, say, $39.99 for local and long-distance calls.
 ''You can't separate these phone services,'' said Christiaan Hogendorn, an assistant professor of economics at Wesleyan University who studies the telecommunications industry. ''Any company with a brand name sells bundles, and some might sell local service as a loss leader.''
 In this kind of market place, Mr. Hogendorn said, the consumers who may fare the worst are those who buy only local phone service from small providers that are the least able to absorb higher access fees.

HEADLINE: A Liberal With New Emphasis on Old Values

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES

 BODY:
AMERICA'S moral decline, real or illusionary, is at the heart of the current culture wars. And as these wars polarize the nation and dominate much of the political debate, a few trigger words instantly place people on either side of the divide. The right tends to talk about morality and values, while the left invokes evolving mores and personal rights.
 It is hard, therefore, to label David Callahan, a liberal who argues that America has lost its moral compass. He warns that the country must recapture the solid bourgeois values that once guided business leaders, and he says the cheating and lying from Wall Street to university exam rooms are unraveling the fabric of the nation. 
 That kind of scolding may sound odd coming from the left, but Mr. Callahan seems intent on wresting moral issues out of the hands of conservatives. Liberals, he says, should wake up to the rot in the country, fight against its pervasiveness and stake out moral values as their own turf.
 ''The right in this country has defined values very narrowly,'' he said. ''They define it as sexual morality, family, drugs, crime and personal responsibility in these areas. The other problems related to the free market and the moral downside of capitalism -- greed, materialism, cutthroat personal ethics -- have not been on the values discussion.''
 He calls for a new social contract, in which ''people who play by the rules get ahead.''
 Perhaps he is the new liberal. His latest book, ''The Cheating Culture: Why More Americans Are Doing Wrong to Get Ahead'' (Harcourt, 2004), contends that the steady erosion of values and honesty in American society is real, and as ominous as many on the right contend. But he pins much of the blame on the growing social and economic inequality in the country, or what he calls ''our war against poor people.'' 
 Mr. Callahan is a co-founder of Demos, a public policy organization dedicated to ''creating a fairer America.'' Based in Manhattan, it has a $3 million budget and about 25 staff members.
 ''We want to help reinvent public policy for the 21st century,'' Mr. Callahan said. ''We want to strengthen democracy and create a more widely shared prosperity.''
 His road to ethics and the decline of morality in American public and private life had an unusual start. He wrote a book called ''Kindred Spirits: Harvard Business School's Extraordinary Class of 1949 and How They Transformed America'' (John Wiley & Sons, 2002). As he conducted his interviews, many with men who had run some of the country's largest multinational corporations, he became convinced that they operated under very different moral guidelines than many of their successors.
 THEY were not saints,'' Mr. Callahan said, ''but they had very different values. They grew up during the Depression, fought in World War II, went to Harvard Business School on the G.I. Bill, and many came from the working class. They went into business with low expectations. They did not have a strong sense of entitlement. Wealth would be created patiently over many years. They were thankful for what they had been given, and many had a belief in social equity.''
 The anger he encountered among these men over the huge compensation packages awarded to heads of companies today, coupled with their disgust with the loss of values, led him to wonder what had changed in American society. 
 ''There is not a lot of opinion research on ethics and honesty,'' he said, seated at a wind-swept patio table outside his hotel, the Ritz-Carlton New York, Battery Park. ''I wish I had a million dollars to do research and a time machine. I would go back and see how people over the last 40 years answered basic ethical questions.'' 
 Mr. Callahan, 39 and unmarried, grew up in Hastings-on-Hudson, which he noted was not the upscale town it has become. His father was a bioethicist and his mother a psychologist who writes about psychology and religion. As might be expected, their house was overflowing with books, which he, like his parents, devoured. But he was not a good student.
 ''I was only interested in English and history,'' he said. ''I nearly flunked everything else.'' 
 He graduated from Hampshire College and later, after working as the managing editor of The American Prospect, received his doctorate in politics in 1997 from Princeton. But he did not want to go into the academy, dismissing many of the scholars around him as ineffective. He argues that, unlike conservatives, liberals do not understand how to use the news media to get their ideas to the public.
 ''I was never interested in the academic life,'' he said. ''I always wanted to be involved in public debate. I wanted to have influence. The right has invested a lot of time and capital in building public intellectuals and institutions to develop ideas. They have reshaped American politics. Liberals tied up their intellectual capital in the academy, or focused solely on specific issues such as the environment or freedom of choice. They are not as adept at packaging broad ideas or getting them to decision makers.''
 He has written six books, including a 1997 novel called ''State of the Union.'' A political thriller, it has Islamic terrorists plotting to hijack planes and crash them into the Capitol during the State of the Union address. 
 ''I was really spooked when Sept. 11 happened,'' he said. ''It was pretty close to my story line. I hope they didn't read the book.''

To the Editor:
 I'm surely less talented than Dave Eggers. So with my sights set on graduate school, I had no choice but to spend nearly every waking hour in college learning the math that I should have been taught in high school but wasn't. Ditto for history and literature.
 I did take a few blessed breaks from my studies, breaks mostly involving cheap beer and unsuccessful quests to enchant enchanting women. These breaks were absolutely necessary to re-energize me for further long hours in the library. 
 If my college had required me to spend these precious few respites delivering meals to the underprivileged, I would have dropped out.

HEADLINE: Shares Drop After a Report Of Strong May Retail Sales 

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks retreated yesterday, as a stronger-than-expected report on retail sales increased fears that the Federal Reserve would take a more aggressive stance toward raising interest rates. 
 Investors also prepared for the May reading on the Consumer Price Index, which will be released before the markets open today.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 75.37 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,334.73. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 11.18 points, or 1 percent, to 1,125.29. The Nasdaq composite index decreased 29.88 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,969.99. 
 Shares of General Motors fell, even after it reaffirmed its quarterly and 2004 earnings targets. 
 Interest-rate-sensitive financial stocks also fell sharply, with Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase among the Dow's top 10 percentage losers. Communications equipment makers like Cisco Systems pressured the Nasdaq, dragging the S.&P. communications equipment index down 2.5 percent. 
 Yesterday's strong retail sales report, which showed an increase of 1.2 percent in May, ''means consumers are spending, no matter what,'' said Ozan Akcin, chief market strategist at Puglisi & Company. ''Everything's headed in a northerly direction in terms of inflation, and the market's pulling back because people are worried the Fed could raise rates more than expected.''
 In other economic news, the United States trade deficit unexpectedly widened in April to a record $48.3 billion, prompting the dollar to weaken against the euro.
 A higher number for the May Consumer Price Index could lead the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates faster than originally planned, economists said. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, said last week that the central bank would do ''what is required'' to keep inflation in check.
 Shares of G.M. slumped 97 cents, or 2 percent, to $47.09, even after it said the outlook for the global auto industry remained strong.
 Shares of J.P. Morgan dropped 1.7 percent, or 64 cents, to $37.16, while shares of Citigroup slid 1.3 percent, or 61 cents, to $46.74.
 Wal-Mart Stores also weighed on the Dow, even after it backed its June sales forecast. Shares of Wal-Mart dropped 82 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $56.38.
 99 Cents Only Stores, the discount chain operator, topped percentage losers on the New York Stock Exchange, sinking 31 percent to a new low, after it slashed forecasts last week because of problems related to inventory controls and rising costs. Shares of 99 Cents Only Stores plunged $6.38, to $14.10.
 The casino operator MGM Mirage fell after it raised its offer to buy the Mandalay Resort Group, hoping to seal a deal that would build the world's largest casino empire. MGM raised its bid to $71 a share from $69 a share. 
 MGM shares rose 60 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $48.20, while those of Mandalay slid 82 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $67.60.
 Among the Nasdaq's most active stocks, Cisco fell 50 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $23.32, while Intel slipped 65 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $27.99. 
 Treasury bond prices fell yesterday, sending yields to two-year highs, as bond traders also worried about the possibility of aggressive rate increases. The price of the 10-year note dropped 18/32, to 992/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.87 percent from 4.80 percent Thursday.
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 26/32, to 9728/32. The bond's yield rose to 5.53 percent from 5.47 percent.
 On the New York Stock Exchange, trading was moderate, with 1.19 billion shares changing hands.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Justices Limit the Reach of U.S. Antitrust Law in Transactions Overseas

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court ruled Monday in a closely watched international price-fixing case that federal antitrust law does not apply to transactions that take place overseas and that cause harm there unless a company's actions in the United States can be shown to have contributed to the harm.
 The decision, 8 to 0, overturned a ruling last year by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that had caused considerable alarm among multinational corporations and foreign governments by significantly expanding the reach of American antitrust law and the jurisdiction of the federal courts to hear such cases.
 The Bush administration had urged the justices to overturn the appeals court's ruling, which came in a suit by foreign customers of vitamin manufacturers and distributors that were the subjects of a United States investigation in the late 1990's into international price-fixing. That investigation led to guilty pleas and to the biggest criminal fine, $500 million, ever obtained by the Justice Department, in addition to heavy civil penalties imposed by the European Union and several foreign governments. 
 The case before the Supreme Court on Monday was a private lawsuit seeking triple damages against the same defendants. It was brought by five companies in Australia, Ecuador, Panama and Ukraine as a class action on behalf of overseas purchasers who use vitamins in a range of commercial applications, like animal feed and additions to breakfast cereal. Stalled by the issue of jurisdiction, the private lawsuit has not yet gone to trial.
 Writing for the court, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said that the Sherman Antitrust Act does not cover the foreign effects of anticompetitive conduct unless the defendants' domestic behavior can be shown to have contributed to those effects. 
 In this case, F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., No. 03-724, the five foreign plaintiffs contended that the companies' ability to raise prices in the United States did in fact contribute to antitrust injury abroad. Their lawyer, Thomas C. Goldstein, said in an interview Monday that his clients consequently could meet the Supreme Court's new test as the case goes forward.
 Because the court of appeals did not address the question of domestic effects, Justice Breyer said the Supreme Court could not consider it at this stage. The case now returns to the appeals court.
 Stephen A. Bokat, senior vice president and general counsel of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said the decision was a ''very positive development'' in its campaign against what it calls ''global forum shopping.''
 The decision interpreted a 1982 law, an amendment to the Sherman Act called the Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvement Act. While it generally provides that federal antitrust law will not apply to foreign trade or commerce, it contains an exception for conduct that has a ''direct, substantial, and reasonably foreseeable effect'' on domestic commerce.
 ''Where the plaintiff's claim rests solely on the independent foreign harm,'' that exception does not apply, Justice Breyer said. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor did not participate in the case.
 Canada, Germany and Japan filed briefs warning the court that application of United States antitrust law would interfere with foreign governments' efforts to regulate their own markets. The Bush administration's brief on the same side was signed both by the usual contingent of Justice Department lawyers and by the State Department's principal legal adviser, William H. Taft IV.

HEADLINE: Second Part Of Land Deal Speeds Up Development

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 14 

 BODY:
Three days after legislators approved a landmark plan to preserve 400,000 acres near many sources of drinking water in North Jersey, lawmakers have unveiled the other part of that deal: a proposal that would significantly speed development on more than a third of the state's vacant land.
 The new initiative, which was introduced and adopted by committees in the Senate and General Assembly on Monday, would streamline the building-permit process in much of the state by granting developers automatic approval of zoning or environmental applications that are still undecided after 45 days. 
 The plan would also appoint a special ombudsman to help builders who feel they are being bogged down by the Department of Environmental Protection or other agencies. 
 Supporters of the proposal say it will help fight suburban sprawl and speed the process of urban revitalization by giving state officials the means to encourage development in blighted cities and other areas. 
 ''This is about cutting through red tape,'' said Micah Rasmussen, a spokesman for Gov. James E. McGreevey. ''This doesn't weaken any environmental regulations whatsoever. It allows us to enforce our existing laws more efficiently.''
 Environmentalists, though, were angered that the plan made such far-reaching concessions to the builders' lobby. It was prepared during the past month as Governor McGreevey's aides desperately tried to win Democratic support for a bill to preserve land near the rivers and reservoirs of the state's Highlands region.
 David Pringle, program director for the New Jersey Environmental Federation, said he would have opposed the Highlands bill if he had known the tradeoff would be so costly. He said the new rules would allow builders to sidestep much of the state's environmental code. 
 Jeff Tittel, executive director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, said he planned to challenge the plan in court, saying it violates federal environmental law and does not give the public enough opportunity to review building plans.
 ''This kind of legislation was rejected by Ronald Reagan and abandoned by Newt Gingrich,'' Mr. Tittel said. ''This will give New Jersey the worst environmental rules anywhere in the country. Our neighborhoods will see more toxic waste, pollution into their drinking water and rivers, and loss of open space than ever before.''
 Suburban sprawl and environmental protection are highly emotional issues in New Jersey, which is both the nation's most densely populated state and home to a high number of industrial waste sites.
 Mr. Rasmussen, the governor's spokesman, said the new rules, which Democrats have called the ''smart growth'' regulations, are also environmentally friendly because they balance the concerns of preservationists with the need for new housing and urban redevelopment. Senator Stephen M. Sweeney, the Democratic lawmaker who blocked the Highlands bill until the administration agreed to support the proposal to speed up permits, said the plan would also ease property taxes in some communities by allowing development to create new sources of municipal tax revenue.
 The New Jersey Builders Association and a variety of other construction groups welcomed the bill, saying it would help make sense of a permitting process that has driven up housing costs by creating a maze of time-consuming and expensive bureaucratic delays. John B. Canuso Sr. said the new regulations would allow construction companies to provide housing at a reasonable price.
 ''When you have the developers putting money on the street to plan, the farmers who want to sell their properties and the towns who need new tax revenue, you need predictability,'' said Mr. Canuso, who runs a construction company in Haddonfield.
 The regulations would apply to large swaths of land identified in the state's master planning map. Although supporters said the bill would focus on redeveloping urban communities, environmentalists insist that it will also lead to accelerated building in rural areas and suburbs. 
 ''This bill is packaged and presented as a smart growth bill but it is no such thing,'' said Dena Mottola, executive director of the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group. ''It will increase sprawl in towns already overburdened with overdevelopment.''

HEADLINE: With Pride and Warmth, Jersey City Welcomes New Hospital

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, June 14 

 BODY:
Nearly 70 years ago, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was greeted by a cheering crowd estimated at 200,000 people as he delivered $7 million in aid to spur construction of the new complex of buildings for the Jersey City Medical Center.
 The city-run charity hospital, like so many projects at the time, had succumbed to the collapse of the financial markets in the Great Depression and, as Roosevelt put it, help ''for the small-income families in times of sickness'' was in jeopardy.
 On Monday, the ribbon was cut on the new Jersey City Medical Center. Now a private, nonprofit hospital, it is again struggling in the financial markets, and it still serves primarily small-income families, with nearly 70 percent of the patients charity cases or Medicaid recipients. 
 This time it was federal loan guarantees, state grants, state land acquisition and municipal assistance that were cobbled together over 18 years to pay the $217 million cost for new construction.
 ''We don't have a stand-alone creditworthiness,'' said Dr. Jonathan M. Metsch, president and chief operating officer of the hospital, which is part of the nonprofit Liberty Health care system, a group formed by consolidating a number of small and financially troubled hospitals into one system during the 1980's. ''But the government loan guarantees say that we are the safety-net hospital in the area and that we are providing a service that is essential.''
 Monday's ribbon-cutting ceremony for the 350,000-square-foot, seven-story steel-and-granite structure did not attract the presence of a president. In 1936, Roosevelt, popular and heading into re-election, kicked off work on the seven-building, Art Deco medical complex of 20-story buildings with 1.1 million square feet of space that mimicked the grandeur of Rockefeller Center. 
 This time around, there was less pomp, but the feelings ran deep.
 For Gov. James E. McGreevey, it was literally a return to the place where he began. Mr. McGreevey was born in the Jersey City Medical Center's Margaret Hague Maternity Ward, named for the mother of Frank Hague, the longtime Jersey City mayor. Mr. McGreevey's mother had worked as a nurse at the hospital.
 ''It's a tremendously warm feeling being here,'' the governor said, smiling as he talked about the time he spent in the city until he started school. ''There's hardly three degrees of separation between me and the people here today.''
 Also attending was Representative Robert Menendez, who hospital officials said had championed the fight for the federal loan guarantees, making construction of the new medical center possible. Building a new hospital in an urban area when many hospitals are downsizing or consolidating was not an easy thing to sell to Congress, he said.
 But in the end, he said, the hospital won the help for a building to deal with ''those in the dawn of life, those in the shadows of life and those in the twilight of life.''
 The theme of the ceremony on the lawn of the 15-acre hospital on Monday, under a broiling sun, was that the hospital was ''the miracle in Jersey City.'' Speaker after speaker highlighted its improbability, and even Dr. Metsch said that there were ''eight or nine times when I thought it was dead.''
 The building actually opened on May 16 when staff began moving patients from the old complex near the heart of downtown Jersey City to the new structure near the waterfront, overlooking the Lower Manhattan skyline and the Statue of Liberty.
 James McLaughlin, chairman of the board of the medical center, said that little else but the board table and some chairs was worth moving from the old building to the new high-tech, state-of-the-art center.

BYLINE: By RICHARD SEVERO

 BODY:
Whitman Knapp, a federal judge with a prosecutor's tenacity and a Wall Street pedigree who led New York City through a tumultuous two-year investigation into widespread police corruption in the early 1970's, died yesterday at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. He was 95 and lived in Manhattan.
 As the commission's inquiry concluded, in 1972, Mr. Knapp was named to the Southern District bench by President Richard M. Nixon and remained on the court until his death, most recently in senior status. He presided at many major trials, including the corruption case of the Bronx Democratic leader, Stanley M. Friedman, who was convicted in 1986 in a racketeering conspiracy that involved bribery and fraud in connection with a multimillion-dollar city contract.
 But it was a phone call from Mayor John V. Lindsay in the spring of 1970 that led to Judge Knapp's most visible role: chairman of a five-member commission that would reveal, over many months, a pattern of corruption familiar in precinct houses throughout the five boroughs. From organized shakedowns at bars and construction sites, to payoffs from gamblers and drug dealers to ignore their growing influence, no officer seemed to be immune from the scourge of a department found to be riddled with graft and unable to police itself. 
 The principal catalyst for the inquiry came from a series of articles in The New York Times by David Burnham, a reporter who had earlier shed light on a widespread police habit called ''cooping,'' in which officers drove their patrol cars to out-of-the-way places to nap. 
 The articles that helped lead to the Knapp inquiry came about after The Times was approached by two disgruntled police detectives, Frank Serpico and David Durk, who had voiced their concerns and disgust to various officials in the Lindsay administration, including Jay Kriegel, a top aide to the mayor, and Arnold G. Fraiman, the head of the city's Commission of Investigations. Mr. Serpico later complained publicly that neither man seemed interested in what he had to say. 
 The commission report, based on the work of a 30-person staff, including about a dozen investigators, asserted that the Lindsay administration had failed to promptly investigate reports on specific corrupt acts, despite evidence that the corruption was widespread. 
 It faulted the mayor and the police commissioner, Howard R. Leary, for having ''failed to exercise leadership in the field of corruption.'' Mr. Lindsay said that over his then five years in office, he had asked the police many times to take ''vigorous and firm action'' to correct their own abuses. Mr. Leary quit before the commission filed its report.
 On the basis of the commission's work, several dozen indictments were issued and there were some convictions, although not many, given the scope of the report. If some wrongdoers managed to evade punishment because of lack of evidence, they saw their careers compromised or downgraded because of the inquiry. 
 The report has been credited, however, with ridding the department of the kind of pervasive corruption that Judge Knapp's commission uncovered and, among other things, led to the establishment of an undercover anticorruption force within the department. 
 But for Mr. Lindsay, it was a political blow from which he did not fully recover. The mayor had worked hard at trying to calm the racial and economic tensions of 1960's New York, but the report faulted him, saying he ''cannot escape responsibility'' for what happened.
 Percy Whitman Knapp was born on Feb. 24, 1909, the son of Wallace Percy Knapp, a New York lawyer, and the former Caroline Morgan Miller. He dropped the Percy before he went to college.
 His mother died when he was 3 years old and, five years later, Percy and two older sisters were sent to live with their maternal grandmother, Mary Miller. The Knapps were in the Social Register, and Whitman was groomed to carry on family traditions of success and influence. He went to private schools in New York City, prepped at Choate, then was admitted to Yale, from which he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1931. His college career gave no hint of his interest in law or in writing.
 He wasn't sure what he wanted to do -- he gave no indication that he wanted to follow in his father's footsteps -- but before his senior year was over, he ventured to Cambridge, Mass., and sat in some classes at Harvard Law School. ''It was enough to make me decide that was where I wanted to go,'' he said.
 At Harvard Law, he became editor of the Harvard Law Review, graduated in 1934 and got a job almost immediately with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft in Manhattan. He remained there until 1938, when he left to become an assistant district attorney in Manhattan under the racket-busting Thomas E. Dewey, for whom he had campaigned in 1937.
 By 1941, Mr. Knapp began to think it was time to return to private life, and so he joined the law firm of Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Lumbard. But within a year, Frank S. Hogan became Manhattan's district attorney. He thought highly of Mr. Knapp, with whom he had worked in Mr. Dewey's office, and persuaded him to return to the fold. Mr. Knapp worked well under Mr. Hogan and at one point was chief of three bureaus -- appeals, indictments and fraud.
 One of his most memorable, and briefest, court appearances grew out of a 1947 decision to ban Edmund Wilson's ''Memoirs of Hecate County'' from sale on the grounds that it was obscene and might have ''a bad effect'' on ''the immature or depraved.'' 
 It did not matter to New York that virtually every other major city and state in the union permitted the book to be sold, which was not surprising, since Mr. Wilson had long been known as a distinguished critic, author and dramatist. But the naysayers said some of his descriptions of sex play were ''clinical.'' 
 Doubleday was the publisher, and it appealed the New York ruling to the United States Supreme Court. Rather than rehash the contents of the book, Mr. Knapp rose and said: ''The New York statute is valid. Readings by the court of the book will demonstrate the factual finding of obscenity is reasonable.'' Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter refused to participate in the case and the other justices were tied, 4-4. So the New York ruling was permitted to stand, although a subsequent decision overturned it.
 In 1950, Mr. Knapp left Mr. Hogan's office to again enter private practice. In the years ahead, he served as a special counsel to Mr. Dewey, who had become governor of New York, and was a member of the commission that revised the state's criminal code. He also served in 1953 and 1954 as special counsel to the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, which investigated corruption on the New York docks.
 Looking back on the work of the Knapp Commission, Judge Knapp said that the relatively few convictions did not matter as much as his work did, for he felt his work had changed the culture of the police so that they took charges of corruption in their midst more seriously. The cultural change did not last as long or go as deep as he would have liked, since there were other police scandals in the decades ahead. Judge Knapp felt that many of the scandals came in part from the nature of the law itself.
 In 1993, Judge Knapp joined with Judge Jack B. Weinstein of the Eastern District, based in Brooklyn, in declaring that they no longer would preside over drug trials, a decision that already had been made quietly by federal judges across the country.
 In doing so, they were protesting what they called the failed national drug policies and sentencing guidelines that they said emphasized arrests and imprisonment, rather than prevention and treatment.
 Over the years, Judge Knapp developed a reputation for having a quick temper and being acerbic on the bench. But he resisted becoming cynical, never losing faith in the ability of police to do the right thing. He said that the public should not he judgmental about the behavior of the police since, ''Human nature being human nature, everyone can be subject to temptation.''
 Mr. Knapp married Ann Fallert in 1962. They had a son, Gregory Wallace Knapp. By a previous marriage, to Julie Marrow, he had three other children, a son, Whitman E. Knapp, of Brookline, Mass., and two daughters, Caroline Hines, of Manhattan, and Marion Knapp, of Eau Clair, Wis.; five grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.
 Mr. Knapp enjoyed good health and was quite vigorous until 1995, when he injured himself in a horseback-riding accident in Millbrook, N.Y., which cracked his hip and ribs and caused a collapsed lung. But even after the accident, he said he planned to keep working as a judge because ''I cannot think of anything more interesting to do.''

 CORRECTION:
An obituary yesterday about Whitman Knapp, a federal judge who headed the commission that investigated New York City police corruption in the 1970's, misidentified the mother of three of his four surviving children (Whitman E. Knapp, Marion Knapp and Caroline Hines). She was Elizabeth Mercer Nason; he had no children with his second wife, Julie Marrow. He and his third wife, Ann Fallert, had a son, Gregory Wallace Knapp.

HEADLINE: California Leads on Warming

 BODY:
Filling a leadership vacuum left by President Bush and Congress, states have been forced to lead the fight against global warming. Yesterday California unveiled an ambitious proposal to require automakers to cut emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases linked to global warming by as much as 30 percent over the next decade. 
 The plan will almost certainly be challenged in court by the automakers and possibly by the Bush administration. Given California's long history as an innovator in environmental policy, however, the initiative is likely to inspire similar efforts in other states and may have the further salutary effect of forcing the issue of climate change -- which even Senator John Kerry has shown little inclination to tackle -- onto the campaign agenda. 
 The plan grows out of legislation passed by the California Legislature two years ago. It would require manufacturers to start reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the 2009 model year with the aim of achieving a 30 percent reduction by 2015. Since carbon dioxide and other gases linked to global warming cannot be filtered in the same way that catalytic converters filter out harmful smog-forming particles, the only way to cut global warming emissions is to reduce fuel use. That means making more fuel-efficient cars.
 The manufacturers are likely to argue in court that this is merely a backdoor way of mandating a tougher fuel-economy standard, which under current law is a federal responsibility. The manufacturers will also complain about having to sell cars in states with different regulatory mandates. This is a legitimate problem, for which Washington must be blamed. Given the federal indifference, California cannot be expected to refrain from acting on its own to address global warming.
 The state's plan still faces further regulatory and legislative review. Nevertheless, whatever emerges is likely to serve as a template for similar action in other states, particularly on the East Coast, where concern over global warming runs high. In New York, Gov. George Pataki, for instance, is organizing a 10-state regional plan to cut power plant emissions, and he has announced that he will follow California's lead on automobiles. Altogether, more than 30 states have approved global warming laws of one sort or another, many of them aimed at encouraging greater use of less-polluting fuels. 
 All of that leaves Washington bringing up the rear of a parade it ought to be leading. Mr. Bush reneged on his 2000 campaign promise to impose mandatory caps on carbon dioxide, and Congress has rejected all efforts to mandate meaningful increases in fuel efficiency. 
 Local measures alone are never going to solve the climate-change problem, which will ultimately require a global response. And that battle will never be fully joined unless America joins it. But the palpable concern on the state level may in time serve as a goad to national action.

HEADLINE: Trade Center Cultural Decisions Affected by What's Best for Lincoln Center

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT and ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
When it came time early this month for a final decision on the cultural presence at the World Trade Center site, city and state officials' focus was in large part on what would be best for a cultural site some five miles to the north -- at Lincoln Center. 
 During a meeting at City Hall, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg pointed out that New York City Opera, which wanted to move downtown, was an economic linchpin of the city-owned New York State Theater at Lincoln Center. City and state officials who attended the meeting said that Mr. Bloomberg asked, in effect: If you take away my tenant, who is going to pay the rent?
 The city's financial concerns took on added weight as it became clear that the political ground had shifted, at least under this particular facet of ground zero decisionmaking. Gov. George E. Pataki, who has taken the lead in most of the big decisions about the trade center site, decided not to weigh in strongly about the cultural buildings, state officials said. 
 By last Tuesday, when Mr. Pataki met with John C. Whitehead, the chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, and other rebuilding officials, even Mr. Whitehead -- who had continued to champion City Opera's move to the trade center site -- recognized that he was nearly alone, said a state official who attended the meeting. 
 That was despite the previously undisclosed lengths that the opera company went to in trying to keep its prospects alive, like revising its plans repeatedly and obtaining designs from top architects for a cantilevered opera house squeezed into the allotted cultural space. (Several city, state and cultural officials spoke about the process on the condition of anonymity, citing the political sensitivity of the discussions.)
 The result was a plan announced last week that aims to install the Signature Theater Company and the Joyce Theater in a performing arts building and a Freedom Center museum and the Drawing Center in another building.
 The outcome was not always clear, however. Like most efforts at ground zero, it involved last-minute lobbying and a seemingly endless series of designs and plans to determine an appropriate cultural mix for the site of the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001.
 The decision is expected to be approved by the development corporation's board next month. Early in 2002 City Opera officials were already meeting with Mr. Whitehead and others, seeking support for a move downtown. In Mr. Whitehead, a retired Goldman Sachs executive, they found a sympathetic ear. 
 An opera fan, he came to believe the City Opera was one of the few New York institutions with sufficient weight to anchor the cultural offerings he envisioned for the trade center site. Mr. Whitehead did not respond to a request for an interview.
 But roadblocks to the proposal soon surfaced, among them the question of whether the physical requirements of an opera house could be accommodated in the architect Daniel Libeskind's conceptual design for the site.
 City Opera said it needed a 2,200-seat theater to make the move a financial success, but planners at the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation doubted that such a large hall would fit on the site. 
 Redevelopment officials also wondered what would fill the auditorium in the 30 weeks per year that City Opera was not performing or rehearsing. Unlike some other cultural institutions, City Opera did not have much experience in programming, the often-difficult art of inviting and scheduling performances by traveling dance and music troupes. That left the prospect of a big theater sitting empty for much of the year. 
 City officials involved in the process had other concerns, too, including the impact that a new opera house might have on sites like Carnegie Hall, City Center and the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Nearly every cultural institution was already feeling economic strain in the aftermath of 9/11. Lincoln Center, meanwhile, was in danger of being diminished, as well, with the New York Philharmonic floating plans last summer to move to Carnegie Hall.
 But City Opera pressed on. 
 Rejecting proposals from rebuilding officials that they consider other sites away from ground zero, opera officials asked Mr. Libeskind to figure out, conceptually, how to fit an opera house into his ground zero scheme. At the same time, Rafael Vinoly, the New York-based architect, offered his own version of a possible vertical opera house. Mr. Vinoly was one of the creators of a rival ground zero plan that came in second to Mr. Libeskind's. 
 ''We wanted to show there was room,'' said Paul Kellogg, general and artistic director of City Opera.
 Both Mr. Vinoly and Mr. Libeskind came up with plans that would allow an opera house to work on the site, using a taller building with a portion of the auditorium cantilevered over the street. Development corporation officials said they thought those proposals ultimately were too costly or provided too little public space for operagoers.
 Downtown residents and other cultural institutions also were weighing in, both publicly and behind the scenes. 
 The heaviest lobbying, however, came from some of the institutions themselves. Mr. Pataki spoke with Edward Norton, the actor, who is on the board of the Signature Theater Company, among others. 
 Several people involved in the process said that Lincoln Center officials did not personally lobby against City Opera at the mayor's office or the development corporation. But Mr. Bloomberg was familiar enough with the issues; he contributed $15 million toward Lincoln Center's redevelopment plan before becoming mayor, an anonymous gift at the time. He also used to serve on the center's board and remains close to Beverly Sills, the former chairwoman of Lincoln Center who now is chairwoman of the Metropolitan Opera. Through a spokesman, Mr. Bloomberg declined to comment. 
 Although Ms. Sills made her career at City Opera, she has at times opposed the company's positions on Lincoln Center's redevelopment. And though City Opera has complained about the acoustics in the State Theater, she has said they were fine for her.
 ''I've always said I hope they stay at Lincoln Center,'' Ms. Sills said in an interview. 
 Mr. Bloomberg was also influenced by Kate D. Levin, the commissioner of the city's department of cultural affairs, who knew well the city's financial commitment to Lincoln Center. The city has contributed $7.7 million to the State Theater's capital maintenance during the last 14 years, according to department figures. And having committed $240 million to Lincoln Center's redevelopment project under the Giuliani administration, the city had already made clear that no additional capital funds would be available to the campus. 
 City Opera, meanwhile, found itself unable to get the mayor's ear. Mr. Kellogg said the opera had requested meetings with Mr. Bloomberg but had been turned down. ''Certainly City Opera wishes we'd been given an opportunity to meet with the mayor before a decision was made,'' he said.
 Many of the organizations that submitted proposals for ground zero ''sought individual meetings to lobby the mayor but meeting with any of them would have undermined the selection process,'' said Edward Skyler, the mayor's press secretary.
 By the time officials from the development corporation came to brief him on the cultural proposals shortly after Memorial Day, the mayor's mind appeared to be made up. ''The mayor said that he was now confident that the hole that City Opera would leave at Lincoln Center was not fillable, the city would be called upon to pay for it, and he didn't want to pay for it,'' said one person involved in the process.

HEADLINE: As Clinton Is Honored, a Brief Break From Politics. Very Brief.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14 

 BODY:
For a moment in the White House on Monday morning, it seemed like a political mirage: President Bush and Bill Clinton, joking as they walked together into the East Room, then spending the next 20 minutes effusively praising each other. 
 But the even stranger sight was the audience, the men and women who make up Senator John Kerry's brain trust, almost all of them veterans of the Clinton era who have not set foot in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue for three years, four months and 24 days, vigorously applauding the sitting president they are desperately trying to ride out of town.
 Peace finally broke out this morning -- well, a truce that ended after lunch -- between two administrations that make no secret of how viscerally they dislike each other. The brief lull in the street fighting permitted the unveiling of the official White House portraits of Mr. Clinton and his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton -- which will now, by tradition, occupy the places where portraits of Mr. Bush's father and mother now hang. 
 Graciousness oozed from all sides. Mr. Bush praised his predecessor -- upon whom he bestowed the honorific nickname ''42'' to mark an eight-year interregnum between Bushes -- as a man ''with far-ranging knowledge of public policy, a great compassion for people in need, and the forward-looking spirit the Americans like in a president.'' He offered up an advance plug for Mr. Clinton's memoir.
 His face reddening, his eye tearing a bit, Mr. Clinton returned the compliment, saying: ''I had mixed feelings coming here today, and they were only confirmed by all those kind and generous things you've said. Made me feel like I was a pickle stepping into history.''
 For the first time in years, he stood and talked at a lectern adorned by a presidential seal.
 Forgotten, for the moment, was Mr. Bush's campaign pledge ''to restore honor and dignity'' to the Oval Office. And forgotten was the unwritten rule inside the Bush White House that Mr. Clinton's presidency would rarely be mentioned by name -- except to blame it for leaving Mr. Bush with an approaching recession, for contributing to violence in the Middle East, or for letting North Korea keep its plutonium.
 Until Monday, the former aides to Mr. Clinton -- who filled the East Room and then wandered, nostalgically, through the ceremonial rooms for a lunch given by Laura Bush -- have been no more charitable. Day by day, with ever-increasing volume, they issue broadsides about how Mr. Bush has torn apart perfectly solid alliances, turned surpluses into huge deficits and blamed everyone but himself for mistakes in Iraq. 
 (The Clinton alumni are also circulating a joke about how many Bush administration officials it takes to change a light bulb. The answer is seven, and the joke is too long for this space, but suffice it to say that one of the officials is in charge of blaming Mr. Clinton for the blown bulb, and another is in charge of invading a country that is believed to be stockpiling replacement bulbs.)
 But that was all gone this morning. ''I thought everybody was going to break out in 'Kumbaya,''' said Rahm Emanuel, known a few years ago as among the most partisan of Mr. Clinton's aides.
 Mr. Emanuel said he was touched by Mr. Bush's comments. But by this afternoon, the good feelings about Mr. Bush had worn off sufficiently for Mr. Emanuel, now a congressman from Chicago, to point out how an underestimate of terrorist attacks around the world in a recent Bush administration report fit a pattern of ''curious mistakes'' involving other unpleasant statistics.
 The Bush administration said it believed this was the first time that Mr. Clinton had returned to the White House since he left on Jan. 20, 2001, having just issued a slew of midnight pardons over the advice of his own top aides. His wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, has been back many times, for official events. And on Monday Mr. Bush had kind words for her, as well.
 ''Listen, New York politics is serious business,'' Mr. Bush said to laughs. ''It's rough business. It takes an extraordinary person to campaign and win the United States Senate. She has proven herself more equal than -- to the challenge.'' 
 Mrs. Clinton also proved herself eager to have posterity remember her as she was in the White House: dressed in a pants suit, all business. For some in the crowd, it was a welcome return to once-familiar ground. Former Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen was there, using a wheelchair because he has had several strokes, but smiling at the Texas jokes. So were two of Mr. Kerry's top foreign policy advisers: the former defense secretary William Perry and the former national security adviser Samuel R. Berger. And so was Chelsea Clinton, who smiled when Mr. Bush said, ''The fact that you survived your teenage years in the White House speaks to the fact you had a great mom and dad.''
 But a few in the audience seemed to be watching Mr. Bush with the seasoned eye of a batter studying videotapes of a particularly skilled pitcher. Among them was Mary Beth Cahill, Mr. Kerry's campaign manager, who was an assistant to the president under Mr. Clinton.
 ''It's the first time I've seen him in the White House,'' Ms. Cahill told reporters later. ''I thought that President and Mrs. Bush were extremely gracious to the Clintons. This was a historic moment; it was a nonpartisan moment.''
 She might have said briefly nonpartisan: By the time reporters returned to their offices, Ms. Cahill had circulated a letter mocking plans by Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's top political adviser, for a media blitz against Mr. Kerry, and citing poll numbers showing the president behind the challenger.
 Mr. Bush's graciousness today was hardly surprising. He remembers well, his aides say, Mr. Clinton's equally charitable comments about 41, the senior President Bush, when his portrait was unveiled nearly a decade ago. Ms. Cahill recalled that ceremony as a ''similarly nonpartisan, historical moment'' and said ''and everyone rose to the occasion.''
 For those looking for even the subtlest sign of partisan bite in the encounter, there were a few tiny morsels to chew. Mr. Bush's praise of his predecessor included references to Mr. Clinton's ''hard work and drive and determination and optimism.''
 ''I mean, after all,'' he said with a grin, ''you got to be optimistic to give six months of your life running the McGovern campaign in Texas.''
 Mr. Clinton was only slightly more indirect. Talking about his favorite portraits in the White House, he finally settled on one of another president, from a century ago, who knew a thing or two about military pre-emption. 
 ''If you look at that picture, Theodore Roosevelt, who was known as our most macho, bully, self-confident president,'' Mr. Clinton said, ''you look at that picture and you see, here's a human being who's scared to death and not sure it's going to come out all right.''
 Then, with a cryptic comment that left all sides confused about whether he was making comparisons to a modern president immersed in a messy foreign occupation, he added: ''And he does the right thing anyway. That's what I saw in that picture.''
 But in the end, Mr. Clinton returned to the theme that dominated the post-Monica Lewinsky phase of his presidency: what he used to call the politics of personal destruction.
 ''I hope that I will live long enough,'' he told Mr. Bush and the former Clinton aides, ''to see American politics return to vigorous debates where we argue who's right and wrong, not who's good and bad.''

HEADLINE: Kerry Opens 2-Week Drive on the Economy

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, June 14 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry served notice Monday that he still considered the economy a central vulnerability for President Bush despite strong employment growth in recent months.
 Beginning a two-week focus on the economy, officials with the Democratic challenger's campaign argued that Mr. Bush's record should be judged on his entire tenure, not on the turnaround of the past few months.
 ''If you get D-minuses for three and a half years in college, one semester of a B-minus does not get you on the honor roll,'' said Gene Sperling, who was a top economic adviser to President Bill Clinton and is now advising Mr. Kerry. 
 ''Our economy doesn't recover after three and a half extremely weak years of job creation with just a few positive months,'' Mr. Sperling added.
 Moreover, the Kerry campaign asserted, the quality of many of those new jobs, the shift to employment in lower-paying industries with scanty benefits and the pressures of rising health, education and energy costs have combined to create an increasingly strained middle class. The campaign issued a report Monday indicating that 1.6 million households filed for bankruptcy in 2003, up a third from 2000.
 Bush campaign officials fired back, with a spokesman, Steve Schmidt, mocking Mr. Kerry for ''his pessimism and misery tour.''
 ''Senator Kerry ignores the good economic news,'' Mr. Schmidt added, ''and plays to people's fears and anxieties.''
 But Mr. Kerry, signaling the themes of the next few weeks, suggested that it was Mr. Bush who was out of touch. Landing here in Atlantic City to attend a fund-raising reception Monday night and then speak to the New Jersey A.F.L.-C.I.O. on Tuesday, he declared, ''We're here to make sure that Americans get a job where if you work, and work hard, you can actually pay your bills at the end of the day.''
 ''I've met parents all over this country who are struggling to be able to send their kids to school,'' he added. ''Where 20 years ago one job allowed them to send their kid to college, now two barely does it.''
 Mark Mellman, the Kerry campaign's pollster, said voters overwhelmingly agreed with this more sober assessment of the economy, in several recent polls giving Mr. Bush decidedly poor ratings on his economic stewardship. Mr. Mellman said that voters felt besieged by rising prices and that they expected interest rates to rise soon and make their household budgets even worse.
 The Kerry campaign officials brushed aside any notion that they would be perceived as this year's version of what Republicans have sometimes called ''doom and gloom'' Democrats. The Kerry aides said this was a year very different from 1984 and 1988, when such depictions proved effective against the Democratic nominees, Walter F. Mondale and Michael S. Dukakis. 
 In general, Kerry advisers, buoyed by recent polls showing a tight race and continued problems for Mr. Bush, projected a decidedly bullish air at a briefing for the press in Washington on Monday. Mary Beth Cahill, Mr. Kerry's campaign manager, described Mr. Bush as ''a rudderless incumbent'' who had engaged in a campaign of negative ads rather than positive proposals for the future, a calculation that Kerry advisers argue will ultimately be proved decisively wrong.
 Tad Devine, a senior adviser to the Kerry campaign, declared, ''I think it's fair to say that John Kerry won the spring general election, and I think he won it decisively.''
 Mr. Kerry is expected to take his economic argument this week to Ohio and Michigan, in a region achingly sensitive to the loss of good-paying manufacturing jobs.
 Mr. Sperling conceded at the briefing Monday that Mr. Bush was not entirely to blame for the economic troubles of the past three and a half years.
 ''No question, George Bush had a couple of bad breaks on his watch,'' Mr. Sperling said, ''most specifically 9/11 and the slowing economy of 2001. But he also inherited 4.1 percent unemployment, a doubling of productivity, the strongest fiscal situation in our country, and he had a Congress that three different times did what he wanted'' on tax and economic policy.
 The two economic views clashed throughout the day. Even as the Kerry campaign was briefing, the Commerce Department was hailing ''strong'' retail sales growth in May. Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans declared, ''More Americans are going on spending sprees at shopping malls as more people are finding well-paying jobs'' thanks to ''President Bush's leadership.''

HEADLINE: Coal Market Zooms In On Mines in Colorado

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: SOMERSET, Colo., June 9 

 BODY:
Jim Cooper's mountain of coal is a prodigious thing to behold. There is enough glistening black carbon here to fill more than 15,000 tractor-trailers, or a coal train 35 miles long. And each day that the nearby Elk Creek Mine grinds away in an around-the-clock coal digging frenzy -- flush with urgent orders, rising prices and insatiable demand -- the pile grows larger because the coal simply cannot be shipped out fast enough.
 ''By early October, we could be coalbound,'' said Mr. Cooper, an Alabama-born executive vice president at Oxbow Mining, Elk Creek's owner, as he stood on the pile's edge. Being coalbound, he said, would be akin to being snowed in, buried so deep in coal that there would be no room left for storage and the mine would have to shut down temporarily. 
 Colorado, once a backwater of coal production in the shadow of giants like West Virginia and Wyoming, has stumbled into unexpected wealth. China is exporting less coal and keeping more for its own use, thus pinching supply. Appalachian coal, especially the cleaner burning lower-sulfur variety that Colorado's coal competes with, has gotten scarcer and more expensive, and soaring natural gas prices have compelled electricity-generating companies to scramble for alternatives. 
 This year through June 5, coal output in Colorado rose more than in any other major coal-producing state, up 16 percent from the same period in 2003, according to federal energy figures, pushing Colorado from the eighth-largest producing state to the sixth. About half of that output comes from the three mines here in a sliver of stony verticality in the central Rockies called the North Fork Valley, about 40 miles southwest of Aspen.
 ''Colorado shows you how these markets work,'' said John Blaney, an energy analyst at ICF Consulting in Fairfax, Va. ''It was an uneventful place, and now the market has zoomed in.''
 Coal's long-term outlook is also improving, some energy experts say. More than 60 new coal-fired power plants in 26 states are now in the planning stages, including one just south of Denver that could be the first new coal-to-electricity station in the state in 20 years if approved by regulators. 
 And coal is not the only thing piling up. So is the overtime. Colorado's mines, like most of those in the West, are strictly non-union places, where as one miner here put it, ''you keep your mouth shut.'' But the mines are also among the highest-paying industrial operations in the United States, with miners earning $82,500 on average, including benefits, according to the Colorado Mining Association. 
 On a recent afternoon, Jesse Erickson, 51, grinned under his headlamp in the dark, grimy tunnel 1,000 feet under the mountain, talking about his ninth straight day at work at Elk Creek. Mr. Erickson has spent 30 years digging Colorado coal -- all of it in the mines here in the North Fork Valley -- and now has two sons, Jason and Jesse James, working alongside him. 
 He stood with a remote control panel in his hands, operating a machine called a continuous miner that was clawing into the coal seam and dumping load after load into the shuttle cars lined up in the tunnel behind him. Mr. Erickson's coal automaton can load 16 tons in less than a minute.
 But the market signal that tells a company to dig more coal because buyers are ready to pay is one thing. Getting the coal from the middle of nowhere to the middle of somewhere is another, and that is where the railroad figures into the story of the big pile.
 The Union Pacific railroad -- rail being the only practical way that coal can leave the North Fork Valley's narrow, winding terrain, especially in the volumes that the mines here are producing it -- has been struggling to add crews and locomotives. So far this year, an average of about four and a quarter one-mile-long trains have inched through the North Fork Valley every day, but the railroad promised an average of four and a half trains, and that gap is a big reason for the mounting coal pile. 
 Part of the problem, a spokesman for the railroad said, is that the nation's economic recovery this year caught railroad managers by surprise, increasing demand for all kinds of rail freight, with coal only one competing interest among many. There is also the issue of mountain geography.
 ''In the case of Colorado, all of the coal moves east on a single-track mountain railroad, and that limits the number of trains,'' said John Bromley, a spokesman for Union Pacific. ''We don't have enough crews to handle it all, but we have an aggressive hiring program under way.''
 A rise in ocean freight costs has also benefited the North Fork coal, mine officials said. One new customer in the Northeast, for example, started buying from Elk Creek this year after shipping costs from a South American mine suddenly made a Colorado source more attractive. 
 Other buyers have grown desperate as delivery delays have increased. Elk Creek received an emergency call this spring from a buyer willing to pay as much as $28 a ton for North Fork coal, a $10 premium over the average Colorado market price. Transportation to the Midwest or East Coast adds another $20 to $35 per ton. One fully loaded train carries about 10,500 tons.
 ''We haven't seen prices like that in 15 years,'' Mr. Cooper said.
 Many environmentalists are dismayed at coal's new luster and have begun a campaign against new power plants, including a coal-fired plant proposed by Xcel Energy for Pueblo, two hours south of Denver. 
 ''Coal should be a part of the past, not the future,'' said Mark Detsky, an energy lawyer at Environment Colorado, a conservation group in Denver.
 A spokesman for Xcel, which is based in Minneapolis, said the renewed appeal of coal was that unlike fuels like oil or natural gas, whose prices can zig or zag in dizzying fashion, coal was generally downright boring. 
 ''Prices for natural gas have been volatile, and trending higher for the foreseeable future,'' said Steve Roalstad, a spokesman for Xcel. At the same time, Mr. Roalstad said, population growth in the Rocky Mountain region has increased the so-called base-load demand -- energy that must be available all the time, not just at peak moments. Most of the new electricity generation in the United States in the last 20 years has relied on natural gas.
 ''Coal, in the long run, is more cost effective in meeting that base-load demand,'' Mr. Roalstad said.
 Down in the mine at Elk Creek, the labyrinthine tunnels clattered and clanked with unseen pumps, machines and diesel engines. One turn revealed a trio of electricians sitting in a row performing maintenance on a multimillion-dollar coalface shearer, which can tear off two-and-a-half-foot strips of coal from the mountain in a single pass. Around another curve, half a dozen men were taking their lunch breaks in the dark, headlamps shining down on the sandwiches in their hands.
 Some energy experts say that this boom, like so many other Rocky Mountain mining stories, from uranium to silver, could also end in a bust. By 2010, tighter federal air standards are scheduled to take effect, requiring scrubbers and other new technologies for burning coal. Low-sulfur coal like North Fork's will not be necessary to help meet those new standards, analysts say, and so the market's wandering eye could move on.
 But miners like Mr. Erickson do not think so. When he retires, his sons, both now in their 20's, will still have years of work ahead of them, he said.
 ''There should be coal through their 50's at least,'' Mr. Erickson said.
 ''There's supposed to be a 30-year-block just where we're at,'' he said, as he loaded another shuttle car with the flick of a lever.

HEADLINE: In Mexico, Anger Over Gas Terminals

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, June 15 

 BODY:
Fierce opposition to proposed liquefied natural gas terminals in Baja California has thrown into doubt the Mexican government's plan to end the country's dependence on United States gas imports. 
 Petroleos Mexicanos, the oil monopoly, is heavily taxed to finance the government's budget and is starved for cash to develop the country's abundant natural gas reserves. So Mexico imports, at high prices, close to 20 percent of the gas it uses. All of that comes from the United States. 
 ''We are importing from an importer,'' said Dionisio Perez-Jacome, president of the Energy Regulatory Commission, the Mexican federal regulator for private energy investment. ''It's always better to be at the beginning of the chain rather than at the end.'' 
 The government estimates that demand for natural gas will grow 6.8 percent a year through 2012. Much of that is driven by rising electricity use because gas is needed to fuel new power plants. 
 L.N.G. is supercooled to a liquid state, shrinking the volume it occupies by a factor of 600 so that it can be transported by tanker to terminals close to markets. There, it is revaporized and piped to homes and industry. Building liquefied natural gas terminals, Mr. Perez-Jacome said, would enable Mexico to import gas from distant new sources, like South America, Russia and Indonesia.
 By diversifying the sources of gas, the plants will end Mexico's dependence on United States imports, which are more expensive than L.N.G. Pointing to California's energy crisis three years ago, Mr. Perez-Jacome said L.N.G. imports would also reduce Mexico's vulnerability to disruptions in the American market.
 Permit applications for three L.N.G. terminals are moving through Mexico's federal and state bureaucracies. Two terminals would be in Baja California, which covers the northern part of the peninsula. The third, the project that is furthest along, is at Altamira, a large industrial port on the Gulf of Mexico.
 A fourth application, for Lazaro Cardenas, a Pacific port further south, is expected soon. 
 The governors of Baja California and Sonora, another border state, are backing two more terminals, but those plans are still embryonic.
 Opposition has concentrated on the two more advanced proposals for Baja California, a region where environmental awareness has increased sharply in the last decade, with critics raising environmental and safety concerns that recently shelved similar projects in Alabama, California and Maine. 
 Many opponents also say that the real purpose of the Baja California projects is to supply natural gas to California, putting Mexican communities at risk for America's energy needs.
 Opponents are also expected to fight the new Sonora proposal, since it is in an environmentally sensitive area and will export gas to the United States. 
 However, in the United States, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is holding off approval of applications for new L.N.G. terminals, until a safety study is finished, probably by the end of the year, according to Joseph Kelliher, a commissioner at the agency. 
 Mr. Kelliher told Dow Jones last month that the agency wanted ''better information'' about risks before going forward with new projects. 
 In the first Baja California project, divisions of Royal Dutch/Shell and Sempra Energy, a company based in San Diego, are planning a $600 million project some 50 miles south of the border and need only a few permits to begin construction in the next few months, said Daniel Fobelets, manager of the joint venture for Shell.
 The terminal will supply a billion cubic feet of natural gas a day, almost three times what the state of Baja California consumes, once the terminal is completed in 2007. Half will be exported to the United States.
 The second proposal, from ChevronTexaco, calls for a $650 million offshore terminal on a platform eight miles off the coast of Tijuana and less than half a mile from the pristine South Coronado Island. If all permits are granted, construction would begin next year, said Carlos Atallah, vice president of ChevronTexaco de Mexico.
 The terminal would begin by processing 700 million cubic feet of natural gas a day in 2007, with 500 million cubic feet for Mexico and the remainder for California. Mr. Atallah said it was too early to say how much of the plant's eventual daily capacity of 1.4 billion cubic feet would go the United States. 
 Pointing to an accident this year in Algeria that killed more than 20 people, opponents argue that liquefied natural gas terminals are unsafe. They also say the proposed Baja California terminals threaten an already strained coastal environment. But what most infuriates them are the exports.
 ''The problem with these projects is that the gas is for the California market,'' said Arturo Moreno, coordinator of the climate and energy campaign for Greenpeace Mexico.
 The gas, he said, could also go to fuel future power plants built to send electricity to the United States, as two electricity plants on the border at Mexicali already do. One, operated by Sempra Energy, sells all its power to the United States. The second, built by InterGen, a venture of Shell and the Bechtel Corporation of San Francisco, sends half its electricity north. 
 Energy companies talk about an integrated market, Mr. Moreno said, but ''there is a double standard for environmental impact.'' 
 ''We have more corrupt institutions,'' he said. ''We have more lax environmental standards and much worse enforcement.''
 Mr. Perez-Jacome, the regulator, said Mexican environmental and safety standards were ''top of the line.''
 Executives on both projects say they pay heed to environmental concerns.
 And, they say, both sides of the border will benefit.
 ''It is important to be able to export gas to the United States because that will stabilize the price in Mexico as well,'' Mr. Atallahof ChevronTexaco said. ''The more gas you put in the system, the better for everyone.''
 But industry executives acknowledge that not all the proposals will succeed. ''It's hard at this stage to say how many terminals are going to be built in Baja California,'' Mr. Atallah said.
 Community opposition has already scuttled one proposal. In March, the Marathon Oil Corporation of Houston backed out of a plan to build a $1.7 billion energy complex south of Tijuana after the Baja California state government expropriated part of the land for the site.
 Sergio Tagliapietra, the state's economic development secretary, said the government acted to resolve ownership disputes over the site, land he said was better suited for tourism or commerce. But he acknowledged that opposition from residents of Playas de Tijuana, an upper-middle-class Tijuana suburb about a mile away, influenced his decision.
 The state government generally welcomes L.N.G. proposals, he said.
 Wary of the growing weight public protests carry in Mexico, energy executives have taken pains to emphasize their contacts with the community. But opponents are not swayed.
 ''We are surprised that Chevron had the nerve to propose the project,'' said Alfonso Aguirre, director of a local nongovernmental organization, Conservacion de Islas, which is looking at legal options to block it. ''They thought of this option because they could not build in an inhabited area.''
 Opponents of the Shell-Sempra project accuse the state government of subverting the zoning of the proposed site, which is in a section of the coastline closed to industry. Mr. Tagliapietra defended the interpretation, saying the terminal did not constitute industrial development. 
 Investors in the nearby tourist resort of Bajamar are fighting the Shell-Sempra proposal in court.
 Shell and Sempra ''have a public relations program that they carry out in Ensenada,'' said one of the developers, Roberto Valdes. ''When we have expressed concerns they have said nothing. Next day in the paper they say everything is O.K.''


CORRECTION-DATE: June 19, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article in World Business on Wednesday about opposition in Mexico to proposed liquefied natural gas terminals misstated the stance of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on new terminals in the United States. (Dow Jones, which provided the commission's comment, transmitted a revision, but The Times overlooked it.) Applications will not be held up because of a comment period on a safety study, a spokesman said. The commission has not suspended approvals.

HEADLINE: 2 PIPELINE BLASTS HALT OIL EXPORTS AT TOP IRAQ PORT

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG and JAMES GLANZ

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Wednesday, June 16 

 BODY:
Two explosions at oil pipelines near the Persian Gulf forced the shutdown of Iraq's main oil export terminal on Tuesday for what is expected to be about 10 days, costing the country up to $1 billion in revenue.
 The shutdown, which the authorities said was caused by a bombing on Monday and a bombing or malfunction on a second line on Tuesday, came on a day when snipers lining a highway and an overpass near Baghdad International Airport staged a well-organized ambush on a convoy, killing at least four foreign contractor workers, an American military official and a security contractor said. 
 [On Wednesday morning, gunmen assassinated the security chief for the northern oil fields in Kirkuk, Agence France-Presse reported, citing the Iraqi police. The security chief, Ghazi Talabani, a member of the clan of the Kurdish political chieftain Jalal Talabani, was riddled with bullets as he left his home. Ghazi Talabani was the link between American forces, the Northern Oil Company and the private security firm Erinys as they tried to shield the oil fields from attacks.] 
 The specter of sectarian strife coursed through the streets of Baghdad on Tuesday as hundreds of furious Shiite Muslim mourners staged a funeral march through the capital and accused a hard-line Sunni cleric in the volatile city of Falluja of ordering the deaths of six Shiite truck drivers. Their bodies were discovered Monday in a morgue in the neighboring town of Ramadi. The cleric denied giving the order and the identity of the killers and their religion could not be established. 
 The incidents came in the midst of a mounting number of dramatic and sophisticated attacks taking place as Iraq's new interim government prepares to assume formal control of the country on June 30. The sniper attack occurred a day after a powerful car bomb killed five foreign contractors and eight Iraqis in downtown Baghdad. The attack on the oil line was the most devastating so far in a series of ambitious infrastructure assaults clearly intended to paralyze the country.
 The oil explosions crippled a pair of major pipelines in southern Iraq, shutting down exports from the country's most important oil-producing region. In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Reuters reported that still another fiery explosion had ripped through a crude oil pipeline running between oil fields in northern Iraq. 
 The first explosion occurred late Monday about 10 miles south of the southern city of Basra and was a clear case of sabotage, witnesses said. 
 It was unclear whether the second explosion, at about noon on Tuesday, came as the result of another attack or because technicians tried to compensate for the first incident by increasing the oil flow in a parallel pipeline, causing a violent rupture.
 In April, Basra's oil terminal was the target of a largely unsuccessful waterborne attack by suicide bombers.
 Attacks on Iraq's electrical grid, oil pipelines and other structures have been increasing in frequency since a major outbreak of the insurgency here in April. Last week the interim Iraqi prime minister, Iyad Allawi, said attacks on oil pipelines alone had cost the country $200 million.
 ''We've basically been in a race with the enemy to see if we can build them up faster than they can tear them down,'' said John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, which closely tracks developments in Iraq. ''To go after the oil undercuts the ability of Iraq to finance its own reconstruction and makes it more dependent on the United States.''
 Together, the two southern lines could carry about 80,000 barrels of oil an hour for export to ports on the Persian Gulf, said Walid Khadduri, editor of The Middle East Economic Survey and an authority on the Iraqi oil industry. Mr. Khadduri said the pipelines could take very roughly 10 days to fix and cost the country between $450 million and $1 billion over that time, although production could be increased later to compensate for the shutdown once repairs are made.
 Jamal Qureshi, a market analyst at PFC Energy, said rising oil production by other countries had dampened any immediate effect the attacks may have had on crude oil prices. Another analyst at the same company, Roger Diwan, managing director of markets and countries, said that if repairs took much longer than 10 days or there was another major attack, global markets would be affected.
 ''It has a cumulative impact the longer it lasts,'' Mr. Diwan said.
 Until the latest attacks, Iraq had been exporting an average of from 1.7 million to 1.9 million barrels of oil a day, compared to somewhere between 2 million to 2.2 million before the American-led invasion last year, Mr. Khadduri said. 
 Amid the increasing attacks to the oil infrastructure, the way that Iraq's oil revenues are being spent in advance of the handover of sovereignty to a new Iraqi goverment on June 30 is being called into question. Iraq Revenue Watch, an initiative of the Open Society Institute, an organization backed by the billionaire George Soros, alleges that nearly $2 billion in expenditures recently authorized by a United States-controlled board in charge of the Iraqi budget until June 30 may have been rushed into committments on ill-advised projects before power switches hands.
 The money includes $460 million for reconstruction of the oil sector, even though most of the nearly $2 billion that Congress allocated for oil reconstruction last fall remains uncommitted to specific projects. Occupation authorities have maintained that there is no overlap in projects to be undertaken by the two pots of money.
 The attack on the convoy of foreign contractors was also part of a succession well-planned incidents clearly aimed at disrupting rebuilding efforts. It took place between 1:30 and 2 p.m. on a north-south road veering into the highway leading to the Baghdad airport, said Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, a spokesman for the occupation forces. Insurgents on an overpass raked a three-vehicle convoy with gunfire. Passengers in two of the cars were apparently killed, while a third car pocked with bullet holes limped to a nearby American base.
 General Kimmitt said he knew nothing of the identities of the victims and did not know exactly how many people were killed. He added that he had gotten a report of the attack firsthand ''from some fairly shaken-up contractors.''
 A security contractor who had been briefed on the attack said it appeared that at least four people had been killed but said he did not know their nationalities, which company they worked for or the nature of their jobs. Besides the gunmen on the overpass, he said, snipers opened fire from positions they had taken up along both sides of the road. The contractor said he had been informed that the assault took place on the main road to the airport rather than on an intersecting artery.
 The five-mile airport road is considered by foreigners to be the most dangerous thoroughfare in Baghdad. On June 6, insurgents armed with rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47's killed two American security contractors and two Poles in a coordinated ambush on a convoy of sport utility vehicles. Several contractors escaped by lobbing fragmentation grenades at the attackers and commandeering a civilian car at gunpoint. 
 Responsibility for Monday's suicide car bombing that killed 13 people, including five foreign contractors, was claimed Tuesday by a group headed by the suspected Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. A statement claiming responsibility was dated Monday and posted on an Islamist Web site on Tuesday, according to a Reuters report.
 The complicated tensions underlying politics and violence emerged vividly during the funeral march through Baghdad. Hundreds of Shiite Muslims marched on Tuesday from the sprawling slum of Sadr City to a central square to demand vengeance against Sunnis for the murders of six Shiite truck drivers in Sunni-dominated Falluja, 35 miles west of the capital, according to several news wire reports.
 One report quoted mourners saying the men were attacked by insurgents on a highway on June 5 after they delivered a load of tents to the Falluja Brigade, an Iraqi militia being used by the marines to try to maintain calm in Falluja.
 The drivers escaped and sought refuge in a police station. The police turned the drivers over to Sheik Abdullah al-Janabi, a conservative Sunni imam, the mourners said. The imam then ordered the drivers killed, they added. The imam, however, denied that he issued such an order.
 Still, Khaled Latif Matar Sihail, a tribal leader in the funeral march, told Reuters, ''They are starting an old feud, a sectarian feud. We now demand blood from the residents of Falluja for our innocent sons.''
 The mourners carried the bodies of the drivers in wooden coffins. One 12-year-old boy, Muhammad Khudeir, told The Associated Press that he had been with the drivers when they were handed over to ''a group of Arabs who spoke with non-Iraqi accents.'' Muhammad said he had been let go because of his age.
 Sheik Janabai said in an interview on the Al Arabiya satellite television station, that if anyone had any evidence against him, he was ready to face justice before an Islamic court. He and a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, Col. Adnan Abdul-Rahman, confirmed that the drivers had been killed but said they did not know who the murderers were.
 Sheik Janabi said hundreds of Iraqis were killed in Falluja when the marines invaded it in April, and so it was understandable that people in town get angry at Iraqis seen as collaborators with the occupation. ''People here think that anyone who works with the Americans or helps their mission is an American stooge,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.N. Study Finds Its Workers Uneasy About Reporting Corruption

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, June 15 

 BODY:
A new survey of internal perceptions of the integrity of United Nations officials has found that while procedures for reporting and combating corruption exist, most staff members either are unaware of how to use them or fear retaliation if they do.
 ''The U.N. has a 'phone book' of rules and regulations which are totally useless, as they are never practiced,'' one staff member is quoted as saying in the 89-page report. Another says, ''Senior leaders caught in serious breaches of ethics should be punished, not promoted as usual.'' 
 While the study was conducted before the United Nations' reputation for institutional responsibility was undermined by charges this spring that its officials might have been involved in corruption in the Iraq oil-for-food program, it is being made public at a time when Secretary General Kofi Annan has been forced by the widespread publicity given those charges to appoint a high-level panel to look into them.
 The head of that investigation, the former United States Federal Reserve chairman, Paul A. Volcker, has said that its first priority is to examine any role that United Nations officials may have played in diverting billions of dollars in kickbacks and overcharges in the oil-for-food program.
 The now defunct United Nations-administered program was established in 1996 to allow Iraq to use proceeds from oil exports to import food and other civilian essentials to offset the privations of Iraqis living under economic sanctions. 
 The new study records relatively high levels of worker satisfaction and commitment to the organization's goals, but its most negative findings have to do with ingrown leadership and the lack of response to reports of corruption.
 ''Get rid of the old boy network,'' one staff member is quoted as saying. ''That network is wide, tenacious and powerful. It is the ruin of U.N. officers. So long as you can wind your way into that network, you are O.K. If not, you are doomed.'' In a cover letter, Mr. Annan acknowledged that United Nations employees ''generally perceive that breaches of integrity and ethical conduct are insufficiently and inequitably addressed by the disciplinary system.''
 ''At the same time,'' he said, ''they voice concern about the consequences of whistle-blowing, or reporting on misconduct, and uncertainty about the mechanisms for such reporting.''
 Mr. Annan said that the United Nations office of internal oversight services provided a way for staff members to report their concerns privately and that the office of ombudsman afforded a channel for mediation and resolution, but that ''clearly, these need to be better known and made more accessible to staff at large.''
 He promised measures ''to reinforce formal protection for whistle-blowers, while ensuring that they are not used to cloak false accusations.'' Department heads, he said, are being directed to hold town hall meetings with workers to discuss the report. The survey, conducted by Deloitte Consulting LLP, went to all 18,015 members of the United Nations secretariat staff around the world. A total of 6,086 responses were received. Mr. Annan ordered up the report last year as part of a United Nations campaign against global corruption.
 Casting a favorable light on the overall findings, Mr. Annan said, ''Few staff think that there is widespread fraud or financial corruption in the organization, and most staff believe that they know what is expected of them in the way of integrity and ethical behavior.''

HEADLINE: Giving Some Spin To the Status Quo

BYLINE: By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

 BODY:
Yesterday's double-barreled announcement from the New York Philharmonic looks like a public relations move dressed up as an artistic policy.
 Months ago the orchestra made all but official its intention to extend Lorin Maazel as music director. That he will keep the post for three rather than the expected two additional years is not big news.
 To counter the perception that by sticking with Mr. Maazel through 2009 the orchestra is hewing to the status quo, the Philharmonic has announced that the eminent maestro Riccardo Muti will conduct for four weeks per season starting in 2006 and that two younger American artists, David Robertson and Alan Gilbert, will have ''conducting roles,'' as the announcement put it, also beginning in 2006 and running through 2010. No title is attached to any of these three musicians, who already have significant ties to the Philharmonic. 
 Is the Philharmonic feeling defensive as several major orchestras reap credit for having shaken up their institutions by appointing risk-taking artists as their music directors? In 2002 the Berlin Philharmonic turned itself over to Simon Rattle, the young British firebrand, who declared his intention to bring this historic orchestra into the 21st century and to make a major commitment to living composers. Fortified by a large roster of young players, Sir Simon has been delivering on his promise.
 That year another European in his early 40's, the Austrian conductor Franz Welser-Most, took over the Cleveland Orchestra from the formidable Christoph von Dohnanyi. Though Mr. Welser-Most, an immensely gifted artist, was something of an unknown quantity in the United States, you have to assume that this smart and principled orchestra knows what it's doing. So far, despite some solid achievements, his tenure seems a work in progress.
 Last season showed the benefits when an orchestra embraces change. In 1992 the struggling Los Angeles Philharmonic put its trust in a Finnish dynamo, Esa-Pekka Salonen, then 34. He has been so successful that the city is counting on the orchestra and its new home, Disney Concert Hall, to revitalize the downtown area (though sports fans would say the Los Angles Lakers are also playing a part).
 Youth isn't everything of course. The musicians of the Philadelphia Orchestra and the music-loving citizens of that city are responding excitedly to the arrival of the hypercharged conductor Christoph Eschenbach, who is 64.
 And though James Levine, 60, has health problems, the Boston Symphony Orchestra was so convinced that he would begin an era of adventurous artistic growth that it punted for two seasons without a music director while waiting for him to be free. He begins his tenure this fall.
 At the New York Philharmonic, by contrast, after essentially bungling the search to replace Kurt Masur with a younger and hipper music director, the orchestra turned at the last minute to Mr. Maazel, a formidable maestro with podium flair to spare but an old school artistic thinker who was 72 when he arrived in 2002. His tenure has divided listeners and critics. The Philharmonic is playing brilliantly for the most part, though Mr. Masur bequeathed his successor an orchestra in excellent technical shape. Mr. Maazel deserves credit for introducing new works in strong performances, but his willful, agenda-driven accounts of repertory staples can be hard to take.
 It was thought that Mr. Maazel's initial contract might be a transition for the orchestra. Does the extension mean that it is struggling to take the next step? Inevitably some will see Mr. Muti, Mr. Robertson and Mr. Gilbert as embarking on a five-year audition.
 Mr. Muti has already turned down the music director's post once and is not likely to change his mind. An Italian perfectionist, he remains intensely involved running La Scala Opera in Milan and at 62 has scant desire, it would seem, to take on the challenges facing a modern American music director: dealing with conservative orchestra boards, exploring the new generation of American composers, proselytizing for classical music among the public.
 To my mind Mr. Robertson is the most accomplished American conductor of this generation. A champion of contemporary music, he can make a complex score by Pierre Boulez sound lucid and luminous, and Beethoven's Fifth sound radical. Though he has a quirky and nervous personality, he seems to have a productive relationship with the Philharmonic players. But he has just committed himself to the directorship of the St. Louis Symphony and intends to keep his European career going strong.
 Mr. Gilbert, a New Yorker and the son of two Philharmonic musicians, made a well-received return to the orchestra last month and at 37 is certainly someone to watch. But so is, say, the British conductor Antonio Pappano, who made his debut this season as well and who may wind up with as many future guest stints as Mr. Gilbert.
 Everyone welcomes the involvement of these artists in the Philharmonic. I'd like to see more of Marin Alsop, James Conlon and others. How about bringing back the brilliant Kent Nagano? Still, for all the hype of yesterday's announcement, the orchestra seems an uncertain institution trying to placate critics and reassure subscribers.
 Maybe dealing with a major renovation of Avery Fisher Hall and being displaced for up to two seasons is all that the directors can handle right now.

HEADLINE: Evidence of High-Skill Work Going Abroad

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
In the debate over high-technology work migrating abroad, there has been widespread agreement on at least one thing: the jobs requiring higher levels of skill are the least at risk. 
 Routine software programming and testing jobs, analysts agree, are the ones most susceptible to being grabbed by fast-growing Indian outsourcing companies. By contrast, the people who devise the early blueprints for projects -- the software architects -- have been regarded as far less likely to see their jobs farmed out.
 But Microsoft contract documents show that as far back as 2001 the big company had agreed to pay two Indian outsourcing companies, Infosys and Satyam, to provide skilled ''software architects'' for Microsoft projects. The documents were obtained this month by WashTech, an organization of technology workers based in Seattle, which gave copies to The New York Times. 
 ''The policy prescription you hear from people again and again as the response to the global competition of outsourcing is for Americans to move to high-end work,'' said Ronil Hira, an assistant professor for public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology. ''It's important to dispel the myth that high-end work is immune to offshore outsourcing.''
 ''What is not clear,'' Mr. Hira added, ''is how much of that high-end work will go abroad.''
 A Microsoft spokeswoman, Stacy Drake, said that as a matter of policy the company did not comment on individual contracts with suppliers. But, she said, ''we often use outside companies for projects.''
 The outside contractors, Ms. Drake said, are used to bring in specialized expertise Microsoft may not have internally or to bring additional technical support to a project. 
 Still, Ms. Drake said, building the ''core intellectual property'' in Microsoft products is left to full-time company employees. 
 Though definitions vary, software architects are highly skilled workers who often earn six-figure salaries in the United States. The Microsoft contracts with Infosys and Satyam show that the work of software architects, senior software developers and software developers was being done by employees of the Indian companies working at Microsoft facilities in the United States.
 Their work did not come cheap for Microsoft, which was billed $90 an hour for software architects, or at a yearly rate of more than $180,000. Senior software developers were billed at $72 an hour and software developers $60 an hour.
 The on-site work, said Mr. Hira, an expert on offshore outsourcing, is usually done by Indian software engineers who come to the United States on H-1B visas, which allow foreign workers to be employed in the United States for up to six years.
 The Indian workers themselves are paid a fraction of what their employers collect. The top annual salaries paid by Indian outsourcing companies to Indian software experts working in the United States range up to $40,000 or so, Mr. Hira said.
 The contracts also say that for short stints of work, less than 90 days, Microsoft will pay for round-trip economy airfare for travel between India and the United States.
 The contracts also include work done in India, by project managers and by software development and testing engineers. The billing rate for this work ranges from $36 an hour to $23 an hour.
 A spokeswoman for Infosys said the company did not comment on its contracts, and a Satyam spokesman could not be reached.
 Critics of the outsourcing trend regard such agreements with Indian contractors, with work done both in the United States and in India, as a step toward shifting more and more skilled technology jobs overseas. 
 ''Microsoft has hired vendors whose whole reason for being is to transfer work offshore,'' said Marcus Courtney, president of WashTech, an affiliate of the Communications Workers of America.
 The foreign competition for work at Microsoft, Mr. Courtney said, will help the company's management put more pressure on wages for its American workers and reduce employee benefits. 
 Last month, Microsoft announced that it planned to cut costs by an estimated $80 million a year by trimming prescription drug benefits, tightening parental leave policies and making it more expensive to buy Microsoft shares through the employee stock purchase plan.
 Despite its use of foreign contract workers, Microsoft expects to add 3,000 to 3,500 full-time employees to its United States payroll of 37,000 in the fiscal year that ends in July.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New Jersey: Bloomfield: Redevelopment Grants Set

BYLINE: By Anthony DePalma(NYT); Compiled by George James

 BODY:
Jane M. Kenny, regional administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, announced more than $3 million in federal grants yesterday to help decontaminate and redevelop old industrial sites in New York and New Jersey. The grants are part of $75 million in federal funds that the agency will provide to communities across the country for revitalizing thousands of polluted industrial properties, called brownfields, that present comparatively low health risks. Appearing at the municipal garage in Bloomfield, Ms. Kenny said that by bringing together private companies and government agencies to clean up and rebuild the contaminated sites, the brown fields program ''creates opportunities to solve local problems for redevelopment with local solutions.''

HEADLINE: Gas Prices Lead Gradual Rise in Inflation

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
A surge in gasoline prices lifted the Consumer Price Index by 0.6 percent in May, the largest monthly increase in three and a half years, the government reported yesterday. Food prices also jumped while the prices of many other items went up by enough to suggest that the inflation rate will continue to climb gradually.
 The financial markets, however, viewed the latest inflation numbers as nonthreatening and evidence that the Federal Reserve will stick to its plan of ''measured'' increases in interest rates.
 Reflecting this view, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell sharply while the Dow Jones industrial average, which thrives on low rates, rose 0.4 percent. The markets focused not on the surge in the overall C.P.I. but on the small 0.2 percent increase in the so-called core inflation rate, which excludes the often volatile price swings of food and energy. 
 ''After four straight months of worse-than-expected core C.P.I., we are finally getting some relief,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief domestic economist for High Frequency Economics. 
 The market performance yesterday reflected a growing confidence among investors that the Fed's policy makers, when they meet on June 29 and 30, will raise the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks by only one-quarter of a percentage point from its current 46-year low of 1 percent. The federal funds rate, in turn, influences the cost of mortgages, car loans and other forms of consumer credit.
 In Congressional testimony yesterday, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, seemed to confirm that the all-but-certain rate increase would be small. ''Our general view is that inflationary pressures are not likely to be a serious concern in the period ahead,'' Mr. Greenspan said.
 He appeared to base that view on the nature of current inflation. So far, none of the increase is a result of rising labor costs, which can put constant upward pressure on prices and squeeze profits. 
 ''We try to focus on the whole structure of price and cost and profitability in making judgments as to whether individual price changes are significant,'' Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee during a hearing on his nomination for a fifth term as chairman.
 He reiterated, as he has in the past, that the Fed is likely to raise the federal funds rate slowly, until it is close to what it considers a neutral level for a healthy economy with mild inflation, which some Fed policy makers describe as a 2 percent annual increase in the core C.P.I.
 The core rate is moving in that direction, having risen 1.7 percent over the 12-month period ended in May. That was the first bit of relief this year. The core annual rate had risen to 1.8 percent in April from 1.1 percent in January, setting off alarms that inflation was back after many months of almost no upward pressure on prices. Still, the slight drop in May could disappear in June or July. Prices have risen steadily for many goods and services other than food and energy, and last month was no exception.
 ''It is widespread, this modest acceleration in inflation,'' said Patrick Jackman, a senior economist at the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the C.P.I. 
 Housing costs, for example, increased 0.4 percent in May after an identical increase in April. Homeowners bore most of this increase, partly because they paid more for natural gas and home heating oil but also because rents are rising and are likely to continue to do so.
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the C.P.I., weighs shelter costs more heavily than any other single item in the overall index. To calculate shelter costs, the bureau determines what a homeowner would ask in rent for his home, and assumes that the amounts specified cover actual outlays for maintaining a home. 
 The ''owner's equivalent rent,'' as it is called, moves roughly in tandem with actual rents for homes and apartments. These are rising as mortgage rates go up and people become gradually more interested in renting a home rather than buying one. ''As demand strengthens, landlords appear to be shedding their reluctance to raise rents,'' Mr. Jackman said. 
 That dynamic could produce an unusual phenomenon: rising shelter costs and falling home prices. Home prices measure an owner's investment rather than what the bureau considers ''day-to-day consumption costs.''
 Medical costs, up 0.4 percent in both April and May and 4.6 percent over the last 12 months, are also continuing to climb as health insurance premiums and hospital and doctor fees rise. Clothing prices are up as well, increasing 0.3 percent in May after no rise in April, but they gained 0.9 percent in March.
 ''Somehow, retailers have been able to increase prices for apparel, not huge increases, but they are sticking,'' Mr. Jackman said.
 Consumers are beginning to notice, according to some public opinion surveys. Harris Polls, for example, asks 1,000 people every other month what they consider to be the most important questions for the government to address. 
 ''We don't even get one or two people mentioning inflation as one of the top issues,'' said Humphrey Taylor, president of Harris Polls, a division of Harris Interactive. ''However, we have a ton of data that show the public is very upset about certain prices, and the two most prominent are prescription drugs and gasoline/fuel.'' 
 While prices mostly rose in May, some fell -- for things like long-distance phone calls, personal computers and software, tickets to movies and sporting events, airfares and toys. These were overshadowed by the food and energy increases, mainly the latter, which rose by 4.6 percent, an increase many times greater than the 0.1 percent rise in April. 
 That helps to explain why overall C.P.I. rose 0.6 percent in May after rising 0.2 percent in April. Over the last 12 months, this index, which is the nation's best known inflation measure, is up 3.1 percent compared with 1.9 percent in 2003. 
 Gasoline prices, by far the largest component of the cost of energy, were responsible for the jump in energy prices in May. The price of gasoline began to surge in late April, after the Bureau of Labor Statistics completed its price survey for that month. April, as a result, showed a small increase, 0.1 percent.
 By the end of May, the average price of a gallon of gasoline was $2.09, or 24 cents higher than at the beginning of the month, according to the Department of Energy. By mid-June, that average had eased to $2.03 a gallon. While that would suggest the energy component will show no increase at all when the June C.P.I. is published next month, the report will probably show a healthy increase.
 That is because the bureau makes adjustments in the index's components to reflect seasonal price variations. In June, gasoline prices are expected to decline. But an actual decline that is less than the seasonally expected one will register as an increase. Gasoline would have to drop below $1.95 a gallon for it to register as a decline from May's level, Mr. Jackman said.
 Food prices surged 0.9 percent in May, up from 0.2 percent in April, because of sharp increases in meat and dairy prices. That largely reflects smaller herds, the result of increased slaughtering two years ago when the cost of feeding cattle was higher than the price they brought. For dairy products, the big factor was a 33 percent increase last month in the government's support price paid to farmers for a gallon of milk, which is passed on to consumers.

HEADLINE: After Weighing Value of Lives, 9/11 Fund Completes Its Task

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Nearly three years after establishing a fund to compensate the families of Sept. 11 victims, the federal government said yesterday that it had completed the task and that it would end up paying more than 5,000 families almost $7 billion.
 To mark the end of the program, the fund's administrator, Kenneth R. Feinberg, met with President Bush and Attorney General John Ashcroft yesterday afternoon at the White House. In an interview afterward, Mr. Feinberg said the president praised the program for giving the families the full compensation to which they were legally entitled. 
 It was a bittersweet coda to a program that hovered, day after day for a total of 997 days, as a sad and sometimes numbing reminder of the awkward and difficult process by which the families and the government decided how much the lives and the injuries were worth.
 On Sept. 22, 2001, Congress created the Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund without any financial cap as part of an airline bailout package, and as a fast and, it hoped, less painful alternative to lawsuits. In exchange for giving up their right to sue, which some lawyers argued could be a draining and risky option, relatives of dead victims were told that the average payment would be about $1.5 million, tax free, after deductions for life insurance and other possible benefits.
 The fund got off to a slow start, plagued by criticism of rules governing eligibility to apply and how the financial calculations would be made, as well as an overwhelming sense of grief among victims' families. Just a month before the application deadline, Dec. 22, 2003, only 60 percent of those eligible for death benefits had filed claims. The rate was so sluggish that New York members of Congress pushed for a one-year extension. 
 As the deadline approached, hundreds rushed to file, pushing the final application rate to 97 percent of the 2,973 families of the dead who were eligible. In what Mr. Feinberg said was a sign of the fund's success, only 70 lawsuits were filed against the airlines, while 30 or so families filed neither a lawsuit nor an application with the fund.
 ''When you have about two-thirds of all the physical injury claims not coming in until the last 45 days and 40 percent of the death claims, the magnitude of getting this completed fairly and consistently by the June 15 deadline was a difficult challenge, but we did it,'' Mr. Feinberg said.
 By yesterday, Mr. Feinberg's office said that 2,878 families had received, or were about to receive, compensation on behalf of dead victims that averaged almost $2.1 million per family. The lowest individual payment was $250,000 and the high was $7.1 million.
 In addition, 2,675 of the 4,430 who filed injury claims were to be compensated; of those, 1,919 were rescue workers at ground zero or the Pentagon. The range of those payments was from $500 to $8.7 million. 
 In all, Mr. Feinberg said, the government would spend approximately $6.9 billion on the fund, roughly $1 billion of which would go to injured victims. But the fund was more than just a blur of statistics about economic loss; it was also an intense emotional experience for thousands of people.
 There were families who filed early because they wanted to get the process over with and move on. There were families who were so paralyzed by grief that they barely applied in time. There were families, too, that squabbled bitterly and endlessly over who would speak for the dead and who would get to share the awards.
 There were lawyers and accountants, in New York and around the country, who wanted to contribute to the healing process in a post-9/11 world. Some assisted families without pay. Others did it for a reduced commission.
 And there was Mr. Feinberg himself, who had previously mediated complex compensation disputes like the legal claims involving the effects of the Agent Orange defoliant used in the Vietnam War. Mr. Feinberg said he had never encountered the kind of raw and bottomless pain that consumed many 9/11 families.
 ''I underestimated the emotion caused by the horror,'' said Mr. Feinberg, who was also not paid for his work on the fund. 
 To sift through the claims during the surge in 11th-hour filings, Mr. Feinberg leaned increasingly in recent months on a temporary staff that included close to 250 people from assorted federal agencies and PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm. to Mr. Feinberg, alone, was the final arbiter.
 In the last two weeks, hundreds of injured victims who said they had suffered respiratory illnesses at ground zero made last-minute claims. By midnight last night, all decisions were final, and the fund was officially shut down, save for a few hundred checks to be mailed out.

HEADLINE: Who Needs Money When You've Got a Lot of Nerve?

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN

 BODY:
Upspeak -- the phrasing of almost everything as a question -- is often cited as evidence of insecurity in young women. But the question mark is power for Nicole Richie, the trampy tyrant who lived with her pal Paris Hilton on a farm for ''The Simple Life'' last season. Questions from Ms. Richie can mortify; they can also be a prelude to full-on larceny or assault.
 ''Are you wearing a cup?'' Ms. Richie asks, before kicking a baseball player in the groin. She's just checking. 
 Her questions of course are insolent at their core, and this, along with flashes of inspired hauteur from Ms. Hilton, is the key to the catty humor of the show, which starts again tonight on Fox. 
 ''The Simple Life 2'' provides an alibi for poisoned inquiries of all kinds. This time the zany blondes are on a road trip, crossing the United States from Miami to Los Angeles without any money, keeping televised appointments with picturesque Americans. Ms. Richie is a tourist; she ought to be curious. She is curious. Far more than Ms. Hilton she cares about people, especially about their perversions and their inhibitions. A stock sally from her involves asking her host at a dinner what words he or she considers vulgar, and -- once they've been hinted at -- saying every one of them. 
 When, on tonight's episode, she spots a bedroom with a mirrored ceiling in a house they're visiting, she asks the aging owner, ''What do you do with this mirror?''
 The man fumbles with a jokey answer. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Richie asks, ''Did you ever do any modeling?'' Again a jokey answer. Then she closes the deal: ''Will you please model the chaps for us? Bottomless, with just the chaps, please?'' He does it. 
 Another of Ms. Richie's questions, one she finds many spirited variations on, is ''May I have some money?'' Consider: ''Do you have 75 cents?'' ''Do you have two dollars?'' ''Could I have like five more dollars for gas?''
 And then, to a toll collector, whom she can't pay: ''Can we give you -- do you want gum? Do you want contact solution?'' And to a convenience store manager, from whom she wants free gas: ''Can I like help you -- clean something or do something?''
 The answers to these last questions are of course no. But almost everyone lets her debts slide anyway. For that Ms. Richie is grateful if unsurprised, and when she's not staring defiantly at the people she has just wounded, she's lazily paying them compliments. To the bare-bottomed guy in chaps she says, looking bored, ''That was the sexiest thing I have ever seen.'' 
 Finally, when she has gotten what she came for, she works her most loyal phrase, the incessant and melodic ''Thenk yew!'' that rings throughout ''The Simple Life 2,'' making the show seem much sweeter than it is.

QUINTUPLETS
Fox, tonight at 8:30, Eastern and Pacific times; 7:30, Central time
 The five teenagers on ''Quintuplets,'' a lazily imagined sitcom that begins tonight, also on Fox, line up in a neat row of adorable cliches: ditzy girl, nerdy girl, short boy, weird boy and cool boy. The ditz jabbers on about her hair and the nerd sulks in glasses. The shortie tries to get taller, the weirdo jumps around. The cool kid keeps it together. The door to his room has ''no trespassing'' and ''keep out'' signs on it. Why does every television teenager have these signs?
 The retread plot has something to do with the quintuplets' parents' (Andy Richter, Rebecca Creskoff) trying to find time to have sex and listen to Bruce Springsteen, who is now officially parent music. When they head off for a concert (and a magic brownie, hee hee), the children host a boozeless party and try to hook up with other airhead television types. The laugh track keeps guffawing. Ryan Pinkston, Ashton Kutcher's spiteful little sidekick from ''Punk'd,'' shows off his superb, hoarse deadpan, but otherwise the show's a bust -- and a sorry holding pen for the pleasant comic Andy Richter, for whom it's a vehicle.

METHOD & RED
Fox, tonight at 9:30, Eastern and Pacific times; 8:30, Central time
 A major lift comes at the end of tonight's lineup on Fox. It's ''Method & Red,'' a gleeful comedy of race mixing in an overpriced New Jersey suburb. 
 The sitcom, which stars Method Man and Redman, the rap tycoons and B-movie comedians, is sharply written and confidently sentimental, grounded in a cheering vision of Americans as united by a willingness to work hard and a love of our mothers. 
 It's also funny and not stingy with jokes, unlike most sitcoms, which mete out the punch lines in slow waltz time. Every set here -- from Method's and Red's new McChateau, to the tollbooth where Method's mother, Dorothea (Anna Marie Horsford), insists on working because Jesus also had a job -- is also tricked out with details that provide bonus laughs. In the mansion plasma televisions showing basketball appear on nearly surface; there's one on the fridge and one inside it. An exchange between Method Man and Beth Littleford, as a neighbor, exemplifies the show's exuberance, and its right-on comic deflations.
 ''Yo! It's neighbor lady. Hi, neighbor lady!''
 ''My name is Nancy.''
 ''Yeah, like I'm going to remember that.''
 David Henrie, as Nancy's rap-happy 12-year-old son, and Peter Jacobson as her husband, Bill, round out the grand cast. The actors have found an easy comic rapport, as if they'd all been in repertory for years, or had grown up on the same block.

HEADLINE: Kerry Calls Bush Off-Base on Economy and Cost of Iraqi Prisoner Abuse

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, June 15 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry sharply criticized President Bush on two fronts Tuesday. He asserted that Mr. Bush had overestimated the health of the economy and underestimated the damage to the United States from the Iraqi prisoner abuse scandal.
 Campaigning in New Jersey and Ohio, the Democratic challenger accused the Republicans of being all too willing to settle for an economy that leaves the middle class falling farther and farther behind. ''We all know that the middle class built this country,'' he told a cheering convention of the New Jersey A.F.L.-C.I.O., meeting in Atlantic City Tuesday. ''Franklin Roosevelt understood that, and so did Bill Clinton.'' 
 ''But for nearly four years now,'' he said, ''Washington has ignored the middle class, putting wealth ahead of work, something for nothing ahead of responsibility, and what's right for the few ahead of what's right for America.'' 
 At an airport news conference near Cincinnati, Mr. Kerry also asserted that Mr. Bush had ''underestimated the full impact'' of the Iraqi prisoner scandal on America's reputation in the world. He said Mr. Bush should appoint an independent investigator to investigate the abuses -- someone like Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona -- ''to prove to the world that this is really not going to be swept under the rug.'' Mr. Kerry has reportedly tried repeatedly, and in vain, to get Mr. McCain to consider being his running mate. 
 Mr. Kerry also said: ''Torture is not acceptable, period. The United States of America has always been a leader in making it clear to the world that torture is not acceptable.''
 In the light of recently disclosed memorandums from administration lawyers, saying the administration was not bound by prohibitions against torture, Mr. Kerry said, ''I believe this administration still owes answers to the American people.'' 
 Throughout the day, the Bush and Kerry forces engaged in a long-distance debate over the economy that suggested the contours of the fall campaign. Mr. Bush declared at a news conference Tuesday, ''Our economy is strong and getting stronger.'' He added that employment was growing, consumer spending was rising, and ''all indications are that the economic stimulus plan we put in place is working.''
 Echoing the themes of his campaign operatives, who described Mr. Kerry as engaged in a ''pessimism and misery'' tour, Mr. Bush concluded: ''I am an optimistic person. I guess if you want to try to find something to be pessimistic about, you can find it, no matter how hard you look, you know?''
 Mr. Kerry countered, at his news conference, ''They're the pessimists, because they believe Americans are willing to accept less than what Americans are used to doing and achieving.''
 Making the case for changing economic leadership is widely considered critical to Mr. Kerry's campaign -- and the case has become more complicated in recent months, amid steady employment gains. In his speech to the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which he echoed throughout the day, Mr. Kerry argued that economic growth alone was not enough to help the middle class.
 ''More and more of you are working harder and harder and you're still not able to get ahead,'' he said, citing soaring health care costs, rising education and child care costs, the flight of good paying jobs overseas and their replacement with low paying service jobs at home.
 Mr. Kerry argued that he would put the nation's tax code and budget in line with its ''moral code.'' Citing tax provisions helping major corporations, he argued, ''Our tax code has gone from 14 pages to 17,000 pages. Any of you got your own page? Enron's got its own page. Exxon's got its own page. Looks to me like Halliburton's got its own chapter.''
 There were some dissonant moments in his bid for middle-class support; he attended a celebrity fund-raiser Monday night at the sprawling estate of Jon Bon Jovi. And he was asked by a local reporter Tuesday how his championship of the middle class squared with his wealthy wife and lifestyle. 
 ''It's not the size of your bank account,'' he said. ''It's what you feel in your heart and your gut. If it was the size of your bank account, John Kennedy might not have been president. Franklin Roosevelt might not have been president.''
 He ended his day at a rain-soaked outdoor rally in Columbus, which drew a large crowd of supporters as well as a scattering of abortion protesters, and some Bush supporters. The Republicans blasted the theme song from ''Flipper'' for part of his speech to accuse him of flip-flopping on issues. As dusk fell, Mr. Kerry delivered his paean to the middle class, and the crowd held in a driving rain, cheering as he invoked the legacies of Presidents Clinton and Roosevelt.

Kerry Is Urged to Give Up Seat
By The New York Times
 BOSTON, June 15 -- Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey is calling for Sen. John Kerry to give up his Senate seat while campaigning for president, contending that his spotty attendance is leaving state residents ''underrepresented'' in Congress. 
 Ms. Healey, speaking on behalf of Gov. Mitt Romney, a Republican, said the seat should be filled with ''someone 100 percent devoted,'' citing a number of missed votes. 
 Mr. Kerry was asked about the call for his resignation, and replied, ''I'm running for president because we have to put this country back into a place of responsible leadership.'' He said his campaign was serving Massachusetts and the country.

HEADLINE: Dare We Call It Genocide?

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: ALONG THE CHAD-SUDAN BORDER 

 BODY:
The Bush administration says it is exploring whether to describe the mass murder and rape in the Darfur region of Sudan as ''genocide.'' I suggest that President Bush invite to the White House a real expert, Magboula Muhammad Khattar, a 24-year-old widow huddled under a tree here.
 The world has acquiesced shamefully in the Darfur genocide, perhaps because 320,000 deaths this year (a best-case projection from the U.S. Agency for International Development) seems like one more boring statistic. So listen to Ms. Khattar's story, multiply it by hundreds of thousands, and let's see if we still want to look the other way. 
 Just a few months ago, Ms. Khattar had a great life. Her sweet personality and lovely appearance earned a hefty bride price of 40 cattle when she was married four years ago to Ali Daoud, a prosperous farmer. The family owned 300 cattle and 50 camels, making them among the wealthiest in their village, Ab-Layha in western Sudan. Ms. Khattar promptly bore two children, the youngest born late last year.
 About the same time, though, the Sudanese government resolved to crush a rebellion in Darfur, a region the size of France in western Sudan. Sudan armed and paid a militia of Arab raiders, the Janjaweed, and authorized them to slaughter and drive out members of the Zaghawa, Masalit and Fur tribes.
 On March 12, Ms. Khattar was performing her predawn Muslim prayers about 4 a.m. when a Sudanese government Antonov aircraft started dropping bombs on Ab-Layha, which is made up of Zaghawa tribespeople. Moments later, more than 1,000 Janjaweed attackers rode into the village on horses and camels, backed by Sudanese government troops in trucks.
 ''The Janjaweed shouted: 'We will not allow blacks here. We will not let Zaghawa here. This land is only for Arabs,' '' Ms. Khattar recalled.
 Ms. Khattar grabbed her children, and, as shots and flames raged around her, raced for a nearby forest. But her father and mother tried to protect their animals -- they were yelling, ''Don't take our livestock.'' They were both shot dead.
 The attack was part of a deliberate strategy to ensure that the village would be forever uninhabitable, that the Zaghawa could never live there again. The Janjaweed poisoned wells by stuffing them with the corpses of people and donkeys. They also blew up a dam that supplied water to the farms, destroyed seven hand pumps in the village and burned all the homes and even the village school, the clinic and the mosque.
 In separate interviews, I talked to more than a dozen other survivors from Ab-Layha, and they all confirm Ms. Khattar's story. By most accounts, about 100 people were massacred that day in Ab-Layha, and a particular effort was made to exterminate all men and boys, even the very young. Women and girls were sometimes allowed to flee, but the prettiest were kidnapped.
 Most of those raped don't want to talk about it. But Zahra Abdel Karim, a 30-year-old woman, told me how in the same attack on Ab-Layha, the Janjaweed shot to death her husband, Adam, and 7-year-old son, Rahshid, as well as three of her brothers. Then they grabbed her 4-year-old son, Rasheed, from her arms and cut his throat.
 The Janjaweed took her and her two sisters away on horses and gang-raped them, she said. The troops shot one sister, Kuttuma, and cut the throat of the other, Fatima, and they discussed how to mutilate her. (Sexual humiliation has been part of the Sudanese strategy to drive out the African tribespeople. The Janjaweed routinely add to the stigma by branding or scarring the women they rape.)
 ''One Janjaweed said: 'You belong to me. You are a slave to the Arabs, and this is the sign of a slave,' '' she recalled. He slashed her leg with a sword before letting her hobble away, stark naked. Other villagers confirmed that they had found her naked and bleeding, and she showed me the scar on her leg.
 By comparison, Ms. Khattar was one of the lucky ones. She lost her parents, her home and all her belongings, but her husband and children were alive, and she had not been raped. Unfortunately, her luck would soon run out.
 I'll tell you more of her story on Saturday, because if she and her people aren't victims of genocide, then the word has no meaning.

HEADLINE: Bloc of Lockerbie Families Urges End to Libya Penalties

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15 

 BODY:
The families of some passengers killed 15 years ago when a Libyan agent bombed a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, are coming here Thursday to lobby for lifting the remaining sanctions against Libya.
 The families of the 270 victims were divided over even negotiating with Libya, but their divisions deepened strongly last summer, when Libya agreed to pay $10 million for each of the 270 victims if all sanctions against it were lifted. At the time, some relatives said the arrangement seemed like a bribe. 
 Most families accepted a first payment of $4 million in September, when the United Nations ended its sanctions. But the deal for the remaining $6 million -- $4 million for the end of some economic sanctions and $2 million when the United States took Libya off the list of nations supporting terrorism -- expires on July 22. 
 Meanwhile, recent developments have thrown more of an international shadow on Libya. 
 Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, has publicly expressed regret that former President Ronald Reagan died before he could be tried as a war criminal for ordering an air-strike in 1986 against Libya that killed Colonel Qaddafi's adopted daughter and others. Also, an Arab-American arrested for currency violations has reportedly told investigators the money was provided by Libya and was to be used in a plot to assassinate the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, an American ally. 
 James P. Kreindler, who represented 120 of the families in the negotiations with Libya, said relatives of 230 victims had signed a recent letter to President Bush, urging that sanctions be lifted. The letter, which he said he drafted at the request of an association of Pan Am families, was sent before the death of President Reagan and the report that Libya might be involved in a plot to kill the Saudi prince.
 ''There is a growing sense that even with these events of the last week, sooner or later these last sanctions are going to be removed and Libya will come off the list of state sponsors of terrorism,'' Mr. Kreindler said in a telephone interview on Monday.
 The letter said the amount still held in escrow for the families was larger than the Libyan assets in this country that would be unblocked by the lifting of sanctions. 
 ''Thus, we are faced with the ironic circumstance in which Libya stands to gain more by the continued blocking of its assets than if its assets were timely unblocked,'' the letter said. ''Libya's enrichment in this regard, should it occur, would be made all the more difficult to understand if Libya's assets were unblocked and the other commercial sanctions were lifted within days, weeks or months after July 22.'' 
 Mr. Kreindler, in the interview on Monday, acknowledged that his firm has ''a lot of money riding on this,'' although he said his share would be ''substantially less'' than the standard contingency fee -- one-third of money recovered.
 The families coming to Washington will meet with administration officials and Congressional aides. 
 A State Department official said Tuesday that the deal on damages did not involve the government and that ''the U.S. government is going to do what is required by law.'' 
 Libya extended its first deadline on the deal by three months, to July 22. Mr. Kreindler said Libya might be persuaded to allow another delay if action seemed imminent.
 Among the families, one of the strongest critics of lifting sanctions is Dan Cohen, of Cape May Courthouse, N.J., whose only child, Theodora, was killed when the Boeing 747 exploded on Dec. 21, 1988. The structure of the deal, Mr. Cohen said, has turned the relatives into Libyan agents. The Pan Am 103 families, he said, ''are now being enlisted to lobby for murderers.'' 
 ''Money talks,'' he wrote to a Congressional staff member, opposing the lobbying. ''Millions talks very loudly.'' He and his wife, Susan, will accept no Libyan money conditioned on lifting sanctions, he said. 
 But Glenn P. Johnson Jr., the chairman of Victims of Pan Am Flight 103, which is the major family group growing out of the crash, said the families were asking the government to lift the sanctions before July 22 if in fact they were going to be lifted, and ''if they're not going to lift them, tell us why, and we'll understand that.'' Mr. Johnson's 21-year-old daughter, Beth Ann Johnson, who was studying psychology at Regents College in London, died on the flight. 
 John Zwynenburg, chairman of the political action committee for Mr. Johnson's group, wrote in an e-mail to other families last month that major American corporations were going to benefit from the reopening of Libya, and ''while I'm happy for the American companies, I don't want to see the families lose out.''

HEADLINE: The View From Purgatory

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE. 
E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

 BODY:

Q: Did it warm your heart out there in Purgatory, President Nixon, to see the friendly banter at the White House unveiling of the Clinton portraits?
 RN: Same as at my funeral; everybody was forced to be gracious. Nobody would say what everybody thought: that Hillary's portrait is fine but Bill's is awful. Now ask me about Karzai.
 Q: President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan spoke to a joint session of Congress yesterday---- 
 RN: It was a joint meeting, you know -- joint sessions are only to hear the U.S. president. But wasn't Karzai terrific? He was grateful for America's liberation of his country, and you don't hear a lot of that these days. He asked NATO to put its troops where its mouth is, which it won't. That's why we need a new Mansfield Amendment -- to threaten the French and Germans with an American pullout from Europe. 
 Q: But hasn't Bush begun to do that already?
 RN: Not fast enough. You saw the results of the European Parliament elections? Schroder is finished. Chirac has had it. Next year they'll be begging Bush for support. And that's when we should crack 'em hard to bolster our friends in Afghanistan. This Karzai fellow should make a deal with his warlords to get some breathing room this fall for his election. Then he can attack his real problem, which is not so much the Taliban terrorists as it is the damned poppies. We have to help him eradicate the huge opium trade before that place becomes a criminal state. Only then can we have a Muslim model for democracy in Iraq.
 Q: Do you think the handover of sovereignty in Baghdad this month will make a big difference?
 RN: It'll get the Iraqis into their own war, ready or not. If the Shiite majority has the guts to use our help in putting down Saddam's killers, they deserve their freedom. But it's time for them to stop whining about us and start fighting the bombers. 
 Q: But what of our prison abuse----
 RN: Look, when the Iraqis in the street get sore, not at us but at the bombers not only blowing up their oil wells but also killing their wives and children, any terrorist suspects the new government rounds up will wish the Americans were back in charge. That prison story and the C.I.A. recriminations will drag on and on in the media here because it helps the doves make a necessary war look bad. 
 Q: Now you're into politics, how do you see the campaign dynamic?
 RN: Let me say this about that: Bush went into a slump because of war casualties, and as we come out of the war, Bush comes out of his slump. Now he has to stop responding to Kerry's demands -- all that U.N. kissy-face -- and start talking about exciting plans for the economic boom in his second term. 
 Q: And what should Kerry be doing as his Boston convention approaches?
 RN: First, stop the daily grousing, which turns people off after a while. Stay the hell away from job creation, which has backfired on him. Claim credit for straightening Bush out on Iraq and move on to the great dream. Pick one powerful domestic issue -- old folks' health or college education, whatever -- hit it hard and make it his own. Kerry's been all over the lot so far.
 Q: Where will the campaign be four months from now?
 RN: That's Oct. 16, with jobs and the market rising, casualties contained, at least one terrorist attack in the U.S. Debates are over, with Kerry winning on points and Bush on personality. First, half of the swing vote, larger than expected, moves toward the incumbent, which puts Bush a couple of points ahead. Q: That energizes the Democrats----
 RN: Not all of them. The prospect of a Bush win would help Democrats in Congressional races because people who prefer Bush may not trust him, and will split their tickets. And the Hillary crowd, having done their bit for Kerry, won't cry at his potential defeat because it would open the way to the Clinton restoration in 2008.
 Q: (Gasp!) That's absolutely Machiavellian.
 RN: Thank you. And with Coach Joe Gibbs back, keep your eye on those Redskins.

HEADLINE: Bush Shouldn't Write Off the Black Vote

BYLINE: By Juan Williams. 
Juan Williams, senior correspondent for NPR and political analyst for Fox News Channel, is the author of ''My Soul Looks Back in Wonder: Voices of the Civil Rights Experience.''

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With the presidential election only a few months away, it is time for President Bush to unleash his secret weapon -- his relationship with black and Hispanic voters.
 The president is already winning a third of the popular vote among Hispanics, according to a Zogby International poll taken this spring. With advertisements and outreach focused on reforms to allow easier immigration for workers, the president has a good chance to add to his numbers among Hispanics.
 But in a close race, the key to re-election rests on the president's ability to increase his percentage of the black vote. Here, he has the chance to make tremendous gains -- if only because he now has practically no support among black voters. A May Washington Post/ABC News poll showed the likely Democratic nominee, Senator John Kerry, with a 79 percent to 6 percent lead over Mr. Bush among black voters. If the president gets only 6 percent of the black vote this year he will have achieved the near impossible task of getting a lower percentage of black votes than he did in 2000, when he won 8 percent. 
 But the president has the opportunity to flip the script. With a direct appeal, President Bush could win at least 20 percent of the black vote -- and the White House.
 How can he attract those votes?
 First, the field is open. Compared with previous Democratic campaigns, Mr. Kerry's has done a poor job of reaching out to black voters. As Donna Brazile, Al Gore's campaign manager in 2000, said recently, ''Don't expect me to go out and say John Kerry is a great man and a visionary if you're not running ads on African-American or Hispanic cable networks. Fair is fair. So send my dad a postcard, send my sisters a bumper sticker.'' The Kerry campaign has also been notable for its lack of blacks and Hispanics among the candidate's top advisers. And Mr. Kerry has rarely been identified with issues that compel black voters -- notably affirmative action.
 Second, it's increasingly clear that blacks are no longer willing to vote as a bloc, automatically lining up with the Democrats. This is particularly true of younger black voters. A 2002 poll by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a research group based in Washington, found a shift in the political identification of black voters. For example, 34 percent of 18- to 25-year-old black voters identified themselves as independents. Overall, 24 percent of black Americans of all ages see themselves as independents -- a four percentage point increase since the 2000 election. And now 10 percent of blacks call themselves Republican, a six percentage point rise since 2000. 
 Young black Americans seem ready for a forthright conversation about race and politics. While many older blacks responded with anger to Bill Cosby's recent call for poor black people to take more responsibility for their problems, the young people I encountered were uniformly supportive of Mr. Cosby's words. 
 It's worth noting that for this group, the president has an issue with considerable appeal: school vouchers. Despite strong opposition from civil rights leaders (and Democrats), 66 percent of blacks and 67 percent of Hispanics favor vouchers, according to a recent Newsweek poll. That is higher than the 54 percent of whites who say they want to see vouchers used to give students access to better schools.
 Third, Mr. Bush has a network to make a pitch to black voters -- the black church. Despite some bumps along the way, black churches remain generally enthusiastic about the president's faith-based initiative. The president has used his appearances before faith-based groups as a way to communicate with black Americans. It was no surprise that Mr. Bush used a speech to ministers to condemn Senator Trent Lott for expressing kind words about Strom Thurmond's segregationist past.
 And then there is the president's top selling point with black voters -- his track record of appointing minorities to top positions. There are three black cabinet secretaries in the Bush administration: Alphonso Jackson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development; Rod Paige, secretary of education; and Colin Powell, the secretary of state. 
 What's more, the administration official most closely identified with the president is a black woman, Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser. By giving Ms. Rice and Mr. Powell so much clout, President Bush is miles ahead of any other president, Democrat or Republican, in his treatment of black people. More important, the president, by appointing people of genuine talent and ability, has created a climate where tokenism is rarely part of the debate. After all, Mr. Powell consistently has a higher approval rating for his job performance than any other administration official.
 This is the record that President Bush can draw on to win a larger share of the black vote. But he has to want to do it. In private conversations, administration officials make the case that they want the black vote. But it is also clear that they are not planning to work hard to get it -- in part because they are still angry over the black response to their efforts in 2000. 
 Interestingly, the anger predates the post-election sparring in Florida. It has its roots in an ad, run nationally by the N.A.A.C.P., that implied that Mr. Bush, as governor of Texas, did not want to punish the white men who attacked and killed James Byrd Jr., a black man, in Jasper, Tex., in 1998. 
 The ad distorted a complex situation. As governor, Mr. Bush took the conventional conservative position that hate crimes legislation could lead to a dangerous increase in prosecutorial power. Mr. Bush argued that there were adequate criminal penalties to punish Mr. Byrd's assailants. No matter: the N.A.A.C.P. broadcast its ad. Mr. Bush, who won 30 percent of the black vote and 47 percent of the Hispanic vote in his 1998 gubernatorial campaign, was introduced to minorities as a man willing to stand with white lynch mobs.
 If President Bush wants to return to the White House, he needs black Americans to vote for him; in swing states in the South and Midwest, they could make all the difference. To do that, though, the president needs to begin reaching out to black Americans. Fortunately, he has a lot to say.

HEADLINE: Oracle, Locked in Acquisition Struggle, Reports Good Quarter

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, June 15 

 BODY:
The Oracle Corporation, which is in a courtroom battle to defend its hostile bid for PeopleSoft, said Tuesday that its fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose 15 percent because of strong growth in its database business, which it attributed to a modest recovery in technology spending.
 ''We're encouraged that the global economy is showing improvement, led by the United States,'' Jeffrey O. Henley, Oracle's chief financial officer, said during a conference call. ''Clearly, we are benefiting from more business optimism.'' 
 For the quarter, which ended May 31, the company, based in Redwood Shores, Calif., reported net income of $990 million, or 19 cents a share, compared with $858 million, or 16 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue increased to $3.08 billion from $2.83 billion. 
 Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call had forecast earnings of 18 cents a share on revenue of $3.07 billion.
 Lawrence J. Ellison, Oracle's chief executive, said the company, which produces business software, continued to see faster growth in revenue from current subscribers than in new licenses for its products. ''Our business is being reshaped,'' Mr. Ellison said.
 Revenue from software-license updates rose 13 percent, to $1.21 billion, while sales of new software licenses increased 11 percent, to $1.31 billion. The company's database business, its largest segment, grew 15 percent. 
 Revenue from the applications software market, which is at the center of Oracle's proposed takeover of PeopleSoft and a small part of the company's total sales, declined 6 percent.
 ''This is why they are trying to buy PeopleSoft,'' said David Hilal, an analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey. ''What Oracle is trying to find is new avenues of growth.''
 In regular-session trading, before Oracle released its financial results, its shares closed at $11.71, up 17 cents. After hours, they fell to $11.42.
 During the quarter, the company improved its cash position, a move Mr. Henley said would help it make acquisitions, regardless of the outcome of its offer to buy PeopleSoft.
 ''We're growing our cash to get prepared for other large-scale acquisitions,'' he said, adding that Oracle was considering other multibillion-dollar acquisitions, though he declined to elaborate.
 Oracle has spent $54 million on its proposed takeover of PeopleSoft, about $10 million of that in the recent quarter.
 Looking ahead, Mr. Henley said revenue this quarter would increase 6 percent to 9 percent compared with the period a year earlier, which would mean a range of $2.19 billion to $2.26 billion. He said he expected earnings of 9 cents a share.
 The report on the fiscal fourth quarter, traditionally the company's strongest, comes a year after Oracle surprised PeopleSoft with its initial $6.3 billion offer and just 10 days after the courtroom battle began. In its most recent bid, Oracle has offered $7.7 billion. 
 In the six days of testimony since the trial began on June 7, government witnesses have tried to reinforce the argument that the market for enterprise software, which companies use to manage their finances, personnel records, procurement, sales and customer relations, is limited to Oracle, PeopleSoft and SAP when it comes to meeting the needs of very large corporations. 
 The government's case rests on the argument that a combination of Oracle and PeopleSoft would leave only two competitors and result in higher prices. Oracle maintains that the market is highly competitive and that Microsoft is poised to enter it as well.
 Government lawyers are expected to call Douglas Burgum, a senior Microsoft vice president, to testify that Microsoft does not plan to enter the high-end enterprise applications market in the near future. Last week, Microsoft disclosed that it had held secret talks to merge with SAP, the enterprise software market leader, based in Germany. Oracle used that disclosure to support its contention that Microsoft hoped to become a competitor.
 Judge Vaughn R. Walker, who has said he wants to finish hearing witnesses the first week of July, is expected to issue a ruling in August or September.

Industrial production surged 1.1 percent in May, the strongest performance in nearly six years, and a nationwide survey of business activity showed widespread strength, the Federal Reserve reported Wednesday.
 The production increase, the largest since August 1998, surpassed the 0.6 percent rise that some economists were expecting and came after an increase of 0.8 percent in April. Factory production rose 0.9 percent in May, up from an increase of 0.7 percent the month before. 
 Output at gas and electric utilities, which rose 1.5 percent in April, increased 3.3 percent in May, reflecting unseasonably warm weather, the Fed said. Mining production dipped 0.4 percent last month, after a 0.9 percent rise.
 In a second report, known as the beige book, the Fed said that economic activity continued to expand across the nation in April and May, with manufacturing, retailing, residential real estate markets and bank lending activity faring well.
 The job climate also improved, it said, with hiring increasing at a faster pace in most of the Fed's 12 regions.
 Many of the Fed regional banks reported modest increases in consumer prices, with most noting rising prices especially of energy-related products, building material and steel. 
 In other economic news, the Commerce Department reported yesterday that nearly 1.97 million residential units were being built last month, at an annual pace. That represented a 0.7 percent drop from April, but still exceeded analysts' forecasts.
 Total housing permits, a barometer of current demand, rose 3.5 percent in May, to a pace of 2.077 million units, the highest level since February 1973. Permits were issued for single-family homes at a record pace of 1.59 million units.
 The reports issued Wednesday suggested that there was momentum in the economic recovery. The broad economy grew at a 4.4 percent annual pace in the first quarter and, some economists expect, will grow solidly this quarter.
 Economists widely expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates for the first time in four years at the end of the month. For nearly a year, the Fed has held its benchmark short-term interest rate at 1 percent. Most economists are looking for a rate increase of one-quarter of a percentage point. A few predict a half-point increase.
 The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, appearing Tuesday on Capitol Hill, offered a positive assessment of the economy. He held to the Fed's current outlook that inflation was likely to remain largely under control and that any rate increases would probably be gradual.
 If that outlook turns out to be mistaken, the Fed will take aggressive action to keep prices and the economy on an even keel, Mr. Greenspan said.

HEADLINE: Maids vs. Occupiers

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
Visiting India and now China in the past few months tells me how much we Americans need to finish our business in Iraq and lower our profile there -- not so we can wash our hands of the idea, and necessity, of promoting reform in the Arab world, but so we can advance that effort.
 We can't dictate reform to the Arabs. Look at how even a watered-down reform proposal from the G-8 summit meeting -- the Broader Middle East Initiative -- was received in the Arab-Muslim world. No one paid any attention to it. The whole concept was dead on arrival because it was made in America, which is now radioactive in the Arab world. 
 The pressure for change has to come from within, and I think it can -- if we lower our profile. Then the Arab world will have to look clearly at the fact that China, India, Sri Lanka and the Philippines -- all the countries that provide maid service for the Saudi and other Arab ruling elites and manual labor for their construction -- have leapt so far ahead with their own development that they are now taking good jobs away from America. 
 To put it another way, there are two ways for the U.S. to promote reform in the Arab world -- where there is an ocean of untapped brainpower, particularly among women. One way is to try to dictate it, which is not working. American policy has become so unpopular in the Arab world that anti-reformers can easily delegitimize the reform process by labeling it a ''U.S. plot to destroy Islam,'' and reformers are silenced because they don't want to be seen as promoting a made-in-America agenda. 
 The other way for us to promote reform is to get out of the way so people in the Middle East can see clearly that many of their maids' children -- from India, China, Sri Lanka and the Philippines -- are excelling at math, science and engineering, leaving Arab children, not to mention many American children, in the dust. (Over one million Indians work in Saudi Arabia alone.)
 Only when the Arabs focus on how their maids' children are doing in the world, not what the Americans are doing in their region, will they revisit one of the most famous sayings of the Prophet Muhammad: ''Seek knowledge, even unto China. That is the duty for every Muslim.''
 I hadn't been to China since 2001, and one of the first new things I noticed here was the number of women selling phone cards for cellphone minutes. While Islamist terrorists in Iraq and Saudi Arabia are using cellphone technology and cars to create bombs, China and India are making themselves the world's new-car manufacturing centers and are inventing new profit-making uses for Internet-enabled cellphones -- none of which involve blowing anything or anyone up. 
 An Arab journalist friend living in London told me that there is today -- sadly -- an all too pervasive sense in too many quarters of the Arab world of a once-great civilization having been left behind, not unlike Weimar Germany. Because Germany was already a modern state, it created a massive military response to its humiliation: the Third Reich. ''The Arabs can't,'' he said. ''So they create bin Ladenism instead, which can't build a state, only demolish one.''
 So how does one get a healthy reform debate started? ''You need a courageous intelligentsia,'' he said. ''You can't have that as long as people feel besieged. The new historians in Israel only emerged during Oslo. When you feel besieged, you will never start a debate with your brother and sister. Now it is the battle against the enemy, be it real or imaginary.''
 All the more reason why we -- the perceived enemy -- need to hand over power to an elected Iraqi government, and move our troops into the background. If we can do that, I would suggest that next year the G-8 invite both India and China to join, and hold the next G-10 summit either at one of the manicured campuses of Indian outsourcing companies or in Shanghai's manufacturing hub. Then invite Arab leaders to attend. India and China were once seen as their equals.
 Real change happens when people see something in those they compare themselves to, and draw their own conclusions -- not when it's imposed on them. Our job was to smash Iraq's old order and lay the foundations for a new one. Now we need to lower our profile so people in that Arab-Muslim world can see clearly something we've been obstructing and they've been deliberately ignoring: that the world today wants to invest more in their maids' children than in their own children. Once that reality sinks in, so, too, will reform.

HEADLINE: Radical Iraqi Cleric Orders His Fighters To Put Down Their Arms and Go Home

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA and EDWARD WONG; Thom Shanker contributed reporting from Washington for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, June 16 

 BODY:
Moktada al-Sadr, the Shiite cleric whose militiamen have tormented American soldiers in Iraq with ambushes and rocket attacks for nearly three months, ordered his fighters on Wednesday to put down their arms and go home.
 The edict, issued at Mr. Sadr's headquarters in Najaf, a Shiite holy city, came days after he declared his intentions to enter mainstream politics as the new Iraqi government assumes full power. 
 In Najaf, his loyalists appeared to be heeding the order. But it did little to stanch the daily violence across the country. Two American soldiers were killed and nearly two dozen wounded in a rocket attack in Balad, 50 miles north of here. An Iraqi policeman was killed and five civilians wounded in a bomb attack in Ramadi, about 60 miles west of here. 
 A senior Oil Ministry official was assassinated early Wednesday in Kirkuk, in the north. And further crippling Iraqi oil exports, insurgents blasted a hole in a crucial oil pipeline near the southern city of Basra. There have been at least three such attacks in as many days, clearly intended to debilitate the country's economic engine before the transfer of limited power to an interim Iraqi government on June 30. Iraq's main oil 
 [A car bomb exploded Thursday near a United States and Iraqi military base in Baghdad, killing at least two people, a witness told the Reuters news agency. The bomb went off at an Iraq Army recruiting base in the city's heavily fortified Muthanna airport, where United States troops are also based.]
 The violence came as a poll ordered by the American-led Coalition Provisional Authority found that a majority of Iraqis believed that they would be safer without United States forces in their country and that all Americans behaved the way the guards did in the photographs of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison. The poll results, which were not released, were first reported by The Associated Press. 
 A coalition spokesman, Dan Senor, called the poll results understandable. ''It reflects the fact that Iraqis, like most people, don't like to be occupied,'' he said in a CNN interview. ''We don't like to be occupiers.'' He added, ''Of course most Iraqis don't feel safe, and of course they say that it's happening under our watch.'' 
 In leaflets distributed widely in Najaf, Mr. Sadr ordered his fighters to ''go back to their provinces'' in keeping with a cease-fire signed on June 4 that had been regularly broken. Since then, many members of the cleric's militia, known as the Mahdi Army, have disappeared from Najaf and Kufa, a nearby Shiite holy city, but many others who live in those cities have remained.
 In recent days, Mr. Sadr has taken efforts to remake himself into a player in Iraq's emerging political landscape. He has offered his conditional approval to the interim government and, through his spokesman, Qais al-Khazali, floated the idea of organizing a political party. 
 American administrators have issued an order banning people associated with illegal militias from taking part in elections.
 An architect of the Bush administration's Iraq policy, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, arrived in Baghdad on Wednesday for meetings with Iraqi interim government officials, including Prime Minister Iyad Allawi. A joint statement called the talks ''the beginning of a new relationship.'' 
 As part of that new relationship, American administrators will turn over civil aviation operations at Baghdad International Airport to the interim government after June 30, occupation officials said Wednesday. The military side is scheduled to be turned over by mid-August.
 Virtually all American soldiers will move from the airport, the officials said. Many of them will relocate to Camp Victory, next to the airport, while the First Armored Division, which uses the airport as its headquarters, is scheduled to return home in July, after 15 months in Iraq.
 Security at the airport will be provided by a foreign private contractor working with Iraqi forces, said an American adviser to the Ministry of Transportation. Bids were taken for the contract, and the winner will be announced in the next day or two, he said. Custer Battles, an American contractor, currently provides security for parts of the airport. The adviser, an aviation expert who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the transfer was a way to return a symbolic public site to the Iraqis.
 Clearly, the greatest threat to the new government is the campaign against the oil industry, Iraq's main revenue source. Early Wednesday, Ghazi Talabani, security chief for the northern oil fields in Kirkuk, was killed in an ambush, an Oil Ministry official confirmed shortly after an explosion heavily damaged a northern crude oil pipeline. 
 Analysts have said repairs to the large southern oil export terminal could take up to 10 days, and cost up to $1 billion in revenues. 
 Meanwhile, the United States Army charged an American soldier with the murder of an Iraqi civilian, according to The Associated Press. Officials said the victim was wounded in a high-speed chase near the city of Kufa last month and then shot at close range by an officer in the First Armored Division. The soldier's name has not yet been released.
 Also Wednesday, aides of Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most powerful Shiite cleric, said he had sent a delegation to meet with Kurdish leaders. He has objected to provisions in the transitional administrative law, which is supposed to give guidance to the interim government, that essentially give Kurds veto power over a permanent constitution to be written next year. The leaders of the two main Kurdish parties objected to Ayatollah Sistani's stand and wrote a strongly worded letter to President Bush saying they would refrain from taking part in the country's government if their effective veto were removed.
 In Washington, Democratic members of Congress challenged statements by administration officials on Wednesday that a collection of United Nations Security Council resolutions and letters exchanged between the United States and the new Iraqi leadership would be sufficient to define the authority and legal basis of operations for American forces in Iraq after June 30.
 Absent a formal ''status of forces agreement,'' similar to what the United States has negotiated with most nations where American forces are based, that kind of understanding ''is not as strong as it needs to be,'' said Representative Ellen O. Tauscher, Democrat of California.

HEADLINE: Fatal Shooting Prompts Bar's Closing, and a Cultural Debate

BYLINE: By SHAILA K. DEWAN; Katy Reckdahl contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, June 16 

 BODY:
Joe's Cozy Corner does not look like anything special. One of its brick walls has a severe dent, apparently inflicted by a moving vehicle. In the eaves hangs a sun-blanched banner, on which the words ''Thou shalt not kill'' have nearly faded away. ''No guns, no drugs,'' a hand-painted sign says. ''Inside or outside.''
 But if New Orleans is the spiritual home of jazz in the United States, a case can be made that this little barroom is the spiritual home of jazz in New Orleans. 
 The customers wear polished shoes with thin soles, hats with feathers in the bands, saxophone slings around their necks. They include many of the city's musical luminaries: Kermit Ruffins, the swing band leader; Derrick Shezbie of the Rebirth Brass Band; Troy Michael Andrews, a sharp-dressed 18-year-old known as Trombone Shorty. 
 Joe's is on Ursulines Street in the Treme, the once-thriving black neighborhood that for more than a century has been home to many of the city's working musicians, a place where not long ago live music was so abundant that the guitarist Walter Washington played two gigs at once, dashing from one to the other. Now, Joe's is the last corner bar in the neighborhood with live music, and the city has ordered it to shut its doors at midnight Thursday, five months after, the police say, Joseph Glasper, the 63-year-old proprietor, shot and killed a man outside. 
 Nolan Lambert, a city attorney, said, ''You shouldn't have to dodge bullets to come to a place that plays jazz.''
 New Orleans has never defined a landmark by its grandeur, and Joe's is no exception. Jazz funeral processions stop there, as do many brass band parades, known as second lines. More important, the musicians say, Joe's is a place where knowledge passes from old-timers to youngsters: lyrics of standard tunes, where to get a suit tailored, how to tell right from wrong. 
 Many of the players have been going there since they were 5 or 6, when their parents took them to see the brass bands on Mardi Gras. 
 ''In most places, young people think rap will get them out of the ghetto,'' said Sylvester Francis, a historian of second line who runs the Backstreet Cultural Museum in the Treme. ''Here, it's these brass bands that will get you out of the ghetto.''
 The effort to close Joe's has spawned a debate over whether the city, in its eagerness to reduce crime, has overlooked the cultural value of the establishment -- or even, neighbors say, its worth as a deterrent to criminals in a neighborhood already rife with drugs.
 ''Nobody in the neighborhood wants the bar to close,'' Mr. Ruffins said. The cracked arc of his teeth looks as if it was ground out by a trumpet mouthpiece. ''It's a City Hall thing. And they just don't know -- it's not out of hate. They just don't know all the good that's going on here.''
 The shooting was Jan. 18, the day of the jazz funeral for Anthony Lacen, a musician known as Tuba Fats. After the horse-drawn hearse left for the cemetery, the procession of hundreds of dancing mourners found its way to Joe's. A disabled man named Richard Gullette, 52, was selling drinks on the sidewalk across the street from the bar.
 Mr. Glasper, according to the police account, told Mr. Gullette to stop. The two argued, and Mr. Gullette punched Mr. Glasper in the head. Mr. Glasper pulled out a licensed gun and fired one shot. He was charged with second-degree murder, which carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison, and is out on $100,000 bail. 
 The news was a shock to those who know Mr. Glasper as Papa Joe, a man who gives children doughnuts and who has been known to banish patrons seen with drugs. 
 Jessie Varnado, an arthritic 78-year-old woman who lives next door to Joe's, said Mr. Glasper had arranged for the city to put a handicapped parking sign in front of her door. Richard Kendrick, a retired custodian who lives across the street, said: ''I hate to see the place close. At least Joe did stop everyone from doing this, that and the other thing right here on this corner. I'm not saying what he did was right.''
 In April, the city asked the Alcohol Beverage Control Board to revoke Joe's license, citing not only the January shooting, but also a fatal shooting at the bar in December 2002 and several incidents from June 2001 to January 2002 involving drugs and weapons. 
 Carol Kolinchak, Mr. Glasper's lawyer, said many of the crimes at the bar could not have been prevented. In the 2002 killing, for example, a man walked into the bar and shot another in the back of the head. Mr. Glasper, she said, has no prior convictions. He has been married 43 years. His three sons work at Joe's. 
 Mr. Gullette, 52, was unemployed and had prosthetic legs. In 1985, he was released from prison after serving 11 years for attempted armed robbery. 
 His family says the claim that Joe's is a cultural treasure is nothing more than ''camouflage.'' Cynthia Banks, Mr. Gullette's sister, said she saw Mr. Glasper buying beer, soda and water. ''My first thought was, 'My brother is dead and this man is getting ready to party,''' she said.
 Last Tuesday at Joe's, Kermit Ruffins barbecued sausage and showed a home video of an impromptu second line. Mr. Glasper doled out plates of red beans and rice. The idea of shutting the doors for good did not seem to have sunk in.
 At the bar was Mr. Shezbie, 29, who earned his first trumpet by tap dancing in the Quarter. ''It's like a second home to me,'' he said of Joe's. ''My pops didn't really have much time to do with me.''
 Mr. Glasper was courteous, but looked glumly into the distance, under instructions from his lawyer not to discuss the shooting. He took over Joe's in 1992 to bring back the music he heard growing up, he said. ''You'd walk down Bourbon Street, and all you'd hear is bands,'' he said. ''Now all you see is T-shirt shops.''
 Mr. Glasper himself joined the Jolly Bunch, one of New Orleans's traditional black ''social aid and pleasure clubs,'' at 17. The clubs sponsor the second-line parades, and Joe's is now home to two. 
 ''We all love that same sound, that parade sound,'' Mr. Glasper said. ''It do you good.''

PERSON: Kevin M. Rampe

HEADLINE: A Consensus Builder for Ground Zero's Renewal

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
AN accommodating ego, a thick skin, a Type A work ethic, an optimistic world view. If the traits, discordant as they may seem, make the man, Kevin M. Rampe appears to have the right stuff to act as chief facilitator of a 9/11-mandated mission, the reconstruction of ground zero, which should come with a warning label. Danger: prepare to get chewed out, worn out and burned out. P.S.: that's how you'll know you're doing the job right. 
 Chewed out. Check. But this low-key president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation says he fears, and hears, the anguish of survivors of World Trade Center victims far more than the verbiage of agenda-conscious politicians or agita-prone architects. Worn out. Check. The work is ''all consuming'' and follows him home to Tarrytown -- he and his wife moved there from Battery Park City before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
 Mr. Rampe may be pale and rumpled and a tad pudgier than he prefers because of an estrangement from his gym, but he is not yet burned out; then again, he is only a year into the assignment of a lifetime.
 He is adamant that it will not last a lifetime. For one thing, he says, New Yorkers are not that patient; waiting the standard decade or so before choosing a site development plan and, more to the heart of the matter, a memorial plan, was out of the question. ''You can't apply any of the classic rules to this site,'' he says. ''This is not just a development process; it's part of the healing process.''
 For another thing, he holds this $200,000-a-year job at the pleasure of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki, in whose administration he worked as a senior legal adviser and as first deputy superintendent of the New York State Insurance Department. ''But my role is not to push a policy agenda,'' he says. 
 Politics, partisan or otherwise, are not his thing. Growing up on a farm in Warwick, N.Y., he had a father who ran for town supervisor and won as a Democrat, then ran for Orange County executive and won as a Republican. ''Very pragmatic of him,'' Mr. Rampe says. ''But politics can be nasty for the young children of local politicians.'' 
 Mr. Rampe, 37, a corporate lawyer by training but a make-it-better guy at the core, heads a group charged with waving $2.78 billion in federal money like a magic wand to initiate the revitalization of downtown Manhattan. Last week, the development corporation completed its selection of four diverse arts groups -- a theater company, a dance troupe, a museum and a drawing center -- that will serve as the cultural beacons of the rebuilt World Trade Center. And on July 4, a date not selected by coincidence, the groundbreaking is scheduled for the Freedom Tower, a sort of single-spire reincarnation of the twin towers. As of that date, says Mr. Rampe, there will be ''nonstop construction'' at the site. 
 But he will not willingly walk away from the development corporation's base at One Liberty Plaza until the neighbor that used to be the trade center, the place where his close friend Neil Levin of the Port Authority perished, and now a void that grabs at his gut each time he walks by, is reborn. He believes a raw pit has no place in the midst of the nation's third-largest central business district: it's bad for business and morale. 
 ''Getting downtown rebuilt is not a moral responsibility, it's a moral imperative,'' he says, choosing his rhetoric carefully. He is sitting in a small, utilitarian office where the wall art consists of photographs of a reimagined trade center as envisioned by the architects Daniel Libeskind, David Childs, Michael Arad and Peter Walker, along with a site plan -- a trade center composed of Legos and designed by a 6-year-old New Yorker -- that was not chosen but embodies the same sense of civic engagement that spurred him to take on this chronically thankless job. 
 Not that he has a martyr complex. Consensus builders can not stoop to self-indulgence. Or kowtow to bullies. ''Anyone who tries to insert their ego into this process is summarily destroyed,'' he says with a satisfied smile. 
 AS for the critics, amateurs or pros, who dislike the Libeskind design, dislike the memorial, dislike the Freedom Tower, disagree with the arts groups chosen, and ad infinitum, Mr. Rampe is all for dialogue, with a caveat: ''It doesn't mean you put everything out for referendum.''
 ''This is a process tailor-made for Monday-morning quarterbacking. The worst thing would be if we made these decisions and there was no reaction. And the best thing that ever happened to this agency is that we failed at the beginning. No, really! When we put out the first site plans and everybody said they were horrible, it changed everything. Once you turn that switch on and let the people in on the process, there's no going back.''
 Once Mr. Rampe left home for Union College, he switched from a farm boy's career aim (veterinarian) to the law. After graduating from Albany Law School of Union University in 1991, he joined Shearman & Sterling as a litigation associate; when a not-so-plum assignment arose -- travel to Kuwait to prepare $200 million in environmental and health claims against Iraq in the aftermath of the first Gulf war -- he fought for it, and went.
 ''It was incredibly interesting and incredibly sad,'' he says. ''What had happened there was really a rape of their country, and my job was to document that.'' 
 He says the Kuwaiti people were intent on rebuilding. They were resilient. Just like New Yorkers.

HEADLINE: Cooling Your House, Draining Your Wallet

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
GASOLINE prices are high, as everybody knows. Less obvious are the high costs of heating and cooling, which are listed on utility bills in obscure units like therms, cubic feet and kilowatt-hours.
 This summer may be a good time to pay attention to the fine print. Prices for natural gas, which is used to generate electricity, began to tick upward in 2002 and show no signs of going back down. For many households, the impact will be greater than the one felt at the gas pump. 
 Luckily, there are ways to soften the pain, like lowering the thermostat on the hot water tank and investing in energy-efficient air-conditioners.
 Natural gas heats about two-thirds of American homes, and it generates about 15 percent of the country's electricity. Because of more demand for natural gas, the Energy Department is predicting that electricity will cost about 4 percent more this summer than last. 
 ''An accountant might say it's irrational for you to care more about gasoline prices than natural gas prices,'' said Rob Sargent, the senior energy policy analyst at the National Association of State Public Interest Research Groups, a consumer advocacy organization.
 But consumers tend to view a gallon of gasoline as the ultimate indicator. ''The American public's interest in energy is very directly correlated to that single price,'' said Jonathan Cogan, a spokesman for the federal Energy Information Administration. ''It really is one of the most visible commodity prices of anything you'll ever see. You can drive down street, see the price of the product in two- or three-foot-high letters.''
 At the American Chemistry Council, an industry group that began a campaign in late 2002 to get Congress to care about the rising price of natural gas, officials sound almost wistful about the attention being paid to the pump. They say it took months to convince anyone that for certain users, like the chemical industry, which uses natural gas as an ingredient, not a fuel, higher prices have provoked a crisis. 
 To help make its case, the council compared the average price of natural gas from 1994 to 1999 with the average price so far this year. As of June 4, it had gone up 194 percent (while gasoline prices rose by less than half that).
 ''The fact that it's up close to three times what it was just a few years ago is only now starting to sink in,'' said Charles W. Van Vlack, the council's executive vice president, ''but we don't run a pump for ourselves, we just pay a monthly bill.'' 
 At the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, a nonprofit research group in Washington, Steven M. Nadel, the executive director, said that despite the focus on gasoline, ''my guess for a typical family in a house, natural gas is more important.''
 In New England and the Middle Atlantic states, the average house that heats with gas uses 65,000 cubic feet a season. Last winter on average it was $9.60 per thousand cubic feet, or about $600 for the season. This winter it is expected to go up another $1.30, adding another $85 to the bottom line, according to the Energy Department.
 Running air-conditioners and appliances will be expensive, too. The Energy Department predicts that on average, natural gas will push up electricity prices by about a third of a cent per kilowatt-hour this summer over last. 
 At the Long Island Power Authority, officials estimate that a typical household with central air-conditioning spent $231.24 a month on electricity last summer, and that if the weather this summer is the same, the same household will spend $252.76. Last winter, cold temperatures combined with higher gas prices cost the average household in the Midwest $98 more to stay warm than it did the year before, according to the Energy Information Administration, part of the Department of Energy. Though a lot will depend on the weather, heating costs are expected to remain high next year. 
 Driving will be a relative bargain. A typical car uses about 530 gallons of gasoline a year, so if gas goes up 25 cents a gallon, that's an increase of about $133 (it will be around $157 for a van, pickup or sport utility). 
 About half of electricity comes from coal, but because the price of natural gas is going up, ''generators are going to squeeze more coal-fired electricity out of the system, pushing up coal prices, too,'' Mr. Cogan said. 
 Predictions are based on no change in consumer behavior. But there are relatively easy ways to reduce energy use. One no-cost step is to check the setting on the water heater. Mr. Nadel suggests keeping it at 120 degrees. That is hot enough for bathing, and dishwashers often have heaters to boost the temperature to 140. If the dial is not marked with numbers, ''try a little lower than medium,'' he said.
 When shopping for a window air-conditioning unit, it is important to compare the energy efficiency ratings. As the July issue of Consumer Reports points out, the most efficient window units are no longer the most costly. 
 Central air-conditioners now come with a seasonal energy efficiency rating, or SEER. Beginning in 2006, under a federal standard that recently survived a court challenge by the Bush administration, even the least-efficient central air-conditioners will have to be 30 percent more efficient than they are now (a rating of 10). The new SEER floor will be 13, and models ranked 14 and 15 are already widely available. 
 Forced hot-air heating systems, which are in most houses with central air-conditioning, often leak air from their ducts into attics or basements that are not meant to be heated or cooled. Contractors can use a blower to pressurize the ducts and look for leaks, which they fix with something more sophisticated than duct tape. They can also seal gaps between the main area of a house and its unheated basement or attic.
 When it comes time to replace the washing machine, horizontal-axis models -- the ones that open in front -- use only about half as much energy as vertical ones, when the cost of heating the water is included, and some cost only about $150 more than conventional models.
 New refrigerators use far less power than older models, but don't be tempted to replace yours if it is working and was made after 1990, Mr. Nadel said. 
 Bulbs are another matter. Compact fluorescent bulbs use about three-quarters less electricity than incandescent lamps use. 
 And less electricity used translates into less heat for the air-conditioner to remove. 


CORRECTION-DATE: July 1, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article on June 17 about the high costs of home heating and cooling misstated the share of American homes heated with natural gas. The figure, which is increasing and thus raising the demand for electricity, is just under 55 percent, not two-thirds.

HEADLINE: Pistons' Championship Is What Detroit Needed

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN

DATELINE: AUBURN HILLS, Mich. 

 BODY:
DETROIT takes to the streets this morning. Once upon a time if you mentioned Detroit and streets in the same breath, you meant run for cover. This morning it means celebration. The Detroit Pistons are the good news of the day.
 More than 1.5 million fans are expected to turn out for a parade to celebrate the Pistons, who pulled off the most spectacular upset in N.B.A. history Tuesday night. 
 ''It's a David-and-Goliath victory and people feeling ownership and pride about the Pistons,'' Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick said Tuesday before the Pistons routed the Los Angeles Lakers to win the N.B.A. championship. ''This is something that is waking up grandmothers and grandfathers from all corners of this region and this state.''
 Most victories have no significance beyond the day they're being played. Someone wins, someone loses. But some define a moment or a national mood. The nation felt good about Smarty Jones for a month, only to have its hopes for a Triple Crown dashed in the homestretch. We began to feel good about the Pistons -- even those of us who picked them to lose to the Lakers. Larry Brown, 63, the Pistons coach, made the finals a referendum on paying dues and playing basketball the right way -- with teamwork, sacrifice and execution. 
 Detroit was the perfect backdrop for Brown to win his first N.B.A. championship. This is the nation's sixth-largest city and is probably one of the most maligned. 
 I grew up in Chicago and always looked a little cross-eyed at Detroit. My image of the city was tough guys with black leather coats, Jimmy Hoffa and riots. The concept of white flight could have been coined here. 
 Kilpatrick said that Detroit is 80 percent African-American and the surrounding suburbs are 80 percent white. ''The blackest city surrounded by the whitest cities,'' he said. 
 ''But sports is the ultimate bridge that brings people together.''
 Not always in the best ways, especially, it seems, in Detroit. There were riots in 1984 after the Detroit Tigers won the World Series, and another riot in 1990 after the Pistons won their last N.B.A. championship.
 There was no need to erupt after Game 5. The riot was on the court, where the Pistons' victory was so thorough that there was no doubt which team and coach were superior.
 ''The city hasn't been this happy and filled with this much glee since 1989-1990,'' Kilpatrick said, referring to the Pistons' back-to-back titles. 
 In the 1980's Detroit was called the murder capital of the world. There was little economic development and the city was stuck with the stigma of not being able to move forward.
 ''In 1989 Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars and Dennis Rodman and Bill Laimbeer symbolized this city,'' Kilpatrick said. ''No one liked us, everybody hated us. It was a time when Detroit was the butt of all jokes and there was no way that people could cheer for Detroit, and we won in spite of it. That was a tremendous spiritual lift.''
 These Pistons are likable, and Detroit, led by the energetic Kilpatrick, 34, is rejuvenated. Kilpatrick said there are 17 new restaurants downtown, 6 new hotels and riverfront developments.
 ''The resurgence of the city and of this new, young energetic team, is also part of what we're doing on the basketball court as well,'' he said.
 I normally try to steer clear of politicians when there is a championship event in their city. Politicians are addicted to votes the way preachers are addicted to collection plates. They seize the good feeling generated by a dramatic sports moment with the idea of converting them into votes. Kilpatrick is no different, but at least he's a sports enthusiast. 
 He was born in Detroit, attended Cass Technical High School and earned a bachelor of science degree in political science, with honors, from Florida A&M, where he was captain of the football team. He earned his law degree at Michigan State. In 2001, at age 31, Kilpatrick became the youngest mayor in Detroit history and the youngest mayor of any major city in the United States. 
 ''I've been a Pistons fan all my life,'' he said. ''I went to the Detroit Pistons basketball camp every year. I'm a Lions and Pistons fan. I don't care what record they have, what people are saying about them. I cheer for the Lions and Pistons no matter what.''
 Kilpatrick could use a boost. He faces an intense re-election campaign next year and he is being sued by two former city officials for what they said were unlawful firings. 
 That gives Kilpatrick even more reason to savor the dramatic feel-good rise of the Pistons. These are not Bad Boys, and this is not a bad city. 
 ''It clearly is a team that's easily identifiable with the majority of this community,'' Kilpatrick said. ''That's the great part about it.''
 As Game 5 ended, wave upon wave of red, white and blue confetti fell from the Palace rafters. Within minutes everyone was covered -- fans, players, the news media. We were all, as Phil Jackson would say, ''in the moment.'' 
 By yesterday morning the talk had already turned to a Pistons dynasty.
 Don't go Hollywood on me, Detroit. Just savor the moment and enjoy your parade. 
 You earned it.

HEADLINE: Greed Destroyed Adelphia, Prosecutor Says in Summary

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The founding family members of Adelphia Communications used the cable company as a ''personal piggy bank,'' driving it to financial collapse with greed, betrayal and lies, a federal prosecutor charged in closing arguments yesterday at their fraud trial.
 ''They were so greedy, took so much from Adelphia, that when the full extent of the lies and looting were revealed, it bankrupted the company,'' Chris Clark, an assistant United States attorney, told jurors in Federal District Court in Manhattan. 
 Mr. Clark said the Rigas family ''lied to people's faces'' while purchasing 17 company cars, building a golf course and buying country club memberships with the company's money.
 The federal prosecutor's statements came on the first day of closing arguments, which are expected to last about a week, setting the stage for jury deliberations later this month.
 During the trial that has lasted three and a half months, prosecutors have said John Rigas and two sons, Timothy and Michael, stole millions of dollars in Adelphia funds to buy stock and pay for personal extravagances. The defendants have said the Adelphia loans were legitimate and were taken out on the recommendation of outside financial advisers. The three chose not to take the witness stand, and their defense essentially amounted to testimony by character witnesses.
 One other defendant, Michael Mulcahey, a former assistant treasurer, testified on his own behalf against charges that he was involved in a fraud. Yesterday, Mr. Clark, detailing payments that he said were approved for the Rigases, referred to Mr. Mulcahey as ''Michael (O.K. to Pay) Mulcahey.'' 
 Adelphia filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in June 2002 and put itself up for sale in April 2004.

HEADLINE: Variety, the spice of life, has measurable value. But it's not easy to determine.

BYLINE: By Virginia Postrel. 
Virginia Postrel is the author of '''The Substance of Style: How the Rise of Aesthetic Value Is Remaking Commerce, Culture and Consciousness'' (HarperCollins).

 BODY:
CHAMPAGNE from France. Silk sweaters from China. Winter blueberries from Chile. Video games from Japan. Beer from Ireland. Silver jewelry from India. Cellphones from South Korea. Shoes from Italy.
 International trade does not just offer consumers the same goods at lower prices, which is the traditional economic story. It also brings us goods we wouldn't otherwise have access to. Trade increases the number of varieties in the marketplace. It gives consumers more choices. 
 ''The U.S. used to import coffee from around 25 countries,'' says David E. Weinstein, an economist at Columbia University. ''Now we import it from 52 countries. Beer we import from three times more countries than we used to.'' 
 Consider Starbucks. Its Web site lists coffee varieties from Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Indonesia, Mexico, New Guinea, Panama, Yemen and Zimbabwe. Consumers value this variety for its own sake, not just because of lower prices or higher quality.
 ''When you compare two types of coffee, you may not think one is necessarily better,'' Professor Weinstein says. ''But sometimes you'd like to drink a certain type of coffee, and other times you'd like to drink another type of coffee.''
 Being able to get exactly the coffee you're in the mood for makes you, in a sense, better off. But this improvement in consumer welfare has tended to go unmeasured. In most economic statistics, coffee is coffee, beer is beer and shoes are shoes.
 In a recent working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research, Professor Weinstein and Christian Broda, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, estimate how much international trade has benefited consumers simply by increasing variety. (The paper is available at www.ny.frb.org/research/staff--reports/sr180.html.) 
 The results are striking. Consumers, they estimate, would be willing to pay $280 billion a year, or about 3 percent of gross domestic product, to have access to the variety of goods that were available in 2001, rather than what they could have bought in 1972.
 That represents a huge, previously uncounted rise in the standard of living. It also suggests that measurements of real price increases, like the Consumer Price Index, are overstated.
 The economists looked at the number of goods, like red wine, and varieties, which they defined as goods from a certain country, like red wine from France. For thousands of goods, they calculated how much an increase in variety mattered to consumers -- how ''substitutable'' the varieties were.
 Consumers do not generally care what country a commodity like crude oil comes from, for example. They care much more about varieties of wine, automobiles or cheese, and they value some varieties more than others. Access to French wine is more important to most people than access to Japanese or Australian wine.
 ''The nasty mathematics,'' Professor Weinstein says about the paper, ''is all about trying to make adjustments for the fact that qualities of varieties may vary across countries.''
 Economists generally use the term ''variety'' to mean the least aggregated version of a good in their data, but not necessarily a specific brand, much less an individual item. To a consumer, of course, variety has increased even more than the economists' data indicate -- not all red wine from France is the same. As a result, the paper's calculations probably understate the gains from increasing variety.
 The calculations took about four days, using four computers. Ten years ago, the economists estimate, the same calculations, also using four computers, would have taken more than four months. Little wonder that nobody has done this calculation before.
 Once the economists determined how much variety mattered for each good, they looked at how much variety had increased. From 1972 to 2001, the number of varieties increased from 74,667 (7,731 goods, from an average of 9.7 countries) to 259,215 (16,390 goods, from an average of 15.8 countries).
 Using this information, they calculated a price index that measured how much each variety increase was worth to consumers.
 The conventional import price index, they estimate, overstates the price of imports by about 1.2 percent a year, because it does not take the higher value of variety into account.
 Interestingly, the greatest gains took place not in the 1990's but from 1972 to 1988, a period when conventional measures show a relatively stagnant standard of living. During this period, major exporters, notably South Korea and China, liberalized their economies.
 ''Those countries flooded the U.S. market with a lot of varieties that we really liked,'' Professor Weinstein says.
 Americans are not the only consumers who are better off. In an article published in The American Economic Review in May, the economists use less detailed data to estimate the worldwide benefits of variety growth.
 ''Countries like China, Mexico, the former U.S.S.R., and Singapore have welfare gains that are double digits -- three to five times larger than those for the U.S.,'' Dr. Broda says. ''This is really a world phenomenon, beyond the U.S.''
 The benefits of variety also help explain why many people are willing to pay more to live in big cities. Thanks to greater variety, urban dwellers get more for their money.
 Professor Weinstein, who used to teach at the University of Michigan, explains it this way: ''In Ann Arbor, you have maybe a dozen good restaurants to choose from, and in New York you probably have several thousand good restaurants to choose from. Yet when you compute the price of a meal, you don't take that at all into account.''

HEADLINE: In Upstate County, Ashtrays and Beer Bottles Still Share the Bar

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: UTICA, N.Y., June 11 

 BODY:
The sign on the door says ''Smoking.'' Seven cut-glass ashtrays sit on the copper-colored bar, all in plain sight. And when David Sprague strode into the cool, dark barroom here on Friday afternoon, the first thing he did after high-fiving a friend and ordering a bottle of Budweiser was to take out a Newport and light up.
 The bar, the Varick, which is just down the street from the old brewery that now makes Saranac beer, is one of the 28 establishments in Oneida County that have received waivers from the state's smoking ban. No other county has issued as many, and that record, along with the efforts of two lawmakers to alter the state's ban to allow smoking in bars that install filter systems, has quietly made this upstate county along the Mohawk River the smoking capital of New York State. 
 ''This is why I come here,'' said Mr. Sprague, 37, a motorcycle rider and chain smoker who said that before the Varick received its waiver he used to sneak into the kitchens of bars to smoke, brave sub-zero weather for cigarettes or even use chewing tobacco so he could stay indoors. ''In the bar I'd chew Skoal, and ask for a cup to spit it out in.''
 Under the state's smoking ban, which went into effect last July, most counties in New York were given the authority to draft their own guidelines for issuing waivers. Typically, establishments must show a financial loss above a threshold established by the county, usually 10 or 15 percent. With New York City and its surrounding counties covered by their own local smoking bans, the vast majority of waivers have been granted upstate. And Oneida County, where many local elected officials oppose the ban, tops the list, having issued more than a fifth of the waivers in the state.
 But if local officials hoped that issuing waivers here would give a much-needed shot in the arm to struggling bars, the scene on the streets of Utica would suggest that a waiver doesn't necessarily translate into more customers. Even after the Varick threw open its doors to begin happy hour at 4 p.m. on Friday, a much bigger crowd was found just up the street at O'Donnell's -- a bar without a waiver that still drew many smokers, who took breaks from their beers for cigarettes on the sidewalk. 
 One smoker outside O'Donnell's, Jeff Nelson, 36, said he was glad that the Utica area was leading the state in exemptions from the smoking ban, but he added that a sense of loyalty kept him drinking at O'Donnell's. ''The number of bars in Utica exceeds the number of churches,'' Mr. Nelson said. ''If you look at some neighborhoods, there's a bar on every corner. And people stay with their neighborhood bars.'' 
 A statewide analysis of the smoking ban by the American Cancer Society shows that of the state's 65,000 bars and restaurants, only 132 have been granted waivers. And the society said that its data indicated that demand for the waivers appeared to be declining. 
 ''After an initial flurry of complaints about the law, we've seen a significant drop in the number of establishments requesting waivers,'' Donald Distasio, the chief executive of the cancer society's eastern division, said in a statement.
 But Oneida County remains a haven for the live-and-let-smoke crowd.
 Joseph A. Griffo, the Oneida County executive and a nonsmoker, said that the county was simply trying to enforce the state law as it understood it. He said most waivers were granted to establishments that had demonstrated economic hardship as a result of the ban. And he added that there were no plans to market the county as a tourist destination for smokers. 
 ''It wasn't the intent to try to say, 'Hey, come to our place, because there are bars that allow you to smoke,''' Mr. Griffo said. ''We're not using it to try to draw people. We just felt that based on the conditions that were thrust upon us by the state, that we would do the best we could to deal with those.''
 Mr. Griffo said that many in the county were upset that the state had simply passed the ban with little public input, leaving local governments to enforce it and interpret its waiver provisions. He said he would prefer a law less open to interpretation. And he noted that the county's position would have to be revisited soon, because the existing waivers -- for saloons, clubs, businesses and a bowling alley -- last one year.
 The two state lawmakers representing Utica -- State Senator Raymond A. Meier, a Republican, and Assemblywoman RoAnn M. Destito, a Democrat -- have introduced legislation that would amend the ban to allow smoking in bars, bowling alleys and pool halls that install air purification devices.
 Senator Meier, a nonsmoker and a legislator who voted for the ban, said he was moved to introduce his proposal to help tavern owners who say that the ban has devastated business, and to end the inconsistent way the law has been interpreted.
 ''You effectively have, in the 57 counties outside the city of New York, 57 different standards, and you can see that,'' he said. ''This county has granted more waivers than any other county. Some have granted none. There's no uniformity of administering this waiver process and absolutely no predictability about it.'' 
 State officials said it was unlikely that the air purification bill would pass this session. But the new proposal has alarmed antismoking advocates, who see it as an attempt to gut what they consider one of the great public health advances of recent times. 
 ''The law is working as intended,'' said Michael Bopp, the American Cancer Society's director of advocacy for New York State. ''The most severe cases, as determined by local officials, have availed themselves of the relief that is in the existing law -- its waiver provisions. Now the state should move forward and let the law stand as it is.''
 Indeed, the ban has its fans even in a bastion of legalized smoking like Oneida County. 
 Symeon's, a popular Greek restaurant near here, banned smoking before the state law passed. ''It was a Friday night, and we were full; we had a waiting line,'' Symeon Tsoupelis, 33, the owner, recalled. ''The smoking section was empty. So we said, 'No smoking tonight.' The next night, Saturday, the same thing. Our clientele dictated it.''
 Mr. Tsoupelis said that he received two angry letters about the ban, but that within a year and a half the eight sets of regular customers who had sat in the smoking section were regulars once again. ''They are all back,'' he said.
 At the Varick, though, even a couple of nonsmokers said they were happy to be able to sit in a bar that allowed smoking again. ''When I go to a bar, I know what I'm getting into,'' said Greg Stiefvater, 31, who said he quit smoking a few years ago.

HEADLINE: Attacks on Iraqi Oil Industry Squelch Market Enthusiasm

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks closed mixed yesterday, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index slightly higher and the Dow Jones industrial average barely lower. 
 A set of positive reports indicating a strengthening economy were tempered by worries about the world's oil supply after attacks on Iraqi pipelines.
 The blue-chip Dow industrials dipped 0.85 point, or 0.01 percent, to close at 10,379.58. The S.&P. 500 rose 1.55 points, or 0.14 percent, to 1,133.56. The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index added 2.63 points, or 0.13 percent, ending at 1,998.23. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization stocks gained 2.15 points, or 0.38 percent, closing at 570.07. 
 Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange exceeded those declining by a margin of about 6 to 5. Volume fell to 1.17 billion shares from 1.35 billion on Tuesday. Trading in the Nasdaq market was also relatively light. 
 In economic news yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that housing construction surpassed forecasts in May and that industrial production surged. Hiring showed signs of improvement in April and May, the Federal Reserve said. 
 But worries about the availability of Iraqi oil after attacks over two days on main pipelines and the killing yesterday of a top oil security official seemed to have overshadowed the strong data. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for delivery next month settled at $37.32 a barrel, up 13 cents, though still below the high on June 1 of $42.33.
 Energy stocks advanced, with the oil service sector index rising 2.7 percent. Shares of Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, added 65 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $44.73. ChevronTexaco, the No.2 oil company in the United States, gained $1.39 -- also 1.5 percent -- closing at $91.99.
 Oil services companies advanced, including Halliburton, which rose 97 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $30.35, and Schlumberger, up $2.31, or 3.8 percent, to $62.23.
 Oracle was the most active Nasdaq issue, falling 36 cents, to $11.35, even after it reported late Tuesday that its quarterly earnings rose 15 percent. The results seem to have disappointed some investors and analysts, who had expected stronger license sales.
 Shares of the electronics retailer Best Buy fell, despite the company's reporting a quarterly profit in contrast to a loss a year earlier. Best Buy dropped $1.04, or almost 2 percent, to $52.04. It forecast higher earnings for the current quarter and the full year. But analysts worried about the cost of its customer loyalty plan and about rising inventories.
 Cyberonics, which designs and sells medical devices, soared $15.12, or 76 percent, to $34.81, after a majority of a Food and Drug Administration panel recommended conditional approval of its therapy system as an additional treatment for depression. Shares of the company, based in Houston, were the most actively traded Nasdaq issue. 
 Apple Computer rose $2.05, or 6.7 percent, to $32.74, a day after releasing its iTunes online music service in parts of Europe. Apple traded more than 16 million shares, and the closing price was its best in more than three years. 
 Among stocks sensitive to interest rates, big banks and home builders were mixed. Citigroup was unchanged at $47.02, while American Express rose 29 cents, to $51.51, and J.P. Morgan Chase gained 7 cents, closing at $37.32.
 The S.&P. homebuilding index slipped 0.59 percent. Shares of KB Home gained 32 cents, to $63.71, amid expectations of a rate increase by the Federal Reserve. 
 On the bond market, Treasury prices fell, after yesterday's economic data added strength to suggestions that a rate rise is coming soon, leading traders to lock in gains from Tuesday.
 By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note slipped 11/32, to 100 7/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.72 percent, from 4.67 percent on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Suits Challenge Hospital Bills Of Uninsured

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON and JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
A group of plaintiffs' lawyers filed civil lawsuits against more than a dozen nonprofit hospitals across the country yesterday, contending that the hospitals violated their obligation as charities by overcharging people without insurance and then hounding them for the money. 
 The complaints name some of the largest hospitals in the Chicago, Atlanta and Minneapolis metropolitan areas. More lawsuits are expected to be filed, said Don Barrett, one of the lawyers involved in the cases. ''It is part of a coordinated attack on this reprehensible practice,'' he said. 
 The lawyers, some of whom were involved in litigation against the tobacco companies in the 1990's, are calling for the creation of a trust that would be financed by the hospitals and would provide affordable medical care for those without insurance. Because the hospitals have tax-exempt status and other benefits as nonprofit organizations, the lawyers argue that they have an obligation to provide affordable care to the uninsured. 
 Hospitals' billing and collection practices have emerged as a controversial issue over the last 18 months as many hospitals have come under sharp criticism for charging people without insurance significantly more than they charge those insured, and then aggressively seeking to collect payments from those people.
 ''It has brought on them the wrath of the community over their tax exemption,'' said Dr. Uwe E. Reinhardt, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University.
 The suits were filed in federal courts perhaps because they cite federal laws that govern health insurance. The lawyers are seeking class-action status on behalf of uninsured patients who they say should have received affordable care but did not.
 The lawyers also say the hospitals are sitting on large, untaxed sums that should help pay for care for the uninsured. Some hospitals are described in the suits as being among the most profitable hospital systems in the nation with hundreds of millions, even billions, in assets and revenue. 
 But the hospitals say they are not responsible for the plight of the uninsured. And they say that in seeking repayment by people without insurance, they are not charging unfairly high rates but are simply charging prices that do not reflect the negotiated discounts obtained by insurance companies and health maintenance organizations. Many say they are reviewing their billing and collection practices. 
 The lawsuits are ''baseless and misdirected, diverting focus away from the real issue of how we as a nation are going to extend health coverage to all Americans,'' said Alicia Mitchell, a spokeswoman for the American Hospital Association, a trade group in Washington. 
 There is little doubt that people without insurance are frequently charged the highest prices for care. The uninsured do not benefit from the ability of an insurer, health plan or large employer to negotiate low prices for care, and hospitals have typically charged their list price to people without insurance.
 One suit filed in Chicago named Provena Health. ''While Provena gives private insurance companies and governmental third-party payers like Medicare and Medicaid large discounts off this gross or 'sticker price,''' the suit said, ''all of its uninsured patients are charged 100 percent of the full sticker price, which is two to three times more than Provena charges its insured patients for the same service.'' 
 The lawsuit claims that Provena each year charges uninsured patients at least $50 million more than its insured patients. The suit does not indicate, though, what portion of the hospital's patients are insured.
 ''In reality, Provena is anything but charitable,'' the lawsuit said. ''While it promises to provide affordable care to the uninsured poor, Provena has and continues to engage in a practice and pattern of charging inordinate, unreasonable and inflated prices for medical care to its uninsured patients.'' 
 No one from Provena could be reached late yesterday for comment. 
 Provena, like some other hospital chains around the country, is already facing scrutiny from regulators. Earlier this year, Illinois revoked the tax-exempt status of one of its hospitals for, among other reasons, not providing enough charitable care. 
 Other state attorneys general have cited similar practices in bringing lawsuits against some nonprofit providers. In Connecticut, the attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, brought a suit against Yale-New Haven Hospital. In New York, hospitals' handling of uninsured patients is an issue of concern to Eliot Spitzer, the state's attorney general, said Christine Pritchard, a spokeswoman for his office. 
 ''The office has received complaints from uninsured individuals related to debt collection for their hospital care,'' Ms. Pritchard said. ''It is of concern to our office, and we would encourage any individual in a similar situation to contact our consumer help line.'' 
 The lawsuits filed yesterday describe aggressive efforts by the hospitals to obtain payment from uninsured individuals without the means to pay. 
 The suit filed against Advocate Health Care Network of Oak Brook, Ill., for example, asserts that Jannie Watts, one of the plaintiffs, ''received numerous threatening and harassing phone calls'' seeking payment of $48,008.47 for treatment of her uninsured teenage son, a bystander to a shooting who was hit by multiple gunshots in 1998. 
 Similarly, in a suit brought against Allina Health System in Minneapolis, the plaintiff, Paul Kern, argues that he had no insurance and thought his care was free. Instead, the suit says, he was billed the full cost of the care and he turned to a credit counseling service, which was unsuccessful in its attempts to negotiate with the hospital on his behalf for better terms. 
 A spokeswoman for Allina said the hospital had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment.
 Hospitals say they can ill afford to finance free health care. Many say that they are struggling financially and that whatever assets they have they need to invest in improving the quality of care. These lawsuits would drain already limited resources, said Ms. Mitchell of the hospital association. 
 The issue of hospitals' treatment of the uninsured is likely to continue drawing attention from lawyers and policy makers, said Eugene E. Elder, a lawyer in the Washington office of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld who has represented hospitals. As more people have direct experience with the high price of hospital care, he said, they are sympathetic to those with medical bills they cannot pay. ''More and more people have become sensitized to that,'' he said, ''and it's easy to get outraged.'' 
 It is unclear how strong the new legal cases will prove to be, said Samuel Issacharoff, a professor at Columbia Law School who has worked with both plaintiff and defense lawyers. ''There are a couple of moving parts that are hard to define,'' Mr. Issacharoff said. ''What is the legal obligation to provide charity care?''
 Determining exactly who should have been charged less or received treatment free may be difficult, he said, and deciding how much money they should have been charged for treatment may be equally complex. ''This is a terribly complicated issue,'' Mr. Issachroff said.

HEADLINE: No Airline Bailouts

 BODY:
As part of its overall strategy to emerge from bankruptcy court and restructure the company, United Airlines is hoping to get $1.6 billion in federal loan guarantees. This plan should be thwarted. United is not entitled to a form of taxpayer support that was meant to stabilize the airline industry in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. United's woes nowadays have little to do with that tragedy. 
 As one of its final acts, the federal board established by Congress to manage $10 billion in potential guarantees is reviewing a revised application from United Airlines. It has turned United down once, in 2002, and the merits of that decision have only become more compelling since then. The board -- composed of representatives from the Federal Reserve Board, the Treasury and the Transportation Department -- should stand firm in the face of pressure. A decision is imminent.
 United filed for bankruptcy shortly after failing to get the loan guarantee the first time around, and since then, it has worked hard to reduce its unsustainable costs and improve service. Whether it has gone far enough to emerge as a viable carrier remains to be seen.
 But that needn't be the government's concern. Congress mandated that in addition to determining an airline's ability to pay its debts, the board must predicate any loan guarantees on a finding that an airline's hardship stems from the terror attacks and that federal intervention is necessary to maintain an efficient commercial aviation system.
 That is where United's case falls short. Airlines have already been given grants to compensate them for their immediate 9/11 losses. The loan guarantee system was a further security net for the industry in the event of a protracted terrorism-related slump, and perhaps even more attacks.
 The fact that all of the old major airlines have lost money since the attacks is due to the economic slowdown, their loss of pricing power because of the Internet and competition from new low-fare carriers. Soaring fuel prices are only the latest affliction, and are one of the reasons the major airlines are expected to lose billions more this year, even though they are flying full planes and have cut their costs significantly.
 Some of United's major competitors have been more adept at reinventing themselves in this new environment, without seeking taxpayers' help. It would be unfair for them to have to compete now with a partly subsidized airline. 
 As for the viability of the overall aviation system, there is no need for the government to be worried. And United, the nation's second-largest airline, has 16 percent of the market and tremendous assets. If it cannot deploy those assets profitably, someone else will, just as United once took over some of Pan Am's old routes.

HEADLINE: Forecast on Spending Is Revised Upward

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
TNS Media Intelligence/CMR in New York has increased its prediction for advertising spending in major media to a gain of 9.3 percent this year from 2003, compared with its earlier estimate of a 7.8 percent rise.
 TNS said yesterday that the spending in 2004 would total $140.3 billion, up from its earlier estimate of $138.4 billion, partly because spending in the first quarter was stronger than expected. 
 The increased estimate places TNS among the most bullish forecasters of ad spending for this year, which has so far proved more robust for some media, like the Internet, than others, like radio.
 Some advertiser categories, like automakers, have also increased spending faster than others, like lodging chains. TNS is part of Taylor Nelson Sofres.

HEADLINE: In Detail: How bin Laden Set Plan in Motion in '99

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL and DAVID JOHNSTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16 

 BODY:
In early 1999, Osama bin Laden summoned Khalid Shaikh Mohammed to his well-guarded compound in Kandahar, Afghanistan, to confide to the lieutenant that his long-discussed proposal to use aircraft as terror weapons against the United States had the full support of Al Qaeda. 
 That meeting, described for the first time by the independent commission investigating the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, set in motion an extraordinary series of events. But the path from Kandahar to the World Trade Center was anything but a straight line.
 Described in vivid detail by two captured Qaeda operatives who helped plan the attacks, the plot was more troubled and improvisational than had been previously understood.
 As late as August 2001, one commission report says, Mr. Mohammed fretted about infighting between Mohamed Atta, the mission leader, and a Lebanese pilot, Ziad al-Jarrah. With his frosted hair and his fondness for Beirut nightclubs, Mr. Jarrah seemed so close to choosing a girlfriend over Al Qaeda that the plotters scrambled to line up a replacement pilot. But in the end, Mr. Jarrah was at the controls of United Flight 93 when it crashed in Pennsylvania. 
 Of the four Qaeda operatives first assigned to the plot in 1999, only two ended up among the final 19 hijackers who carried out the attacks. Both of them -- Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaq Alhazmi -- washed out as student pilots and were relegated to lesser roles. To take their place as pilots, Mr. Mohammed turned to other recruits spotted at the camps in Afghanistan.
 Mr. Atta, the Egyptian pilot who was at the center of the core group, did not join the team until after the plot was well under way. The lineup of hijackers was changing throughout the two years of preparations. Meanwhile, an impatient Mr. bin Laden began pressing for an attack as early as 2000, even if it meant using untrained pilots to crash into the ground instead of into buildings.
 At the start, though, Mr. bin Laden and Mr. Mohammed envisioned attacks even more audacious than the one that was ultimately carried out, the report said.
 Mr. Mohammed, the American-educated Kuwaiti from Pakistan who emerges in the commission's account as a main partner of Mr. bin Laden, at one point planned an attack involving 10 planes. Mr. Mohammed wanted to hijack the last plane himself, then kill every man on board and land to deliver an anti-American diatribe. Another version, scrapped in 2000, envisioned near-simultaneous attacks involving aircraft in Southeast Asia and the United States. Still another, discarded only in the summer of 2001, conceived of a second wave of strikes, after those in Washington and New York, that would target skyscrapers in California and Washington State.
 The date of the attacks was not settled until mid-August, the report says, and even in the final days, Mr. Atta and Ramzi bin al-Shibh, another top Qaeda lieutenant, had not decided whether the fourth plane, the one piloted by Mr. Jarrah, should aim at the Capitol or the White House. 
 ''In the end,'' the report said, ''the plot proved sufficiently flexible to adapt and evolve as challenges arose.''

The Training and the Targets
 Mr. Mohammed first presented his plan to use airliners in suicide attacks to Mr. bin Laden in 1996. Then, the Qaeda leader listened, but did not commit himself. 
 The proposal sketched out an aerial suicide plot that seemed to come straight from a 1995 plan by Mr. Mohammed and others in Manila to blow up 12 American commercial jets over the Pacific Ocean.
 Three years later, at their meeting in Kandahar, Mr. bin Laden said the plan now had Al Qaeda's full support. Mr. Mohammed and Mr. bin Laden chose an initial list of targets. Mr. bin Laden wanted to hit the White House and the Pentagon. Mr. Mohammed wanted to strike the World Trade Center. To that list they added the Capitol, one commission report said.
 Mr. bin Laden quickly supplied Mr. Mohammed with four recruits to carry out the scheme, drawing from the thousands of young men who trained in his camps a few especially ardent followers he had singled out for martyrdom missions.
 The four men were Mr. Alhazmi; Mr. Midhar; Walid Muhammad Salih bin Attash, known as Khallad; and Abu Bara al-Taizi. Only Mr. Alhazmi and Mr. Midhar stayed to the end.
 Intensive training began in the fall of 1999. The recruits took part in an elite course at the Mes Aynak camp in Afghanistan. Mr. Mohammed, who had attended college in North Carolina, taught the men English phrases, showed them how to read a telephone book, make flight reservations, use the Internet and encode communications. They played flight simulator games and sifted through airline schedules to determine which flights would be in the air at the same time.
 At first, Mr. Mohammed ordered Khallad and Mr. Taizi to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to study airport security and conduct surveillance of American airlines in preparation for a smaller version of the Manila plot. But Mr. bin Laden canceled the Southeast Asia plan. Khallad and Mr. Taizi dropped out; instead, Khallad became the mastermind of the October 2000 attack in Yemen on the Navy destroyer Cole. Mr. Midhar and Mr. Alhazmi were the first hijackers to enter the United States, arriving on Jan. 15, 2000.
 Separately, in 1999, a group of four other young extremists were making their way from Hamburg, Germany, where they met, to the Afghan camps, as an alternative to an earlier plan to fight against the Russians in Chechnya. The four, Mr. Atta, Mr. Jarrah, Mr. bin al-Shibh and Marwan al-Shehhi, seemed ideal for Mr. bin Laden. They were Western educated and held extreme anti-American views. All except Mr. bin al-Shibh died in the attacks.
 In Afghanistan, Mr. Atta quickly achieved high status, pledging ''bayat'' or allegiance to Mr. bin Laden, who made him the operation's leader. The two men discussed targets for the attack. One commission report, based on the interrogation of Mr. bin al-Shibh, said the two men identified ''the World Trade Center, which represented the U.S. economy; the Pentagon, a symbol of the U.S. military and the U.S. Capitol, the perceived source of U.S. policy in support of Israel.''
 By March 2000, the four Qaeda recruits were back in Germany researching flight schools. After learning that training was cheaper and easier in the United States, Mr. Atta, Mr. Shehhi and Mr. Jarrah left for America. Mr. bin al-Shibh, a Yemeni who tried but failed to enter the country, stayed behind as a link between Mr. Mohammed and Mr. Atta.
 By the fall of 2000, the recruits were training at different aviation schools around the country. But Mr. Midhar and Mr. Alhazmi, the first two hijackers to enter the country, proved to be poor pilots.
 Al Qaeda proved adaptable. In place of the two men, Mr. bin Laden's scouts recommended Hani Hanjour, who had studied in the United States and had taken flight training in Arizona. He was chosen for the plot in 2000 after he arrived at Al Faruq camp in Afghanistan. That December, Mr. Hanjour flew to California.
 With his arrival, the pilots of the four planes used in the attacks were safely in the United States.

The Team Takes Shape
 As 2001 dawned, all was not well among the pilots.
 Mr. Jarrah was headed abroad, on the second and third of what would be five foreign trips in 10 months, to see his girlfriend in Germany and his family in Lebanon. Mr. Atta and Mr. Shehhi also left the United States around the New Year, but it was Mr. Jarrah, from a wealthy Lebanese family, who seemed to be having second thoughts about the plot.
 The report says Mr. Jarrah ''studied at private, Christian schools'' in Lebanon, ''knew the best nightclubs and discos in Beirut, and partied with fellow students in Germany, even drinking beer -- a clear taboo for any religious Muslim.'' He was different from the more pious Mr. Atta and other pilots, the report says, and in his months of training in the United States, he lived separately and felt isolated.
 By late July, when Mr. Jarrah headed to Germany again, on a one-way ticket bought by his girlfriend, the daughter of Turkish immigrants, Mr. Mohammed and Mr. bin al-Shibh discussed the possibility of replacing him with another man, Zacarias Moussaoui. Only after an emotional conversation in Germany in early August, in which Mr. bin al-Shibh encouraged him ''to see the plan through,'' did Mr. Jarrah return to the United States and the team.
 In fits and starts, the final lineup for the attacks began taking shape. At one time or another, at least nine candidate hijackers, all Saudis, had been dropped from the plan, the report says. But by late April, the 15 recruits who would serve in supporting roles in the hijackings had begun arriving in the United States. Most were short, slender and 20 to 28. They would serve as the ''muscle'' to subdue the crew and passengers. 
 Still, Mr. bin Laden was impatient. As early as 2000, just as the pilots were beginning to arrive in the United States, he had been pressing Mr. Mohammed to carry out the attacks, to protest harsh treatment by Israel of the Palestinians. It would be sufficient, the Qaeda leader told Mr. Mohammed, if the planes were just crashed into the ground.
 At least twice in 2001, Mr. bin Laden encouraged attacks as early as May, but Mr. Mohammed deflected those requests, the report says, saying the hijackers needed more time. In the summer, Mr. Mohammed set aside his vision of attacks in California and Washington State, that would follow those in the East; he was too busy preparing for the main onslaught. 
 At a meeting in Spain in mid-July, Mr. Atta told Mr. bin al-Shibh that he would need another six weeks to carry out those strikes, the report said. Not until mid-August did Mr. Atta settle on the Sept. 11 date.
 Since 1999, when Mr. bin Laden gave the go-ahead to the plot, the target list had been whittled down, albeit after much debate. From Boston, two hijacked planes would strike the World Trade Center, a target long favored by Mr. Mohammed. From Dulles airport outside Washington, a third plane would hit the Pentagon, a favorite of Mr. bin Laden.
 But what of the Capitol and the White House? Both had been on the preliminary list, and Mr. bin Laden preferred the White House, a message conveyed to Mr. Atta. But the chief hijacker resisted. In the center of Washington, the White House might be difficult to strike; he wanted to hold the Capitol in reserve.
 The fourth aircraft, hijacked after takeoff from Newark, was headed toward Washington but it crashed into the Pennsylvania field. ''As late as Sept. 9, two days before the attacks,'' one commission report says, ''the conspirators may still have been uncertain about which Washington target they would strike.''
 In Afghanistan, some of Mr. bin Laden's most senior advisers were anxious, the report says. They were concerned that the attack could provoke an armed American response and would also anger Taliban leaders and the Pakistani government, whose good graces had permitted Al Qaeda to use Afghanistan as a refuge. But in a dispute over whether to go forward, Mr. bin Laden prevailed. 
 ''In his thinking,'' the report says, ''the more Al Qaeda did, the more support it would gain.''

HEADLINE: Bill Clinton, on '60 Minutes,' Speaks of Affair With Intern

BYLINE: By COURTNEY C. RADSCH

 BODY:
Former President Bill Clinton called his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern, ''a terrible moral error'' and sought to explain how his family handled the crisis in an interview with Dan Rather on the CBS program ''60 Minutes,'' to be broadcast Sunday. 
 During interviews at his homes in Chappaqua, N.Y., and Arkansas, Mr. Clinton said: ''I did something for the worst possible reason. Just because I could. I think that's just about the most morally indefensible reason anybody could have for doing anything.'' 
 In his most extensive remarks about the Lewinsky scandal since leaving the White House, Mr. Clinton said that he and his family had sought counseling while his wife, Hillary, decided whether to remain married to him in the aftermath of the 1999 Senate vote on his impeachment. He told Mr. Rather that through counseling his family was able to overcome the effects of the scandal. 
 Mr. Clinton called his impeachment for perjury and obstruction of justice ''illegitimate'' and an ''abuse of power,'' but said he never considered resigning. ''The whole battle was a badge of honor,'' he told Mr. Rather. 
 The entire ''60 Minutes'' broadcast on Sunday will be devoted to the interview with Mr. Clinton in what amounted to a preview of his autobiography, ''My Life,'' which goes on sale on June 22. 
 In listing the accomplishments of his presidency, Mr. Clinton singled out the successful ouster of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, who is now standing trial for war crimes in The Hague.
 ''The day that Kosovar war ended and I knew Milosevic's days were numbered was a great day,'' Mr. Clinton said.
 But even more than the successful overthrow of a dictator, Mr. Clinton said he was proudest of his economic plan. He said the creation of jobs, record home ownership and lower interest rates helped people ''do more things than ever before.''

HEADLINE: Bush Tells U.S. Troops 'Life Is Better' in Iraq

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: MacDILL AIR FORCE BASE, Fla., June 16 

 BODY:
Two weeks before the handover of sovereignty to a new Iraqi government, President Bush told thousands of American troops here and around the world on Wednesday that ''a democratic, free Iraq is on the way'' and insisted that despite the daily toll of the insurgency the country's economy was growing and ''life is better.'' 
 Mr. Bush's speech here at the headquarters of the United States Central Command, which oversees operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, came only a day after a poll of Iraqis commissioned by the American-led Coalition Provisional Authority painted a very different picture, one in which the occupation is overwhelmingly unpopular and sentiment is rising for American troops to leave the country.
 Yet to the cheers of troops here, and others connected via a video link in Bagram, Afghanistan, and a hangar at the Baghdad airport, Mr. Bush insisted that over the long run Iraqis would be grateful for the occupation, which he likened to the American reconstruction of postwar Germany. After the handover of power on June 30, he said, American troops will take on the role of ''supporting'' Iraqi forces, and he insisted it would become clear that the insurgents were ''not fighting foreign forces, they're fighting the Iraqi people.'' 
 Mr. Bush has repeatedly returned to Florida, a state that he narrowly won in 2000 and that is widely viewed as up for grabs this year, to drive home the major themes of his re-election campaign. So it was no surprise he chose Centcom, as it is known, for another of his speeches explaining his goals in Iraq.
 Local television coverage was heavy, and Air Force One was parked as a backdrop outside the hangar where he spoke. His welcome was overwhelming, as it often is when he visits military bases, though this time he referred to the strain that long deployments were creating among families here.
 Mr. Bush's aides are increasingly apprehensive about the drop in his approval ratings that polls indicate are largely attributable to his handling of Iraq and the prisoner abuse scandal. Publicly, they express confidence that those numbers will recover once Iraq settles down. Privately, they say, they are uncertain it will settle down in time for the election. 
 On Wednesday, Mr. Bush focused on the best news he could find in the 14 days before the handover. He said that thousands of schools had reopened and that electricity had been restored, not mentioning that electricity was being generated far below the levels his own administration set as a goal. He described the country as a thriving start-up venture in democratic capitalism.
 ''Markets are beginning to thrive, new businesses have opened, a stable new currency is in place, dozens of political parties are organizing, hundreds of courts of law are opening across the country,'' he said. ''Today in Iraq more than 170 newspapers are being published.''
 Of the violence in Iraq, he pledged that ''the traitors will be defeated.'' 
 ''Their greatest fear is an Iraqi government of, by and for the Iraqi people,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And no matter what the terrorists plan, no matter what they attempt, a democratic, free Iraq is on the way.''
 Mr. Bush's probable Democratic opponent, Senator John Kerry, shot back with a critique of the war. ''The U.S. should never go to war because it wants to,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''The U.S. should only go to war because it has to. This president failed the test in Iraq.''
 Mr. Bush's speech came only an hour or so before the 9/11 commission declared that there had been no cooperation between Al Qaeda and the now-deposed government of Saddam Hussein. That alleged collaboration, and the prospect that the two could share weapons of mass destruction, was an argument the administration marshaled last year to lend a sense of urgency to confronting Mr. Hussein. And in his talk to the troops, Mr. Bush melded the fights in Afghanistan and Iraq into a single, broader struggle against ''terrorists in distant lands.''
 His effort on Wednesday to merge those conflicts under the umbrella of a war on terror led to an immediate response from two of Mr. Kerry's top national security advisers, former Defense Secretary William Perry and Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida. 
 Mr. Graham, who has spent years on the Senate Intelligence Committee and is considered a vice-presidential contender, said Mr. Bush had ''essentially ignored the war on terror'' in Afghanistan once he began to divert troops to Iraq, a country that Mr. Graham argued posed no terror threat to the United States until the fall of Mr. Hussein made it a haven for terrorism.
 Mr. Perry, who has been informally advising Mr. Kerry, told reporters in a conference call that ''the reality is that we do not have enough boots on the ground in Iraq to maintain security in a country as large as Iraq in the face of insurgent operation.''

HEADLINE: Bush Campaign Plans a Break in Its TV Ads

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16 

 BODY:
President Bush's campaign said Wednesday that it would stop running commercials for several days starting next week, the first significant halt in his advertising campaign since it began on March 4.
 The pause would seem to bring to a close Mr. Bush's springtime strategy of broadcasting a relentless and precisely planned set of commercials. They were devised to send voters into the summer vacation season with the perception that Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, was a high-taxing, flip-flopping liberal who was weak on defense. 
 Both campaigns have been fiercely debating whether Mr. Bush, who has spent $80 million on advertising, has gotten everything he paid for. Democrats say Mr. Kerry's strong standing in several polls shows the strategy has failed. Republicans say the number of voters who tell pollsters they have questions about Mr. Kerry's core convictions shows it succeeded.
 In Mr. Bush's latest advertisement, an announcer ticks off the president's economic accomplishments and criticizes Mr. Kerry as pessimistic. Advisers to Mr. Bush said the commercial would stop running on network television stations in the 19 states where he has primarily been advertising starting Sunday. They said the commercial would continue to run on cable channels through June 24. 
 The advisers did not indicate how long the pause would last, though Nicolle Devenish, Mr. Bush's campaign communications director, said it would be a matter of days, not weeks.
 Some campaign officials hinted earlier in the week that a pause could last until at least a few days after the June 30 deadline for the United States to hand over limited sovereignty to Iraqis, but Ms. Devenish said no date had been set for a resumption of commercials.
 Reiterating the campaign's refrain that it believed voters would stop paying close attention to the race in the early summer, she said, ''This is a strategic decision based on our analysis of when people are paying attention and when they're focused on other things.''
 Mr. Kerry's campaign officials said they did not believe voters were tuning out the race and indicated that they had no plans to stop running their advertising campaign, which has cost them roughly $60 million, any time soon.
 Stephanie Cutter, Mr. Kerry's communications director, said the Bush advertising pause was likely to be financially motivated and was confirmation of her campaign's belief that the president's advertising had not been effective.
 ''This is a money-conscious decision because why waste money on advertising that is only driving votes away from you,'' she said. 
 But Bush campaign officials said they expected to report on Friday that they had $63 million on hand at the start of June. 
 Mr. Bush's campaign has paused its advertising, briefly, twice since March. It did so on Friday, the day of former President Ronald Reagan's funeral, and during the Memorial Day weekend, when it expected relatively few would be paying close attention.

HEADLINE: President's Political Thorn Grows Only More Stubborn

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16 

 BODY:
The bipartisan commission investigating the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks further called into question on Wednesday one of President Bush's rationales for the war with Iraq, and again put him on the defensive over an issue the White House was once confident would be a political plus.
 In questioning the extent of any ties between Iraq and Al Qaeda, the commission weakened the already spotty scorecard on Mr. Bush's justifications for sending the military to topple Saddam Hussein.
 Banned biological and chemical weapons: none yet found. Percentage of Iraqis who view American-led forces as liberators: 2, according to a poll commissioned last month by the Coalition Provisional Authority. Number of possible Al Qaeda associates known to have been in Iraq in recent years: one, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, whose links to the terrorist group and Mr. Hussein's government remain sketchy. 
 That is the difficult reality Mr. Bush faces 15 months after ordering the invasion of Iraq, and less than five months before he faces the voters at home. The commission's latest findings fueled fresh partisan attacks on his credibility and handling of the war, attacks that now seem unlikely to be silenced even if the return of sovereignty to the Iraqis comes off successfully in two weeks.
 Senator John Kerry, the presumed Democratic presidential nominee, was quick to seize on the commission's report to reprise his contention that Mr. Bush ''misled'' the American people about the need for the war. Even some independent-minded members of Mr. Bush's own party said they sensed danger.
 ''The problem the administration has is that the predicates it laid down for the war have not played out,'' said Warren B. Rudman, the former Republican senator from New Hampshire, who has extensive experience in assessing intelligence about terrorism. ''That could spell political trouble for the president, there's no question.''
 Mr. Bush has said that he knows of no direct involvement by Mr. Hussein and his government in the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. But the president has repeatedly asserted that there were ties between Iraq and Al Qaeda, a position he stuck to on Tuesday when he was asked about Vice President Dick Cheney's statement a day earlier that Mr. Hussein had ''long-established ties with Al Qaeda.''
 Mr. Bush pointed specifically on Tuesday to the presence in Iraq of Mr. Zarqawi, a Jordanian jihadist who sought help from Al Qaeda in waging the anti-American insurgency after the fall of Mr. Hussein, and who has been implicated by American intelligence officials in the killing of Nicholas Berg, the 26-year-old American who was beheaded by militants in Iraq in March.
 The White House said Wednesday that there was a distinction between Mr. Bush's position and the commission's determination that Iraq did not cooperate with Al Qaeda on attacks on the United States. 
 The commission's report did not specifically address that distinction or Mr. Zarqawi's role. It found that an Iraqi intelligence officer met with Osama bin Laden in Sudan in 1994, but that Iraq never responded to Mr. bin Laden's subsequent request for space to set up training camps and help in buying weapons. It said there were reports of later contacts between Iraq and Al Qaeda, but ''they do not appear to have resulted in a collaborative relationship.'' 
 It quoted two senior associates of Mr. bin Laden denying adamantly ''that any ties existed between Al Qaeda and Iraq.'' It concluded that there never was a meeting in Prague between an Iraqi intelligence officer and Mohammed Atta, the leader of the Sept. 11 hijackers; in an interview with National Public Radio in January, Mr. Cheney cited intelligence reports about the possibility of such a meeting in asserting that there was not confirmation ''one way or another'' about links between Iraq and the Sept. 11 attacks.
 Democratic strategists said there was now no question that Mr. Bush would be dogged through the rest of the campaign by questions about whether the war was necessary, justified and sufficiently well planned. But Mr. Bush's supporters said that in political terms, the amazing thing was how well he had weathered the problems thrown at him by Iraq.
 ''If you look at the last eight months at the White House and in particular the last 90 days, I've never seen more negative stories come out in a concentrated period,'' said Sig Rogich, a veteran Republican advertising consultant and fund-raiser. ''Yet despite all that, the president is still even with John Kerry or, if you count the Electoral College votes in the battleground states, ahead. Then there's a creeping plus for George Bush, which is that the economy is taking off.''
 James M. Lindsay of the Council on Foreign Relations, who studies the interplay between foreign policy and domestic politics, said the issue now was less whether Mr. Bush was wrong in asserting a tie between Iraq and Al Qaeda than whether he could stabilize Iraq and show progress in bringing American forces home.
 ''Does the commission's finding make it easier for the Democrats to say, Look, the administration got it wrong?'' Mr. Lindsay said. ''The answer is yes. But the bigger question for the administration is whether it can succeed in getting Iraq to be stable. If it does that it will largely neutralize the threat the Iraq issue poses to the president's re-election.''
 The commission's findings were the latest in a string of Iraq-related developments this year that have kept Mr. Bush's campaign on the defensive, helping Mr. Kerry during a period when the White House's political strategy had hoped he would be especially vulnerable. 
 The official White House strategy for Wednesday may have been to deny any real differences with the commission. But on this day as on many others recently, its real goal appeared to be to stick a bandage on whatever wound it might have suffered, keep moving toward June 30, when the United States will return sovereignty to the Iraqis, and then bank on its ability to redefine the election on terms more favorable to Mr. Bush. 
 In one indication of the White House's doggedness, Mr. Bush's campaign manager, Ken Mehlman, held a conference call with reporters about the same time the commission was delivering its description of the Sept. 11 plot. His topic: the economy.

A news analysis article on June 17 about a report by the staff of the Sept. 11 commission calling into question ties between Iraq and Al Qaeda misstated the month in which Nicholas Berg, a 26-year-old American, was beheaded by militants in Iraq. It was May, not March.

HEADLINE: Panel Says Bush's Space Goals Are Feasible

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 16 

 BODY:
President Bush's goal of sending people back to the Moon and then on to Mars without big budget increases can be achieved by reorganizing NASA and building a private space industry to help, a presidential commission said Wednesday.
 ''It's not going to be easy, but it can be done,'' said Edward C. Aldridge, a former secretary of the Air Force who is the panel's chairman. ''There are a lot of details to work out.''
 After four months of study that included public hearings around the country, the nine-member commission formally issued a 60-page report on how to carry out the president's plan. The report's broad outlines were disclosed last week. 
 On Jan. 14, Mr. Bush said he wanted NASA to focus on putting astronauts back on the Moon by 2020 and using the experience and technology developed in that effort to send people to Mars a decade or so later.
 Mr. Bush suggested starting the effort with $1 billion in new money spread over five years added to $11 billion shifted from other NASA programs over the same period. After that, the agency, whose budget now is about $15 billion a year, would pay for the effort with money saved by phasing out the space shuttle, ending work on the International Space Station and other measures.
 The commission said that it unanimously endorsed Mr. Bush's plan and added that the pay-as-you-go approach could work if public and political support for space exploration by humans and robots could be maintained for several decades. If the program succeeds, the report said, it could assure American technical leadership, increase industrial competitiveness, create technology jobs and inspire the nation's youth to pursue careers in science and engineering.
 ''The long-term, ambitious space agenda advanced by the president for robotic and human exploration will significantly help the United States protect its technological leadership, economic vitality and security,'' the report said.
 Congress has been slow to endorse the president's plan, with leaders saying they needed more details on how it would be carried out and how much it would ultimately cost. Mr. Aldridge said it was not essential to know the full cost of the program in advance -- and that it might not even be possible to calculate such a figure -- to support it.
 ''How much is the cure for cancer going to cost?'' Mr. Aldridge said, ''I don't know that either, but I know what I can afford on an annual basis to try to get there, and this is the same model we're using for the space program.''
 The report was released the day after Senator John Kerry, the probable Democratic presidential nominee, criticized Mr. Bush's space vision as being long on goals and short on resources. According to written responses to questions by the Web site Space.com and the publication Space News, released Wednesday, Mr. Kerry said he supported NASA as an national asset that should be adequately financed. ''However, there is little to be gained from a 'Bush space initiative' that throws out lofty goals, but fails to support those goals with realistic funding,'' he wrote.
 The presidential committee presented the report to Vice President Dick Cheney on Wednesday, and Mr. Aldridge characterized his response as positive.
 The NASA administrator, Sean O'Keefe, said the commission's recommendations ''will influence our work for years to come and will help guide us through a transformation of NASA.'' Lester L. Lyles, a commission member and retired general who headed the Air Force Materiel Command, noted that NASA was in the process of planning a reorganization that closely paralleled the panel's recommendations.
 Among the report's most sweeping recommendations are the establishment of a Space Exploration Steering Council in the White House to oversee a space effort that would involve numerous agencies; having NASA contract out all but its most specialized tasks to private industry to help build up space business; and the transformation of NASA field centers into research and development centers run by universities or private companies, much like the Energy Department's national laboratories.
 Mr. Aldridge said it could take some time for NASA to transform its field centers because of possible resistance within the agency and in Congress. The commission rejected suggestions made at its hearings that NASA consider closing some of its centers, which have strong political backing, and consolidating their activities. If the panel had made such a suggestion, he said, ''the report would have been burned on the first day.''
 Dr. John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said that if the recommendations were followed, NASA would undergo its most radical transformation since it was formed more than 40 years ago.
 ''Lots of legislative action would be needed to follow these recommendations, such as changing Civil Service rules for NASA center employees, tax incentives for industry, export controls for technology and lots more,'' Dr. Logsdon said, ''It's not going to be an easy sell and NASA has its work cut out for it.''

HEADLINE: New Tech Surge in Ireland, And It Feels Like '99 Again

BYLINE: By BRIAN LAVERY

DATELINE: DUBLIN, June 16 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, standing alongside the chief executive of Intel, Craig R. Barrett, cut the ribbon on Monday to open the company's newest semiconductor plant, at Leixlip, outside Dublin. A month earlier, Intel said it would spend $2 billion to build another mammoth factory at the sprawling site. 
 A week before that, eBay's chief executive, Margaret C. Whitman, flew to Ireland to officiate at the opening of her company's newest European location, which will eventually employ 800 people. 
 In April, Google took The Irish Times on a tour of its year-old Dublin-based European hub, so the newspaper could run an enthusiastic article about how the office felt like a California college dorm. 
 Rumors are rife that Amazon.com is touring Web site host operations in Ireland. 
 And so on. 
 In short, it feels like 1999 here. Ireland's $121 billion economy, which rode the crest and crash of the dot-com wave, is once again pinning its hopes on technology investments from across the Atlantic, whether by Internet companies or manufacturers like Intel, just as the American economic revival is allowing companies to look abroad again. 
 Among Ireland's lures are the vast arrays of servers, which serve as hosts for international Web sites and process their data traffic, that were left idle when the technology shakeout four years ago wiped out many over-ambitious start-ups. Many of these barely used servers are now spinning up and humming with life. 
 Likewise, the country's vast Internet bandwidth, including a dedicated undersea cable built five years ago partly with government financing, is once again carrying reasonable amounts of traffic after a long drought. 
 Analysts at Goodbody Stockbrokers, a prominent financial firm here, forecast that Intel's latest investment will, by itself, speed up the growth rate of Ireland's gross domestic product by half a percentage point in 2005, to 4.8 percent. 
 ''I think we've come out in an amazingly resilient state, which does bode well,'' said Jim Power, chief economist with Friends First Asset Management. 
 Lessons have been learned, however, and Ireland is now trying to use the same advantages that put its so-called Celtic Tiger economy on the map in the 1990's in a more mature way. The Industrial Development Authority, the government agency responsible for attracting foreign investors, is using an age-old tool kit of tax and other incentives, but with a tighter focus, often aiming at specific companies rather than whole sectors, said Colm Donlon, a spokesman for the authority. 
 For example, it successfully lobbied the Irish Parliament for a change in the tax code to allow companies that put white-collar operations like headquarters offices and research laboratories in Ireland to write off the investment against taxes, the way manufacturers can with new plants. At 10 percent, Ireland's tax rate for multinational corporations is already one of the lowest in Europe. 
 Universities have tailored engineering programs to meet the requirements of Intel and Hewlett-Packard, and Intel opened a nanotechnology research center at Trinity College in Dublin this year. And the development authority helps streamline Ireland's convoluted planning and zoning process for companies wishing to build significant facilities here. 
 Mr. Donlon predicted that 2004 would be the best year for foreign direct investment, mostly from technology investments, since 2000. 
 The character of the investment is different now, creating far less new employment. Projects assisted by the agency yielded only 2,200 new jobs in the first four months of 2004, about a quarter the pace of 2000, when the full-year total was 23,000. 
 ''We're not looking for investment projects with volumes of jobs,'' Mr. Donlon said -- easy to say in a country where the unemployment rate is 4.4 percent and falling. Instead, he said, the emphasis is on ''high-value investment.'' Intel certainly qualifies -- its latest plans would bring the company's total investment in the country to $6 billion, or about $1,500 for each citizen. 
 The ribbon-cutting on Monday featuring Mr. Ahern, the prime minister, was for a plant known as Fab 24, announced five years ago. The next one to be built here will be Fab 24-2, Intel's fourth in Leixlip and its first outside the United States to use 45-nanometer technology, squeezing more processing power onto each chip than earlier designs. 
 But where Fab 24 employs more than 1,000 people, when Fab 24-2 opens in 2006 it is expected to employ only 400. More important to Irish officials is the $2 billion that Intel expects to spend building the highly automated plant, deepening its stake and, they hope, anchoring Intel in the country for the long term. 
 ''It is symbolically, if not in real terms, the most important U.S. multinational in this country,'' said Mr. Power, the economist, calling it ''a force for modernization.'' He said Intel arrived in Ireland in 1989, when the unemployment rate was 15 percent and hardly anyone here had even heard of stock options. 
 Intel chose Ireland again despite offers from some other countries much more generous than the $120 million Ireland is believed to be paying to land Fab 24-2 (the precise figure has not been made public). In doing so, Irish analysts say, Intel may inspire other technology companies to invest here as well. 
 ''You do attract a quorum of U.S. multinationals -- they tend to feed upon themselves,'' said Gerry Hennigan, a technology analyst with Goodbody Stockbrokers. 
 An Intel spokeswoman, Karina Howley, said the company's employees here had the benefit of 15 years of experience at the top levels of the semiconductor industry. Some 500 of Intel's 4,700 Irish employees have spent more than a year at the company's training and development center in Oregon, accompanied by their families, and another 300 are scheduled to go shortly. 
 If Intel and other multinational corporations here have a growing complaint, it is the rapidly rising cost of doing business here, which seems to climb far faster than consumer inflation. But Mr. Donlon said Intel's plans for Fab 24-2 showed that this country is not at risk of losing more jobs to cheaper locations in Eastern Europe or Asia -- places, he said, that now compete for outsourced service jobs, like those in call centers, that have already come and gone from this country. 
 ''It's the end of the first industrial revolution in Ireland,'' he said, ''and the beginning of the second.''

HEADLINE: Delta Pilots to Seek Talks

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The pilots' union at Delta Air Lines Inc. decided yesterday to seek a resumption of contract negotiations with the company, using updated objectives.
 The union's top council passed a resolution during a special meeting in Los Angeles after getting a financial update from economic experts and investment bankers. 
 The company made its latest proposal in January and no substantive talks have taken place this year. 
 ''Delta is under considerable pressure due to increasing fuel costs and declining yields,'' the union, a unit of the Air Line Pilots Association, said in a message to pilots. 
 Delta, which has posted $3.6 billion in losses since 2000, is asking pilots for pay cuts and has said a bankruptcy filing is possible unless it can stem losses. Delta is based in Atlanta.

HEADLINE: Food and Energy Push Producer Prices Up

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Producer Price Index, a measure of prices before goods reach store shelves, posted the largest increase in more than a year in May, reflecting higher prices for energy and food, the Labor Department reported yesterday.
 In a separate report, the Conference Board said its composite index of leading economic indicators increased 0.5 percent to 116.5 in May, after a 0.1 percent rise in April. The closely watched gauge suggests that the American economy will continue to expand into the fall. 
 Also yesterday, the Labor Department reported that new applications filed for unemployment insurance fell a seasonally adjusted 15,000, to 336,000, the lowest since May 8.
 The Producer Price Index rose 0.8 percent in May after a 0.7 percent rise in April. It was the largest increase since a 1.3 percent rise in March 2003. Excluding energy and food prices, ''core'' wholesale prices rose 0.3 percent in May, after a 0.2 percent rise a month earlier.
 Economists had forecast a 0.6 percent increase in the overall index and a 0.2 percent rise in core prices.
 In May, wholesale prices for energy products rose 1.6 percent for the second consecutive month. The price of crude oil, which peaked at around $42 a barrel in late May, is expected to ease later this year, analysts said.
 Food prices, which are increasing because of more expensive transportation costs tied to higher fuel prices, rose 1.5 percent in May, after a 1.4 percent advance in April.
 Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C., said that ''it may be the last blast of really large price increases,'' noting that crude oil prices have come down in recent weeks and that other commodity prices, including lumber, have been softening.
 The question is how the Federal Reserve Board will read the data when it meets at the end of the month to review its interest rate policy.
 ''The real debate is whether this is a significant increase we're seeing here that has to be met with a more aggressive posture from the Federal Reserve,'' said Anthony Chan, senior managing director and chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio. ''I don't see that in these numbers.''
 The 0.5 percent rise in the Conference Board's index of leading indicators, a forecast of economic activity, was larger than the 0.4 percent that analysts had expected.
 Ken Goldstein, economist for the board, noted that the index had risen in 13 of the last 14 months. The latest numbers, he said, ''reflect a robust economic environment this spring and point to more of the same this summer.''
 Eight of the 10 indicators in the index increased in May, according to the board, a New York-based business group. They were average weekly manufacturing hours, the money supply, interest rate spread, vendor performance, building permits, manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials, a drop in initial claims for unemployment and manufacturers' new orders for nonmilitary capital goods.
 Negative components were consumer expectations and stock prices.

HEADLINE: 9/11 Fund Closes Its Doors

 BODY:
Congress had two purposes in mind when it established the Victim Compensation Fund after 9/11. One was economic: to provide the families of the World Trade Center victims with prompt and fair compensation in exchange for their agreement not to sue the airlines and send them into bankruptcy. The other was to provide a compassionate and collective response to an act of shocking barbarity. 
 The fund officially closed up shop on Tuesday. Though it suffered constant criticism and the occasional lawsuit, it was largely a success. Roughly 97 percent of the 2,973 eligible families filed claims; only 70 chose to risk the uncertainties of litigation, while 30 did nothing.
 This success is a tribute to the industry and the adaptability of Kenneth Feinberg, the special master appointed by the administration to handle the exquisitely difficult task of assigning monetary values to human lives. The volunteers who helped families navigate the paperwork, mainly pro bono lawyers, also made a big contribution.
 Though long on generosity -- the overall payout was $6.9 billion, including 2,675 valid injury claims -- Congress was short on guidance, leaving it to Mr. Feinberg to make sure that families at the lower end of the economic scale got something, while those at the top did not walk away with obscenely high awards. The program taught lessons in tolerance as well as fairness. Gay partners were treated fairly even when state laws were stacked against them, and families of illegal immigrants were assured that they would not be prosecuted if they came forward.
 Everyone hopes, of course, that there will never be a need for a program like this again. But even if a disaster like 9/11 does strike, it seems unlikely that Congress will choose to replicate this program. The price was high, and the chances of total equity virtually nil. Even Mr. Feinberg, an experienced and skilled mediator, agrees that the responsibility he undertook was too great for one person.
 Still, the fund did the task it was given. The airlines got the protection they needed. The American people made a national gesture of sympathy to the bereaved families. The families themselves were able to get compensation through a quicker and simpler route than litigation. In a story with no happy endings, it's good to see this satisfactory one.

HEADLINE: Building-Approval Process Speeded Up in New Jersey

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 17 

 BODY:
While environmental advocates lobbied frantically to stop them, New Jersey legislators approved a bill Thursday that would expedite approval of development in more than one-third of the state. The bill moved with startling speed; introduced three days earlier, it sailed through both houses after leaders struck deals to vote without debate.
 The measure speeds the building-permit process in areas already designated by the state as suitable for development, including most of northeastern New Jersey and the New Jersey Turnpike corridor. It also provides for a state ''smart-growth'' ombudsman with effective veto power over proposed environmental regulations, and representatives in key state agencies to address builders' complaints. 
 The bill was the price exacted for the legislation protecting the New Jersey Highlands, which was hailed as a triumph of environmental preservation when the Legislature approved it just last week.
 Gov. James E. McGreevey, who has cast himself as an antisprawl champion, has had notoriously bad relations with builders. But when a handful of fellow Democrats advocating development projects held up his Highlands bill, he agreed to streamline the permit process. On Thursday afternoon, he twisted arms to get the needed votes. 
 Meanwhile, the environmental advocates who were rejoicing a week ago protested that they had been betrayed. 
 ''This bill was worse than we ever imagined,'' said Douglas O'Malley of the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group, joining colleagues outside the governor's office. ''We would not have supported the Highlands bill if we knew about this bill.''
 Amy Goldsmith, the executive director of the New Jersey Environmental Federation, said, ''No deal was worth the destruction of 30 years of environmental progress in this state.''
 But the bill's proponents said they were just encouraging builders in developed areas. ''The status quo has not given us smart growth,'' said Micah Rasmussen, the governor's press secretary. ''Half of smart growth is telling builders where they can't build, which we have been doing for two and a half years, and the other half is telling them where they should build.'' 
 Jim Sinclair, the first vice president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, said the bill was ''an important economic development tool, particularly in cities and older suburbs.'' Mr. Sinclair added: ''We still have to meet all the state requirements. This just takes us out of the never-never-land of the permitting process.''
 The areas covered by the bill are designated in the State Development and Redevelopment Plan, which divides the state into five categories, from urban to environmentally sensitive. The bill applies to those designated urban and suburban, although much of the acreage is still undeveloped. 
 The plan requires a state agency, in most cases the Department of Environmental Protection, to act on permit applications within 90 days; if it does not, a permit is automatically approved. It also allows a builder to hire a consultant, to be registered with the state, to certify that the application meets state law.
 Local zoning and planning ordinances and local decisions on building permits would not be affected.
 Environmental groups strongly opposed the permit measures. Most said they were disturbed by the appointment of an ombudsman with wide-reaching authority. The ombudsman may not only expedite permit approvals, but may also veto proposed environmental regulations he deems inconsistent with the state plan. 
 Jeff Tittel, the executive director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, said the organization's board had authorized a court challenge to the legislation,. The federal Environmental Protection Agency also raised concerns. Jane M. Kenny, the agency's regional director, who oversaw the New Jersey state planning office when she was a cabinet member under Gov. Christie Whitman, said in a letter to Mr. McGreevey that some provisions ''could contravene a variety of federal permitting requirements, which the state is required to follow.'' 
 Environmental advocates said they knew the Highlands plan would require trade-offs but were taken by surprise when the new bill materialized within days.
 ''The only place there was going to be any debate was on the floor of the Legislature, and they cut that off, '' Ms. Goldsmith said. 
 The Senate vote was 26 to 10, with 4 abstentions. The Assembly vote was 47 to 25, with 2 abstentions. The votes did not follow party lines.

HEADLINE: On Two Continents, Companies Ask Politicians for Accounting Favors

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
JUST when the prospects for accounting reform were at their peak, the bull market came back. And with it came the power of those people who warn that bad things will happen if accountants report unpleasant truths.
 On both sides of the Atlantic, companies that do not want change in an area they deem of vital importance have been pleading with politicians to do something. In the United States, high-technology companies are campaigning against being forced to report the value of stock options as an expense. This week, the House Financial Services Committee voted, 45 to 13, to gut the proposed accounting rule. 
 Powerful senators are opposed to that, so the bill may die. But the committee vote reflects the strength of the technology lobby. Its warnings that America's growth industry could be damaged carry weight.
 In Europe, a similar options rule is sailing to approval. But European banks, primarily though not exclusively French ones, are up in arms over an international accounting rule that would force them to report just how much their investments in derivatives have gained or lost in value -- something American banks have had to do for years. Europeans often ignore such movements, although they can always sell a security to take a profit or loss and smooth the earnings flow.
 In some cases, banks even have two parts of the same institution trade with each other. One part reports a profit from the trade, while the other does not report the offsetting loss.
 The banks say they fear that their reported profits will be too volatile unless the European Commission blocks the rule. They warn that they might be forced to reduce lending just when it is most needed. 
 It had appeared that an intricate dance was going on. Frits Bolkestein, the European Union commissioner for internal markets, demanded changes to reduce the volatility stemming from the rule and to help banks explain away some of the remaining volatility. The International Accounting Standards Board complied, and endorsement was expected.
 But this week, France was joined by Italy, Spain and Belgium in opposing the rule, and Germany did not vote. That is just short of a blocking minority under E.U. rules, and passage is suddenly in doubt. If the rule is blocked, it is not clear what derivative rules, if any, will apply when Europe adopts international accounting standards next year.
 The success of the bank lobbying reflects the dominant position of the banks in financing European business. Their dire warnings command respect from politicians.
 It is time for the people who use financial statements -- the investors -- to speak up. That has happened to some extent in America, where shareholders at several technology companies have defied management and voted in favor of reporting the cost of options as an expense. 
 But in Europe, ''we hardly see users,'' said Hans van Damme, chairman of the financial reporting policy group of the European federation of accountants. Few money managers are involved in such issues, he said.
 The European decision may hinge on what Germany does. Klaus Pohle, who leads the German Accounting Standards Committee, said on Thursday that opposition from small banks led to Germany's abstention but that larger banks and industrial companies were trying to persuade them to support the rule. He said the bigger banks feared that German opposition would damage efforts to make Frankfurt a world financial center.
 The important principle is that accounting rules should be set by independent experts, not by politicians facing heavy lobbying. Investors should shudder if either lobbying campaign prevails.

HEADLINE: Pension Gap At Companies Eases Slightly

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17 

 BODY:
The underfunding of pensions at companies with severe shortfalls eased by 9 percent last year, but the gap remained much worse than five years ago, the nation's pension insurance agency said Thursday. 
 The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which insures the private pensions of about 44 million Americans, said total underfunding at companies with pension shortfalls of more than $50 million dipped to $278.6 billion in 2003, from $305.9 billion a year earlier.
 But the number was up sharply from $18.4 billion reported in 1999, before a recession and stock market declines hit many companies. 
 Big shortfalls persisted in two of the hardest-hit areas, airlines and steel, the agency said. Companies in those industries have made more than 70 percent of the claims against the agency's insurance program since it was created in 1974.
 Companies with pension underfunding of more than $50 million at the end of 2003 were required to file special reports to the agency by April 15, giving details of the shortfalls. While the reports are confidential, the agency is allowed to release the cumulative data to the public.
 Usually the agency waits months to release the data, but its new director, Brad Belt, decided to do it now, while Congress and the Bush administration are discussing possible changes in the pension system. 
 ''Workers and investors have a right to know the financial status of pension plans,'' Mr. Belt said. 
 A pension agency spokesman said it was too soon to tell whether the drop in underfunding was the start of a trend toward improvement.
 The number released on Thursday does not include all underfunding at companies with traditional pensions, because some pension plans are underfunded by less than $50 million.
 If underfunding in all companies with traditional defined-benefit pension plans were included, the total shortfall would be ''significantly higher,'' the agency said. That total was estimated at about $400 billion at the end of last year.
 Defined-benefit pension plans pay a fixed amount at retirement. Apart from the airline and steel sectors, underfunding in these plans was fairly rare in the 1990's bull market, when companies received good returns on their investments.
 But more recently low interest rates and lower returns on stocks have made underfunding more common.
 The severely underfunded pensions -- about 1,050 plans covering millions of workers and retirees -- had $641.8 billion in assets to cover $920.3 billion in liabilities, and were on average less than 70 percent funded last year, the agency said.
 Companies clamoring for help with struggling pension plans spurred Congress to endorse a temporary fix in April, approving $80 billion in relief for companies over two years by changing the way contributions to plans are calculated. The new law also included extra aid for airlines and steel companies.
 With some experts arguing that structural flaws in the pension system need to be addressed, lawmakers are also examining long-term changes.

HEADLINE: City Rent Board Approves Increases Up to 6.5 Percent

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
In a decision that satisfied neither tenants nor landlords, the New York City Rent Guidelines Board voted last night to raise rents by up to 6.5 percent on the city's one million rent stabilized apartments.
 It was the second consecutive year that the board approved increases that tenant groups warned would be unduly burdensome, but that landlord advocates called woefully insufficient to defray rising costs.
 By a 6 to 3 vote, the board authorized increases of 3 percent for one-year leases, and 6 percent for two-year leases for tenants who pay for their heat and hot water, and 3.5 percent and 6.5 percent for those who do not. That followed last year's increases of up to 7.5 percent, which were the biggest since 1989. 
 In separate votes, the board froze rents on residential hotels for one-year leases, the only kind offered. For lofts, the board approved increases of 2.5 percent for one-year leases, and 5.5 for two-year leases. For all the categories, the increases apply to leases that are renewed from Oct. 1 of this year through Sept. 30, 2005.
 In most years, there is little drama inherent in the board's final vote, because it rarely deviates from a preliminary vote a month earlier. But this year was different, because the board opted during its preliminary vote on May 10 not to offer specific recommendations, but rather a range of increases -- 3 percent to 5.5 percent for one-year leases on stabilized apartments, and 5.5 percent to 7.5 percent for two-year ones.
 The tactic was the idea of Marvin Markus, the board's chairman, and it upset many tenants as well as some landlords. But at the end of the two-and-a-half-hour session last night at Cooper Union, Mr. Markus defended the approach. 
 ''We ended up in the range and I think the process worked,'' Mr. Markus said.
 The annual vote is watched closely because of the sheer numbers of those affected, and the fact that few places around the country have anything remotely similar to the city's rent-stabilized system.
 Of the city's three million housing units, about two million are rentals. Of those, about one million are stabilized and subject to the rates set by the board. 
 Since it was established in 1968 to review rent rates annually for the city's stabilized units, the board has never authorized a rent decrease or freeze. During the high-inflation era of the late 1970's and early 80's, the board sometimes approved increases of up to 14 percent for two-year leases. But for most of the last decade, rents have gone up a few percentage points, in keeping with low inflation and, to a lesser degree, with annual surveys measuring landlord costs and incomes.
 In 2002, for instance, the board ratified increases of 2 percent for one-year leases and 4 percent for two-year leases, even though the Price Index of Operating Costs, a summary of landlord expenses like utilities and labor, dropped for the first time. Last year, the board authorized increases that were dwarfed by a 16.9 percent jump in the index, the biggest since 1980. 
 This year, landlord costs grew at a much slower pace -- 6.9 percent. Even so, landlords said they were concerned about the possible impact of the city's new lead paint law. 
 The law, which regulates the removal of lead-paint hazards, including dust, from apartments built before 1960, takes effect in August. City officials and landlord groups contended that the cost could be millions of dollars, but tenant groups said that figure was overblown.
 If nothing else, the board's annual vote can always be counted on to attract a raucous and polarized audience. Even before a proposal was made to increase rent by up to 9 percent, the crowd became so unruly, shouting ''Shame on you,'' and ''We say no,'' that Mr. Markus ordered the board to recess for several minutes.
 The 9 percent proposal failed, as did a proposal by a tenant representative to freeze rents. Then came the proposal suggested by Mr. Markus, which eventually passed. 
 Tenants said they found the increases outrageous. ''I think it's really a reflection of the people that the mayor has appointed,'' said Michael McKee, associate director of Tenants and Neighbors, a statewide advocacy group. ''They just don't get it: what real people go through to make ends meet in this city. They're conducting an auction, that's all this is.''
 Landlords were equally angry. ''It's a disgrace when the process meant to stabilize housing is turned into a political circus,'' said Andrew Hoffman, president of Community Housing Improvement Program, a landlord group. ''This is going to lead to widespread abandonment.''

HEADLINE: Saudis Debate Captive's Fate on Web

BYLINE: By NEIL MACFARQUHAR

DATELINE: CAIRO, June 17 

 BODY:
As the deadline loomed for the threatened execution of an American engineer held hostage in Saudi Arabia, with no apparent progress in freeing him, a debate swirled Thursday on Islamist Web sites about whether the killing of foreigners in the kingdom was religiously approved.
 Several efforts were made to persuade the militants to spare the life of Paul M. Johnson Jr., 49, by suggesting that Western expatriates working in Saudi Arabia had been invited and were, therefore, protected.
 But little optimism was apparent that any such proposal would work. In a videotaped threat issued Tuesday over the Internet, Mr. Johnson's kidnappers said the government had until Friday to release all imprisoned militants or they would kill him. 
 Saudi security officials announced no results from many searches around the capital, Riyadh, where Mr. Johnson, a specialist in Apache helicopters who worked for Lockheed Martin, was kidnapped Saturday. The searches seemed to be concentrated in Suweidi, a sprawling, impoverished neighborhood.
 The area is considered a militant hotbed, hometown to about 15 of the kingdom's 26 most-wanted terrorists, including Abdulaziz al-Muqrin, the self-proclaimed leader of a group called Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which claimed responsibility for the kidnapping and a string of recent violent acts. A cameraman for British Broadcasting Corporation television was shot dead and a correspondent critically wounded early this month while filming in Suweidi.
 In one unusual Web site posting, a Saudi man who wrote that he worked with the kidnap victim and had even discussed Islam with him, tried to extend a religiously inspired, traditional tribal form of protection known in Arabic as ''ijara'' that would forbid killing Mr. Johnson.
 ''I hereby declare my protection and rescue for this man along with all his colleagues who work with us in the company, who ate with us and accepted our gifts of Islamic books which they promised to read,'' wrote the man, identified as Saad al-Moemen. He also described visits by Mr. Johnson to his home and said Mr. Johnson had expressed distaste for American foreign policy.
 Saudi analysts said such protection was usually issued by respected tribal leaders or religious sheiks and there appear to be few such men whom the militants revere. A few clerics still tried, using open forums on the Internet, the medium of choice for the radicals.
 One cleric, identified as Sheik Abu Bassir, reissued a ruling saying that anyone who came to Saudi Arabia with a valid visa should be protected. He wrote that whether foreigners come ''to visit, or for tourism, or for trade, or to study, or to tutor, or for therapy, or to get married, or to hear the word of God, they should be safe and should not be terrorized, should not be assaulted.'' The exceptions, he wrote, are those who come as warriors or spies or to spread corruption, vice and drugs.
 The fatwa, or religious edict, was immediately attacked by a number of readers who said all foreigners, by definition, come to the kingdom with such bad intentions, acting as the vanguard for the American military. ''Whoever gives them security is an apostate,'' read one posting.
 Others scoffed at the idea that an official visa bestowed legitimacy on visitors. ''Who gave them the visa? It is the infidel agent regime,'' read one posting in part. ''So I tell the mujahedeen to keep killing them until the Arabian peninsula is cleared of the filth of the crusaders.''
 Still others were not quite so severe, suggesting to the militants that they try to convert Westerners to Islam rather than killing them, because that way they would be spared from going to hell, and the image of the faith around the world would not be so tainted with blood.
 Reflecting the differences that are rife in the interpretation of Islam, one religious sheik, identified as Abdel Rahman bin Saleh al-Mahmoud, said that Muhammad's followers had commanded that all nonbelievers be expelled from the Arabian peninsula. But it has never been clear, he wrote, whether that includes just the holy city of Mecca or some larger area. Foreigners visited at the time of the prophet, he noted; it was just the idea of permanent communities that was abhorrent.
 One Saudi lawyer prominent in religious affairs said that the religious establishment was preparing to launch a campaign to explain that non-Muslim visitors are permitted. The stated aim of the militants is to undermine the ruling House of Saud by driving from the kingdom millions of expatriates who help keep the economy afloat, especially tens of thousands of Western technicians.
 ''We want to make clear that anyone who comes to the country to live is different from someone coming to invade,'' said Muhsin Awaji, the Saudi lawyer. He said he doubted that any such campaign would change the minds of the militants, and would certainly be too late for Mr. Johnson.
 ''Those very dangerous leaders may not be influenced by anyone from outside,'' Mr. Awaji said. ''But the others, those sympathetic to them, could be prevented from being recruited for their side.''

HEADLINE: A Pool and a Lighthouse? No, a Toll Plaza

BYLINE: By PHIL PATTON

 BODY:
AT the beginning of each episode of HBO's hit television series ''The Sopranos,'' Tony Soprano drives to his home in New Jersey through tollbooths onto the New Jersey Turnpike, passing the rusty viaducts and grim industrial areas that have long made the name Garden State seem ironic. They have also firmly fixed the state's place in the landscape of the national imagination.
 But starting this summer, if the authorities who run the turnpike have their way, that image will change. At the end of this month, traffic will start flowing through a gleaming new $45 million glass and steel toll plaza at Exit 1, the southern end of the turnpike, near Carneys Point, N.J. The building, which spans two dozen lanes of traffic on the main highway route connecting Maine and Florida, is made up of steel trusses and greenish blue glass punctuated by a dramatic curving building. At its center is an 81-foot tower reminiscent of a lighthouse and meant to evoke the Jersey Shore and tourist destinations. 
 And while many of the 50,000 people who drive through the new toll plaza each day might be forgiven for thinking of it more as a source of traffic backups or an irritating delay on the way to a vacation, its chief designer, Zorab Vosganian, has a loftier view. ''It's the new gateway to New Jersey,'' said Mr. Vosganian, an engineer and architect. ''It will change people's impression of New Jersey.''
 Opened in 1951, the New Jersey Turnpike now takes in $440 million a year. There was a time not so long ago when it seemed like the road's tollbooths might be removed. In the 1980's, both Connecticut and New York eliminated at least some toll plazas, and in New Jersey's 2001 gubernatorial campaign, Bret D. Schundler, the Republican nominee, proposed removing tolls immediately. The Democratic nominee, James E. McGreevy, who is now governor, argued for gradual removal. But the tide has turned, both in New Jersey and across the country. More drivers heading to the roads this summer will be taking toll roads, including one in Texas named after George H. W. Bush.
 The growth in tolls is due, in part, to public resistance to increases in gasoline taxes, which have traditionally paid for highway construction and repairs. Automated toll collection systems like E-ZPass, used in seven Eastern states, have also made it faster and cheaper to collect tolls.
 Electronic toll taking makes it relatively easy to change toll pricing -- perhaps raising fees at peak-traffic times and locations or having drivers pay more for low-congestion ''fee ways.'' In traffic-bound areas like Orange County, Calif., HOT (high occupancy toll) lanes are replacing H.O.V. (high occupancy vehicle) lanes. Drivers who choose the HOT lane pay for the privilege at a toll plaza, while those in the more congested lanes drive free.
 When design work started on Carneys Point in 1992, ''the original plan called for enough capacity to handle the busiest time of the year -- Thanksgiving,'' said Dennis Conklin, an engineer at Louis Berger Associates, the project's prime contractor. Among the firm's other projects are the Trans-Amazon highway and the recently built road from Kabul to Kandahar across Afghanistan. Partly because of changing technology, from human toll takers to E-ZPass to high-speed E-ZPass, the project's design changed repeatedly over a decade. There will be two express E-ZPass lanes in each direction, five northbound ticket lanes and 14 southbound toll lanes.
 Mr. Vosganian worked with Ecoplan, an Englewood Cliffs, N.J., architectural firm, in designing the Carneys Point building. Mr. Vosganian and Martin Santini, Ecoplan's chief executive, worked out the lighthouse idea. With the gleaming glass and steel high-tech look of the toll facility, Mr. Santini said, ''we wanted to emphasize the change in New Jersey from the old manufacturing economy to the high-technology one.''
 T HE plaza is also something of a Toll Mahal for toll takers, who will walk across glass bridges to their stations and descend individual elevators to their booths. (At most other toll plazas, toll takers walk underground. ''It's often dark and damp,'' Mr. Santini said. ) The supervisor's curving office, Mr. Vosganian added, is shaped to provide views both north and south; it will function much as an airport control tower or a stationmaster's tower in a railroad yard. 
 But the signature feature of the building is the tower at its center. Although landlocked, the light house is surrounded now by the flow of traffic and soon also by water in a pool at its base. At night, lights sweep across the tower and plaza, suggesting to some the searchlights of a prison escape movie.
 Not so, says Mr. Vosganian, who likes the play of light on the tower. ''It's gorgeous at night. There are indentations in it so the light ripples and shifts.''
 The Vosganian firm also designed the new booths at exit 18W near the Meadowlands. ''They are the northern gateway,'' he said. ''There's a skylight with a computerized system of light in 156 possible colors.'' The lights can be customized like those at the top of the Empire State Building. 
 To reach the new toll plaza, northbound drivers still have to pass over the soaring Delaware Memorial Bridge, from which they get a glimpse of an incinerator-like facility to the right and a DuPont processing plant to the left -- cliched images of industrial New Jersey. The new plaza ''will definitely change people's impression of New Jersey,'' Mr. Conklin said. But, ''they will have a better impression if they don't have to wait a long time at the toll.''

HEADLINE: UNION PACIFIC IS PLANNING TO HIRE 5,000 WORKERS

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The Union Pacific Corporation, the railroad operator, intends to hire 5,000 train crew workers -- 800 more than its earlier plan -- to help end delays that forced the company to turn away shipments and reduced profit. Richard Davidson, the chief executive, announced the increased hiring at a transportation conference in New York. The crew shortage led to delays after business unexpectedly surged in late 2003 as the economy strengthened. The company, based in Omaha, said last week that second-quarter profit would fall to as little as 60 cents a share from $1.10 a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Archer Daniels Settles Suit Accusing It of Price Fixing

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Closing a final chapter on a nine-year scandal, the Archer Daniels Midland Company said last night that it had agreed to pay $400 million to settle a civil class-action lawsuit accusing the company of fixing prices in the huge market for corn sweeteners.
 The settlement, which was filed in Federal District Court in Illinois late yesterday, is one of the largest ever by a single defendant in an antitrust suit. The money will go to an array of corporate purchasers of the sweetener known as high-fructose corn syrup, including soft drink giants like the Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo.
 The $400 million will be the largest payment from Archer Daniels in any individual case since the company was first rocked by a price-fixing scandal in 1995, with the disclosure that a senior executive had been recording illegal antitrust conspiracies while working as a cooperating witness for the government. The settlement is subject to court approval, the company said. 
 Archer Daniels, based in Decatur, Ill., has already pleaded guilty in a criminal case to fixing prices with competitors in the markets for lysine, a feed additive, and for citric acid, an additive used in numerous consumer products. But the total settlement in the criminal case reached $100 million, a record at the time for an antitrust case but just a quarter of what the company has now agreed to pay to resolve the lawsuits related to the much larger fructose market.
 A spokesman for Archer Daniels did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
 In recent decades, high-fructose corn syrup has become the sweetener of choice for most consumer packaged goods, supplanting even the use of granulated sugar from cane. The market for the syrup, which is turning up as a prime ingredient in breakfast cereals, soft drinks and snacks, has become huge, totaling hundreds of billions of dollars. 
 The size of the market alone has always made the fructose lawsuit the most potentially damaging of all those faced by Archer Daniels. Economists working for the plaintiffs estimated in court papers that the company's total liability could approach $5 billion. 
 The fructose case has followed a tortuous path over its many years. For some time, it seemed on the verge of collapse, only to be revived by a critical legal ruling issued last year by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. That ruling, coupled with breakdowns in the relationship between Archer Daniels and Michael D. Andreas, its former vice chairman who served a prison term for price fixing in the lysine market, greatly increased the probability that the company would lose the case in a trial, people involved in the case said. 
 Settlement negotiations were said to have begun in earnest in mid-May, with a direct presentation to the plaintiffs' lawyers by G. Allen Andreas, the chief executive of Archer Daniels, who is a cousin of Michael Andreas. 
 Those meetings, held in Washington, were also attended by two senior members of the Archer Daniels board: Brian Mulroney, the former prime minister of Canada, and O. Glenn Webb, the former president of Growmark, an agricultural cooperative. 
 At first, people involved in the case said, the two sides were far apart, with the plaintiffs seeking a $650 million settlement. Over the course of four weeks, they agreed to the $400 million payment. Under the deal, the money will be delivered to the plaintiffs in one lump sum, three weeks after the deal's effective date.
 The fructose case was an outgrowth of the cooperation provided by Mark E. Whitacre, the former head of the Archer Daniels bioproducts division, which made lysine. In the fall of 1992, Mr. Whitacre informed an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation that Archer Daniels was working with competitors to rig the markets for a number of the commodities it sold. He informed the agent, Brian Shepard, that he had personal knowledge of the schemes because he was participating in the price fixing in the lysine market.
 In one of the most involved corporate investigations in history, Mr. Whitacre proceeded to work with the F.B.I. for two years as a cooperating witness, wearing tape recorders on his body and carrying them in his briefcase as he traveled the world, meeting with his competitors in the lysine market. The tape recordings captured both Michael Andreas and Terrance S. Wilson, the head of the corn processing division at the time, actively participating in the price-fixing meetings.
 The investigation came into public view in June 1995, when F.B.I. agents raided the company and descended on the homes of Archer Daniels executives. Rapidly, accusations emerged of the participation by Archer Daniels in antitrust schemes in other markets, including those for citric acid, fructose corn syrup and monosodium glutamate, a food additive. Lawsuits were filed by purchasers of each product line.
 The lysine case became troubled when it emerged that Mr. Whitacre, during the time he had been working with the F.B.I., had simultaneously been embezzling millions of dollars from Archer Daniels and shifting the money into offshore accounts. He was eventually charged with fraud. Because he had violated his cooperation agreement, he was tried for price fixing along with Michael Andreas and Mr. Wilson, who has since left the company. All three men were convicted. 
 Despite the strength of the evidence in the lysine case and the eventual admission by Archer Daniels that it had rigged citric acid prices, the fructose case struggled along. Mr. Whitacre had no role in that marketplace, and his tapes had little in the way of direct evidence that price fixing had taken place with fructose corn syrup.
 In August 2001, Judge Michael M. Mihm of Federal District Court for the Central District of Illinois threw out the lawsuit, ruling that the plaintiffs had no direct evidence of a conspiracy. The appeals court reversed that ruling last year, saying the evidence, while not direct, was ''highly suggestive'' that an illegal conspiracy existed in the market before 1995.
 From there, two critical rulings propelled the case toward settlement. The court held that the tapes of the lysine conspiracy could be admitted as evidence in the fructose case, proving that Archer Daniels executives were willing to engage in the types of wrongdoing described in the class-action suit. 
 The most critical remaining evidence would be the testimony of Michael Andreas, who as vice chairman and onetime heir apparent at the company would most likely have known about or participated in any fructose scheme, particularly given his involvement in the lysine conspiracy. 
 Having finished his prison sentence on the lysine case, Michael Andreas refused to cooperate with the company. Archer Daniels subpoenaed him, demanding that the court compel his testimony. But he successfully argued that he still faced liability from testifying, and the court quashed the subpoena.
 If Michael Andreas were to testify at a trial -- and the plaintiffs were sure to call him -- he would be allowed to invoke his right against self-incrimination. Such a refusal to testify would almost certainly be damaging to the argument of Archer Daniels that nothing improper took place in the fructose market, especially in light of the recorded evidence in the lysine case.
 Archer Daniels then started its effort to settle. 
 Archer Daniels is the fourth company to settle the claims in the fructose case. CPC International agreed to pay $7 million to resolve the lawsuit in 1996. Earlier this year, Cargill Inc. and American Maize Products agreed to pay a combined $24 million.
 With the Archer Daniels settlement, the A.E. Staley Manufacturing Company is the sole remaining corporate defendant. A trial is scheduled to begin in September.

HEADLINE: That Invisible Hand Guides the Game Of Ticket Hunting

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
What price Madonna? Well, for me, $139.95. That was for two tickets for Wednesday's show at Madison Square Garden, Section 336, Row H. The tickets, with a face value of $94.50, cost me $59 each. Shipping via FedEx added $9.95. And finally, I paid $11.80, or 10 percent of the price for my two tickets, to an outfit called StubHub.
 To anyone surfing the Web, StubHub.com looks like a ticket brokerage. It's not. The company, founded four years ago by a couple of Stanford Business School students, is a kind of stock market where the only shares traded are tickets to live events: baseball games, Broadway musicals, pop concerts, tapings of television shows, movie premieres, you name it. You can even find lecture tickets. One of the hot tickets on StubHub last month, priced at $350 for two, was to see Oprah Winfrey speak at the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City. Somebody snapped them up. 
 StubHub, which sells tickets to events all over the United States, does not buy tickets. Instead, it creates a regulated arena in which people who have bought tickets can sell them, and people looking for tickets can buy them, knowing that the tickets are genuine and that StubHub backs them with a guarantee. Some sellers are professional brokers who use StubHub as their place of business. Most are ordinary citizens, usually season ticketholders who want to get cash back for the events they can't attend, or who want to make a nice profit on tickets to high-demand events. Like the auction houses, StubHub makes its money by taking a cut from buyers and sellers, collecting 15 percent of the purchase price of the ticket from the seller and 10 percent from the buyer.
 In principle this business model is as straightforward as Adam Smith. Buyers and sellers mingle in the marketplace and, through free negotiation, arrive at a price that reflects the true value of a commodity. StubHub simply acts as a referee, making sure no one hits below the belt, and collects a commission for its trouble.
 To test the system I started with the New York Yankees. A series with the Seattle Mariners was coming up, just before the Yankees left town for a long road trip. Good tickets would be scarce. Sure enough, when I searched the Yankees' Web site, I found slim pickings for the Saturday afternoon game on May 15. There were a few $18 seats in the last couple of rows, a mile up in the nosebleed sections. No good. This was a half-step removed from watching the game on television in the stadium parking lot.
 I went to StubHub. Lots of tickets there, many priced stratospherically. A seat at field level on the right-field line, just past first base, was $310. Farther out, about halfway to the warning track, a seat just one section back was $185, a tidy profit on a ticket that sells at the box office for $50 in advance or $55 on game day. Those seats, though, had long since been snapped up.
 I settled on two Main Box seats in Section 313, Row G. They were in the right-field corner, just one section above field level. The price was $35 each, or face price for a season ticketholder. This was tremendous value for a sold-out game. I registered with StubHub, creating a user name and password, ordered the tickets, then sealed the deal by providing my credit card number. An e-mail message arrived soon after, confirming the order and informing me that StubHub was contacting the seller to arrange for shipment. My card would not be charged until the seller had confirmed to StubHub the time and method of delivery. A second e-mail message arrived a day later giving the delivery details. The tickets arrived on the Thursday before the game, and the seller was paid by StubHub on confirmation of delivery. On Saturday, under a clear, sunny sky, the Yankees were sending a steady stream of screaming line drives into the right-field corner.
 Eric Baker created the company with Jeff Fluhr as a class project. Both men had worked as investment bankers, and they saw opportunity lurking in the chaotic, highly irrational world of ticket scalping.
 The market, in business-speak, lacked liquidity. It was highly fragmented. Buyers and sellers had a hard time finding each other. Information was scarce, fraud was rampant and pricing was distorted. Two buyers sitting side by side at a basketball playoff might have paid wildly different prices for what was, essentially, the same product.
 StubHub was created, Mr. Baker said, ''to bring together buyers and sellers, and allow people to compare prices and seat locations.'' In other words, to make the market liquid, hence the company's original name, Liquid Seats. Its prime target was the underexploited assets of season ticketholders.
 ''If you have season tickets to the Yankees, that's 81 games,'' Mr. Baker said. ''Unless you're unemployed or especially passionate, there's no way you're going to attend every game.'' StubHub gives ticketholders a way to recoup some of their season's investment. This makes sports franchises happy for several reasons. It encourages season ticketholders to buy season tickets again, and it puts warm bodies in empty seats, where they can buy hot dogs, souvenir caps and programs. The teams also receive a percentage of the resale profits, usually 10 percent. So far, StubHub has signed agreements with nine professional teams in North America, and each team's Web site encourages season ticketholders to sell their extras through StubHub. Ticketmaster, eyeing StubHub's sports profits, recently jumped into the secondary market, signing similar deals with 20 professional teams. 
 StubHub also separated itself from the herd by offering a guarantee. Buyers will receive either the tickets they order or comparable tickets purchased by the company, which insists that it has ways to get its hands on tickets even for sold-out events. In theory, StubHub knows only what its sellers tell it -- that is, that a package has been sent out on this date, with this tracking number. Mr. Baker uses toilet paper to outline the worst-case picture. ''If you open the package and it contains two squares of toilet paper instead of the tickets,'' he said, ''then we debit the seller's credit card for the amount of the purchase.'' By contrast, eBay bows out once buyer and seller have struck a deal. It does not monitor the shipment of purchased items. The eBay system is largely self-policing, with buyers and sellers rating each other's trustworthiness.
 When it comes to antiscalping laws, eBay does more enforcing than StubHub. It automatically refuses a bid that exceeds the legal markup for a resold ticket in the buyer's state, while StubHub relies on the seller to stay within the law.
 From sports, StubHub expanded into other live entertainment events. It also spiced up the formula by approaching individual artists, like Britney Spears, Jewel and Christina Aguilera, and persuading them to put V.I.P. concert tickets on StubHub. Proceeds from the ticket sales go to the artist's favorite charity, and fans with deep pockets buy packages that can include backstage passes, admission to after-concert parties or, in rare cases, a meeting with the artist.
 When I began browsing the StubHub site, I gasped at the V.I.P. prices for the Madonna tour. Who on earth would shell out $1,000 or more for the privilege of seeing Madonna surrounded by a scrum of bodyguards? Well, lots of people. Those tickets quickly disappeared. So did all the $49.50 general-admission tickets being sold through the box office. That left Madonna fans looking for the best tickets at the lowest prices they could find, but now, like airline travelers logging onto Travelocity, Orbitz and Expedia, they could comparison shop. My $59 Madonna tickets, for example, had a face value of $94.50 each. 
 I did a lot of browsing, comparing prices on StubHub with eBay and assorted ticket brokers. For Madonna on Wednesday, StubHub offered tickets in Section 305 for $54. Tickets in the same section, high up and in the middle of right field, so to speak, were being offered on eBay, by a broker, at a starting bid of $150 each. Buyers could skip the bidding process and buy them outright for $399 apiece.
 But eBay also had bargains. A ticket in Section 329, high up and just behind stage left, opened at $20, attracted 17 bids and sold at $45, or just under the general-admission price. Prices on StubHub vary, too. Two tickets in Section 336, Row H, were offered at $59. Two tickets in Row L of the same section were $101. Several online brokers were offering tickets in Section 336 for about $150, a price that had dropped, by press time, to face value. As the concert approached, Ticketmaster also began selling the $49.50 tickets again. Like commodities traders, buyers can bet that an event will sell fewer tickets than predicted, and wait for falling prices to deliver a bargain.
 Once I had the hang of StubHub I succumbed to day-trader syndrome. I began searching the site neurotically, comparison shopping for events that I had no intention of attending. Ms. Winfrey fascinated me; tickets to her speaking engagement, with a face value of $45, sold for about $180 on eBay and $315 on StubHub. A mere trifle. Hot playoff tickets can command prices in the thousands. And when StubHub auctioned tickets to the live finale of the reality show ''Survivor: All-Stars'' on CBS, two tickets sold for $3,300. Like too many other people, I wanted to see Smarty Jones race for the Triple Crown at Belmont Park. A really good ticket, right at the finish line, sold on eBay for $1,025. Anything remotely near the finish line would have set me back at least $500 on StubHub.
 In the New York metropolitan area, the main event categories on StubHub are sports, theater, music and comedy. At the moment, television boils down to one show, ''The Daily Show,'' with ticket proceeds benefiting the Museum of Television and Radio. A category called Family Tickets is also represented by just one event this week, ''Dragon Tales,'' at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y.
 Classical music lovers will look in vain for tickets; StubHub has nothing for them, although that may change in the next year or so. StubHub establishes categories when enough ticketholders express a desire to sell. That has not yet happened for classical music in New York, or anywhere else, as far as I can tell. The Metropolitan Opera alone should be able to support a booming market. Let's get some liquidity going.
 Sometimes, not even StubHub can help. At press time, it had no tickets for Saturday matinee performances of ''Avenue Q'' through Sept. 4. But I found a secret source with a few tickets to spare. Don't tell anyone. It's called the box office.

United Is Denied Request For Loan Guarantees
A federal loan board rejected United Airlines' application for $1.6 billion in federal loan guarantees, saying that it thought the airline could survive on its own without government help.
 United, the nation's second-largest airline, has kept operating normally in bankruptcy, and the decision was not expected to have any immediate effect on travelers or the airline's employees. But its plans for emerging from bankruptcy depended heavily on winning the loan guarantees, and the board's decision was a serious setback. [Page A1.]

Atmos Energy said that it had agreed to acquire the natural gas operations of TXU for $1.93 billion. The deal would create one of the nation's largest distributors of natural gas. The purchase would substantially enlarge Atmos's business in Texas, giving it control of 6,800 miles of transmission pipelines in the state and many new customers in north Texas. Both companies are based in Dallas. [C5.]

Pension Gap Eases Somewhat
Underfunding of pensions at companies with severe shortfalls eased by 9 percent last year, but the gap remained much worse than five years ago, the nation's pension insurance agency said. [C3.]

Rigas Lawyer Cites Flawed Case
John J. Rigas, the founder of Adelphia Communications, fell victim to a ''rush to judgment'' by federal prosecutors who have failed to prove their fraud case against him, his lawyer said in closing arguments. [C5.]

Putin Says Russia Will Aid Yukos
A day before an expected court ruling that could cost the Russian oil giant Yukos billions of dollars in back taxes, President Vladimir V. Putin said his government would do its best to assure that the company would not go bankrupt. ''Russian authorities, the government, and the economic officials of our country are not interested in seeing Yukos go bankrupt,'' Mr. Putin told reporters. ''The government will try to do everything not to topple this company,'' he said. [World Business, Section W.]

HEADLINE: Bush Spends A Long Day (And Night) On the Trail

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: TACOMA, Wash., June 17 

 BODY:
President Bush swooped into Spokane on Thursday night to raise $750,000 for Representative George Nethercutt, the Republican who is challenging Senator Patty Murray for a seat in a politically competitive state important to Mr. Bush's re-election chances in November.
 Mr. Bush's two-hour stop came after he spent a fractious day on the other side of the country in Washington, D.C., focused on the commission investigating the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the intense arguments over ties between Iraq and Al Qaeda. The president's four-and-a-half-hour flight here, for events that did not end until after midnight East Coast time, showed how much effort the White House is devoting to his re-election campaign in the middle of the persistent debate about national security. 
 ''The right person to represent the state of Washington in the United States Senate is George Nethercutt,'' Mr. Bush told more than 600 people at the Spokane Center complex, who had spent $1,000 each to attend, adding that they should work hard to get people to the polls.
 ''While you're getting them to vote for George, why don't you get them to vote for me as well,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Both of us are going to carry this state. And we're going to because we've got optimistic plans to make this country safer, stronger and better.''
 Optimism was Mr. Bush's other message in a speech he delivered to a business group in Washington earlier in the day promoting recent improvements in the economy and castigating, although not by name, Senator John Kerry.
 ''There are modern-day economic pessimists who are quick to offer dire predictions and complaints,'' Mr. Bush told the National Federation of Independent Businesses at the JW Marriott Hotel. ''But you know what? They do not offer pro-growth economic policies.'' 
 Such people, the president added, ''can find the dark cloud, but they can't see the sunshine, and they don't know where to take the country and they don't know where to lead.''
 Mr. Kerry, the all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee, is in the middle of a two-week campaign attacking Mr. Bush's economic record, which his advisers say should be judged on the president's entire term in office, not the turnaround of recent months. In Ohio and New Jersey on Tuesday, Mr. Kerry told audiences that the Bush White House has been willing to settle for policies that leave the middle class saddled with endless debt and rising health care costs and tuition.
 Phil Singer, a Kerry campaign spokesman, responded to Mr. Bush's speech in Washington by saying, ''It's ironic that a president who has overseen record deficits and the biggest increase in spending since World War II is criticizing a candidate who plans to cut the deficit in half and restore fiscal discipline.''
 In Spokane, Mr. Bush gave his standard endorsement speech for Mr. Nethercutt, and said as he almost always does for every other male candidate that he and the congressman had married above themselves. ''The good news for me is that Laura hasn't run me off yet,'' Mr. Bush said.
 Mr. Bush included in his speech a lengthy quotation from a 1946 New York Times article describing the occupation of postwar Germany, some two years before the Marshall Plan began pouring billions of dollars into what became a successful reconstruction.
 ''In every military headquarters, one meets alarmed officials doing their best to deal with the consequences of an occupation policy that they admit has failed,'' Mr. Bush read aloud from the article.
 The lesson for Iraq, he said, was optimism.
 ''Fortunately, my predecessors were not pessimistic people,'' Mr. Bush said, adding that ''someday an American president will be sitting discussing world peace with a duly elected leader from Iraq.''
 On Friday, Mr. Bush is to appear at stops in Fort Lewis, Wash., and Reno, Nev., Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who ran a bitter race against Mr. Bush in the 2000 presidential primaries.
