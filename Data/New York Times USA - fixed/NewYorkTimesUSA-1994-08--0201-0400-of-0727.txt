HEADLINE: The Call of the Lox and Due Process at Zabar's;
A Salmon Slicer Claims Discrimination; Her Employers See Only Mangled Fish

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN 

 BODY:
This is a tale of art and commerce, of sex discrimination and smoked fish, of due process and Zabar's.
On one side is a determined young woman seeking justice because her salmon-slicing skills, she believes, have been cruelly impugned. On the other is her employer, an exacting man who believes that anyone who mangles a nice piece of fish should not be paid the same as more seasoned counterparts -- regardless of whether they all happen to be men. 
 And making the determination last week whether Murray Klein dismissed Eleanor Wolper or whether she quit her job was Judge Dennis Aloysius Dooley, who is singularly qualified to know a fish story when he hears one.
To generations of slicers and buyers, an elegant sliver of fish is art on a waxed paper canvas. It's a stressful situation: in the demanding world of deli galleries, everyone's a critic. As Milton Bauman of Murray's Sturgeon Shop put it, "This particular store is very particular."
The artist, however, is almost never a woman. Murray Klein, 71, a co-owner of Zabar's, on Broadway and West 80th Street, acknowledged this situation, but said that he was not to blame. "Women are sensitive about the smell of fish," he said. "Men aren't. Women don't like the stink on their clothes."
Ms. Wolper, an earnest but easily flustered woman of 27, does not fit the image of a barrier breaker. Her peripatetic resume reflects both the volatility of the food-service industry and her restless search for the perfect job.
But she has the fever. Raised on the Lower East Side, she would often travel to Zabar's to watch the salmon slicers.
"I have an affinity for cutting salmon," she said wistfully as she waited last week for her case to be called. "I get chills thinking about it -- it's so beautiful to watch. And Zabar's was always the best." As she lifted her wrist to slice air salmon, she launched into the relative merits of Norwegian versus Scotch.
Last August Ms. Wolper passed Mr. Klein's do-or-die test -- a shift behind the counter on a typical wild-eyed Saturday. Soon she became something of a novelty herself at Zabar's. She was featured in several publications and developed her own coterie of regulars, some of whom, said one counterman, still ask about her, though she left in April. Sam Cohen, 79, the Dean of Slicers who has been behind the counter for 43 years, said Ms. Wolper worked out just fine.
Tourists would photograph her. One, noting that she was unusual for a slicer not only because she was a woman but because she was left-handed, described her technique as "French style."
Even Mr. Klein said that for a beginner, Ms. Wolper was pretty good. The customers benefited, he said, because "she wasn't as rude as the men."
But Mr. Klein and Ms. Wolper disagree about just how stylish a slicer she was. Once Mr. Klein scooped up a discarded salmon skin from a bucket, yelling at her because there was too much flesh left. She had been, in the vernacular, hacking up the fish.
"I said it wasn't my skin!" said Ms. Wolper, her cheeks flushing. "He told me to calm down."
Mr. Klein, a co-owner of Zabar's for more than 30 years, is so obsessed with the place that he cannot understand why Ms. Wolper would quit her exalted post. But quit, he said, is what she did.
Ms. Wolper has two actions against Zabar's. After, as she says, Mr. Klein dismissed her because she wasted too much fish and wanted too big a raise, she filed a claim of discrimination with the New York State Division of Human Rights. In it, she said she had been grossly underpaid: that even after she got a 50-cent raise to $8.50 an hour, her colleagues, all men, were earning up to $22 an hour. (A counterman says $22 includes overtime.) That investigation is pending.
After she left, she collected unemployment benefits. In June, the state Labor Department cut them off because Zabar's reported that she had left her job voluntarily. If she could not prove otherwise, she might have to return the $1,980 she had received. A hearing on that decision was held one afternoon last week at the department's Brooklyn office before Mr. Dooley, an administrative law judge.
Mr. Klein and his lawyer, Eugene G. Eisner, showed up to challenge her appeal.
A clerk yelled out: "Eleanor Wolper versus Zabras!"
Mr. Klein looked aghast. "He doesn't know from Zabar's?" he muttered to Mr. Eisner. "Oy! We're in bad shape."
In a hearing room so small it could barely accommodate the judge's desk and a table, Mr. Klein and Mr. Eisner sat across from Ms. Wolper, who could not afford a lawyer, but did bring her mother, Marjorie, a forceful woman who was very angry with Mr. Klein.
Ms. Wolper testified that last fall she asked for a $6 raise to $14 an hour -- "it was supposed to be a bargaining position," she whispered. By January, a manager promised he would intercede on her behalf. On Friday, April Fool's Day, the new rate finally came through: 50 cents more an hour. Her mother told her to march back into Zabar's and talk to Mr. Klein.
"I lose money on you," Ms. Wolper testified that Mr. Klein yelled. "You hack up the fish. Get out of my store."
Mr. Klein told a different story. He said the argument occurred on April 2, and so she must have quit, because he would never dismiss someone on a Saturday. "It's our busiest day," he testified. "I only fire people after the weekend." Ms. Wolper resigned in a rage over her salary, he said, leaving him perilously short-handed.
As these things go, the hearing was unusually probing. Mr. Eisner demanded the identity of the manager. Ms. Wolper refused, saying she feared he would be punished. He cross-examined her narrowly: about her past experience at Balducci's, about when she applied for and canceled her health insurance.
Mr. Eisner kept producing documents that he argued should be admitted into evidence because of their relevance to Ms. Wolper's state of mind and credibility. "I loved my job!" Ms. Wolper stammered, her eyes filling with tears.
Judge Dooley handed Ms. Wolper some napkins. Neatly trimming away the excess issues, the judge announced that the dispute came down to this: he said, she said.
Within the month he would issue his decision, he said, based on an evaluation of each party's demeanor and testimony. The disappointed party had the right to appeal.
Ms. Wolper and her mother, looking shellshocked, left quickly. Mr. Klein, looking equally perturbed, lingered.
"You haven't been to my store?" he said to the judge in a wheedling tone. "There is one God and one Zabar's!"
Mr. Eisner, alarmed, started tugging on his client's elbow.
Judge Dooley fixed Mr. Klein with a cool stare. "You can't fool me, Mr. Klein," he said. "When I was a boy I was a lox slicer at Pincus Appetizing in Long Beach, L.I. The owners used to say, 'He's one of the goyim and he knows how to cut salmon like that?' "
The legal slicer leaned across his desk. "I never hacked up a salmon in my life," he said.

HEADLINE: Louis H. Bean, 98, Analyst Best Known For 1948 Prediction

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Louis H. Bean, who was an Agriculture Department economist when he became nationally known for a book that predicted Harry S. Truman's surprise victory in the 1948 Presidential election, died on Friday at his home in Arlington, Va. He was 98.
The cause was congestive heart failure, said his daughter, Elizabeth Fountain. 
 Mr. Bean, who had a master's degree in business administration from Harvard University, was an economic and political analyst over the years. He was a Government official from 1923 to 1953, mostly in the Agriculture Department. Later he was a private consultant for various clients until he was in his mid-80's. He also wrote on a variety of subjects.
He was an aide to the Secretary of Agriculture and did his political prognosticating in his spare time when his book "How to Predict Elections" came out in 1948. In that work, which is still in print, from Greenwood Press, he correctly forecast that voters would return Truman, who was generally seen as the underdog, to the White House. He also forecast the victory of the Democratic Party, which regained control of Congress at the same time.
Years later, no less an authority than Truman himself wrote, "Only Louis Bean, an economist of the Department of Agriculture, and a few others forecast any chance of a Democratic victory."
In 1948, Mr. Bean called his predicting technique the Bean Poll. It was described at the time as a complicated method of analyzing various sets of statistics, including characteristics of groups of voters and long-term voting trends. He kept on predicting election returns in the 1950's and 1960's, with a high degree of success.
Mr. Bean was born in Russia, came to the United States in 1906 and earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Rochester. He married Dorothy May Wile in 1923; she died in 1991.
In addition to his daughter, of Montross, Va., he is survived by a son, David, of London; a sister, Sarah Kizell of North Miami Beach, Fla.; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: A Life of Its Own

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Thirteen years ago, the plan to redevelop Times Square with four huge office towers was hatched as a grand design for urban renewal, something as ambitious as the United Nations or Lincoln Center, something that would bring civility and commerce to what had become a national icon of sleaziness and blight.
Since then, a building boom has gone bust, a torrent of lawsuits has derailed other large projects, and many of New York City's biggest development dreams have been scrapped. Mortimer B. Zuckerman's Columbus Circle project unraveled last month. And the 20-year-old effort to replace the West Side Highway was scaled back further last week to a plan for a riverfront boulevard. 
 But the Times Square project refuses to die. An agreement announced last week by the city, the state and Times Square developers makes it all the more likely that the four office towers will eventually be built on the same scale as was envisioned during the halcyon boom of the last decade.
Why the project survives as others have failed can be boiled down mainly to money. Too much has been invested to turn back.
 
The Risky Aspect
 Yet it also lives on courtesy of government sponsorship and tax breaks, and as such provides a case study of the risks a government takes when it commits its resources in a highly speculative real-estate market.
Even as the developers move ahead with the interim step of refurbishing the area's vacant storefronts, some New Yorkers, including people who supported the plan in the early 1980's, are questioning the need for office towers supported by huge tax breaks -- particularly on a block that seems to be springing to life on its own.
"There is a real renaissance, and shouldn't we be going with the flow?" said Michael T. Cohen, whose professional interests as president of the Williams Real Estate Company, a commercial brokerage in Manhattan, do not usually lead him to oppose new office buildings. "Times Square has already rediscovered itself as a mecca for tourism and entertainment."
Even William J. Stern, who a decade ago headed the state's Urban Development Corporation, the lead government agency in the project, has questions. "I don't think the government belongs in the business of developing office buildings," he said. "There may not be a way out of it, but we really ought to take another look at this project."
To be sure, such complaints are based on hindsight, looking back through a decade when New York City, and more particularly Times Square, were awash in economic changes that could not have been anticipated when the project was launched.
"You can't count the benefits to taxpayers," said Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Development Project, an arm of the Urban Development Corporation.
Clear progress has been made toward two of the project's chief goals: reducing crime and shutting down pornography businesses that pervaded 42d Street. Pedestrians now confront a block that is decidedly less sinister, but eerily abandoned.
There are other signs of movement. The Walt Disney Company, for instance, has obtained an option to renovate the New Amsterdam Theater on 42d Street, and has joined a large New York City developer in a bid to build a new hotel at 42d Street and Eighth Avenue.
Officials say the improvements would not have been possible without the Times Square project, because it has provided money to condemn property.
"Does anybody think a private developer would have assembled 30 parcels on this site?" said Ms. Robertson, who reacted angrily to a recent report by the Municipal Art Society that the tax breaks pledged to George Klein and the Prudential Insurance Company of America, the developers, would amount to $1.5 billion to $4.2 billion after their towers are complete.
The tax breaks were intended to compensate the developers for the money it provided to the state to finance the condemnation process -- about $270 million so far.
The art society, which supported the Times Square plan in the 1980's, said the city and the state should now pay the developers back the money. If they still want to build their towers, the group said, no tax breaks should be offered.
But there appeared little chance last week that the city, the state or the Times Square developers would let their project unravel. After spending $270 million, Prudential and Mr. Klein will now be spending $22 million more as a result of last week's agreement.
That money will be used to fix up existing buildings, allowing stores and restaurants to move in.
It is the huge amount of money already invested that has given the project a life of its own. When the project was begun in 1981, city and state officials employed an urban renewal strategy that had been used in the construction of Lincoln Center, the United Nations and the World Trade Center. Because the buildings along 42d Street were owned by many landlords, and no private developer could be expected to buy them all out, the state would use its powers to condemn them.
But unlike other projects, where the city and the state raised the money for condemnation on their own, the Times Square project had a hitch that reflected the high finance of the 1980's. The money for condemnation would be paid by the developers, without any direct investment by the public, and the developers would be paid back through long-term tax breaks.
In 1981, that seemed to make sense, particularly because the price of condemnation was not expected to exceed $80 million. If the developers paid that much for the land, and built their towers swiftly, they could recoup their investment through tax reductions that would last no more than 20 years.
 
Times Change
 But the assumptions of the early 1980's changed radically by the end of the decade. Faced with dozens of lawsuits, the state's condemnation of property was delayed for years while Manhattan real-estate values soared, inflating the condemnation price and forcing the city and state to agree to tax breaks that would be far larger and extend far longer than anticipated. Now, no one knows how long they would last, because the benefits to the developers will depend in part on how much the value of the buildings and their rental income increases over decades. Some critics predict the tax breaks will last as long as 99 years.
By the end of the decade, the market for new offices had collapsed, leaving the developers with a plan to build four large buildings but few potential tenants to put in them.
On Tuesday, in announcing the interim agreement for the project, Mr. Klein said he expected that demand for new offices would continue to increase and that construction of the first of the four towers could begin in three to five years.
Mr. Cohen said that he also expected an improving market, and that some tenants, including entertainment companies and law firms, would find the proposed Times Square towers appealing. But he added that the neon lights and street activity that will return to 42d Street before any of the towers are built may prove a problem for Mr. Klein and the developers.
"There is no question the neon and glitter will limit the appeal of Times Square for corporate tenants," he said. "The tragedy here is that the developers have invested so much in a project that could be past the point of no return."

HEADLINE: Utility Gets New Rate Plan

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 7

 BODY:
The California Public Utilities Commission approved plans last week to make the San Diego Gas and Electric Company the nation's first energy utility to base rates on performance rather than costs.
The five-year plan allows rates to rise or fall annually with inflation, employee productivity and customer growth. It offers stockholders in the company greater profits if the company meets certain goals in safety, reliability, customer satisfaction and rate-cutting. 
 For the utility's 1.2 million customers in San Diego County and southern Orange County, the plan offers "the comfort level of knowing that the company now has an incentive to provide good service at reasonable costs and the most reliable service available," a spokesman for the utility, David Kusumoto, said.
But Michael Shames, executive director of the San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, said the company's rates were 36 percent above the national average and would not be lowered meaningfully by the new system.
Like commissions in most states, the Public Utility Commission has traditionally set gas and electricity rates so utilities can recover their reasonable operating and construction costs and a fixed profit.
As part of an overall effort to reduce regulatory controls, the commission has experimented with some performance-based rates.

HEADLINE: Notes Issue By Vietnam

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Seeking huge injections of foreign capital for economic development, Vietnam will make its first foray into the international money markets late this year or early in 1995 with a $50 million issue of Euro floating-rate notes, a senior banker said on Friday.
The Bank for Foreign Trade, or Vietcombank, the country's largest state-owned commercial bank, will make the offering, the bank's deputy executive director, Vu Viet Ngoan, said. 
 The bank has selected the Standard Chartered Merchant Bank of Britain as broker for the issue and expects the notes will be issued on Asian and European markets and in New York, he said.
The issue, denominated in United States dollars, will be Vietnam's first attempt to raise money in international markets as part of a drive to attract $25 billion of international money -- mainly through direct investment and government aid -- by the year 2000. It intends to raise a similar sum domestically.
The Finance Ministry said a month ago that it was planning to issue Government bonds internationally and hoped to raise $2 billion to $3 billion by the turn of the century.

Clock Keeps Ticking and Two Sides Keep Staring

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Negotiators for baseball club owners and players expect to meet daily this week, but it will be a short workweek if they don't have anything new to talk about when they get to the critical topic: the game's economic system.
The players are set to walk out before Friday's games if the two sides don't work out a new collective bargaining agreement, and nothing has happened to suggest that either side has a new or different idea it will present to try to avert the strike. 
 There was a rumor during the weekend that the clubs were preparing a surprise proposal for Wednesday's session, the first one this week at which the owners' salary cap proposal is scheduled to be discussed. The rumored proposal involved some sort of payroll tax clubs would be charged depending on how much they spent on players' salaries.
But neither it nor any other new proposal will apparently find its way to the bargaining table Wednesday.
"I never heard of any such thing," Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief proposal maker, said yesterday when asked about the rumor. "I'm not preparing it. I never heard of it."
Bud Selig, the acting commissioner but also the owner of the low-revenue Milwaukee Brewers, said he was unaware of it, too. "The rumor is unfounded," he said by telephone from his office in Milwaukee.
Ravitch said he had nothing new planned for Wednesday. "I'm not negotiating with myself," he said.
The two sides will meet today to discuss elements of their expired agreement other than the issue that is at the heart of their dispute.
Ravitch and Donald Fehr, the players' labor leader, made their fourth joint national television appearance yesterday, replying to the same questions with the same answers on "Meet the Press." They even rode to the airport together to return home, but that's about as close as they'll get this week.
"It seems to me," Fehr said after arriving home from Washington, "we're in a posture where they have predetermined dates when they'll be willing to negotiate, later this summer or next year. Until then, nothing we do matters -- unless we say we surrender. They're operating on a plan."
The owners, of course, deny that suggestion. What they do say repeatedly is they want the players to address their desire for cost certainty, which is the goal of their salary cap proposal.

More Like a Factory Than a National Trust

BYLINE: By Claire Smith 

 BODY:
IN the next four days you will read and hear the term "looming baseball players strike" a lot. You will also hear from a lot of grass-roots locales the term "fan boycott." And then there will be the obligatory calls for intervention by the President of the United States.
Only one of these notions should be given any credence at this point. And that is the players strike. For the players are scheduled to walk on Friday, and it appears that only intervention of the heavenly sort will stop that from happening. 
 The players have stood as one in opposition to the owners' salary cap proposal, the sort of unified defiance that caused owners to drop their ill-fated pay-for-performance proposal in favor of traditional solutions during the lockout of 1990. And the owners, still smarting from defeats like the one in 1990, are also boasting a heightened resolve, resulting in the current standoff.
With the two parties so thoroughly entrenched, it is left for others to look for solutions that, so far, resemble pipe dreams.
Oh, there are fan groups organizing boycotts. And if those boycotts are simply to show a general disgust, fine. But some boycott organizers are putting forth the proposition that they can and will affect the outcome of negotiations. The latter thinking is rooted in naivete over the role the public plays in these types of disputes. There is no role.
Yes, fans put down good money for tickets, just as they do for movies, concerts and video rentals. But fans are not buying into partnerships with these dollars. They are merely renting the right to be entertained by that particular entertainment business.
And that is what baseball is. A business. It is not a religion. It is not an inalienable right guaranteed by the Constitution or by your local cable television carrier. It is simply dollars and cents to those who try to finance it, the owners, and to those who take to the stage for pay, the players.
The money and time they invest is not considered discretionary or expendable, as is the contribution from the public. For owners and players, the game is their livelihood. As such, they have a right to take disputes involving their livelihood to the bargaining table. Just as do television writers, symphony orchestra musicians, actors, directors and movie technicians and their employers.
Fans will probably argue that there is a difference, that baseball is a national trust owned by the public. But it stopped being that the first time one man put a dollar in another man's hand to play baseball, then turned around and charged admission to recoup his costs.
Now, negotiators, staring at a pie worth billions of dollars, are merely fighting for things most Americans take for granted. Like the right to say what city they want to live in, work in or set up shop in. In other words, the right to make economic decisions that are best for their families, their businesses, their careers and themselves.
And, like it or not, owners and players have the right to pursue such goals, too, even if they do dance on a different economic plane and work in an industry others idealistically but unrealistically say they would participate in without pay.
Perhaps, deep down, fans who wouldn't countenance such outside interference in their affairs understand better than most these basic rights. Maybe that's why boycotts that accompanied strikes in 1981 and 1985 fizzled. Fans who said they would never buy another ticket invariably did. Despite the residual anger, the holes left in their hearts and the gaps in their summer schedules, they may have realized it still wasn't their fight.
Soon, the President of the United States will have to decide whether it is his fight. At least one owner, Ted Turner of the Braves, has called on President Clinton to intervene if the players strike.
Such requests are a hoot, in light of management's historic resistance to Federal interference as baseball continues to lobby for its antitrust exemption.
Despite the urgings of the players union, the Federal government, specifically Congress, has traditionally listened to the owners and protected the special dispensation granted baseball. Most recently, a Senate judiciary subcommittee defeated a modified rollback of the exemption, which would have applied to labor disputes. That defeat cost baseball players the legal recourse enjoyed by their peers in the National Basketball Association and the National Football League: the right to try to solve their labor disputes in courts.
Now an owner has the unrepentant moxie to woo the third branch of government to get involved where the judicial branch oft-times does not, because of the exemption, and where Congress will not, because of the lobbying successes of the owners.
President Clinton has not bitten, yet, keeping his Labor Department at a distance. Maybe he will intervene one day. But perhaps he has decided that this is Congress's mess and will remain so until those on Capitol Hill acknowledge what fans learned a long time ago the hard way: that baseball is a business and needs to be treated as such.

HEADLINE: A National Registry for Work

 BODY:
A Federal commission on immigration reform has urged President Clinton to establish a computerized national registry of all citizens and immigrants authorized to work in the United States. The goal, a worthy one, is to help employers check the eligibility of job applicants in order to screen out illegal aliens.
The proposal has been vigorously attacked as an invasion of privacy and a threat that will lead to government surveillance, a national identification card and new forms of discrimination. But such fears appear exaggerated. The registry can be protected so that it does not grow into an instrument of government oppression. The commission's chairwoman, Barbara Jordan, a former Democratic Congresswoman from Texas, a longtime civil rights advocate and leading black politician, said she would never support a proposal that increased discrimination or invaded privacy. 
 The registry is designed to tighten access to employment, the lure that brings most illegal immigrants across U.S. borders. The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act sought to shut off this economic magnet by penalizing employers who hired illegal aliens. Employers are required to ask all job applicants for documents to verify that they are either citizens or aliens authorized to work in the U.S. But phony documents can be readily obtained in many cities. Thus many illegal immigrants use false papers to obtain jobs, and many employers, seeking to avoid sanctions for illegal hiring, discriminate against any applicants who look foreign, whether they are entitled to work or not.
How to resolve this dilemma was one of many issues that the Commission on Immigration Reform was set up to examine. The commission will issue a final report next month, but Ms. Jordan previewed its recommendations before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week.
The most controversial proposal is the computerized registry of all eligible workers in the country, using data from the Social Security Administration and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Employers would use the registry to check that the Social Security number provided by an applicant was valid and had been issued to someone authorized to work in the U.S.
The commission recommends a large pilot program in those states with the most illegal immigrants -- California, Texas, Florida, New York and Illinois -- to test the best way of determining the job applicant's identity and eligibility. That might be done through more secure documents, like counterfeit-resistant Social Security cards and driver's licenses, or other methods like a telephone verification system.
By making the same initial check of all potential employees, the new system would actually reduce the chances of discrimination. Employers would no longer have any reason to ask if an applicant was an immigrant or to reject all foreign-looking applicants out of hand. And American workers at the bottom of the economic ladder would benefit from more effective ways of discouraging the hiring of illegal immigrants.
Opponents of the proposal, like the American Civil Liberties Union, insist that it comes dangerously close to a national identity card. But the Social Security number is already a form of national identification system, used widely by government agencies and private companies. The computerized registry would enhance its reliability.
The commission recognizes the need for accuracy of the new registry and supports efforts by the Social Security Administration and the Immigration and Naturalization Service to improve and update their records. It also supports safeguards against use of the registry data for improper purposes. The task for Washington is to protect the integrity of any new data system as vigilantly as it would protect the workplace from illegal immigrants.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Clinton's Good Deed

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Five years ago, an inflammatory piece titled "Free the Baltics" appeared in this space. Its theme was that "a great struggle has begun" to dismember the Soviet empire, and I went to the Baltics a few months later to be able to put the message in a dateline redolent with pro-independence propaganda: "Riga, Soviet-occupied Latvia."
The three tiny Baltic republics -- Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania -- were the keys to the kingdom. The West had never recognized Stalin's deal with Hitler to swallow up the three states; for a half-century, U.S. Presidents of both parties kept the diplomatic faith with the peoples of these "captive nations" (a phrase derided by anti-anti-Communists here). 
 By emboldening independence movements in these disputed Soviet annexations, we subtly encouraged nationalists in Ukraine and in other republics where Kremlin sovereignty was recognized. Sure enough, as the Russian economy collapsed, Balts asserted their freedom, Ukrainians followed suit, and the Soviet Union came apart.
But there was a blot on the sovereignty of the Baltics: the ominous, continued presence of Russian troops.
Moscow gave such excuses as the protection of the human rights of Russians sent by Stalin to colonize the states, and the need to maintain an early-warning radar station. The practical reason was that no decent housing existed in Russia for the returning officers. The political reason was the rising resentment within Russia of the loss of superpower and the ensuing neo-imperialist pressure to dominate the "near abroad."
On Aug. 31, despite these pressures and to the surprise of many Russian, American and Baltic diplomats, all remaining Russian troops will be pulled out of the Baltics. Much of the credit for this unremarked foreign-policy stunner should go to the perseverance and persuasiveness of President Bill Clinton.
From the first summit with Boris Yeltsin in Vancouver to the recent meeting in Naples, Clinton pressed for the Baltic pullout. Yeltsin had criticized Gorbachev on this, but once in power was faced with the military's demands to stay. Aided by Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt, Clinton began chipping away at the reasons for delay, by phone and letter, making plain a personal interest.
The U.S. successfully mediated a radar phase-out that met Moscow's defense concerns. We made available $160 million for resettling Russian military, including $25,000 vouchers for officers to build new housing back home, more generous than our own old G.I. bill.
But Yeltsin balked at the impending deadline for withdrawal. Getting political heat from nationalists and resentment from his army, he complained of "brutal" repression of the Russian minority in Latvia and Estonia. Asked last month if he would meet the deadline, he publicly answered "nyet."
On July 6, Clinton was the first U.S. President to visit Latvia, affirming its Western ties, raising hard-liner hopes that he will abandon "partnership for peace" bomfog and expand NATO membership eastward while opportunity exists. But he quieted a cheering throng in Riga with a message many non-Russians did not want to hear: "to never deny others the justice and equality you fought for . . . for freedom without tolerance is freedom unfulfilled."
Nine days later, he wrote Yeltsin a private letter to assure him that the rights of Russians in the Baltics "is an issue of principle with me" but "we do not see in these countries a pattern of abuses . . ." He added: "Boris, it remains my firm view that we must not miss the chance to put Russian-Estonian relations on a new path by achieving agreement with President [Lennart] Meri. You should make every effort to withdraw your remaining troops from Estonia by August 31."
Russian diplomat Vitaly Churkin treated Meri rudely, expecting his Moscow meeting with Yeltsin to fail; Nick Burns, the Clinton national security aide highly regarded by the Balts, was pessimistic. But Bill's pen-pal Boris, repeatedly made aware of linkage, thundered "solve it!" to aides and ordered his troops out -- on the same day the last Russian soldiers are to leave Berlin.
Thus, Russian imperial interest seems directed more southward than westward, partly by virtue of Clinton diplomacy. That shows what can happen in the rare case when this President makes a clear-cut strategic decision, takes a personal interest in its success and quietly follows through.

HEADLINE: A Hutu Family Tries to Rebuild in Tutsi-Led Rwanda

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: GISENYI, Rwanda, Aug. 8

 BODY:
In the six days that Laurent Ngwijabanzi and his wife, Constantine Nyiramahne, have been back in their mud-brick house on a hill high above banana plantations, it has been strangely silent.
Almost all their neighbors are still refugees across the border in Zaire. The schools are closed, the few public buses were stolen and the goats that used to roam the countryside disappeared with their owners. 
 "We feel alone," said Mrs. Nyiramahne.
Only three families out of the hundreds who lived on the hill have trekked the few miles home. The front door on the adjacent house remains padlocked; it is not known if the owner is alive. The neighboring village is empty.
But as tough as starting over is proving to be, Mr. Ngwijabanzi said he was pleased to be home. His initial fear of being harassed or harmed by the soldiers of the new Rwandan Government had subsided. His main problem, he said, was finding enough food, and generating enough money to pay for it in a shattered economy. A farmer who also runs a business building homes, he has no seeds to plant and no customers for the rows of mud bricks lined up in his yard.
The United Nations estimates about 90,000 Rwandans have returned from the squalid camps in Zaire, where tens of thousands have died of cholera and other diseases.
A vast majority of the refugees -- about 900,000 -- have chosen to stay in the disease-ridden camps out of fear of reprisals from soldiers of the new Tutsi-dominated Government. The Hutu soldiers and militia of the previous Government, who are being blamed for the massacres of up to 500,000 Tutsi in April and May and who ordered Hutu civilians to flee northwest Rwanda three weeks ago, are campaigning in the camps against repatriation.
 
Flow of Returnees Slows
 The number of Rwandans returning through the main border crossings has fallen as the propaganda in the camps has increased and as the political situation inside Rwanda remains unclear. There have been reports of attacks on returning refugees in the southwest.
The unease that many educated refugees feel was made clear tonight at a small gathering in Goma of Rwandans who had worked at the United States Embassy in Kigali.
A political assistant at the embassy, Habimana Diendonne, said his father had returned to his home in Rwerere, near Gisenyi, to have a look but was a week overdue in returning. "He went back to see if it was safe," Mr. Diendonne said. "Now we don't know anything."
Fear was a factor for Mr. Ngwijabanzi, too, but he decided to take the risk rather than stay in the camps. "The worst period in my life was in Zaire, when I saw what I'd never seen before," he said -- "roads full of bodies."
To make the return journey easier, he left five of his children with relatives in Goma and walked a mile to the border with his wife and Victor, 18, and Samuel, 10.
"When we crossed the border, we thought we'd be killed," he said, sitting on one of the five wooden chairs in the small living room decorated with faded black-and-white family photographs. "But the Rwandan Patriotic Front soldiers talked to us gently and we were no longer afraid."
 
A Military Escort
 At another checkpoint further inside Rwanda, where soldiers had placed plastic soft-drink crates as barriers, their luggage was searched for weapons. Then, with about 60 other refugees, they were assigned a Patriotic Front soldier as an escort for the three-hour walk home.
They arrived here to find their entire bean harvest stolen. The bananas had been stripped from the trees of his plantation. There were no more animals because the five goats Mr. Ngwijabanzi had taken with him were stolen by Zairian soldiers.
To survive, he said, he has been using his meager savings to buy food. His son Samuel was pounding cassava leaves in a wooden pot for the evening meal. There was a small dish of sweet potatoes.
But cooking was difficult because the community water pump was broken, probably looted by soldiers. The family now depends on polluted water from the river, he said.
Mr. Ngwijabanzi said he would have to depend on food from relief agencies. He hopes the food arrives soon so he can go back to Zaire and bring his five other children back.
But as long as he can feed his family, Mr. Ngwijabanzi, a Hutu, seems unconcerned about the new Government, which is predominantly Tutsi.
The Hutu Government had not treated him well. In mid-April his house was searched by 20 Government soldiers because he was suspected of hiding a soldier of the Rwandan Patriotic Front.
And the massacres are still emblazoned on his mind. "People were being killed like cutting bananas with a machete," he said
It was not only Tutsi who were being killed, he said. "Everybody was frightened because people could point and say you are a spy," he said. "Now there is no disturbance for those who come back, there is no more fighting. And when you are talking to the soldiers, they don't shout at you."

HEADLINE: Rabin Makes First Visit to Jordan by an Israeli Leader

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ARAVA CROSSING, Jordan, Aug. 8

 BODY:
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, in the first official visit to Jordan by an Israeli leader, met King Hussein today in his seaside summer palace in Aqaba and opened a border crossing.
The meeting and ceremony, after years of secret contacts, come just two weeks after the Washington meeting between Mr. Rabin and the Jordanian King, which ended the state of war between the two neighbors. Phone links between Jordan and Israel were established on Sunday, and the King may visit Jerusalem as early as next week, according to Israeli officials. 
 The border crossing, which lies two miles north of the Red Sea port of Aqaba, will be open, for now, to foreign tourists and Israelis with foreign passports. Officials of both countries said they hoped that Israeli and Jordanian passport holders would not have to wait long to use it.
"We are literally seated at this time and this place, all of us, Israelis and Jordanians, on the remains of the past," Mr. Rabin said at the arid border crossing. "We are sitting on an old minefield which was cleared only three days ago. This is what divided Israel and Jordan for decades. This is the field in which death and destruction were sowed."
"We are sitting at this time and at this place, all of us, Israelis and Jordanians, before the future," he said. "To our right and to our left stand the new Israeli-Jordan border crossing terminals, which sprang up overnight."
 
Cleared of Land Mines
 The desert crossing was cleared of surrounding land mines in the last three days, and fresh coats of white paint marked the trailers and hastily built cement structures.
The King, who warmly welcomed Mr. Rabin at his palace, promised that this was just the start. He called his Israeli counterparts "friends and partners." And later in the day the Prime Minister told reporters that he had first met the King 20 years ago.
"Now that it has all been published, I will tell you," Mr. Rabin told reporters when asked how long he had known King Hussein, "that when we were all three at the White House, President Clinton, the King and myself, Clinton turned to us and asked us, 'Tell me the truth, how long have you known each other?'
"I looked at the King, and he didn't reply. I answered, 21 years. Then he corrected me and said: 'Twenty years,' and he was right."
 
The King's Comments
 The King said: "This is something I have never experienced over the many, many years that have passed. I hope it is something we will leave for all people, men, women and children, to live with and enjoy in the future."
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who met with the two leaders and later traveled with them aboard the King's yacht, said, "The rhetoric of peacemaking is giving way and being translated into reality."
Mr. Christopher is in the Middle East to help broker a deal between Israel and Syria. Syria remains critical of the contacts between the Israelis and their Palestinian and Jordanian counterparts.
Syria and Israel are struggling to break a deadlock in the peace effort. Mr. Christopher, who met President Hafez al-Assad of Syria for five hours on Sunday in Damascus, said today that the two countries "have a great distance to go" to make peace.
 
Criticism of P.L.O. Delay
 Mr. Rabin criticized the Palestine Liberation Organization for delaying Palestinian elections and slowing up the agreement between the Israeli and Palestinian leadership. He said further agreements, including the status of the remainder of the West Bank, could not be decided until the P.L.O. went ahead with legislative elections, as called for in the self-rule agreement. The elections were scheduled for July.
The Prime Minister said he expected to meet Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman, on Wednesday to discuss the delay.
The border ceremony, over which Crown Prince Hassan officiated for Jordan, was attended by Jordanian and Israeli veterans, as well as some of those who lost relatives in the four wars that have taken place between the two countries since the creation of Israel in 1948. The groups exchanged gifts and shook hands.
"The task of leadership is not to follow public opinion blindly," said former Foreign Minister Abba Eban of Israel, who shook hands with Jordanian veterans and went on to Aqaba with Mr. Rabin, "but to lead public opinion, and both Prime Minister Rabin and King Hussein are doing this."
 
Eban Praises Arafat
 Mr. Eban also paid tribute to the P.L.O. leader, noting that the agreement with Jordan was possible only because Mr. Arafat had broken the ice.
"We never would have reached the agreement with Jordan unless we had reached the agreement with the Palestinians," he said. "And we won't have peace with Syria unless we cherish the Palestinian and Jordanian agreements."
On Friday, President Clinton sent a letter to the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and 10 other industrialized nations to urge them to grant debt relief to Jordan, whose overall government-to-government debt totals $6 billion.
Mr. Clinton called debt relief for Jordan a "critical element" in demonstrating support for the peace effort.
"It is essential that the people of Jordan feel the benefits of peace in tangible ways," he said. "Jordan's debt overhang is a major impediment to economic growth."
Showing that the United States intended to lead the way, Mr. Clinton said in the letter, which was released today, that as a first installment he would seek to reduce Jordan's $702 million debt to the United States by about $220 million.
 
Yacht Tours Gulf of Aqaba
 King Hussein played host to Mr. Rabin and Mr. Christopher at his palace on the Red Sea immediately after the early-morning border opening. The three men met briefly with reporters in the garden of the palace before a tour of the Gulf of Aqaba in the King's yacht, Haya, piloted by the King.
Israeli boats, waving Jordanian and Israeli flags and unleashing horn blasts, greeted the Haya, which means life in Arabic, as it plowed through the placid waters. The yacht briefly crossed into Israel as it cruised along the coastal resort city of Eilat. Israeli gunboats escorted the vessel as Israeli and Jordanian helicopters hovered overhead.
"Friends say to us, 'The pace of events is too fast,' " Mr. Rabin said in the morning. " 'We cannot keep up. Wait a minute.' "
"Your Royal Highness, our friends in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, we have waited 46 years," he said. "We have gone through war, pain and suffering. To prevent further loss and so on, we cannot wait even one more day."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
WPP Group is having a good year after some shaky ones.

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
AFTER years in which its survival seem threatened by a bloated debt load and the pinch on marketing budgets caused by the recession, WPP Group P.L.C., the London-based advertising holding company that is an important force on Madison Avenue, has generated a steady stream of good news during the last 12 months.
Clients began spending more on advertising as economic recoveries took hold in the United States and Britain, aiding results at J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy & Mather, WPP's two biggest agencies. The company has shored up its balance sheet, in part through the sale late last year of Scali, McCabe, Sloves, another of its agencies, for $70 million. And in May, Ogilvy scored the biggest account gain in advertising history when I.B.M. consolidated its account, with billings estimated at $400 million to $500 million, there. 
 WPP's shares have reflected this, having surged on the London Stock Exchange from a low in 1992 of 22 pence a share, or about 33 cents, to 89 pence, or about $1.33, at the end of last year. The shares closed yesterday in London at 111 pence, up 3 pence. WPP's American depository receipts, which trade on Nasdaq and represent two shares each, closed yesterday at $3.50, up 25 cents.
Despite the progress, WPP's shares may have been restrained recently. A consortium of 28 banks, which financed WPP's acquisitions of J. Walter Thompson, Ogilvy and other companies in the mid-1980's, agreed in 1992 to trade $272 million worth of debt for equity. A big block of that stock -- 190.2 million shares, or 26.5 percent of shares outstanding following the conversion -- can be sold by the banks as of Sept. 1 under the terms of their agreement with WPP. The bank group includes J. P. Morgan, Bankers Trust, Barclays Bank and National Westminster Bank.
The banks indicated last week that they planned to sell the shares to institutional investors in Britain and on the Continent in an offering led by Bankers Trust, Morgan and S. G. Warburg Securities.
While investors have long known the sale was coming -- the banks were allowed to sell 60 million shares last year, and did so -- some analysts think a fear that WPP's shares are being diluted has kept buyers on the sidelines lately, blunting what might have been further gains.
"There hasn't been any evidence of short-selling or of the price being severely affected, but it's held back the share performance," said David Forster, an analyst at Smith New Court Securities in London.
The question now is how well the sale of the banks' shares will go next month and whether the shares will then resume their upward climb. WPP declined comment pending the release of its financial results for the first six months of the year, which is due tomorrow.
The company already had one lesson this year in equity market volatility: It had to cancel a $200 million offering of an equity stake in its market research business in June when it became clear that the market for new issues was close to sated.
But the general expectation among analysts is that the bank group will sell the WPP shares at a modest discount to the market price and that there is sufficient demand to avoid dragging down the market price significantly.
"If the placing is executed successfully we think the shares can move ahead from these levels," said Mr. Forster. He added that Smith New Court had rated the stock a hold for the last several months. "We're positive on the shares long term," he said. "We think there's reasonable value there."
Mr. Forster estimated that WPP would post pretax earnings for the first six months of the year of 37 million, or about $55.5 million. In the same period last year it earned 24.1 million, or about $36.15 million.
Average net debt for WPP, which peaked in 1992 at 395 million, or slightly less than $600 million at today's exchange rates, fell to 339 million last year, or $515 million, and should be less than 300 million, or about $456 million, for the first half of 1994. The advertising agencies have continued to gain new business, though the I.B.M. account probably will not show up on the bottom line until next year, when heavy start-up costs -- and offsetting losses of billings from I.B.M. rivals estimated as high as $200 million -- are out of the way.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 6.79 to End a Four-Day Decline

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average snapped a four-day slide yesterday, as the stock market was buoyed by expectations of strong corporate earnings. Stability in bonds and the dollar also helped stocks, traders said.
Friday's report of stronger-than-expected job growth in July "underlines the solid momentum of the current economy," said Gail Dudack, market strategist at S. G. Warburg & Company. "This is a good backdrop for earnings prospects for the second half of 1994." 
 Gains were capped by concern that this week's sale of $40.25 billion in new Treasury securities would glut the market and drive bond yields higher, creating competition for stocks, traders said. Concern about this week's inflation reports and next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting also limited the stock market's advance.
"Today's rebound doesn't have much 'oomph' behind it," said Christie McClellan, managing director at Robertson, Stephens & Company. "The pressures to buy or sell seem to be about equal at this point."
The Dow industrials climbed 6.79, to 3,753.81, after losing 51.15 points in the last four sessions. Gains for International Paper, I.B.M. and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing offset losses for Caterpillar, American Express and Union Carbide.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index closed up 0.80, at 457.89, after dropping 4.37 during the last two sessions. Computer systems, drugs and international oils were among the sectors with the biggest gains yesterday, while general retail stores, health care and chemicals were among the largest decliners.
The Nasdaq composite index, which shed 6.18 points in the last four days, rose 1.80, to 720.47. Cisco Systems, Microsoft and Nordstrom paced the rebound.
Nordstrom rallied 15/16 , to 439/16 . An analyst at Wertheim, Schroder & Company raised his earnings estimates a day before the apparel retailer is expected to post second-quarter earnings of between 65 and 70 cents a share, up from 52 cents a share in the corresponding period a year earlier.
Eleven stocks rose for every nine that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. About 217.7 million shares changed hands on the Big Board, below the daily average of 260 million shares in the last three months.
"We don't see long-term inflationary pressures and we're already beginning to see signs of a slowing in the economy," as evidenced by a drop in housing starts and auto sales, said James Engle, chief investment officer of Wood Struthers & Winthrop, the investment management subsidiary of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, which manages more than $2.2 billion.
The most active stocks on the United States composite list were Mesa Airlines, which plunged 37/16 , to 69/16 , after reporting a drop in third-quarter income; Telmex, down 1/4, to 62 3/4; Intel, down 1/8, to 58; RJR Nabisco Holdings, unchanged at 6 1/4, and Cisco Systems, up 3/4, to 21 5/8.
North American Mortgage soared 3, to 30 5/8, after it hired Morgan Stanley & Company to help it evaluate options, including a possible sale, to bolster shareholder value.

HEADLINE: If Welfare Mothers Must Go to Work In Clinton Plan, Will Children Gain?

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA 

 BODY:
Dorothy Carmona, a mother and relative newcomer to the world of work, thinks her children are better off now in day care than they were when she was on welfare. "I see many, many women who just get up in the morning and do nothing with their lives," she said. "My kids learn more at the day care center than when I was at home."
Gail Abney, a mother and no stranger to work, nonetheless calls it cruel to ask welfare mothers to work when their children are young. "A child's most important year is the first year," she said. "You build a bond with that child." 
 The two mothers, both welfare veterans from the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn, reflect a larger divide about a major part of President Clinton's plan to overhaul welfare: for the first time forcing mothers of young children to leave those youngsters for work, school or training. Alternative welfare proposals in Congress make similar demands.
 
Echoing Broad Debate
 The unanswered, and so far unanswerable, question is just how the Clinton plan and other proposals would affect the women's children. Because no previous welfare-to-work program has required mothers of infants to seek work, there is little good research on children that age. But there is plenty of passion on both sides of a discussion that echoes broader debates about working mothers and the state of children.
For the Clinton Administration, the political calculus is clear: if the Family and Medical Leave Act grants just three months no-paid leave to working mothers generally, then welfare mothers can hardly expect more.
To disarm critics, the Administration would exempt welfare mothers until their first child is 1 year old, and give them three months off after the birth of any other children. After that, all welfare mothers who are 18 or older would have to prepare for work through job training or education, or would have to engage actively in a job search. After two years, welfare payments would end; if a woman did not have a job, she would be required to work at subsidized, Government-provided jobs at minimum wage for 15 to 35 hours a week.
"The philosophy is fairness," said Mary Jo Bane, the assistant secretary for children and families in the Department of Health and Human Services. "Our expectations for welfare mothers ought to be similar to the expectations of working people."
 
Child Care Guidelines
 Existing child care research suggests that children's responses to their mothers working depends on both whether their mothers want to work and whether their mothers' jobs are stressful and on the quality of the child care in which the children are placed. But these guidelines can be interpreted differently .
Ms. Bane and several other welfare experts argue, for example, that children might be better off if their mothers work because working could ease the women's social isolation, give them pride and self-confidence and combat the depression that disproportionately afflicts mothers on welfare. And, they maintain, children could be placed in child care that offers them more stimulation than they might receive at home.
"The issue isn't middle-class moms who, if at home, would spend all this time reading to their kids," said Douglas J. Besharov, a welfare expert with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization. "That's why research on child care often shows that kids benefit, because compared to what they get at home, it is often more enriching."
Indeed, researchers at the Johns Hopkins University, in a recent study of 867 children nationwide, found that when children from the poorest and least intellectually stimulating homes were placed in child care (particularly in child care centers) before they were 1 year old, they performed better on math and reading tests than children who were not in day care.
A national study of 22,000 children conducted last year by the research organizations Westat Inc. and Child Trends Inc. found that welfare mothers -- and other poor mothers -- tended to read less to their children, allowed them to watch more television, showed less physical attention and spanked them more than mothers in the general population. Those children had more behavior problems and achieved less in school than other pupils, the study reported.
But other welfare experts argue that mothers forced into low-wage jobs that are unfulfilling might be resentful, overwhelmed by stress and unable to pay for quality child care. And poor children, they argue, are particularly in need of child care that offers an environment in which they are encouraged to learn.
 
Two-Generation Approach
 The scant evidence available from small-scale welfare-to-work projects suggests that children fare best when programs are designed both for parents and children. The National Center for Children in Poverty, based at Columbia University, recently studied about 200 children of teen-age mothers in Newark who had received further education and job training.
"If you're concerned about kids as well as parents, it's necessary but not sufficient to do welfare to work," said Lawrence Aber, the co-director of the center. "You have to combine employment training with parenting education and child-development activities for kids."
Other small-scale programs to require welfare mothers to seek work support that contention. So do the experiences of women like Ms. Carmona, who found her job as an administrative assistant with a nonprofit company through the help of Project Chance in Fort Greene, which offers counseling, parent education, employment training and free day care. Ms. Carmona said the combination of services helped her be a better mother.
The counseling and training improved her family's finances and her self-confidence. "When I was pregnant, on welfare and watching soap operas at home, one of the family educators said, 'This will make you depressed; you need to go out,' " she said. "I can't see myself at home all day long with them. I tell them, 'I have to work so you can get a better education.' "
The parenting classes improved Ms. Carmona's relationship with her children. "A lot of us come from abusive homes," she said, "and if you get upset with the child, instead of saying, 'Let's take a deep breath,' you say, 'Get the belt.' We learned we can't just take out our frustrations on the children."
The Clinton proposal, already pared because the President pledged not to raise taxes to pay for it, does not require a two-generation approach. But it would let states allow mothers to fulfill part of their required preparation for employment in parent education courses, as long as they spent most of their time looking for a job, Ms. Bane said.
But several child care experts fear that the plan, which was cut back because of costs and politics, did not allocate enough money to pay for quality child care when mothers were undergoing training and, more important, when they had to work. The cost of the proposal was reduced to $9.3 billion over five years from $19.5 billion.
Among other provisions, it does guarantee child care while mothers are on welfare and for one year after they find work. It also offers incentives to raise child care reimbursement rates; nearly doubles the amount of money available to help the working poor pay for child care, and expands the Head Start preschool program to include newborns to age 3. The program now serves 3 and 4 year olds.
 
Shortcomings Are Seen
 But Helen Blank, child care director of the Children's Defense Fund, said states would still be allowed to pay as little as $175 a month to reimburse child care expenses. With waiting lists for subsidized child care for working poor parents reaching 255,000 in California alone, Ms. Bank said the Clinton plan would fall far short of working parents' needs for affordable child care -- and risk pushing working poor parents back into welfare to get the scarce subsidized child care slots.
Jacqueline Bullock, a Fort Greene mother who left welfare to take a job as a transit clerk, said that without the free child care she found through Project Chance she could not afford to keep working. "I was lugging each child to a different place -- one to a center, one in family day care, one to my niece," she said. "If it weren't for the program here, keeping me ahead of the game, giving me free child care, I wouldn't work. With the income limits on day care, the system just throws you out."
Welfare mothers would also have to contend with a time limit if the Clinton proposal were adopted: They would have two years to find jobs, after which welfare benefits would end. Yet virtually every welfare-to-work program has shown that mothers struggling with particularly difficult emotional and family problems may need more time to prepare for work.
Mitzi Hack, for example, is a 30-year-old mother of four in Overland Park, Kan., and has been on welfare for five years, since she left an abusive husband. She says she wants to work but has no skills. She worries that within two years she cannot get training, find a job that pays enough to support four children and save enough money to buy a car, which is essential to commute to work.
Toby Herr, director of Project Match, which works with long-term welfare recipients at the Cabrini-Green housing project in Chicago, proposed that instead of requiring job training for every mother, participation in tenant patrols, Head Start programs, parent-teacher meetings and family support programs could count because these build work skills like reliability and promptness.
"I believe very strongly that everyone's expected to do something," Ms. Herr said. "But the expectations must be meaningful and realistic. If we push the mothers into things they aren't good at, it's bad for kids."

HEADLINE: Oil Prices May Be at a Turning Point

BYLINE: By KENNETH GILPIN 

 BODY:
The decline in oil prices that helped bring inflation in the United States down to an annual rate of 3 percent may be ending.
Many oil analysts and economists are suggesting that the sharp price increases this year, which have brought the price of oil up nearly $6, to about $20 a barrel, are going to hold. Some others contend that they see signs that point to rising oil prices for the rest of this decade. 
 "Using a very reasonable set of assumptions, I can foresee several years of price increases after 1995," said Vahan Zanoyan, senior director at the Petroleum Finance Company, a consulting firm in Washington.
"I personally think demand will be exploding because of a rapid coincidence of demand in the Far East, Europe and North America," he said. "And at current prevailing prices, I don't think the global oil industry is ready to accommodate a synchronized push in demand."
 
Demand Growth Increasing
 An executive at an oil trading company, who asked not to be identified, said the calculus looked like this:
"Total production is about 70 million barrels a day. Demand growth is increasing by 1.5 million to 2 million barrels a day, per annum, the equivalent of Kuwait's current annual production. The big supply sources over the past few years are coming to an end, and for the first time anyone can remember, OPEC has no substantial excess capacity."
Oil prices have been on a slow but steady rise since mid-February, when spot prices for a barrel of West Texas intermediate crude bottomed at $13.95 a barrel.
In the last few weeks, strikes by Nigerian oil workers have raised concerns about widespread and long-lived disruptions in the supply of high-quality Nigerian crude. Those worries have driven up spot oil prices by about $2 a barrel.
The price of light crude for September delivery closed at $19.42, up 11 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday. When its workers are not on strike, Nigeria produces about 1.9 million barrels a day.
But Nigeria is not the only big oil producer that is having political problems and could have production disruptions. Tensions are rising in Algeria, which produces slightly less than 800,000 barrels of oil a day, and in Venezuela, which pumps more than 2.4 million.
And with these problems on the production side, demand is rising.
"We are seeing an acceleration of demand for oil, at least as far as the United States is concerned," said Bernard J. Picchi, a managing director and oil analyst at Lehman Brothers.
"And the liberalization of economies in India, China and ultimately Russia will have an impact on demand," he added.
In a report issued nearly a month ago, analysts at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company said that by the end of September, "commercial stocks, relative to forward consumption," would be "well below" their levels a year ago.
But the Morgan analysis was done before a heat wave settled on Japan and Western Europe. During July alone, demand for electricity in Japan was so great that oil consumption was up 800,000 barrels a day, compared with July 1993. Until the country's heat and drought conditions abate, consumption will remain high, further taxing existing stocks.
In its most recent forecast, the Paris-based International Energy Agency in Paris said last week that petroleum demand would rise by 1.2 million barrels a day next year, after increasing by 800,000 barrels a day in 1994.
"The bulk of the price increase is due to a cyclical surge in demand," said John H. Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. "If the Nigerian situation deteriorates, prices could go up another couple of dollars or more. But even if Nigeria comes back, prices are likely to be firm."
But even as these analysts predict that oil prices will rise, they maintain that compared with other commodities, oil will still be a bargain, if only because its price has stayed so low for so long.
In nominal terms, crude prices are about a third lower than they were in 1983, according to price data from Datastream. But after accounting for inflation, crude oil today is selling for less than half of its average 1983 price.
"I would argue that oil is still cheap, even if it goes up by another $3 a barrel," said Mr. Zanoyan of the Petroleum Finance Company. "Oil is not only cheap relative to its own price path, but also relative to the price path of other commodities."
But there are analysts who say they see a potentially more alarming scenario. To them, the emerging tableau of rising demand, tight inventories and instability in some key producing countries is disturbingly familiar.
"I have this eerie feeling we are about to repeat 1978-1979," said Philip K. Verleger, Jr., a Washington-based vice president at Charles River Associates, an economic consulting firm.
"We are probably going to have to deal with irregular production from Nigeria for the next six months to a year, demand is surging and there is not enough of a production overhang to deal with that sort of a situation," he said. "Towards the end of the fourth quarter we could have a terribly tight oil market. And at the moment, I am hard pressed to see many answers that could ease the situation."
Mr. Verleger said global inventories were currently at their lowest level in five years. Given current consumption patterns, by the end of the year inventories will have fallen to their lowest level since 1974, he said.
At the moment, Mr. Verleger's view is not widely shared. But even the merest suggestion that world petroleum markets could push up prices the way they did in the wake of the Iranian revolution should be cause for concern in the Clinton Administration, and at the Federal Reserve Board.
Oil prices soared after the 1973 Yom Kippur War, and then doubled during 1978, to $28 a barrel. The inflationary impact forced the Fed to push interest rates to record-high levels and played a big hand in Ronald Reagan's victory over President Jimmy Carter.
Those who reject the thesis that spot oil prices could skyrocket argue that there is enough excess capacity to cope with rising demand.
Mr. Lichtblau said that Saudi Arabia, the swing producer among the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, could pump as much as an extra two million barrels a day above its current production quota of 7.9 million, a cushion big enough to offset even a long-term disruption in Nigerian production.
Kuwait, currently pumping about 1.8 million barrels a day, has excess capacity of about 300,000 barrels a day. But other OPEC producers are operating at very close to full capacity.
OPEC oil ministers are not scheduled to meet again until November, when the group will discuss whether to increase production in 1995 above the current level of 25 million barrels a day. If conditions in Nigeria remain unsettled, Mr. Lichtblau said, the Saudis and Kuwaitis are likely to raise their output.
Aside from a desire to avoid another boom-bust cycle with oil prices, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are apt to go to extreme lengths to prevent prices from skyrocketing in order to keep the United Nations-sanctioned oil embargo against Iraq intact.

HEADLINE: 2 Companies Look to Leave Manhattan

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
In a reflection of the growing strength -- and rising prices -- of the midtown Manhattan real estate market, two large companies said yesterday that they were considering leaving the city for offices in the suburbs.
The Equitable Life Assurance Society is considering several existing buildings in Westchester County, and the Swiss Bank Corporation said it might build on vacant land in downtown Stamford. 
 The two companies' search for new offices comes as offices in midtown Manhattan -- particularly the large, modern blocks of space preferred by financial services companies -- have grown increasingly scarce and expensive.
 
Vacancies in Suburbia
 At the same time, large numbers of suburban office buildings are vacant or only partly filled, the results of layoffs and corporate "downsizing." That has left asking rents in midtown more than a third higher than in suburban buildings, experts say, and the disparity may grow.
"It is very good news for the suburbs," said Michael H. Siegel, executive director of the Edward H. Gordon Company, a commercial realty company that handles property both in the city and suburbs. Because little new construction is expected any time soon in Manhattan, "large users are looking for alternatives."
The search by Equitable and Swiss Bank, which together have more than 4,000 employees in New York City, comes less than three weeks after another large Manhattan company, Mastercard, said it was looking for a suburban building for its headquarters and 540 employees. Although Mastercard has not said where it is looking, real estate executives say it is negotiating to take over a building vacated by the International Business Machines Corporation in the Westchester town of Purchase.
The Mastercard announcement raised some concern among city officials because it followed years of relative quiet in what as recently as the mid-1980's had been intense competition between New York and its suburbs for big businesses. To keep businesses, New York City was forced to offer increasingly generous incentives, like tax abatements.
Real estate executives attributed the slowdown in relocations to the region's real estate slump, beginning in 1988, which initially hurt midtown Manhattan as much as anywhere else in the region. With vacancy rates soaring, many midtown companies that might have considered relocating were able to negotiate new Manhattan leases at lower rents.
 
Differing Rental Rates
 Although experts say the expense of corporate relocation -- including the loss of employees who elect not to move -- involves far more complicated questions that a simple comparison of rental rates, those rates give a clear advantage to the suburbs.
According to Edward S. Gordon, the average asking rent in midtown Manhattan offices at the end of June was $31.60 a square foot. That compared with an average of $26.85 in lower Manhattan, $19.74 in Westchester and $19.25 in Fairfield County.
The possible moves by Swiss Bank and Equitable were first reported yesterday by Crain's New York Business, which also said that Avon Products and the Union Bank of Switzerland were considering moving from Manhattan to the suburbs.
Officials of Avon and Union Bank declined comment yesterday. Real estate executives, who asked that their names not be used, said both those companies had retained consultants to advise them on relocation, but they added that the use of such consultants had become routine for companies whose leases were expiring, and did not mean they would move.
The search for a new home appeared the most advanced at Swiss Bank, which has 1,500 Manhattan employees split between a United States headquarters at 10 East 50th Street and another building at Broadway and Park Row.
Matthias Beckman, a company spokesman, said yesterday that the company was considering building a new complex on a parcel just north of the Stamford train station.
"It would be a few years before we actually move," he said, "and it is far too early to tell how many employees would be affected." Nonetheless, Mr. Beckman added, the company is searching for a new location because it is expanding rapidly from its traditional banking business into stock trading and investment banking and needs more space for a trading floor, computers and offices.
One hurdle in Connecticut is that state law bars foreign-owned banks from locating there, and he said negotiations are under way in Hartford to have the law amended. Mr. Bergstrom said Swiss Bank could expect to obtain large tax breaks if it moved to Stamford because of a two-year-old state law that provides for long-term reductions in corporate income taxes to companies with more than 1,000 employees that either move into or expand in the state.
At Equitable, which opened its headquarters in 1985 in the Equitable Tower, at 787 Seventh Avenue, a company spokeswoman, Nancy Amiel, said other buildings were being considered across the New York region, including in Westchester County.
She said leases would begin to expire in 1996 at four other buildings Equitable occupies in Manhattan. Whatever decision is made, she said, the company will "maintain some space" in the Equitable Tower.

No Room For the Ruby Legs

BYLINE: BY IRA BERKOW 

 BODY:
I CLIMBED into a taxicab in Manhattan one day recently and told the driver, "Yankee Stadium."
He half-turned to me and in a foreign accent said, "Is that in New Jersey?" 
 "Not yet," I replied.
Then I gave him directions to the Bronx and, without even a thonx, he stepped on it.
One day, though, the Yankees may, as George Steinbrenner has indicated, wind up in a coveted spot in the New Jersey swamps.
If so, the New York Yankees will join such historic 19th-century major league baseball teams as the Providence Grays, the Troy (N.Y.) Haymakers, the Newark Peppers, the Worcester (Mass.) Ruby Legs, the Louisville Eclipse, the Keokuk Westerns, the Wilmington (Del.) Quick Steps and the Altoona Mountain City.
Not to mention the 20th-century Brooklyn Dodgers, the New York Giants, the Boston and Milwaukee Braves, the Philadelphia and Kansas City Athletics, the Washington Senators (two versions) and dozens of other teams. All of whom weighed their market places in the balance and found them wanting, and, like many businesses in similar situations in the American free-enterprise system, either moved away or went out of business.
The shuttling of teams is a harsh reality, but it is reality, something the baseball owners of today would rather not discuss.
The owners, on the verge of forcing the players into a strike, have demanded that the players accept a salary cap, which would negate many of the rights for which the players have fought successfully in recent years.
The owners contend they can't continue like this -- saying at first that 19 of the 28 teams are in the red, then changing that yesterday to 12 to 14 money-losing clubs -- but have been totally unconvincing to the players. This is unlike the National Basketball Association owners in 1984, who opened their books and proved to the satisfaction of the players' union that four franchises were about to fold, and the players thereby risked a loss of about 50 jobs.
Baseball owners, with frequent turnover, continue to sell their franchises at ever higher prices, and the sport continues to expand. While the owners say teams are losing money, especially the so-called small-market teams, Financial World Magazine, which tracks such goings-on, says this is fiction.
The San Diego Padres, for one, made a profit of $4.1 million in 1993, according to Financial World. And the Pittsburgh Pirates, who went on the sales block last week -- and immediately found at least two serious business groups expressing interest -- were reported to have made $4 million last year.
Nowhere is it decreed that a big league ball club must exist in a particular city. Instead, basic economics requires that one sets up shop at the busiest corner, a tradition baseball owners have followed religiously.
For many years, only 16 teams played in the major leagues. Of those 16, only 10 remain in the same city. The others moved on. Owners decided there was nothing inviolable about the national pastime. And the majors have ballooned to 28 teams.
Owners, some of whom say with a straight face that they are caretakers of a national trust, insist that it would be terrible to lose franchises in smaller markets because of the history of those teams, and that it would damage the continuity of the game. A continuity, in fact, that the owners themselves have often changed -- from franchise-hopping to the designated hitter to artificial playing surfaces.
If small markets are a grievous problem, then why don't the owners solve it among themselves with a greater degree of revenue-sharing -- and not tie it to a players' salary cap? They could give visiting teams 40 to 50 percent of the gate instead of 20 percent, as in the American League, and about the same in the National. And George Steinbrenner, for example, could share his $40 million-a-year local television deal with, say, Milwaukee, which gets only about $5 million for its locally televised games.
That's because the large-market owners are playing like profiteers, the game they're best at. Have always been best at. And if a shift in population and jobs in Pittsburgh, for example, no longer allows it to support a baseball team, then metropolitan areas on the rise like Orlando, Charlotte, Norfolk and Phoenix are ready and willing to try.
The Tampa-St. Petersburg area is so eager, in fact, that it built a domed stadium, and waits, like a maiden with trousseau at the ready. At last count, the Tampa Bay Baseball group had sold 32,079 season ticket reservations.
This is baseball business, also a national pastime. And apparently a thriving one, at that.

HEADLINE: Physicists Ponder Life After the Demise Of the Supercollider

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE 

DATELINE: ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.

 BODY:
PARTICLE physicists meeting here last week to ponder the uncertain future of their arcane science relished a host of new ideas for penetrating the secrets underlying universal existence. But their branch of science has fallen on economic hard times, and many physicists were mainly looking for new ways to make a living.
A cloud of gloom shrouded the meeting of the Division of Particles and Fields of the American Physical Society, the first meeting the group had held since Congress killed the superconducting supercollider accelerator last October. The supercollider, a $10 billion proton accelerator that was under construction in Texas, would have been the most powerful such machine ever built. With its demise, thousands of scientists and engineers have lost jobs or suffered professionally in other ways. 
 Particle physics, which is also called high-energy physics, depends on the enormous energies needed to accelerate nuclear or subnuclear particles to speeds close to that of light. The head-on collisions of particles like protons and electrons (or their antimatter partners, antiprotons and positrons) produce microscopic fireballs comparable in temperature to that of the universe a few trillionths of a second after it was created in the explosion called the Big Bang.
The energy in these fireballs quickly converts itself into many different types of particles, some of them familiar components of matter and radiation, others so exotic that they exist today only as the ephemeral products of gigantic accelerators.
 
Dwindling Financial Support
 The United States is still a leader in high-energy physics, and Dr. Melvyn Shochet of the University of Chicago proudly enumerated achievements at Fermilab's Tevatron accelerator in Batavia, Ill., in the last year, including the probable discovery of the "top" quark -- the last of the six types of quarks that theory had predicted. But high-energy physics is being starved of energy, in both the literal and figurative senses.
The pessimistic mood apparent at the meeting stems partly from a shortage of financial support for high-energy physics throughout the world, and partly from the isolation many physicists say they increasingly feel. Some speakers also spoke of a need for new theoretical and experimental breakthroughs to impart new momentum to a languishing field.
"We speak a different language from that of people outside our field -- a language that must be articulated by mathematics," said Dr. Julia Thompson of the University of Pittsburgh, an organizer of "outreach" groups of physicists who seek to reduce this alienation from the public.
The spartan salaries of most physicists (and particle physicists in particular) was also a sore point often raised in conversations here.
"It's bad enough that my children keep asking me why we haven't been able to afford a vacation in the last five years," said a particle physicist who has worked on several accelerator projects. "But even my wife doesn't really understand. She can't see why we have to live in near poverty after my having spent eight expensive years earning a doctorate."
 
Communications Gulf
 More serious for particle physics, some said, is the communications gulf between scientists and the politicians who control Federal money.
Among the speakers who addressed this subject was Dr. Murray Gell-Mann, the author of the quark theory of matter, which radically changed the course of science 30 years ago and won Dr. Gell-Mann the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969.
"I talked to a senator from one of the Southern states who said he was really interested in particle physics, because it has to do with antimatter," Dr. Gell-Mann said. "It turned out that he thought antimatter had something to do with biological antibodies."
But the interaction between Congress and science is no laughing matter, he added.
"If we had built the supercollider, we would have had an exciting chance to find the higher-mass super particles that theories of supersymmetry predict to exist. But the supercollider, which might have had enough energy to demonstrate the existence of these and other fundamental particles, was killed by the House of Representatives -- a conspicuous setback for human civilization," Dr. Gell-Mann said.
 
Search for 'Sparticles'
 The discovery of supersymmetric particles, one of the main goals of high-energy physics, could prove the underlying identity of two basic families of particles -- fermions and bosons. Fermions include such entities as quarks, the building blocks of protons and neutrons, which in turn are the building blocks of atomic nuclei. Bosons, which are the carriers of force, include the photon particles that propagate the electromagnetic force in the form of light, radio and other types of radiation.
Among the supersymmetric particles (dubbed "sparticles") hypothesized by supersymmetry theory is the "gravitino," a partner of the graviton. The graviton is a fundamental (but as yet undetected) particle believed to be the carrier of the force of gravity, corresponding to the bosons that carry the other forces. If theorists are correct, gravitinos would have physical properties in common with those of some well-understood particles of matter, and could serve as a bridge to understanding the link between matter and gravity.
Reconciled to the probability that a decade from now the United States will have to take a back seat in experimental particle physics, some of the dispossessed Americans are seeking jobs at various European and Japanese laboratories, including CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics at Geneva.
But Europe also has acute financing problems, and jobs for high-energy physicists are almost as scarce there as they are in the United States.
 
Wanted: New Careers
 One of the suggestions for underemployed physicists seeking retraining for new careers came from Dr. Fabio Sauli, an Italian physicist at CERN. Dr. Sauli said a type of particle detector being used at CERN and elsewhere has been adapted for use as a clinical X-ray device that exposes patients to only one-tenth the dose they would normally receive, while producing more detailed X-ray pictures.
"I know that many of you are looking for alternative career possibilities in view of the lamentable state of high-energy physics," Dr. Sauli told an audience. "I'm suggesting that medical applications could make use of some of the tremendous capital of manpower and knowledge that has suddenly become available since the death of the supercollider."
Although jobs in high-energy physics are harder to find than at any time since World War II, the intellectual allure of the field remains powerful. "I'm not working as a physicist," said a young woman who was recently awarded a doctoral degree in particle physics. "I guess I'm just another one of the physics groupies who keep coming to meetings like this to enjoy the ideas and problems. There's more to physics than making a living."

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Labor Secretary's Plea Is Hardly a Solution

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has enough trouble without blundering into baseball's labor dispute, but its labor representative has done just that.
Robert Reich, the Secretary of Labor, was at Fenway Park in Boston Sunday, watching a doubleheader but first speaking to players on both teams about the impending players' strike. He spoke to reporters, too, and used that opportunity to call on fans of all ages but especially young fans to write to him at the Labor Department asking players and owners to continue talking. 
 "I can assure you if every kid sends it to me, I will make sure it gets to both sides," he told reporters.
Reich said that the administration would not intervene in the dispute. But by calling for those letters to be written, he was doing exactly what he said he and Washington wouldn't do. He was intervening, or at the least, interfering.
Although the Secretary of Labor has spoken to the chief negotiators in the dispute, he apparently has missed a basic element of the position of each side. The players are poised to strike after Thursday's games because they believe, with good reason, that if no agreement is reached by the end of the post-season, the owners will declare an impasse and unilaterally implement their coveted salary cap.
The only weapon the players have to block that development is a pre-emptive strike while they still have leverage. Striking in November, when the cap would be implemented, the Secretary surely can understand, would do the players no good. That's Labor 101 in your college course book.
Using public pressure -- "Say the season's not gone, Don," the kiddies cry -- to induce both sides to continue talking means the players should put off their strike. The owners would love that; they would be willing to continue talking into the blizzards of winter.
The Secretary could argue that if the negotiators continued talking, they might reach an agreement without needing a strike. Yes, and George Steinbrenner will stop trying to tell his managers how to manage.
If the two sides had ideas that could avert a strike, they have had plenty of time to place them on the bargaining table. They certainly could have introduced them at their bargaining session yesterday, but yesterday they discussed provisions of the expired basic agreement having nothing to do with players' salaries.
They could raise their season-saving ideas today, too, but today they are scheduled to continue discussions in committees on such topics as a joint drug program and international play. They could bring them up tomorrow, when they have said they will confront the critical issue of cost certainty. But the players don't have anything to offer that the owners want to hear, and the owners don't plan to offer any new proposals.
"I'm not negotiating with myself," Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief labor executive, said the other day.
If the Labor Secretary wants to do something constructive, without interfering, he could use his expertise to develop an economic idea that won't be as onerous as a salary cap to the players but that will go far enough toward the owners' stated need for cost certainty.
If such an animal exists in someone's fertile mind, don't write to the Labor Department; send it directly to Ravitch and Donald Fehr of the players' union. If it's good enough and gets there quickly enough, maybe the strike will last only for a couple of weeks instead of the rest of the year and then some.
Meanwhile, three days remain. They could be three of the most exhilarating days of any season because races, division and individual, abound, and they should be viewed as being definitive; that is, after Thursday, there very likely won't be any chance to alter the outcome.
The Yankees clinched first place in the American League East last Wednesday. Two National League races were decided Sunday. Montreal clinched first place in the East and Los Angeles in the West.
Entering last night's games, the leads in the other three divisions were one game (Cincinnati over Houston, Chicago over Cleveland) and one and a half games (Texas over Oakland). The three-game series between the White Sox and the Athletics that began last night could decide two races.
The two most interesting individual races involve Tony Gwynn of San Diego and Frank Thomas of the White Sox and Albert Belle of Cleveland. Gwynn's race is with no other hitter but with a figure -- .400. He will take a .392 batting average into the Padres' three-game series in Houston beginning tonight.
To reach .400 by the start of the strike, Gwynn would need to get 9 hits in 12 at-bats or 10 in 15, if he bats five times a game. But if he has a hot first two games and gets 7 hits in 9 at-bats, he would be at exactly .400 and should sit out the last game.
Thomas and Belle are vying for the Triple Crown, which no one has claimed since 1967. Thomas went into last night's games leading the American League in hitting with a .362 average to .361 for Paul O'Neill of the Yankees and .360 for Belle. He was tied with Ken Griffey Jr. of Seattle for the lead in home runs with 38, two ahead of Belle, and was tied with Belle and Joe Carter of Toronto with 101 runs batted in , three behind Kirby Puckett of Minnesota.
With so much on the line in the next few days, if the players did not strike or came back after striking, everything that happened afterward might be anticlimactic.

HEADLINE: South Korea's Self-Inflicted Wound

 BODY:
For more than a month, South Korea has been waging a fierce campaign against student radicals and labor militants with methods that have no legitimate place in a democratic society. Washington has muted its public criticism in deference to Seoul's anxieties over the North Korean nuclear program and the delicate succession to Kim Il Sung. But a month has elapsed since his death, and the repression shows no sign of abating, posing a far graver threat to democracy than any subversive scheme hatched in Pyongyang. South Korea's true friends need to speak up.
The crackdown began in June, amid a wave of labor unrest. In the first phase, riot police swept through factories making mass arrests. They also raided university campuses, arresting activist students for allegedly supporting North Korea. That charge falls under Seoul's fearsome National Security Law, which allows long sentences merely for expressing proscribed opinions. 
 Things got even worse after Kim Il Sung died on July 8. Radical students sought to travel north for the funeral and hold public memorial services in the South. These expressions of public sympathy for the man who started the Korean War outraged Southern conservatives and led to intensified campus repression.
Kim Il Sung is widely reviled in the South, where families mourn the relatives and homes they lost in the war. More recently, the North has sponsored acts of terrorism and compels Seoul to remain on constant defense alert. Meanwhile, South Korea's student radicals are notorious for their often simple-minded politics and sometimes violent protest. But suppressing speech and locking people up for their unpopular opinions will not fortify South Korea against external danger.
One reason the South has proved more successful than the North is that it has always been the more open society of the two. But even in Seoul, the word "open" has been qualified. For years, military regimes encouraged economic daring while maintaining tight control over political activities.
That dichotomy broke down under pressure from domestic dissidents and, at crucial moments, pressure from the United States. Since 1987 South Korea has moved toward full political democracy; since early last year it has been led by a former dissident leader, Kim Young Sam.
Mr. Kim should know better than to round up radicals under the National Security Law. The Clinton Administration earlier this year publicly expressed its concerns about the law as well as its hope that Seoul would repeal the statute as soon as possible.
More recently, however, Washington has lowered its voice on human rights issues in general and has seemed particularly reluctant to raise such issues with South Korea in the midst of the nuclear crisis. That reluctance has given Seoul exactly the wrong message. A fresh expression of American concern and hope is urgently needed.

HEADLINE: Farmers and Consumers Have Been Had

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your July 25 front-page article on the rebellion of Iowa farmers against subsidies: Farmers are not getting a good deal from the Government. Farmers reluctantly accepted that if we increased production at artificially low prices, a subsidy would replace the shortfall. That allows the political establishment to give an appearance of cheap food. 
 Both farmers and consumers have been had. Farm programs have artificially reduced farm income to such a level that we liquidate about 500 farms a week and have helped destroy rural America's infrastructure.
America's small towns are not prospering. Their physical decline and the aging of their populations are both the result of national policy.
Food is cheap only at the farm gate. Real food costs must include the cost to the taxpayers to maintain this "cheap-food" policy. Taxes and income will be consumed to pay the increasing national debt this policy in part creates.
If food is so cheap, why do 26 million Americans need food stamps?
Our economy's farm sector lacks the income to cover its costs even with the subsidy. It lacks the income to purchase other goods and services provided by the rest of the economy.
Debate on a new farm bill has been confined to more of the same. We can't let Congress avoid these issues.
The American farmer never wanted to become dependent on subsidies for income. But the choice was to take the subsidy or nothing. We want to do our job and to be paid fairly. We regard the food consumers of America as our greatest ally. Perhaps together we can extract sound policy from Washington.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bond Prices Are Mixed Ahead of U.S. Auctions

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of government securities were mixed yesterday ahead of this week's quarterly Treasury refunding. The market was also bracing for a fresh batch of economic reports that should show how fast the economy is growing, and thus provide a clue as to whether the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates very soon.
Reports on July producer and consumer prices and retail sales could reinforce last Friday's stronger-than-expected employment report, which, analysts said, painted a picture of an economy growing at a brisk pace. 
 The 6 1/4 percent 30-year bond rose 2/32 to a price of 8431/32 for a yield of 7.53 percent, down from 7.54 percent on Friday. The two-year note was unchanged at 9927/32 for a yield of 6.21 percent, while the five-year note slipped 2/32 to 9924/32 for a yield of 6.94 percent and a 10-year dropped 3/32 to 9926/32 for a yield of 7.28 percent.
Matthew F. Alexy, a government trading strategist at CS First Boston, said the government securities market was preparing itself for a Fed action, and cited trading activity in the two-year note as an example.
 
A Spread Narrows
 Last Friday, he said, the yield spread between the 2-year note and 30-year bond narrowed to 134 basis points, the narrowest it has been since April 1991.
"Since the May 17 move by the Fed to a 4.25 percent Federal funds target rate, the two-year note has traded in a 55 basis point range -- between 5.71 percent to 6.26 percent," Mr. Alexy said. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
"We wouldn't be surprised to see rates inside five-years approach three-month highs by mid-August," Mr. Alexy said. "In such an environment the yield curve will flatten further," he added, meaning that the difference between the shorter maturities and longer maturities would narrow.
"The sooner the Federal Reserve reacts in a decisive manner, the closer the arrival of stability on the long end," he said, and he added "early indications are that economic activity will remain subdued over the next three months."
Mr. Alexy said, "If Mr. Greenspan properly manages expectations, inflation will remain in check, and the 30-year bond will not revisit 7.75 percent." With that in mind he suggests that investors should view this week's auctions as an opportunity to get into position for a flatter yield curve.
Traders pointed to rising steel scrap prices as one reason for the market to expect a near-term tightening by the Fed. Steel scrap prices, reportedly one of Mr. Greenspan's favorite inflation guages, are soaring. Prices, after tumbling more than 20 percent this spring, rebounded 12 percent in July and industry analysts predict that prices could return to their 1994 highs, as demand is far outstripping supply.
There is some concern that with the Fed now widely expected to tighten at next week's meeting of its policy making committee, the environment for this week's refunding could not be much worse. The issues will settle just one day before the meeting. Many expect to see no policy change at the meeting, while others predict the Fed will raise rates as much as half a percentage point.
Traders expect that the uncertainty will greatly limit any retail demand during the refunding, which begins with a $17 billion auction of new three-year notes today, followed by $12 billion of new 10-year notes tomorrow, and $11 billion of 30-year bonds on Thursday.
In when-issued trading, the three-year note was offered at a price to yield 6.59 percent, the 10-year note, 7.27 percent, and the 30-year bond at a price to yield 7.42 percent.
At yesterday's auction of new three- and six-month Treasury bills the average rate at auction for a three-month maturity was 4.43 percent, up from 4.35 percent a week ago. The average for a six-month bill rose to 4.93 percent, from 4.75 percent last week. Both averages were the highest in nearly a month.
Following are the results of the weekly bill auction:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.880	97.508	Discounted Rate	4.43%	4.93%	Coupon Yield	4.54%	5.13%	High Price	98.883	97.513	Discounted Rate	4.42%	4.92%	Coupon Yield	4.53%	5.11%	Low Price	98.878	97.508	Discounted Rate	4.44%	4.93%	Coupon Yield	4.55%	5.13%	Accepted at low price	63%	42%	Total applied for	$42,118,569	$48,139,089	Accepted	$12,429,904	$12,457,070	Noncompetitive	$1,465,505	$1,301,683	
 
Both issues are dated Aug. 14, 1994. The three-month bills mature on Nov. 10, 1994, and the six-month bills mature on Feb. 9, 1995.

HEADLINE: Man With a Knife Hurts Seven in a New Haven Coffee Bar

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Aug. 8

 BODY:
A man sitting by himself in a coffee bar in New Haven's arts district pulled out a knife at closing time Sunday night and attacked the other patrons, stabbing or slashing seven people as they screamed and struggled to escape.
The man, identified by the police as Daniel Silva, 38, was caught shortly afterward, trying to pedal away from the bloody scene on a bicycle. Authorities said he cried, "Shoot me!" before he was tackled and subdued. 
 Five of the victims remained hospitalized today, one in serious condition, the others in good or fair condition.
In a city whose reputation has been battered by violent crimes in recent years, including the murder of a Yale student in a robbery attempt and a gang shooting on the courthouse steps, officials sought to assure residents that this attack, on one of New Haven's showcase blocks in one of its safest neighborhoods, had nothing to do with drugs, gangs or urban poverty.
"There is a definite mental-health aspect to the case," the Police Chief, Nicholas Pastore, said, saying that Mr. Silva had a history of personal problems and appeared to be distraught over the recent hospitalization of his mother.
Victims of the stabbings, who described a nightmarish scene of panic and terror inside Koffee, said that nothing seemed unusual there until the attacker pulled out a large knife and began attacking.
The man, wearing a ponytail and beard, seemed calm, "like someone you might see in a place like that," said Martin Bresnick, a composer and adjunct professor at the Yale School of Music, who was stabbed in the right thigh and left arm.
"He was sitting there quietly, just drinking his coffee," Mr. Bresnick said. "There was nothing in his demeanor that would make you think he would get up and start trying to kill people. Then suddenly, I heard someone screaming, 'He's got a knife! He's got a knife!' "
Mr. Bresnick said he was stabbed as he tried to back away from the assailant inside the cafe. His wife, Anna Bresnick, a sculptor who heads the art department at the Educational Center for the Arts further down the block, was caught in the crush of patrons trying to get outside.
 
Running for Help
 Ms. Bresnick said she was sitting in another part of the cafe when the screaming began. "I didn't even know what was happening at first, and then my friend, Ruth Shapiro, was trying to push me out the door," she said. "We were trying to crawl out the door and couldn't move because we had fallen onto the floor and gotten tangled up with each other. I thought I was going to be killed right then and there."
When she got out on the street, Ms. Bresnick said, she saw one woman bleeding heavily and her friend's husband, Bruce Shapiro, an editor for The Nation, lying near the curb. She said she ran several blocks for help, not realizing she had been stabbed in the side, before collapsing on the steps of a brownstone.
Candace Blasi, one of Koffee's owners, said 15 to 20 people were in the cafe when the attack occurred just before 10 P.M. One of the seven victims was an employee, Cristina Koning, 22.
The Bresnicks were fortunate enough to be able to go home after being treated for their injuries. Mr. Shapiro, 35, was reported in fair condition at Yale-New Haven Hospital, as was Richard Coleberg, 24. The hospital said that Emily Bernard, 27, was in serious condition, and that Ms. Koning, 22, was in good condition. Kerstin Braig, 29, was reported in fair condition at the Hospital of St. Raphael.
Mr. Silva was being held on $700,000 bond on seven counts of first-degree assault and one count of possession of a dangerous weapon. The police said he was unemployed, and they would not comment on whether he had been treated for psychological problems. He was not known to the patrons or employees of Koffee, which is frequented by Yale graduate students and faculty members who live and work in the area.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 24, 1994, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Aug. 9 about the stabbing of seven people in a New Haven coffee bar referred incorrectly to one of the people on the scene. He is Bruce Shapiro, a stabbing victim, not Ruth Shapiro. No one named Ruth Shapiro was involved in the incident. The article also said Mr. Shapiro was married, but he is not.

HEADLINE: Invasion That Never Comes Has Many Haitians Skeptical

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Haitians are asking foreigners here, especially Americans, many variations on a single question, now that the United Nations has authorized an American-led invasion of this country and economic sanctions are at last fully in place: What are you waiting for? When are you coming? Why aren't you already here?
The Haitian economy is in a shambles, with half the work force said to be unemployed. A lack of electricity and gasoline has severely circumscribed all aspects of daily life, leaving most people at home with nothing to do. Tempers are short and the anxiety level, already high, is rising as a result of the state of siege Haiti's military-dominated Government declared last week in response to the United Nations resolution. 
 In such an atmosphere, the invasion Washington has repeatedly threatened if Gen. Raoul Cedras and other military leaders do not step down has come to be seen by many Haitians as deliverance from privation and uncertainty.
"Waiting, waiting, waiting," a clerk at a transportation company here complained a few days ago. "We're tired. It's time to finish this."
Publicly, of course, no Haitian is willing to acknowledge support for an American invasion. A decree issued by the Justice Ministry after the Aug. 1 declaration of a state of siege makes it a crime to advocate any form of foreign military intervention.
But in private, many welcome the prospect of military intervention as the only certain way to end to the wild swings of emotion they have endured since the country's elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was overthrown in a military coup three years ago next month.
"People aren't just fed up," one diplomat said. "They are mentally exhausted."
Acceptance of intervention is probably most widespread among the poor, who are accustomed to having their fates decided by others. But it can also be detected among the more well-to-do, including some who don't particularly like Father Aristide's populism but are eager for a resolution of the crisis.
"I want to get my business going again and my employees back to work," one American-educated executive said, looking forward to the eventual benefits of an invasion and lifting of sanctions against Haiti. "But you ought to do it soon, because the longer you wait, the more difficult it is going to be for us to rebuild."
Many here feel that the United States is toying with Haiti and its people. Those concerns are exacerbated, and nationalist suspicions awakened, any time a Congressman talks about establishing an American "protectorate" here or the suggestion is made that perhaps a United Nations trusteeship should be installed.
Viewing American policy, some people here detect evidence of a sinister conspiracy. Last month, for instance, five left-wing groups that support Father Aristide issued statements accusing the United States of seeking the failure of economic sanctions in order to weaken Haiti and prepare the way for an American takeover. "Don't be fooled," warned the Haitian Clerical Conference, one of the groups.
 
'The Magic Phone Call'
 Others subscribe to what is sometimes called "the magic phone call" theory. Citing American involvement in the overthrow of Jean-Claude Duvalier and two of the generals who succeeded him, Henri Namphy and Prosper Avril, they argue that all it would take to end the crisis is for the American Ambassador, William L. Swing, to make a single phone call to General Cedras, telling him it is time for him to go.
"That's how you Americans have always resolved these things in Haiti," one Haitian radio journalist argued. "What is keeping Swing from making the call? Is it the Pentagon?"
Given those doubts about American intentions, the latest round of statements out of Washington has baffled and perplexed people here. No sooner had the United Nations passed the July 31 resolution authorizing the use of "all necessary means" to remove General Cedras than the Defense Department began telling reporters that a decision on American military action here was weeks away.
 
Mixed Messages Perceived
 Almost simultaneously, Venezuela, a member with the United States of a five-country group that has been leading the effort to restore Father Aristide, announced a new diplomatic initiative that would entail one last round of negotiations with the military. That effort appears to have foundered, but it demonstrated the disarray within the pro-Aristide coalition and dismayed those here who had been hoping action was near.
American officials here say that they have tried to explain to Haitians that a multiplicity of voices is natural in a democracy like the United States. But they acknowledge that in a country with no democratic tradition, where power is wielded like a club and compromise seen as a sign of weakness, those explanations are largely unconvincing.
"Every time there is a sign of might, there is also what appears to be a sign of appeasement," one Latin American diplomat here said. The Haitian military interprets that as an invitation to stay on, he said, and the Haitian people are left "sitting on the edge of their seats, shaking their heads and waiting for this particular movie to end."

HEADLINE: Millionaire Nominated to Face Georgia Governor

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Georgia Republicans yesterday chose an Atlanta millionaire to face Gov. Zell Miller in the Nov. 8 general election.
The nominee, Guy Millner, founded Norrell Services, the nation's sixth-largest temporary services agency. He defeated John Knox, a former mayor of Waycross in southeast Georgia, in a runoff with 59 percent of the vote. The second election was needed when neither candidate got 50 percent of the vote in the July 19 primary. 
 In Colorado, another millionaire, an oilman named Bruce Benson, easily won the Republican nomination to challenge Gov. Roy Romer, who was unopposed in his bid for a third term. Republicans have not held the governor's office in two decades.
Elsewhere, South Carolina Republicans overwhelmingly favored keeping the Confederate battle flag flying over the Statehouse in primary voting there.
Despite the threat of a boycott by civil rights groups, Republican voters supported keeping the flag by a margin of 76 percent to 24 percent, with 87 percent of precincts reporting. Republicans put the nonbinding question about the flag on their ballot to increase interest in their primary for governor.
In that race, former State Representative David Beasley and Representative Arthur Ravenel Jr. were headed for an Aug. 23 runoff after neither got more than half the vote. The current Gov. Carroll A. Campbell, a Republican, is barred from seeking a third consecutive term.
South Carolina's Confederate battle flag has flown atop the Statehouse in Columbia since 1962, but civil rights groups threaten an economic boycott of the state unless the flag comes down by Labor Day.
South Carolina is the last state to fly the flag atop its capitol, though Georgia's and Mississippi's flags incorporate part of the rebel banner in their design.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE;
Excerpts From Opening Statements in Senate Health Care Debate

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the opening statements of the debate on health care bills in the Senate today. The statements by Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic majority leader, and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican minority leader, were provided by Reuters and the Federal Information Systems Corporation, a private transcription service. The texts of statements by Senators Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, were provided by their offices.
 
STATEMENT BY SENATOR MITCHELL

Madam President and members of the Senate, tonight we begin debate on health care reform legislation. We will undertake no more important task in this Congress. What we do will affect every American family. 
 In preparing this legislation, I was guided by one principle: the purpose of health care reform is the well-being of American families. The insurance industry and health professionals are important parts of the system -- but they're a means to an end. The end -- the real goal -- is the well-being and peace of mind that Americans should have with respect to their health care.
Health care reform is a matter of simple justice. Human beings are born unequal in ability and in strength. None of us chooses our family circumstance. None of us is immune to bad luck. We're all susceptible to accident and illness. We all grow old.
Health care takes 14 percent of our gross domestic product -- more than in any other developed nation. Americans pay the highest medical bills in the world. Thirteen years ago, the average family paid about $145 a month for health insurance. Today, that family pays over $430. If we don't control costs, in six year's time, that family will be paying more than $900 a month for health insurance.
All that expense might be worth it, if America led the world in adult lifespan or in low infant mortality. But it doesn't. . . .
 
Ruining Lives
 Some people can't get coverage for the health condition for which they need care. Some people stricken with serious illnesses find that so-called "lifetime insurance limits" are used up long before their condition improves. Some families, whose children have medical needs, find themselves red-lined out of insurance coverage. So, a sick child's healthy brothers and sisters are put at risk. Some families whose parents suffer disabilities as they age face years of providing in-home care or the bankrupting costs of long-term care because there is no affordable alternative.
Everyone engaged in the health care reform effort has heard, first-hand, the stories of people -- ordinary working people, middle class professionals, high school football stars -- whose health bills are ruining their lives and limiting their futures.
Senator Reid [Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada] told us of a man in Nevada who is able and is willing to pay for insurance for his college student daughter, but he can't because there isn't an insurance company in the country that will insure his daughter. She was born with a malfunctioning adrenal gland and is a victim of juvenile diabetes. She takes medication every day to control her symptoms and sometimes, she needs hospitalization. Her father wants to pay for insurance coverage. He can afford to pay for insurance coverage. But he can't find anyone willing to sell it to him.
He told Senator Reid, and I quote: "Neither Laura or I are looking for a government handout. We are willing to pay, even at a premium price. Isn't it ironic that we mandate automobile insurance companies to pool their assets and provide automobile insurance to high risk drivers, but we do not require the same for health insurance companies. Health is far more important than driving." So said a man from Nevada -- and he was right.
If the states can demand that auto insurers cover the risks resulting from bad driving behavior -- behavior that can be controlled and influenced and prevented, it is not beyond our ability to require health insurers to cover those whose conditions don't arise from behavior, but from circumstances and bad luck. My bill will do this. Insurers won't be able to reject a person because that person had the bad luck to be born with a malfunctioning gland, or to contract a disease in childhood, or to suffer an accident with long-term effects, or for any other cause.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
'Crisis of Affordability'
 High costs are driving ordinary Americans to choices that no civilized society should tolerate. Why is our society willing to allow people to experience the degradation, the humiliation of begging for care after a lifetime of hard work and personal responsibility? It's not fair. It should not continue. There are too many people forced into this kind of choice. There is a crisis in American health care. It is a crisis of affordability and price. It has to change.
I have proposed legislation which I believe will meet the need, which will make needed change with the least disruption to the parts of the system that work well for millions of Americans. The problem is that the money we all pay into our system doesn't deliver to those who need it the care they need when they need it at a price they can afford. People with secure, comprehensive insurance coverage -- members of Congress, Federal workers, state employees, or the employees of most large corporations -- are well served by our system.
But, for millions of other Americans, the situation is very different. For them, the difference between financial security and devastation can be as simple and dramatic as an auto accident or a weak heart valve. The difference between secure coverage and an unaffordable policy can be as heartbreaking as one sick child. That's not fair or right. That's why we need reform.
My approach is to build on the existing American health care system of private insurance and expand it to those not now included; Americans who can't afford insurance, people with an illness that insurers won't cover, and people between jobs. My plan would move most of the persons now covered under Medicaid into the same system of private insurance and care as the rest of us. Put another way, my plan would reduce one of the largest government programs -- Medicaid -- and encourage those in that system to buy private insurance policies.
My bill includes all of the insurance market reforms on which there is broad agreement. Insurance companies won't be allowed to reject applicants for pre-existing conditions. Insurance will travel with the person, so Americans won't be locked into jobs. Policy renewal will be guaranteed so people who become ill aren't cut off from coverage just when they need it the most. My bill creates incentives for cost controls through the competitive pressures of employers and consumers looking for the best-priced coverage.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Toward Universal Coverage
 My bill will create universal coverage through a voluntary approach. Based on discussions with the Congressional Budget Office, I am confident that its provisions will assure that 95 percent of all Americans will be covered by guaranteed, portable, renewable insurance over the course of the next six years.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Health insurance for all Americans is the key to reform. Without it, there will be continued cost shifting. We now have a system where some have coverage and some don't. Those who have health insurance are subsidizing those who don't. That's what cost shifting is.
Doctors, hospitals, clinics, and all other health care providers compensate for unpaid care by charging more to the people who have insurance. That added charge isn't paid by the insurance companies. They add it to the premiums that are paid by every insured family and individual. As a result, insured Americans pay as much as 30 percent more for their coverage to pay for cost shifting. The only way to stop cost shifting is to cover everyone.
To make insurance more affordable, my bill provides for the states to create voluntary regional or statewide health purchasing cooperatives. These co-ops won't be allowed to turn down qualified applicants, and they'll be required to offer a choice of plans to all buyers. Any American in a community-rated insurance pool will be able to enter the federal employee health benefits plan. It offers many different plans among which to choose. Many Americans believe they should have the same health care members of Congress get. My bill provides that opportunity.
 
'My Bill Will Expand Choice'
 My plan reaches the millions of Americans who are self-employed, the millions more who are out of work between jobs, and those now covered by Medicaid. It integrates all of these people into a national system of private insurance. With the end of acute care Medicaid, there will be less government involvement, not more.

 	 	 		. . .	 	A major strength in our system is the element of choice. My bill will expand choice, and will increase incentives to compete by price and quality to those offering insurance coverage. Today, most people's health care choices are limited to one plan that their employer offers. My bill requires every employer to offer at least three plans.

 	 	 		. . .	 	To sum up, let's help deal with the problems faced by small businesses who do provide health insurance to their employees, and encourage those who don't to do so.
 
STATEMENT BY SENATOR DOLE
 We all receive a lot of letters on health care and every other issue. And probably the most eloquent one I've seen so far on this issue was passed on to me by Senator Gregg [Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire] and it was written by Dr. John Schimmerhorn, a constituent of his, and I'd like to share a portion of that letter with you.
And I quote: "Recently my 10-year-old son was the victim of a near-drowning. Thanks to the intervention of people at the scene, he survived the initial incident and was transported to a nearby hospital where he received superb care and treatment, was stabilized and then sent to Children's Hospital in Boston, about an hour away from where we were. With God's help and the outstanding care and treatment that he received in the intensive care unit at Children's, my son is awake, alert and sitting up in his room, surviving with virtually all his physical and mental faculties intact.
"After the initial crisis had passed, I sat in quiet reflection over the entire episode, and it dawned on me with chilling clarity that had the Clinton health plan been in effect, the outcome could have been drastically different. In the scheme of things that the president proposed, we would not have been able to send our son to Boston. We would have been relegated to some other hospital, if any. And the penalty for going against the plan would be a $10,000 fine and possible jail sentence.
"I have no feelings of rancor; just fear that events could have been taken out of my control and put in the hands of some unseen, uncaring, bean-counting bureaucrat whose only concern was compliance to a government policy that only leads to mundane mediocrity."
And he concluded his letter by writing: "The choice comes down a simple question. If you were in my place, would you want the freedom to determine your child's care and outcome, or would you rather be forced to accept what the government will give you?" And I think that's what this debate is all about.
 
World's Best Health System
 America has the best health care delivery system in the world. America has the best health care delivery system in the world. America has the best health care delivery system in the world. And I repeat it three times because I'm concerned that actions we might take in this chamber in the next couple of weeks or so will mean those words are no longer true.

 	 	 		. . .	 	A lot of people have experienced miracles in health care in America, and I've been fortunate to be one of those. And had I returned from World War II to any other nation, I'm not certain what would have happened to me. But in America at the time, in my view, I had the best treatment possible. Now, I'm not here to talk about myself because it was large to me, but mine was just one small miracle among the millions that save and improve and prolong the lives of Americans every day, every week and every year.
And what makes those miracles possible is the American commitment to the freedom of individuals and the freedom of markets, and not the government. And there's something else I know from first-hand experience. The fact is, there's nothing worse than not being able to afford health care for yourself and your family. And I think that's very important that we understand that there's many people out there, as the distinguished majority leader has pointed out, who have that problem today.
And Republicans know very well there are people in need, and Republicans want to help. In fact, we've been working for a year and a half on a bipartisan plan under the aegis and leadership of the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, Senator [John H.] Chafee, and probably even into the health care debate before President and Mrs. Clinton.
 
Affordability and Accessibility
 The plan sponsored by myself, Senator Packwood [Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon] and 38 other Republican senators that we introduced today will make our system more affordable and more accessible to millions of Americans. And it will be introduced today. It's 619 pages. . . . And if anybody will read it carefully, instead of passing judgment without reading it, they'll find it does a great deal.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Affordability and accessibility, in my view, are the important two words; if you forget all the others, affordability and accessibility. Everybody wants to help those who are blocked from getting insurance because of a pre-existing condition. We believe we can make health care more affordable and more accessible and we can take care of the pre-existing condition and portability and malpractice reform and pooling for small business and probably 25 other things that, if you had a vote in this chamber, it would be 99 to 1. There would probably be one who didn't get the message. But it'd be almost unanimous.
We believe we can do that without new taxes, without having the government tell you what will be included in your health insurance, and without, in many areas, putting Federal bureaucrats in charge of your health care system. And my colleague from Maine, the majority leader, talked about Social Security. It was 31 pages long. Medicare was 110. Senator Mitchell's bill is 1,410 pages. Ours is 619. So they weren't as complicated. Maybe times weren't as complicated.
And Mr. President, it seems to me this debate is just too important, as has already been stated by the majority leader, to degenerate into false accusations and partisan bickering. And it's too important to be completed in any rushed or haphazard manner. And there are a lot of questions that are going to be asked by members on both sides over the next week, several weeks.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
So Many Questions
 So we ask ourselves questions. Will we trade in a health care system based on individual freedom for one based on government control? That's a legitimate question. Will countless small businesses be forced to close their doors and countless more working Americans lose their jobs because of government mandates? That's a serious question. I don't care what you say about mandates; it's a serious question.

 	 	 		. . .	 	And what about new taxes or increased taxes? Some count 17 new; I only count 16. I don't count Part B Medicare as an increase in taxes, because I've long believed that if you could afford it, you ought to pay a little more. And how much is it going to cost?

 	 	 		. . .	 	We haven't learned anything. We appoint this commission and they tell us if we don't do something by the year -- what is it -- 2005 or 2010, we're going to double taxes, double our taxes. So we set out to say: "Well, that's a terrible problem. Let's create some more entitlement programs right now." And we create a new one in our bill, low-income subsidies. But we don't include prescription drugs or long-term care or early retirees or some of the other entitlement programs that have been talked about.
So somebody has to explain all this to us. Maybe we've overlooked something. We appoint one commission to say there are too many entitlement programs; we ought to do something about it. Then we trot out a bill that blithely creates three or four more big ones. These are big ones. Maybe 100 million or more Americans are going to be subsidized; 100 million or more, much bigger than Social Security and Medicare combined.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Now, my point is, there are hundreds of other questions. I may not even have the important ones. But all of these questions deserve lengthy debate, because I'm certain my colleague from Maine is going to say, "No, that's not quite right," or whatever. And he may want to ask us questions, which is certainly fair. So we're talking about all these questions and more and more and more.
 
Getting Public's Consent
 Mr. President, before a patient has surgery or is given some new experimental treatment, the doctor must explain in plain English the treatment's benefits, its risks, its costs and alternatives. This is called, and I quote, "informed consent." And it is crucial to the trust between the patient and the doctor.
Health care reform is an experimental treatment, too. If there's going to be any trust between our government and the public, then the public must have a chance to grant or not to grant their informed consent. And I think we can ask a very legitimate question. Maybe the public shouldn't have a right to know, but I think the public does have a right to know.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Once the American people had what we called informed consent on the President's bill, it went down and down and down, regardless of the efforts by many in the liberal media who bought into the program and tried to sell it every chance they had -- on the evening news, in the newspapers. But the American people weren't buying because they understand that there's a little tilt out there in the media sometimes. They're all good people, but they have a little different view.
And so the American people said, "Wait a minute." And it wasn't Harry and Louise. It wasn't the Republicans. They said, "Wait a minute. I don't understand the President's bill." And if you walk into a drug store or grocery store and you read the label on some product and you don't understand it, I'll bet you walk on. You don't pick it up. You don't buy it. And the American people didn't buy the Clinton health plan because it was too complicated, too bureaucratic, too many taxes, too many controls, too many mandates.
 
STATEMENT BY SENATOR KENNEDY
 On a personal level, this is a special moment for me. I introduced my first universal health care plan in 1970 and I have been working on this issue ever since. One of my strongest memories is a series of hearings we held around the country in 1978, where we learned of the health care tragedies affecting Americans all over the country.
I remember especially one family, the Corbetts. Their child had spina bifida. The Corbetts' insurance didn't cover the costs of therapy for their son, and their unpaid bills mounted rapidly. Hounded by bill collectors, Mrs. Corbett began to worry about the cost whenever her children needed care. Once, her daughter urgently needed hospitalization after a convulsion. She did what she had to do. But I'll never forget what she told me: "I put my child in the hospital, and I cried. I thought we were going to be wiped out for the rest of our lives."
Think of the pain suffered by the Corbett family almost two decades ago. Multiply it by all the American families who have faced similar crises since then. Hasn't there been enough fear and worry? Should we study the problem for another year, or another decade, so that more American families find themselves in the Corbetts' shoes?

 	 	 		. . .	 	As we discuss the Mitchell bill, it is important that we understand the two alternatives. The first is to do nothing -- and that is simply unacceptable. The second is to adopt the Republican proposal -- and that would be equally wrong.
Senator Dole's proposal has already been cosponsored by 39 of his Republican colleagues -- even though it is not a bill. It is only a 37-page outline. But this outline makes it clear that the Dole bill will not guarantee universal coverage. It will do little for the hard-working middle-class families who cannot afford to insure their families and who need help the most. It will not control costs. And it will cut Medicare while offering nothing to our senior citizens -- not long-term care not prescription drug coverage. It is another example of too little too late.
Medicare was a defining test for Congress a generation ago. Social Security was a defining test in the years of the Depression. This legislation is the defining test for Congress today.
 
STATEMENT BY SENATOR KASSEBAUM
 It is with deepening disappointment that I have watched the evolution of the reform debate in recent months. The leadership legislation now before us reflects an unfortunate accumulation of missed opportunities.
We had an opportunity to simplify the current administrative nightmare that is health insurance. Instead, the bill before us is a 1,400-page tangle of new bureaucracy, red tape and government regulation.
We had an opportunity to focus on the root of the public's concern -- namely rising costs. Instead, the majority leader's bill -- like the Clinton plan that preceded it -- has been constructed almost as if cost were no object. Far from "streamlining" the costly promises in the Clinton proposal, the Mitchell bill would create at least four new entitlements and cost taxpayers a projected $1.1 trillion over the next decade.
We had an opportunity to give Americans the security of a truly basic set of benefits guaranteed for everyone. Instead, the majority leader's bill promises an unreasonably lush package -- one that is more responsive to interest group pressure than it is to what average Americans can afford.
We had an opportunity to be honest about financing. Instead, all of us -- in both parties -- have chosen to pay for our desired new entitlements by chopping into existing ones, namely Medicare and Medicaid. We do this knowing full well that such "savings" are not really savings at all, but rather cost shifts to those who have private insurance.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We all want health insurance available to Americans. However, we need to move toward universal coverage through straightforward subsides based on income, not through an expensive and rickety structure of complex subsides and "triggered" mandates.
We all want to control health care costs. I contend we should do so through market disincentives against high-cost health plans -- not by using heavily regulatory limits on prices in the market.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Photos: "THE PLAYERS: The Senate's Face Off"
 
GEORGE J. MITCHELL
 Democrat of Maine. The majority leader of the Senate, he is retiring after his term expires in January. As he is the principal advocate of the Democratic side of the debate and the author of the bill before the Senate, passage of a measure would be a valedictory to his Senate career.
 
BOB DOLE
 Republican of Kansas. The minority leader and a potential Reprublican presidential candidate, he is a strong opponent of the Mitchell measure, which he says gives the Government too large a role in health care. As the Republican leader, his decision on how hard to work against the Mitchell bill, including whether to try to block it with a filibuster, will be pivotal in the debate.
 
EDWARD M. KENNEDY
 Democrat of Massachusetts. As chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, Senator Kennedy has been a leader of liberal legislative efforts. His panel passed a health care bill more generous than President Clinton's original proposal.
 
NANCY LANDON KASSEBAUM
 Republican of Kansas. Senator Kassebaum is the senior Republican on the Labor and Human Resources and once supported measures like limits on insurance premiums as a way to control health costs, but in recent months has been a loyal supporter of Senator Dole's.

HEADLINE: U.S. Lawmakers Agree On Bosnia Arms Measure

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Senate and House lawmakers have agreed on a measure instructing the Clinton Administration to seek the lifting of the arms embargo against the Muslim-led Bosnian Government before the end of October if the Bosnian Serbs do not agree to a peace settlement.
If by then the Serbs had not agreed to the peace plan and if the United Nations Security Council failed to approve an exemption to the arms embargo, American military forces would be barred from enforcing the arms ban under the Congressional plan. 
 The compromise measure, which was proposed by Senator Sam Nunn and is attached to a bill authorizing military spending, is intended to stave off calls for an immediate lifting of the arms embargo while setting a deadline for action.
 
Backed by Administration
 A senior Clinton Administration official said the White House supported the thrust of Senator Nunn's proposal as a way to gradually increase pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to go along with a peace settlement.
The Security Council imposed an arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia in 1991 in an unsuccessful effort to quell the fighting there. But since the Serbs acquired most of the artillery pieces, tanks and other weapons from the old Yugoslav Army, the ban locked in a Serbian advantage in heavy weapons.
While the Clinton Administration agrees that the arms ban has unfairly hampered the Muslims, it has resisted calls by some lawmakers to unilaterally lift the ban, asserting that such a move would undercut the force of other Security Council resolutions.
"The Nunn approach does reinforce our overall strategy to build up pressure on Bosnian Serbs with the lifting of the arms embargo as a last resort," a senior Clinton Administration official said. "At the same time, it provides leverage with our contact group partners," he said, referring to Britain, France, Germany and Russia.
 
Tightening of Sanctions
 American officials have been trying to work out a United Nations resolution to toughen economic sanctions, particularly controls on financial transactions by Serbian-controlled companies. But the American effort has been slowed by disputes with Britain and other allies about how strict the controls should be.
While supporters of Senator Nunn's proposal portray it as an astute compromise, critics assert that it is intended to buy time for an Administration that has come under growing Congressional pressure to lift the arms ban on Bosnian Government.
"Nunn is trying to save the Administration embarrassment and maintain the status quo," said Marshall Harris, executive director of Action Council for Peace in the Balkans, which supports the Bosnian Government.
Senator Nunn's compromise also falls short of Senator Bob Dole's proposal to unilaterally exempt the Bosnian Government from the embargo by mid-November if a peace settlement is not reached.
Senator Nunn's plan, which has been accepted by Senate and House conferees on legislation authorizing military spending, has a number of elements.
 
A Move at the U.N.
 If the Bosnian Serbs continue to resist a peace settlement, the Clinton Administration would introduce a resolution in the United Nations Security Council before the end of October exempting the Bosnian Government from the arms embargo and would actively work for adoption of the measure.
This element of Mr. Nunn's plan is not legally binding, but Congressional aides say President Clinton has promised to go along with it. If the United States was unable to muster support in the Security Council to lift the arms ban, Senator Nunn's plan would prohibit spending funds for American military units enforcing the arms ban. To prevent the Security Council debate from dragging on, the provision cutting off funds could go into effect by mid-November.
American officers attached to NATO command centers could be exempted from the ban on American enforcement if President Clinton thought such an exception was necessary. This provision was added so that the legislation would not have the effect of stripping American officers from important command positions in NATO.
 
Link to Attacks on 'Safe Areas'
 If the Serbs stepped up their attacks on the Muslim "safe areas," Senator Nunn's plan calls on President Clinton to immediately seek Security Council approval for the selective lifting of the arms embargo so that weapons could be delivered to the enclaves that were under attack.
While Administration officials expressed hope that Senator Nunn's move could strengthen their hand with the allies to build pressure on the Bosnian Serbs, Serbia's five-day-old announcement that it was cutting off trade with Bosnia's Serbs, except for food and medicine, has complicated Washington's efforts to tighten economic sanctions.
Generous logistical support from Serbia has been an important factor behind the Bosnian Serbs' ability to capture most of Bosnia, and a prolonged cut-off of supplies from Belgrade would hurt them. But President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia made a similar promise to cut off assistance to the Bosnian Serbs a year ago and never followed through.
Administration officials said that their basic plan was to propose tightened sanctions on trade with Belgrade. The sanctions against Serbia would be eased if Belgrade agreed to allow monitors on its border to verify that it was cutting off aid to the Bosnian Serbs.
"It will take some time to assess fully whether the closure of the border is effective," Secretary of State Warren Christopher told reporters en route from Israel. "It's a long border with a number of crossing points."
"All I can say is there are some encouraging early indications," he said. "But we will be very cautious before we express any final evaluation."

HEADLINE: Months After the Quake, Ghost Towns in the City of Angels

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Aug. 3

 BODY:
In one abandoned apartment after another along Hubbard Street in Sylmar, wall calendars are open to January, when normal life came to a halt. Scavengers have picked through the rooms so thoroughly that there is almost no sign left of the lives that were lived here before the Jan. 17 earthquake.
Only a few mattresses and broken couches remain. Air-conditioners, refrigerators, even door handles and wall thermostats, have been stripped away. 
 In one littered apartment here in the northern San Fernando Valley, a Jan. 30 edition of The Los Angeles Daily News, evidently brought in by squatters, carries the headline: "The Northridge Earthquake: Some Hard Lessons in Survival."
Nearly seven months after the quake, Los Angeles is still plagued by single blocks or entire neighborhoods of these vacant, damaged buildings, populated by squatters, drug addicts and gangs, as they await demolition or repair.
 
123 Ghost Towns Identified
 The city has identified at least 12 "ghost towns," as they are known here, mostly in the San Fernando Valley, the epicenter of the earthquake, which measured 6.7 on the Richter scale. The areas include scores of low-rent apartments in the Sylmar section of the city as well as two clusters of a dozen or so condominiums and single-family homes in the comfortable Sherman Oaks area.
Though emergency repairs were rapid, and the city's freeways were reopened ahead of schedule, government regulations and bureaucratic procedures, insurance conflicts and a lack of money have slowed housing reconstruction, especially in apartment buildings.
While right after the quake there were 50,200 vacant housing units citywide, that number is now down to 19,400 vacant units, including apartments, condominiums and houses. City statistics show that 4,029 of those units are in the 12 ghost towns.
Many property owners did not have earthquake insurance. Applications for Federal assistance have set records, and the Government has pledged $11.2 billion in aid, more than for any previous disaster.
 
600 Applications a Day
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which received twice as many applications as for any previous natural disaster, is still receiving 500 to 600 new applications each day.
Applicants say paperwork and coordination of aid have been nightmarish, and it was only in late July that the city began fencing off and patrolling the filthy and vandalized ghost towns.
Last week, President Clinton announced that he was asking Congress to allocate an additional $225 million primarily "to solve this ghost town problem." The money, which would come from leftover Federal money for repairing freeways and schools, would provide interest-free loans.
Officials say that the ghost town problem can be partly traced to the defeat in June of a $2 billion statewide bond issue for earthquake recovery, which would have included $576 million to provide loans for building repairs. Even though the Federal Government is paying 90 percent of those repairs, that meant California could not pay its 10 percent of the disaster repair costs. Without state help, earthquake victims have besieged Federal agencies.
 
'Things Are Getting Worse'
 As the months have passed, the 12 urban black holes, each with a dozen or more buildings, have blighted their surrounding areas, residents and officials say. Nearby residents are fleeing the neighborhoods, and local retail businesses are collapsing and closing.
"Things are getting worse rather than better," said Richard Close, president of a homeowners association in the Sherman Oaks section. "In areas where 70 percent of residences are vacated we are finding that the remaining 30 percent of people are now moving out because they don't want to live in a ghost town."
"The cleaners, the shoemaker and the little retail establishments just don't have the population they need to survive," he continued. "So even if they physically survived the earthquake, now they are finding major economic problems."
Michael J. Ourieff, owner of Michael J.'s Italian Kitchen, which is on Ventura Boulevard near a ghost town in Sherman Oaks, estimates that the vacancy rate on his street is 40 to 50 percent. Though business was not so bad right after the quake, he said, many people have since moved. "We've been forgotten," he said. "Our business is way, way off."
One vacant store on Ventura Boulevard belonged to Leo Shahinian, who lost his men's clothing stop after business dropped 40 percent. "The damage from the earthquake was significant, but we were able to patch things up," he said. "Then people started moving away."
 
'Giving Up Everything'
 Barry Wegman, a lawyer, owned a $159,000 condominium in a 30-unit building in Studio City that was severely damaged in the earthquake. The building did not have insurance, and his owners association has voted to walk away from it.
"We're giving up everything," he said. "It now goes to the banks. I'm financially wiped out. My cash flow is next to nothing."
Mr. Wegman, who said he lost about $30,000 in equity, applied to the Small Business Administration for low-cost loans but has received no response. He did receive a check from the emergency agency for $3,400 for his moving expenses and is now living with his parents.
In the deserted neighborhoods, rats and cockroaches have proliferated. Stagnant swimming pools have become breeding grounds for mosquitoes, and city officials recently ordered them drained or stocked them with insect-eating fish.
On Hubbard Street in the Sylmar section, vandals shattered windows and sliding glass doors and threw a toilet out a window.
 
Prostitutes and Fires
 Before a recent sweep of the area, prostitutes used looted sofas outside on the curb to wait for customers.
"I come up here every day, three or four times a day, to kick somebody out of here," said Howard January, a security guard hired by the city to keep out squatters. "I had a guy come in last week shopping for clothes. 'Oh, I'm just here looking for clothes.' I said, 'Go ahead and look.' "
In one building, squatters started a fire that burned most of one apartment. Firefighters turned on the water supply to fight it, and since then, Mr. January said, homeless people have been coming by to take showers.
This summer, the city formed an Earthquake Ghost Town Task Force to direct efforts to board up buildings and remove graffiti and debris, and the City Council acted recently to step up that work.
At the end of July, the Federal Emergency Management Agency had received 606,643 applications for assistance, said Marty Zucker, a spokesman for the agency; that surpassed the 304,000 applications filed after Hurricane Hugo in 1989, the previous record. Mr. Zucker said the agency expected to pay out a total of $5.5 billion for the Northridge earthquake.
A spokeswoman for the Federal Small Business Administration said it was processing more applications for low-interest loans than in all disasters over the past five years combined.
"We have had, in the last five years, seven of what we refer to as major, major disasters," said the spokeswoman, Lisa Cookie, listing Hurricane Hugo, the Loma Prieta earthquake in San Francisco, the 1992 Los Angeles riots, Florida's Hurricane Andrew, Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii, Typhoon Omar on Guam and the 1993 Midwest floods. "We have received and processed more applications than we did in the combined total of all those others."

HEADLINE: German Court Criticized for Its Treatment of a Holocaust Skeptic

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BONN, Aug. 9

 BODY:
A German court has come under criticism for suspending the one-year sentence of a veteran far-right leader convicted of publicly inciting racial hatred against the Jews. The court said he probably would not do it again now that he knew it was against the law.
The far-right leader is Gunter A. Deckert, national chairman of the 5,000-member National Democratic Party. He was found guilty in 1992 after organizing a meeting in Weinheim where he translated and embellished a speech by an American skeptic, Fred A. Leuchter Jr., casting doubt on the historical fact of the Holocaust. 
 Earlier this year, Germany's highest court ordered Mr. Deckert retried on the ground that he could be convicted only if he had publicly expressed views that were clearly his own. Publicly denying the existence of the Holocaust is a crime under German law, and Mr. Leuchter, who lives in Massachusetts, was also charged, but he has not been tried.
 
Sentence Suspended
 Last June, the three-judge Mannheim court that had convicted him retried Mr. Deckert, 51, a former high school teacher. In its latest ruling, published this week, the court found no doubt that at the meeting, in November 1991, he had clearly violated German law by telling the audience that the Holocaust was a myth.
The court rejected his appeal for acquittal but suspended his sentence in the expectation that he would be more careful next time.
It also rejected the view that Mr. Deckert should have been given a harsher sentence because of the 5,000 far-right attacks against Jews, foreign asylum-seekers and Turkish families that have taken 24 lives in Germany since 1992.
Some leading German politicians have expressed dismay with parts of the ruling.
A leading legislator from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, Heiner Geissler, said: "The decision proves, unfortunately, that right-wing radical thinking has also penetrated the thinking of a few judges, and the heads of some people in German justice. You can practically read the decision as a legal guide to how to deny the Holocaust and make anti-Semitic statements without fear of punishment."
Germany's domestic security service, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, classified Mr. Deckert's party in its 1993 annual report as an extremist group that encouraged anti-Semitism and racism. The party is not a contender in national elections on Oct. 16.
The court did not respond to Mr. Geissler's criticism of its ruling on a German television program, "Report," on Monday night, but made the full 67-page decision available today.
The news magazine Der Spiegel this week also criticized the court's reasoning.
"The accused made a good impression at trial," the court's decision said. "He is a strong-willed, responsible personality with clear principles who defends his political views with great dedication and a considerable expenditure of time and energy.
"The court believes such a man when he professes obedience to the law, as he did expressly during the trial," the ruling said. "It is to be expected that the accused will stay on the right side of the law in future simply by virtue of his conviction."
Mr. Decker is unemployed and has long been under Government surveillance but had no earlier convictions.
The judges said Mr. Deckert was not an anti-Semite in the racist Nazi sense, but a nationalist who bitterly resented the financial, political and moral demands that Jews continued to make on Germany 50 years after World War II.
They said they were also under no illusion that Mr. Deckert would change his views about the Holocaust, but expected that he would be more careful in the future about expressing them. "We are also not unmindful of the difficult circumstances of the accused, who had to give up his much-loved profession as a teacher after a long and successful career," the judges said.
Though it found he had only his own conduct to blame, the court noted that he had been allowed to teach for years in the southern state of Baden-Wurttemberg by authorities who were aware of his connections with the National Democratic Party and only ordered him to sever them a decade ago.

Firebomb Destroys Mosque
 BOBLINGEN, Germany, Aug. 9 (AP) -- A firebomb destroyed a mosque early today in southern Germany, the latest of several attacks against Turkish-owned buildings.
No injuries were reported in the fire, in Sindelfingen, outside Stuttgart. Both right-wing radicals and Kurds came under suspicion.

HEADLINE: Bosnian Army Makes Gains On Key Fronts

BYLINE: By CHUCK SUDETIC, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Though its advances are relatively modest and may not endure, Bosnia's outgunned army has for the first time in more than two years pressed forward along key battlefronts across this war-ravaged country.
United Nations officials announced today that forces of the Muslim-led Bosnian Government were on the verge of winning their most significant victory of the war after routing the main body of a pro-Serbian Muslim militia. 
 Under the command of Fikret Abdic, a businessman and underworld figure, the militia has held a northwestern Bosnian enclave named after its main town, Bihac.
A Bosnian Army thrust toward Mr. Abdic's last stronghold, the town of Velika Kladusa, has sent more than 7,000 rebel soldiers and their family members fleeing northward into a Serbian-held area of Croatia.
Bosnia's official news agency reported today that the Bosnian Army's V Corps had met almost no resistance in capturing 30 villages and 23 square miles of territory in the Bihac pocket. Army commanders told radio reporters that Velika Kladusa would fall within days with little effort.
The army suffered only three wounded in three days and took some 1,400 Abdic loyalists prisoner, a United Nations spokesman said.
"Bihac will now become one more area where the Bosnians will be able to turn their full attention toward the Serbs," another United Nations spokesman said. "Abdic was a thorn in their side, and his defeat will be a boost for the Bosnians' morale."
 
U.N. Fears Rise in Violence
 Surprising even their commanders, Bosnian Army forces have also advanced to within a few thousand yards of a critical Serbian supply line near the northern town of Brcko and routed Serbian forces southeast of the town of Vares.
Today, Sarajevo Radio also reported the capture of high ground that the Serbs had used for more than two years to bombard the town of Gracanica.
United Nations officials here are worried that the Bosnians' military advances -- combined with economic pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to accept a peace plan, and calls in Washington for the lifting of the arms embargo against the Bosnian Government and for more air strikes against the Serbs -- presage an intensification of violence that would force an end to the United Nations peacekeeping mission here.
"Many troop-contributing nations would say they've done enough trying to make peace in a war zone and it's time to turn our investment elsewhere," said the United Nations military commander in Bosnia, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose.
The United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia threaten to press the United Nations Security Council to stiffen economic sanctions against Serbia if the Bosnian Serbs continue to reject a plan that would require them to recognize Bosnia's sovereignty and hand back a third of the territory they control.
The Bosnian Serbs' main military and economic supporter, Serbia, stopped most commerce with Bosnia on Thursday, though border crossings reopened on Sunday to private cars. But the rebels have sworn to fight on to create a greater Serbian state.
 
Temptation for Bosnians
 United Nations commanders have said that if the embargo amounts to more than just another bluff, the rebel Serbs' huge weapons superiority in Bosnia will evaporate and tempt the mostly Muslim Bosnian Army to try for more territory.
"The evidence should start to emerge in two or three months," General Rose said. But he added that he did not expect the Bosnian Army to be able to assemble enough firepower, trained men and logistical savvy to mount a full-scale offensive for more than a year.
"Modern armies work on fuel," General Rose said, referring to the rebel Serbs' dependence on Serbia for oil. "Without fuel, you've just got lumps of metal."
Bosnian Serb leaders have closed gasoline stations to all but military vehicles, and have ordered the mobilization of the entire adult population into work brigades to free able-bodied men for military service.
The Bosnian Serbs are also reported to have intensified an "ethnic cleansing" campaign against minority Muslims in the Serbian-held town of Bijeljina.
 
Serbian Retaliation Possible
 General Rose said the Bosnian Army advances might spark a violent Serbian response against the most susceptible Government-controlled areas in Bosnia: Sarajevo and three Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnia, Gorazde, Zepa and Srebrenica.
"It doesn't look very good at the moment," he said. "The Bosnian Army is not in the state to be able to defend the enclaves. I'm not saying Sarajevo would be overrun, but it would be pounded. It would be a catastrophe of enormous proportions."
General Rose was referring to a potential breakdown of the heavy-weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo, which was imposed by a NATO ultimatum that ended the 22-month Serbian bombardment of Sarajevo six months ago.
General Rose officially says that no more than six rebel-Serb heavy weapons are inside the Sarajevo exclusion zone. But Bosnian radio reported today that the Serbs had used howitzers and mortars inside the zone to shell the towns of Visoko and Breza, from which the Bosnians have mounted recent infantry and artillery attacks.
And it is an open secret in Sarajevo that the Bosnian Army has smuggled mortars, antitank guns and other weapons into the city.

HEADLINE: Chip Index Drops in July

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., Aug. 9

 BODY:
The Semiconductor Industry Association's closely watched book-to-bill ratio fell to 1.04 in July, down from June's revised 1.07.
"That's basically what we were looking for," said Brett Hodess, an analyst with Montgomery Securities. "That means we saw slightly less than the usual seasonal decline in bookings." 
 Analysts had expected the ratio to fall to about 1.03, because of a seasonal summer slowdown.
The ratio is an indicator of future demand for semiconductors. A book-to-bill ratio of 1.04 indicates that for every $100 in chip shipments in the North American market, semiconductor companies took in $104 in new orders. A ratio of more than 1.0 implies that the market is expanding.
The June ratio was revised downward, from 1.08.
Billings for July, based on a three-month average, decreased 2.5 percent, to $2.65 billion from $2.78 billion in June. Shipments increased 29.6 percent from the July 1993 mark of $2.04 billion.
Actual billings in the month were $2.31 billion, up 26 percent from June's record billings of $3.11 billion, and 25 percent higher that the July 1993 number of $1.85 billion.

HEADLINE: Productivity Of Workers Down 1.2%

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
In a sign that the current business expansion is reaching a mature phase, the Labor Department reported yesterday that the productivity of American workers fell at an annual rate of 1.2 percent during the second quarter -- the first decline in more than a year.
And, in a report economists said could lead the Government to revise downward its estimate of second-quarter growth in coming months, the Commerce Department said stockpiles of unsold wholesale goods fell four-tenths of 1 percent during June. 
 The figure suggests that businesses were not stockpiling goods as rapidly as the Commerce Department estimated when it released preliminary figures for second-quarter economic growth last month.
 
The Inventory Debate
 The sharp gains in inventories reported then sparked a sharp debate in the stock and bond markets about their impact on the economy and on the possible timing of another short-term interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve.
Many analysts had said the rise in inventories, combined with a sharp slowdown in consumer spending, would lead to slower economic growth and a cutback in manufacturing and production in the months ahead. But others, including officials at the Federal Reserve, were worried that consumer spending could rebound and, therefore, the economy could actually grow faster.
Neither of yesterday's reports had much impact on financial markets, partly because a drop in productivity had been widely expected and partly because monthly inventory numbers are subject to constant revision.
The 1.2 percent drop in productivity during the second quarter followed gains of 4.1 percent and 4.9 percent in the third and fourth quarters of 1993 and a revised 2.9 percent rise in the first three months of 1994. Previously, the Labor Department had reported a 1.9 percent gain in productivity during the first quarter.
Analysts noted that the big gains during the second half of last year were consistent with an economy in an early phase of expansion, a period when businesses, in an effort to control costs, work employees longer and harder rather than add to payrolls.
But job growth has been strong since the start of the year -- just under two million jobs have been created in the last seven months. That sort of growth in employment means that productivity, which measures the time, effort and cost of producing goods, is bound to decline.
Reflecting the surge in employment, the Labor Department said the number of hours worked increased by 5.4 percent in the second quarter, more than double the increase reported for the January-March period. The gain in hours was the largest since a 6.1 percent rise in the second quarter of 1988.
"As the expansion continues to mature, the sharp productivity gains of the recent past will probably slow," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities Inc.
During the second quarter, manufacturing productivity, which has outpaced overall productivity in recent years, rose at a 3.8 percent annual rate, the Labor Department said, down from a 6.8 percent increase in the first quarter.
Meanwhile, total business productivity, including farming, fell by 1.4 percent, after rising 2.8 percent during the first quarter.
 
Wage Figures 'Well Behaved'
 Even with the sharp increase in payroll employment, labor costs remained largely in check. Unit labor costs for nonfarm businesses rose 2.0 percent in the second quarter, after a 3.1 percent advance in the first three months.
"The wage numbers were very well behaved," said Stuart G. Hoffman, senior vice president and senior economist at PNC Financial Corporation in Pittsburgh. "You worry about productivity dropping because it suggests you are adding to unit labor costs. But these figures were a bit of a silver lining" in the productivity report.
Mr. Hoffman and other analysts said they expect the productivity numbers to improve a bit in the second half of the year, in large part because they expect a slowdown in economic growth. A slowdown could lead businesses to add workers at a less rapid rate.
"We see employment growth slowing down a little bit, and think the Federal Reserve Board is cooling off the economy a little bit," said David A. Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources Inc., the economic forecasting firm.
 
Smaller Stockpiles
 In its inventory report, the Commerce Department said stocks at wholesalers fell by four-tenths of a percent in June, to $222.3 billion, after posting a 1.6 percent increase in May.
Inventories of durable goods like motor vehicles and machinery fell by one-tenth of a percent. Inventories of nondurable items like clothing and groceries fell by a similar amount.
The wholesale inventory number for June follows an earlier report from manufacturers which showed their inventories were virtually unchanged during that month.
Economists will get another piece of the inventory picture on Friday, when business inventory figures are scheduled to be released.
Based on the June numbers that have been reported, Mr. Hoffman said that "some of the inventories that were built up in April and May, particularly at the wholesale level, were partly worked off."
Mr. Fine said the drop in wholesale inventories for June "suggests there could be a downward revision in the inventory component of gross domestic product."
But that adjustment need not mean that the overall growth figure of 3.7 percent will change much, he added, "because that change says nothing about possible offsets that might be made in other areas" of subsequent revisions.

HEADLINE: Veneuela Announces Bank Rescue Package

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Venezuela announced a $294 million rescue package today for the nation's second largest bank and claimed a long-running crisis in the financial sector had reached its final chapter.
The financial rescue package for Banco de Venezuela, which has 2.5 million depositors, came a day after the Government seized the struggling institution.
It was the tenth bank officials have taken over since January in a liquidity crisis that has dogged President Rafael Caldera's six-month-old government and exacerbated Venezuela's already severe recession.
The Government also announced at least $253 million in emergency loans to four other banks with liquidity or solvency problems.
An unspecified number of other banks managed to rescue themselves without state aid after shareholders pledged fresh capital to keep them afloat, Norys Aguirre, president of the Government's deposit insurance agency Fogade, said.
Seven other banks avoided the same fate on Monday after shareholders pledged $765 million in fresh capital to keep them afloat.
Information Minister Guillermo Alvarez Bajares said these measures represented "the definitive solution to the problems that have been confronting the national financial system."
 
Normal Operations to Continue
 Mr. Bajares, the chief Government spokesman, insisted all the banks affected would continue operating normally.
"All the financial institutions will keep their doors open to attend the public," he said. "The measures only concern the administration of some banks and in no case affect depositors."
Other top officials, moving to reassure a skeptical and nervous public, said no more banks would be taken over and all deposits at Banco de Venezuela and the other seven banks were fully guaranteed by the state.
Despite such reassurances, analysts criticized the government for effectively nationalizing a large section of the bank industry and failing to tackle the roots of the liquidity crisis.
"Now we have a nationalized bank system, which was the only element lacking to complete the government's model of economic controls," Venezuelan economist Tobias Nobrega said. He was referring to price and currency controls introduced by Caldera June 27.
Jose Grasso, a banker and financial analyst, said the 10 banks taken over since the crisis began in January, together with the other seven that needed capital, represented more than half the financial sector's assets and deposits.
Other economists warned that more of Venezuela's 50 banks would face liquidity problems if the Government did not restore public confidence by guaranteeing all deposits, tightening regulation of the banking sector and quickly improving Venezuela's general economic panorama.
At a news conference today, Mr. Aguirre said authorities hoped to sell Banco de Venezuela to United States or European investors after restructuring and bolstering it with the new funds.
Mr. Bajares said the takeover of Banco Venezuela and the accords reached with the other seven banks were part of the Government's long-term economic stabilization program, which he said would be announced in two weeks.

Doubts Raised on Number of Internet Users

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
Has the Internet been overhyped?
Even as cyberspace is being touted as the hippest place to congregate since the original Woodstock, some experts now contend that estimates of the number of people actively using the Internet web of computer networks may be grossly exaggerated. 
 There is still widespread agreement that the growth of the Internet, and the number of people using it, is exponential; it is seen doubling in size every year. But some network experts say the most commonly cited numbers -- 20 million to 30 million users worldwide -- may be many times too high.
"Suppose there were really only two million or three million," said John S. Quarterman, a highly regarded Internet demographer in Austin, Tex.
In an assessment potentially chilling to all the businesses betting millions of dollars on the premise that they can sell advertising, information and products to the Internet masses, Mr. Quarterman believes that his lower numbers may be a more accurate count of people who are active and reachable on the computer network.
The latest comprehensive survey that tries to estimate the Internet's reach discovered more than 3.2 million "host" computers capable of communicating directly with other computers on the Internet. The data, released late last week by Mark K. Lottor of the consultants Network Wizards of Menlo Park, Calif., marked a stunning increasing of one million additional machines since the survey was last taken in January.
But while Mr. Quarterman and some other experts do not dispute this raw count of Internet computers, they take issue with the common assumption that each of those machines represents an Internet port of entry for perhaps 10 people working from desktop computers. Moreover, the skeptics suggest that as many as one million or more of those Internet ports, and the millions of people who use them, may be walled off to much of the potential incoming traffic on the Internet, as corporations erect electronic "fire walls" in response to mounting concern over computer security and intrusions by hackers.
If Mr. Quarterman's analysis is correct, then his calculations further blur the already vague notion that electronic culture and commerce is just around the corner. Certainly his assessment does much to debunk the myth of an interactive, information web that will eventually link everyone on the planet.
Estimates that there are more than 20 million users of the Internet have excited the imagination of businesses, politicians, social scientists, investors and journalists.
The Internet has been described as a prototype of the Clinton Administration's proposed information superhighways. Companies seeking to tap a vast new customer base are spending millions to stake out storefronts in cyberspace, and Internet-related businesses are popping up in every city of significant size. An Internet electronic mail address is considered de rigueur for business cards today, and even the White House is "on the Net."
The Internet is popular, all right. But is it a less dynamic force than we've all been led to believe?
To be sure, there are those who contend that even the estimates of 20 million to 30 million Internet users are too low, if one counts the users of smaller public and private computer networks, like America Online and Prodigy, that are linked to the Internet mainly to exchange electronic mail. But such links do not allow users to employ some of the most significant features of the Internet, including some of the most impressive ones for conducting electronic commerce on the network, transferring and publishing files, and initiating complex information searches.
"The important variable is what the usage is, rather than what the numbers are," said Gary Chapman, coordinator of the 21st Century Project, a science and technology policy study group at the L.B.J. School of Public Affairs in Austin. "If it's just E-mail, that would have some certain kinds of implications. You could surmise there were a large number of people who were exploring the Net and not getting their noses very far into the tent."
 
'Fire Walls' Disconcerting

 
 And for businesses and policy makers who are planning for a digital future where the Internet delivers tens of millions of interactive users freely sending and receiving all sorts of information over the Internet, the rise of "fire walls," or security barriers, is a significant impediment. Mike Schwartz, associate professor of computer science at the University of Colorado at Boulder, said a 1992 survey of the Internet found that an estimated 35 percent of all Internet computers were barricaded behind fire walls.
"If you start looking at Internet services that require interactivity, things like billing or accounting across the Net, there might be nicer ways to do it if you could directly connect to people," Mr. Schwartz said. But if more and more Internet users erect one-way barriers, he added, "the services you can use are more limited."
Also, Internet surveyors agree, there is no way to know how many computers are truly active on the Internet -- as opposed to ones that are out of service, are turned on only infrequently, or exist only as an address with no corresponding machine. When attempts are made to contact a sampling of computers on the network, typically fewer than 30 percent respond.
Despite his deflationary data, Mr. Quarterman still predicts that the Internet will eventually achieve and surpass the size now widely credited to it. But the future isn't here yet, he says.
 
Opportunity Knocking

 
 Some of the biggest investors in the Internet are unswayed by suggestions that the numbers are overblown.
"Whether it's 6 million or 60 million, it's still an opportunity, and the biggest opportunity is within the business community," said Gail Grant, who manages development of Internet services for the Digital Equipment Corporation in Palo Alto, Calif.
Digital, one of the world's largest computer makers, has an estimated 40,000 computers connected to the Internet for interacting with employees and customers around the world. And the company is spending millions of dollars to develop Internet-related services, like distributing the company's product information and allowing potential customers to test powerful Digital computers remotely over the network.
The latest census of the Internet, released last week by Mr. Lottor of Network Wizards, is part of the tally of Internet "host" computers undertaken several times a year. Host computers are the portals through which others can gain access to the Internet, and counting them is roughly analogous to counting the number of telephone numbers on the world's connected phone systems. Mr. Quarterman acknowledges the numbers as an historically reliable set of data.
Once the number of host computers on the Internet is determined, the next challenge is to estimate the number of people who use each host. The task might be equated to calculating the average number of people who can be reached at a given telephone number.
 
How Use Is Calculated

 
 The commonly accepted figure for computers has been 10 users per network node, a number that derived partly from a survey of corporations several years ago, and partly from the ease of multiplying big numbers by 10.
Based on 10 users per machine, Mr. Lottor's latest survey would yield 32 million Internet users worldwide, a number that was embraced quickly by businesses and organizations that champion the growth of the global Internet.
But the number of users per machine may be as small as one, which is often the case for someone who links his or her home computer to the Internet. Or it could be hundreds of thousands, as would be the case for a giant public network like America Online, which is forging Internet connections.
"I've got more I.P. addresses here than I have staff," said Brad Templeton, publisher of Clarinet Communications, an electronic publisher in San Jose, Calif., referring to Internet Protocol addresses, the defining characteristic in Mr. Lottor's survey. "I've got three machines at home with I.P. addresses. There are coke machines and toasters with I.P. addresses."
Mr. Lottor, in defense of his data, said he was more comfortable counting machines, not people. "I try not to get into the user count, because there isn't really any way to figure it out," he said. Pressed to make a guess, he said: "Five to ten users per machine sounds pretty reasonable."
Based on 3.2 million machines, the net population would then be 16 million to 32 million.
 
'Wrong Expectations'

 
 But Mr. Quarterman, who runs MIDS Inc. an Internet consulting company in Austin, said a more reasonable figure, based on the surge of Internet interest among individual personal computer users, is 3.5 users per machine, which would deflate the Internet population to 11.2 million, assuming all the network host machines are counted.
But Mr. Quarterman questioned even that number, based on his own surveys of Internet system operators. Mr. Quarterman sent detailed questionnaires to 5,000 Internet system operators in his most recent survey, in January 1994, and concluded from the responses that the number of active computers was about 741,000 machines. Using his estimate of 3.5 users per machine, the active Internet population would be about 3 million users, he said. Because only about half the users are in the United States, the Internet population domestically would be 1.5 million.
Mr. Templeton, whose company, Clarinet Communications, is in the business of distributing data over the Internet, was asked if it really makes a difference whether there are 3.2 million computers and 32 million users, as some contend, or perhaps as few as 1 million machines and 3.5 million "reachable" users, as Mr. Quarterman suggests. "It's bad if people get false impressions about how big things are," Mr. Templeton said. "It leads to wrong expectations."

HEADLINE: French Bind: Algerian Ties

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 9

 BODY:
For Algeria's besieged army-backed Government, France's arrest of 17 sympathizers of the Islamic Salvation Front after the killing of five French citizens in Algeria last week represented a rare expression of foreign support for its battle against Muslim fundamentalism.
But in clamping down on suspected Islamic militants operating among the large Muslim population here, France's conservative Government has assumed the risks of becoming drawn ever more deeply into a conflict over which it has little influence. 
 The Government felt it had no choice but to show firmness after the killing of its five citizens last week, but the military arm of the Islamic Salvation Front promptly denounced the arrests as "a declaration of war" and threatened reprisals if the 17 detainees were not soon freed.
 
Tightened Security
 The Government in turn responded by tightening security at airports and railroad stations, bringing police reinforcements to Paris and carrying out some 9,000 identity checks in the last three nights. Today, it also banned five Islamic publications that it said were inciting violence in France.
An immediate result has been to place Algeria at the center of French political concerns, with the Government arguing that it should do all it can to forestall a fundamentalist victory and with opposition voices on the left and the far right urging France not to take sides.
The conflict erupted in January 1992 after the Algiers Government canceled a second round of legislative elections that seemed likely to bring the Islamic Salvation Front, now outlawed, to power. Since then, political violence has taken the lives of some 4,000 Algerians and 56 foreigners.
For France, however, the key question is less what happens in Algeria than how France itself will be affected by events in its former North African colony. And for that reason, the simmering civil war in Algeria is increasingly viewed here as a domestic as well as a foreign policy issue.
While France fears the effect of a fundamentalist takeover in Algeria on the rest of North Africa, its main worry is that it would set off a flood of refugees into France.
Interior Minister Charles Pasqua has warned that an Algerian exodus would be a European as well as a French problem, an argument France has used to try to mobilize economic support for the Algerian Government. But the record shows that both immigrants and refugees from Algeria prefer to come to France.
 
Pasqua Criticizes U.S.
 France's sensitivity was apparent last week when Mr. Pasqua criticized the United States, Germany and Britain, accusing them of harboring members of the Islamic Salvation Front. In light of the killing of 15 French citizens by Algerian militants over the last 10 months, he said, this was an offense to France.
Closer to home, France is already alarmed that Islamic fundamentalists are trying to influence young Muslim immigrants -- or French-born children of older immigrants -- with their radical message.
So far, Mr. Pasqua's measures have produced ambivalent reactions among Algerians here. Many are opposed to the Salvation Front and support the Government's action.
"At least we are protected now," said Kheina Lakrenche, 59, who owns the Bar des Amis in the Belleville district of Paris. "But Pasqua should have acted sooner."
But many Algerians fear a backlash from the campaign against militants. Karim Azaiza, 19, who has both French and Algerian nationality, said he no longer carried his Algerian passport. "If I'm asked where I'm from and I say Algeria, people immediately think I'm a fundamentalist," he said.
 
Fear of a Witch Hunt
 Dalil Boubakeur, dean of the Paris Mosque, expressed similar concerns. He urged Islamic militants not to embark on a terror campaign in France, warning that it could set off "a witch hunt" here. But he also called on the French authorities not to use ethnic criteria in stopping people for identity checks.
On Monday, the Algerian Fraternity in France, which identifies with the Islamic Salvation Front, called for the release of the 17 detainees, but Mr. Pasqua has insisted that they will be held until a country willing to accept them is found. He said they would not be deported to Algeria since they would be at risk there.
Less clear is how France intends to pursue its policies toward the conflict in Algeria itself. The United States has urged the Algerian Government to open negotiations with "moderate" Islamic groups, but Mr. Pasqua has dismissed the suggestion, saying no moderate voice has emerged.
On Monday, Algeria's President, Liamine Zeroual, issued an invitation to eight small opposition parties to end their boycott of a Government-named Transitional National Council and to take part in a dialogue with a view to returning the country to democracy. But no invitation was sent to militant Islamic groups.

HEADLINE: Stocks Flat On Concern About Rates

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks ended mixed yesterday, as interest-rate jitters overwhelmed gains in chemical and technology stocks, and reports of a big hostile tender offer.
"It's a market in which there is a lack of great enthusiasm or continuity of movement," said Dick Stein of MKI Securities. "Nobody is making any real bets." 
 Analysts said the market was on edge because of an expected rise in interest rates next week. If the inflation data that are due later this week prove strong, it will increase the chance that the Federal Reserve will raise rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 issues closed up 1.95 points, to 3,755.76. In the broader market, losing stocks outpaced gainers, 1,145 to 974, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 0.03 point, to 457.92. The American Stock Exchange index rose 0.62 point, to 442.22.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.03 point, to 252.96. The average share was unchanged.
 
Fed Meeting Planned
 The Nasdaq index rose 2.14 points, to 722.61.
The producer prices and consumer prices reports due tomorrow and Friday come just a few days before next Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee, which sets policy and is widely expected to raise short-term interest rates for the fifth time this year.
"I think they are going to raise interest rates next week, but I think the marketplace has already discounted that," an analyst at A. G. Edwards, Alfred Goldman, said.
He said an increase in rates would help the bond market, though the bonds could fall temporarily.
Mr. Goldman said the producer prices and consumer prices this week may show that inflation is not as serious a problem as some people believe. He said the interest rate increases earlier this year had slowed the economy to a healthier, sustainable rate of growth.
Retail sales data for July is also due tomorrow, at the same time as the producer prices report. The consensus is that there will be no change from the previous month.
 
A Hostile Takeover Bid
 Among the news that influenced the market, American Home Products began a hostile $8.5 billion takeover bid for American Cyanamid, sending shares of American Cyanamid up 2 5/8, to 93 5/8, on the Big Board. American Home Products rose 1/4, to 56 1/4.
Traders said American Cyanamid would have difficulty finding a "white knight" after the aggressive move by American Home.
Chemical issues rose in response to recent positive comments by several Wall Street firms. Union Carbide gained 1 1/4, to 32 5/8, Lyondell rose 1 1/4, to 28 5/8, and Dow Chemical added 2, to 72 1/4.
Traders said the technology group was buoyed by an article in The Wall Street Journal that said Fidelity Investments' $35 billion Fidelity Magellan fund was bullish on the group.
Molten Metal Technology soared 4 1/2, to 22 3/4, in Nasdaq trading on news of an alliance with Martin Marietta to clean up pollution at United States Government sites, using Molten's technology. Martin Marietta gained 3/8, to 47.

HEADLINE: Clinton Is Expected to Strengthen the Diplomatic Status of Taiwan

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
President Clinton is expected to approve a policy change in the next few weeks and raise the political standing of Taiwan, a step that is likely to anger Beijing.
Administration officials said the policy review is on the President's desk awaiting final choices on some options. But in its overall thrust, the new policy will recognize Taiwan's growing economic power in Asia and elevate the status of its diplomats and business representatives. 
 But it will leave Taiwan's legal position as an estranged province of "one China" unchanged, thus continuing two decades of normalization with the Communist Government in Beijing, which has claimed Taiwan's seat on the United Nations Security Council and has persuaded dozens of countries to switch their diplomatic allegiance to Beijing.
 
Recriminations Likely
 The leadership in Beijing has reacted angrily to earlier attempts to bolster Taiwan's diplomatic standing, and there have been sharp recriminations over continuing American military sales to Taiwan. Administration officials expressed hope that the new policy would draw only a mild rebuke.
This week's diplomatic breakthrough between Beijing and Taiwan on accords relating to fishing and the return of plane hijackers indicates that Beijing may have tried to pre-empt the Administration with a clear signal that Beijing's dispute with Taiwan is an internal Chinese affair.
One practical result of the policy change will be to make it easier for Taiwan Government officials and diplomats to meet in United States Government buildings to discuss trade, commerce, military assistance and other issues with American officials. It will also make it easier for officials from Taiwan to visit the United States and for American officials to visit Taiwan.
In an embarrassing episode in May, President Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan was not allowed to leave his airplane or sleep overnight on United States soil during a refueling stop in Hawaii on his way to Central America. The incident infuriated members of Congress, who have since invited Mr. Lee to visit their districts.
Taiwan, an island of 20 million led by the Nationalist political party that fled the Communist takeover on the mainland in 1949, has become one of Asia's four "dragon" economies, along with Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong. Taiwan imported $16 billion in United States goods last year, double the amount of American goods shipped to China.
In a "white paper" in July, Taiwan's leadership called on Beijing "to face up to the fact that China is a divided country under two separate governments." Beijing considers Taiwan a renegade province and has never renounced the use of force if Taiwan's burgeoning independence movement were to come to power and declare independence from Beijing.
Under President Lee, Taiwan's dominant Nationalist party has pursued a dialogue with the mainland while also seeking world recognition for Taiwan as a "political entity," short of nationhood.
"Prior to unification," the white paper states, "these two parts of China should have the right to participate alongside each other in the international community," including representation in the United Nations and regional organizations. "Only when we set aside the sovereignty dispute will we untangle the knots that have bound us for the past 40 years or more and progress smoothly toward unification."
One of the most visible aspects of the policy change will be a name change for Taiwan's offices in the United States; the current title, Coordination Council for North American Affairs, lacks any geographical reference to Taiwan. Taiwan officials in Washington expect President Clinton to select a new name, possibly Representative Office of Taiwan.
Under the new policy, the Pentagon will be free to continue aid to Taiwan's military without consultation with Beijing. It is not clear how this will be reconciled with an accord signed by Washington and Beijing in August 1982 that stipluates annual reductions in military assistance to Taiwan.
The greatest violation of the agreement on military sales occurred in 1992, when President George Bush agreed during his re-election campaign to sell 150 F-16 fighters to Taiwan for $5.9 billion.
A similiar sale by France of 60 Mirage 2000-5 fighters opened a rift in relations between China and France that was only repaired this year when France abandoned further military sales to Taipei.
One Administration official involved in the new policy said the White House expected Beijing to "go along with a twisting" of the 1982 communique, adding that China is "not likely to go to the mat over it."

HEADLINE: Senecas Ponder Novel Deal On Tax-Free Tobacco Sales

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: CATTARAUGUS RESERVATION, N.Y.

 BODY:
Prodded by the United States Supreme Court, officials of New York State and the Seneca Indian Nation are discussing a novel solution to a costly bootlegging problem involving sales of tax-free cigarettes and gasoline at reservation stores.
The deal would establish the tribe as the only wholesaler allowed to supply a lucrative chain of reservation stores. In return, tribal officials would help the state for the first time by using their sovereignty to close down wildcat Indian dealers involved in bootlegging. 
 The two sides would share inventory information on the Indians' untaxed sales of cigarettes and gasoline and introduce a special Seneca Nation seal on cigarette packs to control the reservation cigarettes that Albany officials say are now bootlegged far and wide in northern New York, costing the state an estimated $100 million in revenues.
"This is an ambitious undertaking," said the State Commissioner of Taxation and Finance, James W. Wetzler, who hopes to produce a model agreement for use with eight other tribes around the state.
Seneca leaders favor the deal because it would considerably bolster the budget and sovereignty of the 6,600-member tribe, which is singular lately in rejecting the boon of Indian casino gambling as too disruptive a cultural force.
"If you're going to cry sovereignty, you've got to step up to the plate," said Ross John, who is on the 16-member Seneca Council, the tribe's legislature.
 
A Reservation Economy
 There are 28 cigarette and gasoline retailers run by Senecas who operate tax free and thereby underprice off-reservation merchants by about 25 percent. The stores, opened over the last 15 years, have been the tribe's first success in building a reservation economy after two centuries of depression. A few Indians, in fact, have become millionaires but do not contribute to tribal coffers. That situation would be remedied under the new approach, which would generate $10 million in wholesale profits annually, doubling the Senecas' communal resources.
The talks began after a recent Supreme Court ruling upholding the state's right to begin taxing non-Indian wholesalers who supply the reservation stores. This put the reservation shops and their 500 jobs in jeopardy. Two years ago, there were arrests and injuries over this issue after a lower-court ruling sparked Seneca civil demonstrations that closed state roads here through the reservation.
With perhaps another month before officials must enforce the Supreme Court ruling, the Cuomo administration and Seneca leaders have been quick to pursue talks on a mutual accord to satisfy tribe and state needs and head off heightened confrontations and litigation. "If we have no agreement, we're looking at another five or six years of limbo and animosity on this issue," warned Patrick E. Brown, director of the State Office of Industry and Community Relations.
Sovereignty-minded Seneca leaders refuse to use the word "negotiations" and are wary of the long history of broken agreements with the state. They remember especially 16 separate attempts by Albany officials to break the tribe's treaty guarantee of 152 years ago to remain forever untaxed. But they say these talks seem to be a remarkable break with Albany's perfidious past.
 
'The Same Language'
 "What's different now is that we're speaking the same language, literally," said Robert B. Porter, the Senecas' first Attorney General, a Harvard Law School graduate. "Signing pieces of paper written in a foreign language by somebody else -- those days are gone," he said of the tribe's slow upturn in self-reliance since the days only a generation ago when a total of three Senecas held on-reservation jobs.
Tribal politics can be sharp-edged, and to critics of the current talks leaders are insisting that, far from informing on Seneca bootleggers to New York authorities, they would approach this as a matter of protecting the tribe's new economic self-interest within the reservation. "We'll take care of this ourselves," Mr. Porter said of Senecas who might try to deal around the wholesale restrictions.
"We need the state's information as much as the state needs ours," Mr. John, the Seneca Council member, added of the pact's basic goal to introduce an overall tracking of incoming wholesale and outgoing retail dealings.
 
Price Advantage
 For the state, the issue is particularly difficult because of pressure from the gas-station and convenience-store lobbies off the reservations to enforce the court ruling and eliminate the Indians' price advantage. Under the agreement being discussed, the Indians would raise their prices closer to those off reservation but maintain part of the current advantage of about $5 a carton and 10 cents a gallon.
Beyond the communal profits as wholesaler, the tribe would collect a surcharge for five years from the retailers of one cent a gallon and three cents a pack to raise money to build the first three tribal-run schoolhouses ever on the 4,500 acres of the Cattaraugus, Allegany and Oil Springs reservations. This would be a payback for the retailers' having given nothing directly to the tribe for the last 15 years.
This is only fair, said Mr. John, who is both a tribal councilor and successful owner of the Iroquois Smoke Shop and gas station. A 38-year-old former construction ironworker, the Senecas' traditional off-reservation job pursuit, Mr. John opened his shop eight years ago and became one of the tribe's pioneer entrepreneurs.
 
'Can Compete Now'
 He has been successful enough to diversify into a construction company, an electronics supplier, and a manufacturer of drug-testing products that he hopes will produce more reservation jobs. "I could never have competed straight off the iron," he said of his roots. "This shop is a training ground for the Senecas. I can compete now and could probably work in a management role for someone else."
As tricky as the three-cornered court issue is for Mr. Brown and the other state negotiators, the Senecas say they feel squeezed too by past wariness, present reality and future hope. Larry Ballagh, a tribal councilor, concedes that the alternative to cooperating with the state is for the Senecas to close their businesses in the face of the court ruling that would introduce taxation.
"But my problem is with the children and grandchildren down the road," he said.
"Here we have the prosperity of my people depending on New York State upholding a law -- I don't know," he said, surveying history with considerable uncertainty.

Anxiety on Fed Makes A Rally Short-Lived

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities declined yesterday, amid continued uncertainty about the economy and the direction of interest rates set by the Federal Reserve.
The Treasury's quarterly auction, which many analysts thought might go poorly because of the threat of another increase in short-term interest rates, began yesterday with a slightly-better-than-expected sale of three-year notes. Dealers and traders have worried that a rate increase during the quarterly refunding could leave them holding new notes and bonds that would be hard to sell. 
 While some analysts expected a rate increase before the Treasury auction, more seem to believe that the Fed would wait to take any action until the Aug. 16 meeting of its rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.
Still, while the three-year note sale yesterday was a happy surprise, and did help Treasury prices rebound from losses early in the day, market attention quickly shifted to today's auction of new 10-year notes. This stalled the afternoon rally.
The Treasury's 30-year bond declined 9/32 to a price of 8420/32 to yield 7.57 percent, the highest since July 27, when it was 7.61 percent.
In the when-issued market, yields rose for the 10-year notes to be sold today and for the 30-year bonds to be auctioned on Thursday. The 10-year note was offered at a price to yield 7.29 percent, a couple of ticks higher than on Monday, while the yield on the new 30-year bond rose to 7.46 percent, about four basis point higher than Monday. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
At the three-year note auction, the average yield was 6.61 percent, up from 6.54 percent on May 10 and the highest since August 1991, when the yield was 6.92 percent. But the note rallied after the auction, with the yield in the when-issued market slipping to 6.59 percent. Prices and yields move in opposite directions.
Noncompetitive bidding at the three-year note auction, which is sometimes a good measure of retail interest, was the fourth highest in the last six years. Many investors have moved away from the longer maturities, which are riskier and more volatile, to less risky, shorter maturities, which are now offering yields higher than those on 30-year bonds at the beginning of the year.
Adding to the pressure on Treasury prices are the two important inflation indicators that are to be released at the end of the week. The July report for producer prices comes on Thursday, followed by the Consumer Price Index on Friday. The July retail sales data released on Thursday will also be watched closely.
Andrew J. Schnydrig, first vice president and head of domestic fixed-income trading for Bank Julius Baer in New York, said that in a quarterly Treasury auction, the first leg is the easiest. "From an investor standpoint, they would want to be short because of all uncertainty weighing on the market," he said.
Looking ahead, he did not expect the two remaining auctions to have aggressive bidding, particularly because of uncertainty about Fed policy and the economic data ahead.
The Treasury is selling selling $12 billion in 10-year notes today and $11 billion in 30-year bonds tomorrow.
Looking farther down the road, Mr. Schnydrig thinks that Japanese-American trade talks could have a positive effect on bond prices in this country. He believes that if the talks resume and an agreement is reached, this could cause a dollar rally and reverse an 18-month trend of Japanese gradually selling their United States Treasury securities.
 
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of new three-year notes:

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Head of Mutual Fund Unit Replaced at Paine Webber

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Paine Webber Group Inc. replaced the head of its mutual fund division yesterday, the latest casualty of a costly and embarrassing bailout of a bond fund that dabbled in risky securities.
Paul Guenther, Paine Webber's president, took over Joyce Fensterstock's position as president of Mitchell Hutchens Asset Management, the mutual fund subsidiary, until a permanent replacement is found, a company spokeswoman said. 
 The move is the brokerage firm's latest attempt to contain the damage from its $268 million bailout of the ailing short-term government bond fund, which this year has lost 7.55 percent through the first week of August, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc.
"I think it's normal to fire the coach when the team doesn't perform, whether or not the coach is directly responsible," said Michael Lipper, president of the mutual fund research company, which is based in Summit, N.J.
Three weeks ago, the brokerage firm propped up its Short-Term United States Government Income Fund by paying $180 million for its weakest securities -- nearly one-quarter of the fund's value. The rescue was in addition to a $33 million cash infusion and $55 million buyback in June.
The fund's troubles stem from surprising investments in mortgage-backed derivatives, which are securities based on, or derived from, homeowners' monthly mortgage payments.
With the Federal Reserve Board's decision to start pushing interest rates higher in February, the market for exotic mortgage securities dried up and hurt the Paine Webber fund's returns.
While other mutual funds also have been battered by this year's tumbling market for exotic securities, Paine Webber's troubles are particularly shocking.
Most short-term bond funds are considered extremely safe and able to retain their value even in times of market declines.
Ms. Fensterstock had a 16-year career at Paine Webber, and spent the last seven years with Mitchell Hutchins. The move to replace her comes after the resignations of Steve Brown, the fund's portfolio manager, and Ellen Griggs, a former manager.
The Paine Webber spokeswoman said Ms. Fensterstock was "exploring other opportunities" within Paine Webber and declined to say whether Ms. Fensterstock resigned or was fired. Ms. Fensterstock could not be reached for comment.

HEADLINE: Watchdog's Deal Raises Revenue and Eyebrows

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
They seem no different from the direct-mail solicitations that swamp the average householder, these circulars that have appeared in 600,000 New Jersey mailboxes from companies like Aristo Aluminum Siding of Lake Hopatcong, the East Coast Mortgage Company of Clark, King Oldsmobile of Verona and nearly 200 others in the state.
But these fliers arrived in Better Business Bureau of Northern New Jersey envelopes, accompanied by letters emblazoned with the bureau's trademarked "torch" logo. And the nonprofit watchdog group was paid by the advertisers for the mailings.
 
Expanded Services
 The New Jersey bureau, the first and so far the only one in the nation to engage in such a venture, is using the money to expand its services. But consumer advocates and some other Better Business Bureau executives say the experiment presents a conflict of interest, because it promotes the very companies the bureau monitors. 
 The New Jersey program, which is being studied by other bureaus, represents only one of the growing number of revenue-raising strategies used by Better Business Bureaus across the country. Others include 900-number systems and credit-card billing for information calls that traditionally have been free, and charges for mediation and arbitration services.
Also being studied are fee-based partnerships, with on-line services like Compuserve and Prodigy and with Yellow Pages directories.
The New Jersey tactic highlights a deepening internal debate in the 82-year-old Better Business Bureau, a national organization, whose mission is the self-regulation of the business community. Some of its members say they are concerned that the private group is compromising its integrity as it tries to become the nation's pre-eminent provider of information on business practices, and a main source of dispute-resolution services.
"I have a problem with a nonprofit corporation charging the public a fee for access to our basic services," Edward Smith, president of the Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan Atlanta, said in an interview. "I don't think it's appropriate for us to say we're funded by the business community to provide free services -- and then start charging for them."
But Joel S. Wein, president of the Northern New Jersey bureau for the last seven years and the force behind the direct-mail advertising experiment, said the growing need for those services meant that the bureaus needed to be open to new ways of doing things.
"We are the victims of our own success," he said. "Many bureaus were hurt badly in the recession, and we've had to look for clever ways to generate revenues."
Critics with a long view say the risk of conflict is inherent in the concept of the self-policing organization, which was founded in 1912, in the era of patent medicines, snake-oil salesmen and emerging Government regulation. Without enforcement powers beyond the ability to stigmatize a business with an "unsatisfactory" rating, Better Business Bureaus have always relied on moral suasion in resolving disputes.
The bureaus are a repository for consumers' complaints about local companies, and offer volunteer mediators in disputes. Perhaps the greatest asset of each bureau is its data base of company ratings, derived from complaint records. The Northern New Jersey bureau, for example, has 50,000 companies in its computerized file, and six "information specialists" who field calls.
The largest of the three bureaus in the state, representing eight counties with a population of about four million, the Northern New Jersey bureau has been operating for 22 years, has a budget of $1.3 million and employs 25 people. It has 1,800 dues-paying members, businesses that pay annual fees that range from $350 a year for small companies to $10,000 a year for big corporations.
 
Modest Profits
 With 185,000 companies in its target area, the bureau received 12,000 complaints last year. Fees covered 35 percent of the bureau's expenses last year.
Profits from the advertising mailings have been promising but modest -- a bit less than $10,000, Mr. Wein said. The money raised will be used to upgrade the bureau's services, including its hot-line -- (201) 539-8222 -- which receives more than 500 calls each workday. "As it is now, too many people get busy signals," Mr. Wein said.
According to Jim Bast, president and chief executive of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, the national umbrella organization based in Arlington, Va., consumer inquiries and complaints to the nation's 163 Better Business Bureaus increased 29 percent last year, to 14.6 million. As a result of those inquiries, the council estimated, the bureaus influenced more than $40 billion of business transactions contemplated by consumers.
But in most bureaus, revenues from membership fees have hardly kept pace with consumers' demands.
Three years ago the Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan New York, which covers New York City, Long Island and the mid-Hudson region, installed a 900-number system for telephone queries. It receives 200,000 of them a year, and now charges an average of $3.80 a call.
 
Testing in Other Cities
 For those unwilling or unable to charge 900-number fees to their phone bills, the bureau assesses a flat credit-card fee of $3.80 for inquiries. There is no charge for mail inquiries.
The 900-number concept is also being tested in Philadelphia, Miami, Buffalo and Los Angeles, Mr. Bast said.
The president of the Metropolitan New York bureau, Barbara Berger Opotowsky, said fees brought in about 10 percent of the New York bureau's budget of $2.8 million. And she said she saw virtues beyond the revenue effect. "It builds a support base among consumers," she said, "and shows we must be accountable to them."
But Mr. Smith of the metropolitan Atlanta bureau said he was concerned that 900-number fees would deter callers who were less well-off. "We don't have anywhere near an accurate accounting of the effects," he said.
Mr. Smith said he was not opposed to a bureau with aspirations to be forward thinking. "We automated our office eight years ago," he said, adding that consumer inquiries had increased to 45,000, from 22,000, since the bureau installed a computerized voice-response system two years ago, providing callers with information 24 hours a day.
The Atlanta bureau does not charge for its service. And while Mr. Smith said he sympathized with "the need to raise money," he acknowledged that the bureau had been blessed with a supportive business community.
So far, the Northern New Jersey bureau has done three mailings, totaling 600,000 pieces. A fourth, of 250,000 pieces, is scheduled for September. As the bureau's sales force of 10 criss-crosses the region signing up new members, it is also trying to sell its direct-mail services.
The six-paragraph letter accompanying each flier says that in the event of complaints, the advertisers have agreed to mediation by one of the bureau's 90 arbitrators and 25 volunteer mediators. The fifth paragraph carries a disclaimer: "The BBB does not guarantee, endorse, recommend, approve or disapprove of any product, service or company."
Advertisers pay 4 cents to 5 cents for each household served, about a penny more than commercial services charge. Gerald Damora, the owner of Morris Window and Siding, of Succasunna, N.J., and a member of the bureau, said that from a single, 10,000-household mailing, he had received 32 responses and made 8 sales, "a wonderful rate of return." A response rate of half a percent is considered good.
"It comes to the homeowner from the Better Business Bureau, and I guess it raises their curiosity," Mr. Damora said. "I'm a legitimate businessman, and they make the public aware of my company. They legitimize my legitimacy."
The New Jersey Department of Consumer Affairs has not received complaints about the mailings, said Nancy Erickson, director of communications for the department, and many of the state's leading consumer groups said they were not aware of the direct-mail program.
The response of Phyllis Salowe-Kaye, executive director of New Jersey Citizen Action, the state's largest consumer organization, with 10,000 members, was typical. "All nonprofits have to look to creative ways to stay alive," she said. "But if the letter states that they don't endorse the companies, then why are they mailing it out?"
Consumers have had a mixed reaction. "I would pay a fee for their arbitration services," said Karen Carrano-Miller, a financial analyst from Nazareth, Pa., who had a dispute about an automobile warranty with a company in Newark. The bureau, she said, interceded for her, and she received the $350 she had sought in the dispute.
"I'd assume the bureau would be endorsing the advertisers," she said. "But I'd only be upset if I had a problem and the bureau didn't follow through."
Another customer of the Better Business Bureau, Elizabeth Kesselring, a massage therapist who lives in Parsippany, N.J., said the bureau had persuaded a car dealer to replace a "lemon" she bought last year.
 
No Conflict Seen
 Miss Kesselring said she "welcomed" direct-mail advertising sent by the bureau, but was less happy with the idea of paying for information. "I don't know why they would have to charge $3 or $4 if they're just sitting at a console," she said.
Mr. Bast, the national council president, said the New Jersey bureau was operating under the council's guidelines, and the direct-mail venture was "definitely not a conflict of interest."
"If there were a conflict with what we stand for -- our integrity -- we wouldn't do it," Mr. Bast said.
Mr. Wein of the Northern New Jersey bureau insisted that his organization could shoulder its dual role as ombudsman and direct-mail peddler. "Our raison d'etre is integrity and the promotion of honest advertising," he said. "We represent the good guys."
Asked whether consumers would notice the disclaimer, he said, "I guess it's possible that some people will not realize that we aren't endorsing these products and suppliers."
"Look," he added, "it's always a balancing act."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Posts Broad Retreat As Fears of Inflation Grow

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against most leading currencies yesterday, hurt by falling bond prices and uncertainty over inflation.
The Treasury's auction of $17 billion of three-year notes met with lukewarm investor interest, which further restrained enthusiasm for the dollar. 
 "I'm sensing that the market is looking to the bond market for some direction," said David Gilmore, partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics.
Traders said the dollar remained vulnerable to further downward pressure as the Treasury auctions $12 billion in 10-year bonds today, the second leg of its quarterly debt refunding.
With the Government scheduled to release key inflation reports tomorrow and Friday, analysts said investors were cautious in purchasing dollar-denominated assets. Expectations are widespread that July figures for both producer and consumer prices will show an acceleration in inflation.
Economists see the Producer Price Index for July rising four-tenths of 1 percent, and consumer prices are expected to show a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent.
"The market is going to have trouble with the inflation numbers on Thursday and Friday," Mr. Gilmore said. "So between now and then, I suspect we'll see the dollar sell off along with bonds."
Although traders had recently detected a shift in sentiment for American investments by foreign investors, there was little evidence of strong foreign demand for the three-year note offering.
One additional hurdle, traders said, was Washington's future monetary policy. The Federal Reserve's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee will meet next Tuesday to discuss the economic and monetary conditions. Many expect that the central bank will choose to nudge interest rates higher at that meeting.
In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 101.31 Japanese yen from 101.55 yen late Monday. In Tokyo, the dollar had closed at 100.44 yen, virtually unchanged from Monday. The dollar also slipped to 1.5825 German marks from 1.5835 marks late Monday. Earlier in London, the dollar closed at 1.5825 marks, little changed from Monday.
Gold prices rose 70 cents on the Commodity Exchange in New York, where the December contract closed at $383 an ounce. A late quote from Republic National Bank put spot gold at $378.30 an ounce.
The British pound slipped to $1.5390 in New York from $1.5396 Monday.

Insurance Sales Buoy Equitable's Net

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The Equitable Companies said yesterday that its second-quarter earnings rose solidly, as improved life insurance sales cushioned the company from the higher interest rates that have hurt its brokerage operations and other Wall Street firms.
Equitable, an insurance and investment banking company based in New York, said its net income rose 44 percent, to $68.5 million, or 34 cents a share, for the three months that ended on June 30, compared with 47.5 million, or 21 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year ago. 
 Total revenue fell to $1.5 billion, from $1.55 billion.
Analysts said a drop of 48 percent in earnings at Equitable's Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette brokerage unit was a worrisome sign. Rising interest rates have given Wall Street its worst quarter since 1990.
"A year ago, the company was getting most of its earnings from the brokerage business instead of insurance, and now it's the other way around," Ira Zuckerman, an analyst with SBS Financial Group in Westport, Conn., said. "This has been a volatile stock because it has a large brokerage, which belongs to an industry having a bad quarter."
Richard H. Jenrette, chairman and chief executive of Equitable, said a continued improvement in individual life insurance and annuities, which almost tripled its contribution to pretax profit, offset the results of the "harsh environment."
Total assets under management rose to $180 billion in the quarter, from $161 billion in the comparable period a year ago.
 
An Increase in Volatility
 At Equitable Life Assurance Society, the nation's seventh-largest life insurer, earnings, excluding gains from the sale of investments, rose to $62.6 million, from $29.2 million a year ago.
The company's investment business reported earnings of $30.4 million for the second quarter, down from $55.9 million a year ago. At Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, earnings dropped to $21 million, from $40.5 million.
"Increased market volatility, which diminished new underwriting activity and reduced the level of dealer and trading gains," more than offset growth in commissions, fees and other revenue, Mr. Jenrette said.
The quarter has been a difficult one for Wall Street, with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the world's fourth-largest underwriter of stocks and bonds, reporting a decline of 79 percent in second-quarter profit. Earnings at Merrill Lynch & Company fell 27 percent.
The results for Wall Street firms have declined because the three-year rally in the bond market stopped abruptly in February, when the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates. The drop follows a year of record profits on Wall Street, with the industry posting pretax earnings of $8.6 billion for 1993, including $1.5 billion in the second quarter.
Third-party assets under management at investment subsidiaries rose 15 percent, to $129 billion.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Traders Are Proved Wrong By a Decline in Oil Supplies

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday on speculation that American oil supplies rose last week. Traders were caught off guard, however, when an industry report proved them wrong after the market closed.
On other markets, lumber rose its daily limit amid renewed strike threats in Canada, lifting the Commodity Research Bureau index 0.47 point, to 231.52. Copper fell as stockpiles rose. 
 In the American Petroleum Institute's weekly report on crude inventories, stockpiles were reported down 2.8 million barrels, or almost 1 percent. Imports plunged 15.5 percent, to their lowest since May 27.
"Imports are way down," said Tom Curtis, energy research director with Pegasus Econometric Group in New York. "That's a little surprising."
Before the weekly report was released he had predicted a "goodly increase in imports."
The United States normally imports about eight million barrels of crude a day, half of its total supply. Nigerian crude accounted for 10 percent of American imports before a strike by oil workers began early last month.
September crude fell 12 cents a barrel, to $19.30. Unleaded gasoline rose 0.78 cent, to 59.22 cents a gallon, and heating oil rose 0.32 cent, to 50.17 cents a gallon.
In "access" trading after the petroleum report was released, Nymex crude was down 10 cents at $19.20.
Lumber rose as much as rules permit in a single day, to a two-week high, as strike threats grew in British Columbia, which produces 18 percent of the United States wood supply.
"There is concern about the possibility of a strike" by the union that represents workers at nearly 95 percent of British Columbia sawmills, said Paul Court, a commodity broker in Vail, Colo., who specializes in forest products.
Lumber for September delivery rose the daily trading limit of $10 for 1,000 board feet, to $358.30, the highest level since July 25.
Copper fell as stockpiles rose, ending a 45 percent decline in supplies since the beginning of the year that had pushed prices to a two-year high. September copper fell 1.35 cents, to $1.0725 a pound, on the Commodity Exchange. Copper has fallen 8.2 percent since reaching a two-year high of $1.169 a pound on July 19.
Traders are concerned that the strong American demand for copper in the first half of the year may have slowed as inventories rose. Wholesale inventories rose 4.8 percent in June from a year earlier, according to the Commerce Department.

HEADLINE: Chrysler May Cancel Model

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 9

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation said today that it might cancel a new four-door sport-utility vehicle because of worries that it would fail to meet future fuel economy standards.
The vehicle, which is in the planning stages and is tentatively called the Dodge Adventurer, was intended to compete with Toyota's Land Cruiser and Land Rover's Range Rover in the fast-growing luxury sport-utility market. But concerns about future legislation regarding corporate average fuel economy standards for light trucks has prompted Chrysler to reconsider the $100 million project. 
 "What concerns us is we'd have the right project at the wrong time," a Chrysler spokesman, Alex Tsigdinos, said, confirming a report yesterday in The Detroit News. He said the addition of several new competitors in the full-sized sport-utility market was also a factor in Chrysler's decision to review the project.
Sport-utility vehicles are one of the fastest-growing segments in the auto industry today, but some experts fear a sharp rise in fuel prices could quickly cool the sector.
Under current fuel economy rules, each manufacturer's truck line must achieve an average of 20.5 miles a gallon. But the Government is considering increasing that by as much as 25 percent over the next 10 years.

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL;
Cadigan Puts Jets on the Hold Button

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Aug. 9

 BODY:
An offensive guard named Dave will rejoin the Jets on Wednesday. No, not Dave Cadigan, a starter the last three seasons, but now unemployed.
Instead, it will be Dave Ware, a second-year pro who walked out of their training camp here Monday and seemed ready to quit pro football. Tonight, he concluded that he really wanted to keep playing. 
 Cadigan may be out of a job, but he told the Jets today that he was not ready to come back, certainly not for the money they had in mind. During the winter, he bought out the last year of his contract because he was unhappy with his 1994 salary of $825,000. He thought several other teams would be willing to pay more. But no one has.
Meanwhile, Roger Duffy, Cadigan's backup last year, had taken the starting job, with Ware as his backup. But when Ware left camp, the Jets called Cadigan at his home near San Diego. Cadigan agreed to come to camp today, take a physical examination and talk.

 
 
Waiting for Injuries

 
 The Jets did not know if they would offer him a job. And if they did, they warned that because of the National Football League's new salary cap, limiting teams to $34.6 million a year for player salaries and benefits, they could probably pay him $400,000 or less, not $825,000.
So Cadigan and his new agent, James Moran, changed their minds about having Cadigan come here, even just to talk. As Dick Steinberg, the Jets' general manager, explained it:
"Dave Cadigan and his agent decided it would be more advantageous for him to stay home and take more time to evaluate their chances around the league, maybe let a few more injuries occur. Because we didn't have a definite proposal for him, he didn't pick up his plane ticket and won't be in. And maybe they felt we could come up with more money."
Down the road, Cadigan could be a Jet again.
"We keep a list of so-called disaster players," Steinberg said, "and he's still on our list."

 
 
Ware Reassesses Future

 
 With Ware returning, the Jets can put aside that list for now. Ware spent more than an hour here this afternoon talking with Steinberg and other personnel officials. At night, Ware met with his agent, Alan Herman. Later, Herman reported that Ware said he was sure he wanted to play.
"He said he would go into the Jets' office and put his best foot forward," Herman said. "He said he had thought things over and concluded that football was important to him again.
"I think his problem was that he never left New York after last season. He stayed here, he worked out every day and spoke almost every day at schools. He never took a day off. He just put too much pressure on himself."
Coach Pete Carroll said he was looking forward to talking to Ware Wednesday.
"If he doesn't want to play football," the coach said, "he should move on. If he says 'I want to play football, but I don't like it,' maybe he won't come back. If he is certain it's what he wants to do, I'd like him back. But we don't want anybody on this team not sure if he wants to play."

 
 
Report Card on the Coach

 
 Thoughts on Pete Carroll's start as the Jets' head coach:
Quarterback Boomer Esiason: "He put up a basketball hoop and gets you to play with and against him. He holds a family picnic on Sunday afternoon. He gets guys to do things together, and anything a coach can do to bring guys together will pay off."
Outside linebacker Bobby Houston: "No situation can get him down. When the defense gets backed up, he'll clap his hands and say, 'Good, good. Don't you just love it? Let's go.' When the offense is in trouble, he's still upbeat. You can hear some guys saying, 'He's out of his mind.' But he takes adversity as a challenge."
Defensive end Jeff Lageman: "Sometimes I wonder how he gets up so early and at 8 A.M. he's so chipper and I wake up and feel lousy."

 
 
EXTRA POINTS
Cornerback JAMES HASTY (knee), fullback FRED LESTER (ankle) and center DAN SCHMIDT (ankle) have been declared out of Saturday night's preseason game against the Eagles in Philadelphia. Defensive tackle MARK GUNN (thumb) is doubtful and two others, wide receivers ORLANDO PARKER (hamstring) and STEVIE ANDERSON (hamstring), are questionable. . . . Coach PETE CARROLL said cornerback AARON GLENN, this year's first-round draft choice, would also return punts against the Eagles. Last year, playing for Texas A&M, Glenn had the best return average (19.9 yards) among collegians. . . . Every day, NICK LOWERY, starting his 16th N.F.L. season, and TONY MEOLA, starting his first, share field goals and kickoffs in practice. Carroll said he was pleased with the rapid improvement of Meola, the goalie for the United States World Cup soccer team. "He's powering the ball, elevating it quicker, just getting better," Carroll said. "We want to see him on kickoffs, and he'll do that Saturday night. Nick Lowery will be our field-goal kicker."

Studying Chinese
A conference on "Chinese Cuisine and the American Palate" will be held Sept. 22 through 24 at Queens College in Flushing. It will explore some of the health aspects and lore of Chinese cuisine, regional Chinese cuisines, the evolution of Chinese restaurants in America, Chinese cooking in American homes and Chinese food as a business.
There will be cooking demonstrations and exhibits of food, equipment and cookbooks. The keynote speaker will be the cookbook author Ken Hom. A banquet will be held at 7 P.M. on Sept. 23. 
 The symposium is sponsored by the Institute for the Advancement of the Science and Art of Chinese Cuisine, an educational organization in Kings Park, L.I., and by the Asian-American Center and the department of home economics, both at the college.
The fee for attending for three days is $30, for one day, $25; for students the fee for the entire symposium is $5. Tickets to the banquet are $35. More information is available from the institute, Box 91, Kings Park, L.I. 11754; (718) 997-4153.
 
Cake Flour Anniversary

Swans Down Cake Flour is celebrating its 100th anniversary with a fine little baking booklet that has 18 classic recipes, 13 of them by Rose Levy Beranbaum, the cookbook author, and the others from the Swans Down company's test kitchens.
Cake flour is a relatively low-gluten, soft-wheat flour sifted to an extra-fine texture, which many bakers prefer for tender cakes. The booklet is $1 and can be ordered from Swans Down 100th Booklet, Reily Foods, Box 60296, New Orleans 70160.
 
Helping Children

During August, Desserts by David Glass is donating 10 percent of its profits to Save the Children, an international nonprofit organization. And fans of the company's chocolate mousse cakes, cheese cakes, carrot cakes and the like have a chance to win a free cake for each week of the year. Stores that sell the cakes have entry blanks for a drawing, which will be held on Sept. 12.
 
Taste of Woodstock
 The updated music of the Woodstock generation will echo through the Catskills this weekend. And for a taste of Woodstock, there is "Famous Woodstock Cooks," by Joanne Michaels and Mary Barile (JMB Publications, $14.95), which was published in 1987 and republished in June.
The contributors include Sylvia Miles, the actress; Paul Draper, the choreographer; Peter Schickele, the musician and conductor; Heywood Hale Broun, the columnist; Milton Glaser, the artist; Mary Orser, an astrologist; Alf Evers, a historian of the Catskill region and Susun Weed, a herbalist specializing in weeds.
Recipes, accompanied by local lore and profiles of the contributors, run from soybean stew and commune cutlets to Cajun shrimp and a gelatin mold with caviar. But the emphasis is on foods one might associate with the Age of Aquarius, like transcendental Tibetan tea, poor-woman's pasta and vegetarian lasagna.
The book is available by mail from JMB Publications, Box 425, Woodstock, N.Y. 12498. Add $2 for postage and 50 cents for each additional book mailed to the same address.
 
English Sugars
 People who use cookbooks published in England often encounter the term "caster sugar." This is a fine-grained sugar similar to extra-fine granulated sugar. Now, unrefined caster sugar from England, Billington's Golden Caster, is available at Balducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas (Ninth Street). It is pale ivory with a clean flavor that is slightly richer than regular refined granulated sugar. The refining process is what makes sugar snow white.
Balducci's has other varieties of Billington's English sugars, including light and dark brown, both of which have a richer, spicier flavor than American brown sugars. The color is natural and does not come from the addition of molasses or caramel, as in most American brown sugar. The English sugars are somewhat more granular and less likely to harden.
Billington's Amber Crystal Sugar is a fairly coarse pale-brown granulated sugar with a mellow flavor, excellent as a topping, on cereal and in coffee.
The sugars, $2.99 a pound, are produced on plantations in Mauritius, an island in the Indian Ocean.
 
New Brews
 This summer, Zip City, 3 West 18th Street, began brewing some new beers. Weisse, a summer wheat beer, is golden amber with a refreshing fruity tartness. It is being served at the brew pub in a 20-ounce glass for $5 through September and is also sold in a two-liter bottle for $11 plus a $7 deposit.
Carrying home the seven-and-a-half-pound bottle is a serious undertaking. But you can take it back, empty, and then carry it home again, filled, for another $11.
The new rauchbier, made with a smoked malt that imparts a decidedly smoky flavor, is a deeper color and has a somewhat skimpy head. At the brewery a 16-ounce mug is $4. It is also available in the two-liter bottle for $11 plus $7 deposit.
Zip City also makes good, earthy root beer, $1.25 for a 12-ounce mug. It will be available in bottles later in the year.
Another hand-crafted root beer, this one from England, is Virgil's, a dark, spicy brew. Like the Zip City beers, it comes in an old-fashioned stoppered bottle secured with a wire spring. But it is a reasonable 15.2-ounce bottle.
It is sold for $2 to $3.50 a bottle at the Gourmet Garage, 453 Broome Street (at Mercer Street); Greenwich Liquors, 161 Greenwich Avenue, Greenwich, Conn., and Bagel Express, Sterling Plaza, Route 10, Randolph, N.J.

HEADLINE: Census Justice for Cities

 BODY:
After 14 years of frustrating litigation, New York and other major cities have won a major judicial ruling that holds out hope for correcting the Census Bureau's habitual miscounting of the nation's population. The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York held on Monday that the Bush Administration had failed to justify its refusal to adjust the skewed undercounting of minorities and ethnic groups that cheats cities of the political representation and economic benefits their true numbers deserve.
Almost certainly the Supreme Court will have to review this decision, a profoundly merited intrusion into the Federal Government's discretion in running the census. If upheld, the ruling could shake up the decade's political maps for Congress and state legislatures and force state and Federal governments to rectify inequities in population-based distribution of benefits. 
 The court's opinion, by Judge Amalya Kearse, was joined by Judge Pierre Leval. Ordinarily, as a lower court observed, Federal bureaucrats are sustained unless they acted "beyond the pale of reason." But the appeals court, citing the census's constitutional purpose of fairly apportioning Congressional seats, said that when voting rights were concerned the bureaucrats had the burden of showing that their refusal to adjust the census furthered a legitimate government purpose.
For decades the population survey has missed millions of urban dwellers -- the very people whose crowded living conditions, apathy and suspicion of authority add to the social burdens and service needs that an accurate census can help relieve. The undercount ends up shortchanging cities in Federal and state allocations pegged to the census.
Over the years population experts have developed acceptable statistical techniques to measure the undercount and adjust the tally. But the Bush Administration, no political ally of urban interests, flatly refused to apply those methods.
Judge Kearse's opinion studiously avoids the partisan politics that permeates the dispute. She did not mention the demoralizing fact that former Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher, who rejected census fairness, was between stints as chief fund-raiser for his friend George Bush.
Instead she simply recited years of high-level resistance to the statistical improvements worked out by the bureau's scientists and Mr. Mosbacher's unrealistic insistence on total precision for any alternative methods. All in all, she said, the Secretary plainly had not made a good-faith effort to achieve what the law required him to seek: accuracy, as nearly as practicable.
States that stand to lose numbers in the House of Representatives are certain to seek Supreme Court review even if the Clinton Administration does not. The current Court tends to favor the Federal Government in disputes like this, but the appeals court's reasoned opinion will be hard to reject.

HEADLINE: White House Memo;
First Things (the Elections) Come First for Chief of Staff

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Leon E. Panetta holds the rank of White House chief of staff. As his very first change of staff suggests, even that grand title understates the job.
Mr. Panetta has yet to reveal a long-rumored reshuffling of the White House or even hire his own aides. But on Tuesday he reshuffled outside the White House, tapping a fellow Californian, former Representative Tony L. Coelho, to in effect run the Democratic Party through the November elections. In part, his move reflects an understanding that President Clinton's agenda is a dead letter if Democrats lose many seats in Congress, as a number of experts predict. 
 It also hints at the breadth and urgency of the political rescue operation Mr. Panetta is conducting. With the President sinking in the polls, his legislative goals imperiled and Whitewater rearing its head yet again, any dramatic White House administrative changes -- changes Mr. Panetta pledged six weeks ago to make "earlier rather than later," if needed -- await more-urgent political duties.
"There are some fundamental problems that need to be addressed now, the most important being the President's legislative agenda," one senior Administration official close to Mr. Panetta said today. Should Mr. Clinton lose the summer's battles on Capitol Hill, this official said, the damage to Democrats "would be considerable."
And so for now, the new chief of staff is also the new chief lobbyist, attending Democratic whip meetings on Capitol Hill to find votes for health-care, crime and trade bills. And he is the chief image-maker, summoning consultants and political friends for advice on how to focus the public's fuzzy view of just what Mr. Clinton stands for.
Perhaps most of all, he is trying to focus Mr. Clinton himself. He is reining in the many aides-without-portfolio who once had fingers and entire hands in almost every Oval Office decision, for example. And he is trying to get the President himself to stop talking so often, for so long, on so many topics.
That may be one of the hardest jobs of all.
Still, one would never know it by talking to the new chief of staff. When Mr. Panetta speaks of managing the most powerful office in the world, he does so in the blandest of bureaucratic language.
"What we're involved in here is the need to make the transition from a campaign organization to a governing organization," he said, "and that means greater discipline, greater lines of authority, greater focus on what needs to be done. Just the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the organization needs to be improved."
 
A Curb on Give-and-Take
 In an interview this week in his White House office, a capacious affair decorated with Ansel Adams landscapes, Mr. Panetta said one of his priorities when he took on his new job on June 28 was to draw clear lines of responsibility among Mr. Clinton's aides. "There has been a tendency to have a group of people trying to manage an issue who may not have been assigned that responsibility under their job description," he said drily.
On any issue of note, Mr. Panetta said, White House advisers must now submit "decision memos" to him, for review and forwarding to the President, rather than hash out policy in the kind of open-ended give-and-take for which this White House became famous.
A second priority, he said, is to insure that aides do not "bypass the process," going around bosses to lobby the President directly. Mr. Panetta has cut back aides' access to the Oval Office.
Mr. Panetta said he had not decided when, or even whether, to undertake a full-fledged reorganization of the White House, much less who should be moved, promoted or let go. The White House did confirm today that he and the President had decided to replace the acting counsel, Lloyd N. Cutler, with Abner J. Mikva, now chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. But Mr. Cutler's departure had been planned for weeks.
Still, there have already been some less-than-full-fledged changes. By Mr. Panetta's account, two of Mr. Clinton's closest advisers and Arkansas friends, Bruce R. Lindsey and Thomas F. McLarty 3d, have circumscribed duties. Mr. Lindsey, who has handled much of the political damage control stemming from Mr. Clinton's days as Arkansas Governor, is now becoming a more generic legal adviser; Mr. McLarty, Mr. Panetta's predecessor as chief of staff, now serves mostly as a liaison to the business world and to conservatives.
A third free-ranging aide with an office next to Mr. Clinton, George Stephanopoulos, now acts as a deputy to Mr. Panetta, focusing on Capitol Hill and the day's brush fires.
Moreover, Mr. Panetta is widely reported to be considering changes in the White House communications staff, which handles public relations and the press, and in the advance office, which plans and helps select Mr. Clinton's trips.
Virtually all these changes are rooted in a worry that the public, confused and worn out by Mr. Clinton's broad list of legislative goals and his varying explanations of personal and political conduct, is starting to write him off. The White House is especially concerned by polls suggesting that the public -- in particular the political independents who carried Mr. Clinton to victory in 1992 -- is increasingly unhappy with his leadership and gives him no credit for the healthy economy or for past victories in Congress.
Mr. Panetta's apparent solution, at least for now, is to plunge into both the White House's message machinery and its lobbying operation. He describes himself as one of the coordinators of the President's strategy for pushing health care legislation through Congress, and said he was lobbying lawmakers to approve Mr. Clinton's crime bill and a new world trade agreement that has unexpectedly met some Republican opposition.
Asked what role that left the White House legislative office and its chief lobbyist, Pat Griffin, Mr. Panetta chuckled and said: "He basically is picking up the rest of the legislative effort, and he works as a member of the team on these issues as well."
Mr. Panetta has also assumed command of an informal group of political and communications strategists who have already reshaped the way Mr. Clinton appears in public.
In recent weeks, the President has delivered more prepared statements and delivered fewer off-the-cuff remarks at photo opportunities. He has staged a nighttime press conference, a setting where advisers believe he looks especially Presidential and where he can appear to be taming the press corps. He has made a point, in virtually every public appearance, of reciting a list of legislative and political achievements of his first term.
Discipline in his public remarks is not easy for Mr. Clinton, who has been known to wax effusive about underwear and his pollen allergy as well as about details of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Indeed, he sometimes falls short: after agreeing last month with Mr. Panetta and the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, to read a statement on Rwanda without taking questions from reporters, he strode to the White House press room, read his statement -- and took questions.
In an interview last week, Mr. Coelho, the Democratic Party's new overseer, said of the President:
"He understands that there has to be discipline, that there has to be a structure, that if it's not there, it's the missing component. He's going to be in good shape.
"But he needs to let Leon be Leon."

HEADLINE: Stocks Up Modestly as Dow Rises by 11

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The stock market posted modest gains yesterday, bolstered by takeover fever among drug stocks and renewed interest in semiconductor stocks.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 11 points at 3,766.76. 
 In the slow summer market, investors kept their eyes on special situations, like American Products' $8.5 billion bid for American Cyanamid. Its cash tender, begun Tuesday, excited investors about the drug sector.
Nasdaq stocks gained, with the index rising 5.59 points, to 728.20, as investors snapped up technology issues. Computer-chip stocks soared on a healthy orders report, and interest also grew in software company stocks.
Eugene Peroni, technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott, said the semiconductor book-to-bill ratio for July was in line with or better than forecasts. The industry reported the ratio at 1.04, meaning there were $104 in new orders for every $100 of semiconductors shipped.
"I think it's putting a more positive tone into the market because technology does have the sizzle that can get people excited," said Dennis Jarrett, analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Co.
Mr. Peroni said the gain in semiconductors gave a boost to the overall market. But he said there was still resistance around 3,780 to 3,800 on the Dow as traders fret about a possible hike in interest rates from the Federal Reserve.
 
Federal Open Market Meeting
The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee will meet on Aug. 16 to discuss monetary policy, and Mr. Peroni said Wall Street has already factored in a quarter-point rise in interest rates.
Robert Stovall of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers said a rotation was taking place among the market's leading issues, with capital goods and heavy industry stocks taking a back seat while investors chase technology stocks and pharmaceuticals.
He noted semiconductors usually make a move up in the fall, and some investors apparently were trying to get an early start on the seasonal move.
In the semiconductor group, Micron Technology rose 3 1/4, to a new high of 42 1/4, Motorola gained 1/2, to 54 and Texas Instruments jumped 3 3/4, to 84.
Elsewhere in the technologies, Hewlett Packard added 2 1/2, to 82 1/4 and networking stock Cabletron Systems rose 2 1/4, to 101 7/8. And Lotus Development rose 4 5/8, to 40 1/4, while Dell Computer jumped 1 3/4, to 32 3/4.
In the drug group, Upjohn rose 1 3/4, to 35 1/2, Bristol-Myers Squibb gained 1 3/8, to 55 5/8 and Merck jumped 1 3/8, to 32 1/4. Also, Lilly jumped 1 7/8, to 50 5/8, while Pfizer gained 1 1/2, to 65 1/8.
American Cyanamid, the object of American Home Products's $95 per share offer, ended unchanged at 93 5/8.
The Standard & Poor's drug company index rose 3.8 percent.
New York State Electric and Gas was a big decliner, dropping 4 5/8, to 20 7/8. The company said it does not expect to earn its allowed return on common equity and the board will continue to review its common stock dividend.
Analyst Mark Luftig of Kemper Securities said the news was a surprise and the dividend could be cut by one-third.
Among other active issues, Dillard Department Stores fell 4 7/8, to 26 5/8. Late Tuesday, the retailer announced disappointing second-quarter earnings.
Lam Research rose 2 7/8, to 36 1/8. The company on Tuesday announced strong earnings, Smith Barney and Kidder Peabody upgraded the stock.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 279.5 million shares, up from 259 million on Tuesday. Advances beat declines 1,186 to 941 on the Big Board.
Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 2.38 points, to 460.30. The American Stock Exchange index rose 1.75, to 443.97.
The New York Stock Exchange Composite index rose 1.24 to 254.20.

HEADLINE: Does This Mean Abortion?;
Vatican and U.S. Battle Over Document for Population Talks

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: ROME, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Less than a month before the countries of the world assemble in Cairo to discuss how the planet can avert catastrophic overpopulation, the United States and the Vatican have emerged as the poles of a bitter debate over one central theme: should abortion, in any form, by any name and for any purpose, be legitimized in the lexicon of international relations?
At issue is a document drawn up at a preparatory meeting held in New York in April under United Nations auspices. Yet the arguments of both sides might almost be drawn from different texts as the United States and the Vatican wage a diplomatic war of selective quotations from the same pages to support opposite views. 
 This week alone, the Vatican has produced a detailed critique to show that the Cairo document comes close to a call for abortion on demand. And the chief American negotiator, Timothy E. Wirth, the Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs, has insisted that "neither U.S. policy nor the Cairo document promotes abortion" and, indeed, that the idea is to reduce abortion rates.
 
'Loaded Language'
 So who's telling the truth? By their own definitions, both sides are.
"There are problems of ambiguous language," said a senior Vatican official closely involved in negotiations still under way to seek a consensus before the Cairo conference opens in September. "On each side, some phrases are looked on as loaded language."
Thus, in a debate that sometimes resembles the kind of textual dispute more familiar to theologians, the United States cites Chapter 8, Paragraph 25 of the draft document, which refers, clearly enough, to "proper counseling to reduce the rate of abortion" as an aim that should be pursued as countries seek better health care for women.
The Vatican counters with Chapter 7, Paragraph 1, which advocates the right of women to "safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of fertility regulation of their choice," while Chapter 7, Paragraph 4, speaks of services including "pregnancy termination" as part of the "reproductive health" services that should be available to women.
"If Timothy Wirth can say that that doesn't mean abortion, then let's get a wording that's absolutely clear," said the Vatican official, who insisted on anonymity.
Moreover, to support its arguments, the Vatican refers to American objections to Chapter 7, Paragraph 22. This restates the conclusions of a major population conference in Mexico in 1984, saying in part, "Governments should 'take appropriate steps to help women avoid abortion, which in no case should be promoted as a method of family planning.' "
Underlying the textual debate is a profound collision of visions between the United States, where the Cairo conference is seen as a potential harbinger of great change in the lot of women, and the Vatican, where Pope John Paul II sees the gathering as a harbinger of victory for what he terms "the culture of death."
 
'Biggest Battle' for the Pope
 Marco Politi, who covers the Vatican for the Rome newspaper La Repubblica, commented: "After the epic duel with Moscow and the Polish Communist Party to save Solidarity, this is the biggest battle for Pope John Paul II. The stake is the family and the aim is to subdue the United Nations, defeat Clinton and force the Cairo conference to rewrite its manifesto so as to eliminate any reference to abortion laws."
The Vatican argues that, on nine-tenths of the Cairo document, there is no dispute with Washington. And Katie McGinty , director of the White House environment office, said "the confluence of our interests with the Vatican's is so strong" on matters including women's and children's health and the role of the family.
Neither does it seem in dispute that the conference will confront a crucial issue: according to newly released World Bank figures, the world's population, estimated at 5.7 billion, could reach 8.5 billion in the next 35 years. The Cairo conference is aiming to stabilize it at 7.2 billion by the year 2050.
Yet the Vatican's campaign -- the most vociferous and global on a specific issue in years -- is based on a variety of perceptions that seem to preclude consensus in Cairo.
One is the belief that the American aim at the gathering is to enshrine the right to abortion for every woman in the conference's final declaration.
Vatican officials insist that they base this belief on a confidential American cable sent from Washington to United States embassies around the world that, they say, makes it a priority for American diplomats to work toward that aim.
While senior Vatican officials say they have seen a leaked version of this cable, they have not produced it to reporters.
Additionally, Roman Catholic doctrine that life is sacred from the moment of conception and that no artificial means of birth control should prevent the transmission of life dictates its own solution to the population crisis.
"One of the principal convictions of the church is that demographic growth is the child of poverty," said a Vatican reporter, Giancarlo Zizola. "And so it's necessary to work for world economic reform: rather than reduce the numbers at the world's table, you need to increase the courses and distribute them better."
 
A 'Type of Murder'
 In Italy itself, the Vatican has begun an effort to persuade the new, conservative Government to "harmonize" its position for the Cairo conference. The campaign already appears to have had some success. Despite legislation in Italy permitting abortion in some cases, the neo-Fascist Environment Minister, Altero Matteoli, told Vatican Radio on Tuesday that, as far as he was concerned, abortion was a "type of murder."
Some analysts believe the Vatican's campaign is advancing on a broader front.
"In fact, the Vatican has already won a first round," Mr. Politi wrote in La Repubblica. "Diplomatic observers are convinced that the preparatory document for the Cairo conference will be changed in part."
"One-zero for Wojtyla," he added, referring to the Pope by his Polish name.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE;
Excerpts From Senators' Speeches on the Mitchell Health Care Plan

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from statements made yesterday on the Senate floor in the second day of debate over the health care bill, as transcribed by The New York Times from a broadcast on C-Span.
 
STATEMENT
BY SENATOR ROCKEFELLER
We're all here to confront problems, not to pretend that they don't exist. We're all here to represent the people of our states as part of the same union, bound together as a nation. And now we have reached this moment when we confront a problem called health care in America. In our wake are years and years of speeches about the crisis of rising health care costs and diminishing health care coverage.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We've reached out in terms of making alliances not mandatory but voluntary; we've stretched out the time line. If there is ever to be a mandate, it will never happen until the next century, and only then under certain circumstances, only if the Congress doesn't follow the orders of the commission.
We have reached out. But . . . this does have to be a two-way process. We cannot constantly be reaching out and out and more and more, and then nothing comes back. So it's very hard to reach agreement that way.
So here we are with our years of speeches about this crisis. This debate begins after, as you go over the years, I would say virtually thousands of hearings here in Congress, certainly tens of thousands of hearings. There've been public meetings at our homes and visits that all of us have had with people of our states, hundreds of reports, hundreds of studies and commissions, mountains. They fill cabinets in everyone's offices and in distant chambers somewhere in this complex, telling us some of the grim facts about health care in America.
 
Emphasis on Realism
We have to be realistic. The Senator from Minnesota spoke about the fact that we let the market work. That's one of the compromises that Senator Mitchell has made in his bill, is to give more time for the market to work.
But I have to point out to my friends on the other side that the Department of Labor has recently indicated that workers who are insured, who have insurance through their jobs, that their number dropped from 66 percent to 61 percent over the last 10 years, and that the trend is downward under the voluntary system.
That means, Mr. President, that 5.5 million more working insured Americans are now uninsured. The market system works in different sectors in different ways. Does it work perfectly in health care? I'm afraid not.
At some point we have to draw on everything that we have learned from the experts, from our own constituents and from our own souls, and decide on the actual steps that will solve as much of the problem as we possibly can this year.
With the health care plan submitted by the majority leader, we now have that opportunity. This is a bill that tries to achieve the major goals of health care reform in ways that will work and that we can afford and that are fair.
The majority leader can only offer the rest of us the opportunity to act; he has no powers further than that. Then it's up to us.

 	 	 		. . .	 	If too many senators treat this debate upcoming as only a chance to score points one against the other, one party against the other, their win is the American people's loss. If too many senators also stay stuck on the idea that we should hold off one more time, until next month or next year or the next election, their delay dashes the hopes of millions of Americans, many in my state, that are now thinking maybe, just maybe, something will soon happen here to help them with their health care nightmares.
 
STATEMENT
BY SENATOR KERREY
The question before us is whether or not we have the capacity to bridge the differences between Republicans and Democrats and pass a bill that is urgently needed by the people, urgently needed.

 	 	 		. . .	 	There truly are people in America watching now, hoping that this debate gets interesting, and hoping that the debate, as a consequence of getting interesting, leads to a finished product, the enactment of legislation. The question before us is, Can we bridge the differences? . . .
It is true that we are dealing with a seventh of the U.S. economy. It is true that we are dealing with something that's life and death for the American people, and so we need to give it our full and serious consideration. We're prepared to do that.
 
Demand for Care
Many of us, indeed I would say most of us, have spent a great deal of time studying this issue, a great deal of time at home looking at the problems that are there. It is, as the President said, bankrupting this country. There will be a $38 billion increase from last year to this year just in Federal spending for health care -- $38 billion. . . .
It is a tremendous amount of money, and the President of the U.S., when he started this thing, said it's bankrupting America, and it is bankrupting businesses and, increasingly, it's bankrupting families.
Why? Well, in part we're demanding expensive health care. Not very many of us walk in and say, "Could you give me the cheapest thing you've got."

 	 	 		. . .	 	We've gone from a point in 1950 where 80 percent of the bills were paid with cash; today, 80 percent is either socialized through the Government or it's socialized through insurance. Eighty percent have our health care bills paid for by someone else. And it's a consequence that most of us don't even know what the price is. And most of us in this body need to be reminded that, for tens of millions of Americans, even having a baby can be a financial catastrophe.
Mr. President, it costs $12,000 to have a baby in this city. Imagine that, $12,000. That's two-day normal vaginal delivery. Now the insurance companies only pay for a day. Two-day normal delivery, $12,000.
Mr. President, my babies were born 19 and 17 years ago, and I paid cash. I didn't have to be insured 20 years ago. Why? Because having a baby wasn't a financial catastrophe if you weren't insured.
We have driven increased demand into the system. In order to provide coverage for individuals, in order to reach out and help individuals pay the bills, we've driven increased demand into the system. The price goes up, the requirement for increased subsidies occurs as a consequence.

 	 	 		. . .	 	There are tens of millions of Americans out there who do not have the capacity to pay the bills, who are forced to ingratiate themselves, to remain on welfare before they are told that they're eligible. All of us feel that there's a problem in America. We can see the gaps and differentials that separate Republicans and Democrats, and my sincere hope and prayer is that the momentum that seems to have stopped, that seems to have caused lots of us to say, "Well, I'm not sure we're going to get a bill" ----
I hope that we are able in a quiet moment to acquire the humility necessary to see that the American people are counting on us to set aside our differences and enact legislation this year. It is urgently needed. And we ought to do the best we can and get a bill to the President of the United States so that he can sign it on behalf of millions of Americans who are hoping and praying that we are able to get the job done.
 
STATEMENT
BY SENATOR DOMENICI
I want to talk a little bit about health care reform and the Federal budget.
Now, why would I do that? Because essentially, whether we like it or not, we are going to be voting on legislation that has a big effect on our children and grandchildren in terms of the budget of the United States, whether we are still in enormous deficit position, whether we are still unable to pay our bills as a nation.
And thus, in a very real sense, the effect on the Federal budget of this plan -- and any major plan -- is of extreme importance, and we ought to try our best up front to understand.
It not so easy because we are sending new things to those who make the estimates all the time. Evidence of that today when every section in this bill has been changed, and yet we had some estimated costs in here the day before yesterday. . . . So we must be careful not to saddle our young people and to burden future generations with today's health care costs.

 	 	 		. . .	 	There is no more compelling case for controlling health care costs than their current and projected impact on the Federal budget. Indeed, one of the most critical issues facing the country is continued growth of open-ended mandatory spending in the Federal budget. That is, you create a situation where a citizen is entitled as a matter of law to benefits and if you don't pay them, they can enforce it in a court of law. That's the definition of an entitlement. And this is led today by Medicare and Medicaid and the resulting growth in budget deficits. . . .
New Entitlements
These new entitlements will bring millions of Americans onto the Federal Government's subsidy program, and let me give you the best estimates I can there.
An estimated 100 million Americans will be eligible for Senator Mitchell's premium subsidies alone, not counting the long-term care, which is a new program with new beneficiaries, and other entitlements in this bill. I am not counting them; I am only counting the recipients of subsidies in whole or in part from insurance premiums.
And what's most alarming to me is the growth rate of these new entitlement programs. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the new premium subsidy program will grow over 10 percent a year even after it is phased in.
So if we thought we had things under control and we're getting them there with new health care reform admittedly, right up front the Congressional Budget Office warns us that these subsidy programs will grow at a rate of 10 percent a year even after they are phased in. The Medicare drug benefit, a brand new one, grows at 10.5 percent a year even after phased in. The long-term-care program grows 44 percent a year, according to the Congressional Budget Office once it's in full effect.
So I don't think there can be any mistake about it: The Mitchell-Clinton bill, under the guise of health care reform, will create several new open-ended, runaway entitlement programs.
 
STATEMENT
BY SENATOR CHAFEE
I want to say I'm delighted we're moving into this health reform legislation this week. It's very complicated, but I think it's time for us to do the best we can do struggle for constructive changes that are going to help our citizens lead healthier lives. . . .
No American's going to remain untouched. It's going to affect how we're born, how we live, how we die. And this is far-reaching.
I think I just saw in the paper a note of a little child born in Pawtucket, Diana Rebello, Pawtucket, R.I., born on Sunday night, Aug. 7, in Women and Infants Hospital in Providence. Think of her life and what it means.
And then I think of Theresa Nigrelli of Westerly -- 100 years old, still stringing pearls every day at Nigrelli Jewelers. And she doesn't even need glasses. So we think of her, too.
And the financial aspects of this are mind-boggling. They've been touched on before, but I'd like to repeat: one-seventh of our economy in the United States of America is devoted to health care, one-fifth of the Federal budget. Of the five biggest items in the Federal budget -- Social Security, defense, interest on the debt, Medicare and Medicaid -- it's the last two that are going right off the chart, Medicare and Medicaid. Defense, banging along, going down. Social Security, fairly stable. Interest on the debt going up but not such a substantial amount. But it's the last two that are causing us our principal problem.
Now, the 1,410-page bill before us was only released a couple of days ago, and as I understand -- I'm not sure it's accurate -- I understand that changes are still being made to it. So it's up to us during this debate to air thoroughly for the American people what's in this proposed legislation and to insure that our actions don't make the situation any worse. Clearly we don't want to go backwards.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Now we all know from study and vast experience and listening to witnesses much that's right and much that's wrong with our health care system. And we acknowledge that in many respects it's exemplary: in technology and innovation, the skill of our professionals and the range of choices.
But we also know there are several things that demand reform. And it seems to me very important to keep in mind, What are we trying to do? What's the endgame here?
 
Goal of Security
And I think our objectives are three:
First, we must give Americans health security. We want to insure to hard-working people like Christopher North of North Smithfield, R.I., that he doesn't live in fear of losing his coverage. He, his wife and two sons were covered by his wife's policy through her employer. She lost her job. They applied for a new policy. They were turned down. Why? Because their son had a pre-existing condition. Minor though it might have been, it was enough for the insurance company to turn him down and thus their family's insurance down. . . .
But what about job lock? In other words, staying in a job you want to leave but you can't because if you go to the new place you won't be able to get insurance. Donald Bolster, Bristol, R.I., 13 years with Blue Cross. His wife suffers now from Parkinson's. No other insurance people, plan, will take them on because of a pre-existing condition. They can't shop for insurance coverage. They can't get an alternative plan. They don't have portability. They can't move to another job. That's what's known as job lock.
 
Covering the Uninsured
The second objective: We must extend health insurance to those -- as many as we can -- who are not now covered. We want to make sure that the first group can keep their insurance; the second group we want to extend it to them. We know the statistics: 15 percent of Americans, 37 million Americans, at any one time without health insurance. In my state, it's 92,000 of our citizens -- 15,000 of them are, regrettably, children. Can't get, or don't have, health insurance.
Now who are these uninsured?
Many people have the impression that the uninsured are the poor or the elderly. That's no so. . . . The very poor have Medicaid; the elderly have Medicare.
Ironically, in our system, single-parent families are better-off in terms of health insurance than two-parent families. Single parent families are frequently on Medicaid. But two-family parents aren't. One of them's working and works for a company that doesn't provide it; the other, the wife, is at home or she's working in a firm where they don't provide the insurance likewise. Earn too much to qualify for Medicaid.
The vast majority of people without health insurance live in families in which the head of household is employed for at least some portion of the year. These aren't people who are the unemployed -- never getting a job. They're employed for at least some portion of the year.
In my state, 76 percent of the uninsured are in families in which the head of household works full time; 85 percent have incomes above the poverty level.
Now we all know it's very costly for society when individuals like these don't have health insurance. They're the ones that go into the emergency rooms of hospitals for treatments, for procedures that the hospital emergency room is not the right place. It's far too expensive for these individuals to be. Or else they don't go anywhere. And then the child or the individual, the parent, comes down with a devastating illness, that in the end costs our society far more.
 
Controlling Costs
Now the third objective is to do something about controlling costs. Cost containment is the buzzword that's used.
The cost of health care in our society is getting tremendously expensive for the individual, for the companies, for states -- particularly through Medicaid -- and for our Federal Government.
In the United States as a whole we spend 14 percent of our gross domestic product on health care, more than any other industrial nation. The Federal Government spends 19 percent of its budget, nearly 20 percent, nearly one-fifth of all our expenditures on health care. And that's projected to go up to 25 percent by the end of the century. And local and state governments, particularly through the cost of Medicaid for state government, spend about 15 percent.
Now the country just cannot sustain these costs. You talk about what it's doing to businesses. The statistic is well known that there's a greater cost for health care involved in every automobile that's built by Chrysler and Ford, General Motors, more for health care than there is for the steel in the automobile. Twice as much we spend for health care in the United States per automobile worker per car than is spent in Japan.

 	 	 		. . .	 	There should be a minimal level of Government intervention. Let's not replicate Medicare, which has been fine for the beneficiaries but a disaster in terms of cost containment. That's the ultimate of the micromanagement program. It's cumbersome; it's top-heavy with regulation. It produces a 12 percent annual growth in costs, which is more than double what the private sector's going up in.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Now it seems to be we can begin to debate in earnest, taking up the bill produced by the distinguished majority leader, Senator Mitchell. He's worked hard to fuse the two bills in the Finance Committee and the Labor and Human Resources, which is a herculean effort. And I think we're indebted to Senator Mitchell for the effort he's made.
 
Seeking a Consensus
Now there are a number of provisions in this that cause me great concern. And the Senator from Massachusetts says, Well, Dick, list them. But just don't attack the measure. Tell us specifically what you're talking about. . . .
Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Maybe I don't read the legislation right. Maybe it's changed in the subsequent rewrite. I don't know. But the President and Senator Mitchell and others have indicated they're willing to give voluntary market solutions a try before imposing Government controls. In this bill in many areas in my judgment, that voluntary market solution effort has not been given the chance it deserves.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The Mitchell bill, but for the employer mandate, appears to reflect few of the principles that those of us in the mainstream have: those of us erring on the side of less government intervention, more marketplace competition and effective cost containment. . . .
Does it mean we can't unite?
I believe we can unite.
Does it make sense for us to try for a bipartisan measure that keeps in mind the two objectives we all say we're for?
I think if you ask people out here what are they for, they'd all say two things: We want to increase the number of Americans who have health insurance with our goal of eventually covering everyone. Everybody would agree with that, I think, very few not.
And secondly, our objective is to get costs lower for individuals for companies for state governments and for the Federal Government. Cost containment.
Nearly all of us pay tribute to the effectiveness of the marketplace. We all seem to subscribe to the notion of competition. There'd be very few people get up on the floor of this Senate and say, "I don't believe in competition. I don't believe in the effectiveness of the marketplace."
We subscribe to the notion of competition, those of us in the mainstream. We're for the most part extremely skeptical of government intervention. So why can't we unite behind a bill that incorporates those beliefs? . . .
 
'What an Opportunity'
I and all the other members of the mainstream group want to see good health care reform enacted this year. We'll do all we can to be helpful. We believe it's extremely important to have a bill with broad support.
What am I talking about? 75 or 80 votes in favor. That's not an impossibility. Rather than a measure that sneaks through, 51 or 52.
Time is getting short, but there still remains time to produce a product that will be of great benefit to millions of Americans.
What an opportunity! What a wonderful opportunity!
So let's not let it slip through our grasp.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Says the Fed Uses Anecdotal Guides

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10

 BODY:
The head of the nation's central bank told a Congressional panel today that changes in the American economy had made it impossible for the Federal Reserve to follow any one computer model or economic indicator in setting short-term interest rates.
As a result, the Fed tries to gauge the economy's strength and forecast inflation by relying on a broad range of models and statistics and by paying attention to anecdotal evidence from trade groups and advisory councils of prominent business executives, said Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. 
 "Such detailed readings of firm behavior are important, for example, in indicating when inflation pressures are beginning to mount," he told the House Government Operations Committee's panel on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs.
Mr. Greenspan's testimony was further evidence that top Federal Reserve officials look for anecdotal clues about future inflation even though broad price indexes remain stable. Although the Fed's approach to setting interest rates has always been somewhat intuitive, it has grown more so in the last several years as traditional indicators, such as growth in bank certificates of deposit, have tended to show less and less correlation with economic growth.
 
Interest Rate Increase Expected
 Marc W. Wanshel, an economist at J. P. Morgan in New York, said that today's testimony indicated again that the Federal Reserve was soon likely to raise interest rates once more regardless of whether Government price indexes later this week showed higher inflation.
"He reiterated, in a way, that you can't wait for inflation to appear in the broad indexes," Mr. Wanshel said.
The Government is scheduled to announce on Thursday morning how much producer prices rose in July; July's consumer price figures will be released on Friday. The Commerce Department is also scheduled to announce on Thursday the level of retail sales in July.
Mr. Greenspan particularly criticized the quality of consumer price data, saying that he and many other economists felt that the Government had overstated inflation, driving up the cost of Federal programs linked to the consumer price index. But even the true, lower rate of inflation could be a long-term problem, he said.
Many Wall Street analysts expect that the Federal Reserve's interest-rate policy committee will raise rates soon, possibly at its meeting next Tuesday. They point to signs that the economy is growing significantly faster than its long-term average and that shortages of materials and skilled workers may soon rise as a result, sending prices up.
 
Inventory Buildup a Concern
 Seven members of the policy committee expressed some of these worries in separate interviews over the last week, although they were also slightly concerned about a large buildup in inventories during the second quarter that could take a while to sell.
Under a prior agreement with the House panel, Mr. Greenspan's testimony today did not include any discussion of current interest rate policy or the current health of the American economy. Instead, he delivered a lengthy tutorial on the flaws in Government statistics and the shortcomings of computer modeling.
Technological changes in particular, such as the spread of computers, have made it hard for the Government to measure accurately the economy's health, Mr. Greenspan said. Past measurements of the tonnage of aluminum production or manufactured goods output were much easier, and probably more reliable, than measurements of the nation's output of computer programs, which vary greatly in quality.
At the same time, computer models of the economy have proved unreliable because they wrongly assume that past economic relationships will stay the same.
 
Skepticism Needed
 "History teaches us that the underlying structure of the economy is in a continuing state of flux," Mr. Greenspan said. "Current estimates of key parameters describing the basic relationships are based on past experience and need to be viewed skeptically when making policy for the future."
He added that the Federal Reserve had tried to get around this problem by calculating many different forecasts and assigning them different probabilities.
While many corporate forecasters of the economy continue to rely on large computer models, and while the Federal Reserve staff continues to maintain one, models have gone out of fashion in academic circles. Laurence M. Ball, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University, said, "I was at a conference recently where someone presented results based on a large econometric model and the general reaction was that this was antiquated, something that belonged in the 60's," he said.
Mr. Greenspan called today for the Treasury to begin issuing bonds with regular interest payments that would vary with the level of inflation. Government bonds currently make fixed payments. The prices people were willing to pay for inflation-indexed bonds would show how fearful they were of inflation, he said.
 
Measure of Fear Sought
 Because inflation fears tend to be self-fulfilling, the Federal Reserve now goes to great lengths trying to measure these fears to determine when interest rates need to be raised. Currently traded bonds vary somewhat with inflation but are an imperfect indicator of inflation fears.
But a senior Treasury official said this afternoon that while the agency had been intermittently studying the possibility of inflation-linked bonds for 15 years, no decision was likely soon. The Treasury made a big shift in the spring of last year when it decided to issue more short-term securities and fewer long-term bonds, and is unlikely to make another shift quickly, said the official, who insisted on anonymity.
The sharp shrinkage in the Federal budget deficit has also reduced the need to find new ways to finance the shortfall, the official added.

HEADLINE: Inland Region of Brazil Grows Like Few Others

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BETIM, Brazil

 BODY:
Inside a factory complex that sprawls over nearly a square mile here, assembly lines are running three shifts a day, propelling Fiat Automoveis S.A. past Ford and General Motors to rank as Brazil's second-largest car maker.
Smaller only than Volkswagen, Fiat presents the flashy face of a lesser-known region of Brazil that is quietly enjoying the highest industrial growth rate in South America. 
 Here, along a 300-mile inland corridor linking the state capitals of Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo, industrial activity is expanding at 10 percent a year, a pace of expansion seldom seen today outside coastal China.
 
Fiat's Big Commitment
 "This will be the main plant for producing Fiat's new world car," Pacifico Paoli, chief executive of the subsidiary, said one recent evening here in Betim, about 20 miles west of Belo Horizonte, as assembly lines worked full tilt.
Fiat of Brazil, already the Italian auto maker's largest subsidiary, is investing $1 billion in expanding the plant here -- four times the parent company's total investment planned at all other Fiat plants around the world.
This industrial surge has driven Minas Gerais past Rio de Janeiro, to become Brazil's second-biggest state economy, after that of Sao Paulo.
Minas Gerais may be little known outside South America, yet its $40 billion economy, and its 16 million people are comparable to the economy and population of Chile.
United States investment here has lagged behind that of Europeans. Even so, the score of American corporations already operating in Minas Gerais include Alcoa, Cargill, General Electric, TRW Automotive and Union Carbide. Citibank and the Bank of Boston have offices in the state capital, Belo Horizonte. And state officials are wooing General Motors, which plans to build an automobile plant in Brazil next year. With such interest, American Airlines will inaugurate daily service between Miami and Belo Horizonte in December.
Responding to Minas Gerais's economic growth, the United States Commerce Department plans to open an office in Belo Horizonte later this year. "It's a state the size of France, with an expanding economy," said Geoffrey H. Walser, a Commerce Department officer in Sao Paulo. "More and more Americans that come here say they also want to visit Belo."
Underlying the state's growth is its longtime status as Brazil's mining and steel center. Minas Gerais, which means General Mines in Portuguese, produces 77 percent of the nation's iron ore. And its nine privately run steel plants produce 41 percent of the nation's steel.
Brazil's two largest mining companies are planning to spend about $1.5 billion to expand iron-ore operations here. Gold-mining companies in the state are undergoing multimillion-dollar expansions.
The latest transformation dates back to 1976, when Fiat began turning steel into cars. Since then, manufacturing has expanded from a quarter of the state's exports to half of them.
 
Magnet for Secondary Industries
 With its rapid growth, Fiat has drawn 53 car-parts manufacturers to the region. It now employs 18,000 people here, and a similar number work in nearby auto-parts factories. The company is in the process of raising the Minas Gerais-originated content of its cars, from 25 percent in 1989 to 60 percent in 1996.
Cheap land, relatively low-cost labor, and abundant steel and electricity are cited as factors in Fiat's expansion. So, apparently, is worker satisfaction. While strikes close auto plants around Sao Paulo perhaps once a year, Fiat has not had a strike here in a decade.
"We have been running three shifts for a long time," said Mr. Paoli, who has watched Fiat's market share in Brazil jump in the last year from 21 percent to 27 percent.
Undoubtedly influenced by Fiat's track record, General Motors and Autolatina, a Ford-Volkswagen consortium, are reportedly leaning toward choosing Minas Gerais for factories they plan to build in Brazil next year.
In March, a French-Brazilian group started to assemble JPX four-wheel-drive vehicles in Pouso Alegre, a city in this booming industrial corridor. The vehicle, which Peugeot sells in France, is produced here with a Brazilian body and an imported Peugeot engine and transmission. Following the same formula, the joint venture intends next year to make pickup trucks and station wagons.
The industrial corridor's growth is expected to continue unchecked, straining a main transport artery, the largely two-lane road that links Belo Horizonte with Sao Paulo.
The bottlenecks are so bad that companies allot 24 hours for a tractor-trailer to go the 281 miles between the two cities. This resulted in intense business pressure on the state governments, and six months ago ground was broken on a $750 million project to expand the road to a four-lane divided highway, The improvement could result in as much as $10 billion of new investments along the corridor, officials calculate.
 
Balanced Budgets, Outside Help
 In recent years the national Government, short of funds, has littered the landscape with unfinished big construction projects. But contractors think this highway expansion will be completed on time, at the end of 1996. The project is being financed by the Inter-American Development Bank and the state governments of Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo.
In a nation that until recently suffered from double-digit monthly inflation, business people appreciate the sober financial habits of Minas Gerais's state government, which has balanced its budget for the last three years. The state raised $400 million this year through the sale of Eurobonds, backed by shares in the state electricity company.
"It was the first of any kind of international bonds floated by the federal Government or by a Brazilian state since the debt crisis of 1992," said Antonio Claudio Sochaczewski, Brazil's representative at the Inter-American Development Bank. Brazil rescheduled its foreign commercial debts with creditor banks in March.
With Rio de Janeiro suffering from street crime and kidnappings and Sao Paulo beset by pollution and traffic congestion, Belo Horizonte looks increasingly attractive to businesses.
 
Livable, but Also Dull
 Built 100 years ago as a planned city full of parks, this state capital of two million was recently rated Latin America's most livable major city by the Population Crisis Committee, a private group based in Washington.
But with a new international airport as yet offering only three international flights a week, foreign business people complain that life in Belo Horizonte can be stultifying.
"Professionally, Belo is very challenging," said Edward M. Mason, who has built his distributorship of Cummins diesel engines here into the United States company's largest outlet in Brazil. "Personally, it's much less comfortable."
Determined to increase foreign investment and trade, the state's business leaders are campaigning to soften the taciturn and insular qualities that people here are known for.
"We have to break down these closed, introverted habits," said Emerson de Almeida, dean of the Dom Cabral Foundation, a local business school. "To get more investment, we have to create a more international environment, with language training and international schools."

Short-Term Treasury Issues Rise

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of short-term Treasury securities rose yesterday, while the long bond remained unchanged, as investors turned their attention to the final leg of the Government's quarterly refinancing.
The market also braced for a batch of important economic data, which many analysts suspect will be magnified because it is coming ahead of the meeting on Tuesday of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's policy-making body, which will decide when another increase in interest rates will come. 
 The auction yesterday of $12 billion of new 10-year notes, which traders said was a modest success, buoyed the bond market slightly in the afternoon. An early weakness in prices was attributed to comments by the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, to a House Government Operations subcommittee.
Analysts said that while Mr. Greenspan's comments differed little from previous comments he had made, their impact was greatly increased by the scheduled release this week of July producer and consumer prices and retail sales, ahead of the Open Market Committee meeting.
The 30-year bond was unchanged, at 84 20/32 , to yield 7.57 percent, while short rates declined sharply, suggesting that investors are moving away from the more volatile long end to the safety of the short end.
In when-issued trading, the yield on a 10-year note dropped to 7.28 percent, from the average 7.33 percent at auction. Tomorrow the Treasury will auction $11 billion of 30-year bonds, which were offered in late when-issued trading yesterday at a price to yield 7.46 percent, unchanged from the previous day.
Hugh A. Johnson, chief investment strategist for the First Albany Corporation, described the 10-year auction as solid, but not spectacular.
"Essentially when you look at all technical ways to measure the success of an auction, the auction came off as about as expected," he said. "Some of those ways being the average yields, the so called tail, or spread between the high and low bids, and the level of noncompetitive bids."
Mr. Johnson said traders were not disappointed by the auction yesterday. "There was some short covering by dealers when they saw the results," he said. "However, Thursday promises to be a very big day in bonds, with plenty of room for major surprises or disappointments."
With that in mind, he said, many dealers looked at the auction results yesterday as an excuse to cover their short positions.
The market's primary focus today will be on the Producer Price Index, which is expected to increase by about 0.4 percent overall, and 0.2 percent at the core.
"The principal source of its strength is expected to come from gasoline and coffee prices," Mr. Johnson said. "In addition, we also expect July retail sales to increase either 0.1 percent, or remain flat. Excluding auto sales, retail sales are expected to register an 0.5 percent increase."
Traders and analysts said Mr. Greenspan's comments contained few surprises, as he reiterated concerns about the inaccuracies of inflation data. They said his contention that the Consumer Price Index was overstated inflation was nothing new.
The following are the results of yesterday's 10-year Treasury note auction:

A Foreign Offering's Unsure Pedigree

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Peddling a Chinese power company to American investors would appear to be a classic no-brainer. China, currently one of the world's fastest-growing economies, is badly in need of more electricity; its total output of 181 million kilowatts is already 20 percent less than overall demand, which is expected to grow by a whopping 17 million kilowatts a year until the turn of the century.
Why, then, are American depository receipts for shares of Shandong Huaneng Power Development Company Ltd., which operates three power stations in China's second-fastest-growing province, selling for below their offering price since they began trading on the New York Stock Exchange last week? 
 The answer reveals as much about China's bid to attract international financing for its modernization as it does about Wall Street's ambition to become banker to the mother of all emerging markets. What seems to have been lost in the middle were the concerns of the investors required to put up the money.
Shandong Huaneng's rocky debut may also deal a blow to China's efforts to raise money to improve its infrastructure. Three more power companies are expected to be listed in New York and Hong Kong in the coming months. Unless Shandong Huaneng begins to trade above its offering price, those issues may have to settle for lower prices.
"You clearly have to take this into mind and probably price accordingly," said Anthony Cragg, who manages two international funds for Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management Inc. based in Menomonee Falls, Wisc. "I can't see now how it could not have an impact."
Doubts about Shandong Huaneng, which is the first Chinese utility to be listed overseas, developed soon after its stock opened last Thursday. More than 14 million shares -- or 60 percent of the total offer -- traded hands on the first day. Though the shares closed at $14.25 each, the same as the offering price, rumors that CS First Boston, the issue's lead underwriter, was supporting the price further eroded investor confidence.
The stock opened at $14 on its second day of trading, indicating to some fund managers that CS First Boston was no longer willing to prop it up. More investors bailed out.
This week, Shandong Huaneng shares drifted down until yesterday, when they closed at $13.875, up 37.5 cents on a volume of 274,000 shares.
CS First Boston said that it could not comment on the stock, citing regulations prohibiting an underwriter from commenting publicly about one of its deals until 25 days after it begins trading.
But several analysts put the blame for the stock's weak performance in part on the fact that Shandong Huaneng is a company created just for this deal so that American depository receipts, representing 30 percent of the new company's shares, could be listed in New York.
"The company wasn't really a company," said Sheldon Kasowitz, a utility analyst and director at Jardine Fleming Asia Research Ltd., in Hong Kong. "It was just a bunch of discrete plants that they tied a bow around and wrote a prospectus on."
Mr. Kasowitz and other Hong Kong-based analysts have also charged that the New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission relaxed their listing standards for Shandong Huaneng because they want more Chinese companies to come to New York.
For example, the S.E.C. only required the company to produce one year's audited accounts. In Hong Kong, which is competing with New York for Chinese listings, regulators require three years of audited accounts.
Officials from both the S.E.C. and the Big Board said that the company got no special treatment. The New York exchange said it received one year of audited accounts and two additional years of pro forma accounts, while the S.E.C. said examining more than a single year's accounts would have been irrelevant since the power stations were operating within state-owned entities.
"We feel that we got the kind of disclosure that was relevant given the kind of environment in which this company existed," Robert Bayless, associate director of corporation finance at the S.E.C., said.
But the problems with Shandong Huaneng are more fundamental, analysts say. The company plans to use the $311 million it received from the offering to retire $83 million in loans from two of the three Chinese state entities that together own 70 percent of the company. It also plans to use the new capital to expand its overall generating capacity, including the completion of a fourth plant now on the drawing board.
The prospectus offers an annual return of 15 percent on the company's average net fixed assets. But the return is denominated in Chinese yuan, which was devalued against the dollar by a third earlier this year. That would have cut the return to American investors by a third as well. And the yuan may face further devaluations as China's annual rate of inflation continues to top 20 percent.
Since the stock began trading, some fund managers have also been surprised to learn that the guarantee of a 15 percent annual return on assets is not as firm as they had thought. Between the initial and final versions of the prospectus, CS First Boston inserted new language revealing that only part of the interest costs on future debt raised by the company will be paid for by raising its customers' rates for electricity. Thus, the return on assets will likely fall below 15 percent, depending on how much the company borrows in the future.
Despite these pitfalls, some investors argue that the issue would have been successful had it been priced more cheaply. But one member of the underwriting syndicate, who requested anonymity, said that the Chinese insisted on a high price to raise as much cash as possible.
The competition for Chinese listings among investment banks is fierce. Rather than risk losing the business, CS First Boston apparently priced the issue aggressively, according to several fund managers.
At the offering price of $14.25, most demand for the stock was met, meaning that when it started trading there were few other buyers waiting in line. Once the stock began wavering, short-term investors hoping to make a quick profit began to sell.
"There are a lot of people at the moment who take new issues and are looking for an instant pop," Mr. Cragg, of Strong/Corneliuson, said. "If they don't get it, then they dump it and move on to the next one."

As Baseball Strike Looms, Many Bystanders Are Out

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
The looming baseball strike is all about millionaires fighting millionaires for the last Learjet on the lot. Isn't it about time they thought about the others involved -- the hot-dog vendors, the parking attendants, the 10-year-olds who would rather watch the Yankees than Beavis and Butt-head?
Wait; don't touch that dial. Such sentiments may be commonplace. This time, though, they are echoed by economists generally known for their distance from the fray and faith in contracts signed by consenting adults. "There is a good argument here for a forced resolution," confirms Lawrence White of New York University's Stern School of Business. 
 Economists have always had an uneasy time with the right to strike. Sellers of steel or baby formula are not permitted to set prices collectively, the argument goes; why, then, should groups of workers who make the steel or baby formula be permitted to withhold their labor unless they are paid the wages they collectively demand?
 
Employers Have an Advantage
 The answer is that labor markets do not quite work according to Hoyle. Employers, especially big ones, have an advantage in bargaining with individual workers, who cannot lightly put their livelihoods at risk by holding out for better terms.
The right to organize -- and the strike threat -- can neutralize the advantage. What's more, notes Daniel Hamermesh, an economist at the University of Texas, the social consequences of labor negotiations that end in impasse are generally modest. "Even when strikes do take place," he points out, "they usually have very few consequences for the average consumer."
There is nothing usual, however, about Major League Baseball, notes Louis Guth, a senior vice-president of National Economic Research Associates. Baseball is an unregulated cartel, uniquely exempt from the antitrust laws. It is also heavily subsidized, with sweet deals on stadiums in many locales. And both facts suggest that the public should have some standing in contract talks.
By the same token, baseball players are hardly potential candidates for Karl Marx's reserve army of the unemployed. Their salaries are modest in the first few years, but only in comparison with those of middle-aged investment bankers and neurosurgeons. Thereafter, players' wages are determined by arbitration or free agent negotiation -- with average deals well above $1 million a year. And in Mr. Guth's view, generous arbitration awards have actually cost the owners more than free agency bargaining.
The core issue apparently dividing the players and owners is a salary cap. The owners claim some clubs are losing money, and that the only practical way to prevent a continuing escalation of budget-busting salaries is to limit the total amount paid by each team to a percentage of league revenues.
That doesn't sound right to Mr. White, though. If the idea is to reduce the temptation of richer clubs to bid up the salaries of superstars, he notes, the clubs could always pool a higher percentage of their own revenues. Mr. Guth agrees: "All they're arguing about is who gets the money."
Still, economists are reluctant to have third parties dictate contract terms. Arbitrators typically look for the middle ground, even when it makes little economic sense. In the case of rail labor disputes, for example, imposed settlements have probably slowed the end of featherbedding.
But in the case of baseball, Mr. White argues, little seems to be at stake other than who gets the gravy. And while baseball may not be vital to the economy, the loss to the public from a strike would be large compared with potential economic losses built on an arbitrator's middle ground.
What middle ground? Ray Fair and Sharon Oster, both economists at Yale University, are glad to be asked. They imagine a compromise in which teams would be discouraged (rather than barred) from paying salaries above a negotiated threshold -- say $2 million.
Owners would be obliged to contribute a portion of every dollar above that threshold -- say 30 percent -- into a fund that would be distributed among the teams and players. Just how to parcel out the cash would also be a matter of negotiation, says Mr. Fair, as long as it did not go back to the clubs or players who had negotiated the "excessive" salaries.
The probable impact on salaries is not clear. The threshold might serve as a benchmark for the highest salaries, a psychological line not easily crossed. On the other hand, if the threshold were set low, it might serve as a minimum that every free agent demanded and expected.
But from the public's perspective, it would not matter much: Changes in salary scales this rich would presumably have little effect on player effort or recruitment. Hardly anybody, presumably, decides to become an insurance salesman instead of a third baseman because the latter are paid $1.5 million a year rather than $2 million.
What matters is that the players would play ball rather than golf for the rest of the summer. And that would make the hot-dog vendors, parking attendants and 10-year-olds much happier.

A Movement In the Labor Negotiations: Out the Door

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Negotiators for baseball's club owners and players have not reached an impasse, one of them said yesterday, but their talks clearly are stalemated and the players will walk out after they play the 10 games that are on the schedule for today and tonight. Practically speaking, the strike already has started for the players on the eight teams that aren't scheduled.
Technically, the game's eighth work stoppage in the last 23 seasons will not be official until tomorrow's night's schedule of 14 games is wiped out. But as Donald Fehr, the players' labor leader, said yesterday, even if a settlement to the labor dispute somehow developed overnight, many players already would have left game sites. 
 Chances of a settlement, though, are so remote that the negotiators did not even set another bargaining session after they ended yesterday's meeting in two and a half hours.
Asked if the two sides are at an impasse, in the legal sense of the term for labor purposes or otherwise, Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief labor executive, said, "I don't consider we are right now."
Fehr did not answer the question directly, saying, "We have not even reached the point in which there is a conceptual framework within which we can negotiate a deal."
The owners remained firm in their quest for a new economic system, the focal point of which would be a salary cap. The players remained equally as firm in their opposition to the drastic change, preferring instead to continue the existing system.
"Players have a choice," Fehr told a news conference at the Hotel Inter-Continental in Manhattan. "Take a salary cap proposal now, take it after the season because they impose it or strike. The owners have very deliberately left the players no choices at all."
Fehr repeated his contention that the owners wanted to force a strike. Ravitch denied the assertion, saying: "There is no owner who wants a strike. Don't be fooled for a minute that any owner wants this, that there was any plan to bring this about. That is not the case."
But it is the case that no agreement looms on the horizon on this or any other planet.
"At this point," Fehr said, "I have no reason to believe that anything of significance will occur today or anytime soon."
Ravitch did not express a different view.
"We will continue to hope," Ravitch said, "that maybe, as Don put it in the meeting, that lightning will strike and one of us will have a good idea that can bridge this gap in the next day and a half. I'm not optimistic."
 
Who's Not Being Responsive?
 In his remarks, Ravitch continued hammering at the theme that the players have been unresponsive to the economic problems the owners have described.
"If they are unwilling to address the underlying economic issues of the game and work with us to solve them," he said, "not much is gained by sitting across the table and exchanging disagreements."
Fehr, however, said the players have been responsive, presenting their ideas on revenue sharing last week. He did not provide details, saying he wanted to hear the owners' response first.
"We have given the owners ideas on how to ameliorate these problems," he said. "We had outside economists review the situation and suggest a number of changes which they believe will respond to the problems the owners have articulated. There are a lot of basic things you can do that will go a long way to solving these problems. The trouble is the owners don't want to do it. They want a salary cap instead."
 
A Revenue-Sharing Plan
 The owners adopted their own revenue-sharing plan last January but linked it to the players' acceptance of a salary cap. Fehr has stressed that the owners' economic fight is an intramural matter, low-revenue clubs vs. high-revenue clubs.
Ravitch dismissed the union's revenue-sharing ideas, saying they have "nothing whatsoever to do with the player compensation system. They suggested that big markets should contribute more money to the smaller markets, not too much because the smaller markets might put that money in their pockets instead of spending it on players."
Although the bargaining session produced no movement, except out the door, Fehr said the union representatives were pleased to hear "frank acknowledgments" from Charles O'Connor, Ravitch's general counsel, "that their proposals are designed to limit salary growth and put artificial limitations around free agency. That is the purpose of it."
"He's alluded to that before," Fehr said. "This was the frankest expression of it."
 
Restricting Free Agency
 Curt Schilling, a Philadelphia Phillies pitcher who drove to New York for the meeting that also was attended by 12 members of the Yankees and Baltimore Orioles, said he asked if a salary cap would restrict free agency and "they said yes."
Ravitch told the players that the owners were not proposing the new system because they have an inability to pay. If the owners did make that claim, they legally would have to open their books to the union.
But, Ravitch added, "That doesn't mean the industry doesn't have economic distress."
 
The Talking Has Stopped
 Both sides said they would meet if either had a reason to meet. Asked if he thought there could be a lengthy adjournment in the negotiations, Ravitch said: "I don't know. I believe any opportunity to talk is useful. I certainly do not believe we should stop talking no matter what."
The players at the meeting addressed a report that some owners apparently think the players will return from a strike after they miss their second paycheck.
"They clearly indicated if anybody holds those illusions, they should think about it again," Fehr said.

 BODY:
JACKIE MASON thinks so, and filed a $25 million lawsuit this week in New York State Supreme Court against five organizations that select the Tony nominees. He charged that their failure to consider him this year for his one-man Broadway show, "Jackie Mason: Politically Incorrect," constitutes discrimination.
HARVEY SABINSON executive director of the League of American Theaters and Producers, which administers the Tonys along with the American Theater Wing, said he could not comment directly on the suit yesterday because he was not aware of it. 
 But he did say, "One man shows have never fallen within the guidelines." What's more, Mr. Sabinson said, "We recognized Jackie Mason when he first came to Broadway in 1987 and gave him a special Tony Award then."
Mr. Mason no longer has that Tony: he returned it in protest on June 7, five days before teh TOnys were awarded.
Contending the Mr. Mason met all the requirements for a Tony nomination, MEL SACHS, his lawyer, said, "They failed to abide by his human and civil rights and didn't give him the proper opportunity to enhance his economic, cultural and intellectual life."
Mr. Mason said yesterday, without a hint of humor: "It was an abridgment of my rights as a human being. They can't stand a guy with a big mouth who donesn't conform to the elitism of the inner circle."

HEADLINE: Speed the Train to the Plane

 BODY:
There are better ideas for connecting midtown Manhattan with La Guardia and Kennedy Airports than the Port Authority's plan. Some of the others would be cheaper, some more convenient, but all want for money.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, owner-operator of both airports as well as Newark's, has money -- from a $3 charge that all departing passengers pay. It has a plan -- not perfect, but workable. Moreover, the airports and the city have a desperate need -- for relief from congestion that pollutes the air and slows taxi and limousine connections to a nerve-racking crawl. 
 The Authority wants to build a 22-mile overhead track from Kennedy to La Guardia to the 59th Street bridge crossing the East River from Queens to Manhattan, then across to an underground station just south of Bloomingdale's. The estimated construction cost is $2.5 billion.
Ideally the train should go to one or both of the city's big terminals -- Grand Central or Penn Station -- where it could connect with railroads and subways. But just to tunnel to Grand Central would cost an extra $600 million, which no one has.
It would also be better, and cheaper, if the train could run on existing track. But under the 1992 Federal authorization for the $3-per-ticket charge, the money can only be spent on airport-related improvements; the train could not carry local traffic, only air travelers and airport employees. An all-new system for a limited body of users is obviously costly. That is a serious constraint, but Congress is not about to rewrite the law.
Any number of critics would be delighted to see the project halted, first and most forcefully the airlines, which want the money used to improve airport facilities. Second and most vocally are New Yorkers whose neighborhoods in Queens and the Upper East Side of Manhattan would be disturbed by the trains and by added street traffic at the Manhattan end. However, Claire Shulman, the savvy Borough President of Queens, where both airports are and all the overhead track would be, supports the plan enthusiastically.
Air travelers should be enthusiastic, too, for more reasons than just a faster trip. Train fare would be much less than a taxi, in the neighborhood of $9 to La Guardia and $12 to Kennedy. Airline competition should improve as well, with more domestic flights in and out of Kennedy when the airport itself is more accessible.
Several hurdles remain: completion of economic studies this month, official authorization of the final design by the Port Authority board later this year, negotiations with airlines and, possibly next year, final approval by the Federal Aviation Administration. Congestion can only get worse the longer the project is delayed. Rather than wait for a perfect system, the Authority should be authorized to proceed with its good one.

HEADLINE: Haiti's Thugs May Listen to Nothing but Force

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Since 1968 I have traveled to Haiti many times as a volunteer surgeon. On my visit in February 1991, two weeks after President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's election, it was obvious that something good had happened! The streets were clean (relative to the past and present), people seemed to be filled with hope and optimism, and smiles abounded everywhere.
During the next few months people began to return from the United States to homes in Haiti. Many opened businesses. Government programs for medical care, education and land reform were begun. President Aristide began restructuring Government finance, beginning with his own refusal to accept the presidential salary of $10,000 a month. 
 The "boat people" phenomenon began in 1973. Under President Aristide, however, the number of people leaving Haiti to seek political asylum dropped to its lowest. Those who traditionally had profited from government handouts, corruption and drug smuggling felt their livelihoods threatened by the new regime.
Military leaders, supported by these people, seized control in September 1991. Since then, Haiti has deteriorated dramatically. Attempts by the United States in the last three years to restore the elected government have failed. These have included lengthy discussions and increasing economic sanctions. The sanctions have hurt the masses of poor people who elected President Aristide and not those illegally in power.
During my most recent visit to Haiti last February, conditions were worse than ever. Since that time they deteriorated even more. Cessation of commercial flights will stop outside trade into Port-au-Prince. The country's leadership, which has access to military planes and private aircraft, will not be affected.
The elimination of financial transactions between the United States and Haiti will have only minimal effect on the country's leaders since their assets have already been transferred out of the country. Instead, the people in the streets who have been receiving $20 to $40 money orders from a family member in the United States will be most affected.
The Haitian people are dying in increasing numbers as the country's economy, medical care, sanitation and police forces deteriorate.
If heightened sanctions do not cause the leaders of Haiti to leave very soon, the sanctions must be considered a failure and the military incumbents must be removed by force.

HEADLINE: Big Firms Gain Bond Work Set For Minorities

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
In recent years, many Government agencies have decreed that some of the bondsthat they issue must be sold by minority-owned brokerage firms. As a result, about 300 such firms have been established, and they have taken a healthy share of the $2 billion in fees paid annually to brokers for selling public securities.
 Now, Wall Street firms, among them Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns, and regional brokerages are finding ways to capture some of this business for themselves. They are buying stakes in minority-owned firms, enabling them to profit from these set-aside programs too. 
It is a trend that troubles many independent, well-established minority-owned firms. They say that they are losing business to these new competitors, who are perverting the intent of affirmative action.
 "Women and minority firms built from scratch on a shoestring are now up against firms that are a quasi-subsidiary or arm of major underwriting firms," said Robert B. Lamb, a professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University, who plans to publish a study on minority-owned firms.
Among the most outspoken executives of established black firms is Napolean Brandford 3d, vice chairman of Grigsby Brandford & Company, a black-owned firm in San Francisco. "African-American firms are an endangered species," he said. "This is an attempt to circumvent inclusion or prevent major African-American firms from getting to the next level. These are not minority firms."
 Muriel Seibert, who heads a woman-owned brokerage firm, commented: "On one hand, it's wonderful these big firms are letting some of these people get into the business. But you've got to question their intention and what the real purpose is. I know I've lost business to them."
 Some minority-owned firms say they are also losing out to small but politically connected "storefront" minority firms, which have no employees, no ability to sell bonds and no intention of building a business. Still, they are given bonds to sell; they hand them to Wall Street firms and split the profits. Professor Lamb estimated that, based on his research, about half the 300 or so minority-owned firms are illegitimate.
 As the number of black and women public officials has grown, so has the number of programs to give minority-owned firms a bigger piece of public finance business. Typically, public agencies issuing bonds hire brokerage firms to advise them how to design the bonds and, later, to buy the bonds and resell them to the public. This is a risky business -- the firms need large sums to buy bonds and, often, to hold them in inventory. But the fees are lucrative.
 The programs requiring that a portion of the securities be sold by minority firms take various forms. Some include quotas. For example, in California, 15 percent of local and state bonds must be sold by minority firms, and 3 percent by women. Other large issuers, like New York City, simply aim for more minority inclusion.
 
Merrill Helps Utendahl
 In response, large Wall Street firms have helped establish and taken an interest in minority-owned firms that are geared to win business selling securities from Federal agencies. The most successful has been Merrill Lynch's investment in Utendahl Capital Partners, headed by John O. Utendahl, an African-American and former Merrill trader. Merrill Lynch has invested $3 million and extended a $9.9 million line of credit for a 25 percent stake in Utendahl.
 In its first year, Utendahl participated in underwriting syndicates that have sold $9.8 billion in Government mortgage-backed securities. Its assets have swollen to $13.9 million from $100,000, and its surplus capital, a rough indication of net worth, has reached $12.2 million.
 Merrill declined to discuss its involvement in Utendahl beyond describing it as a "passive, minority-ownership interest." A spokeswoman for Utendahl also declined to comment. But others are not so reticent.
 "It cloaks Merrill in minority status," said Harold E. Doley Jr., who is black and heads Doley Securities Inc., a brokerage firm. "It's as though these big firms are creating their own minority firms."
 
Resentment is Stirred
 "I resent it," said Donald Rice, president and chief executive of GB Derivatives, an affiliate of Grigsby Brandford. "Merrill's relationship is not some uninvolved third party providing capital. This is an ongoing relationship. Merrill people sit on the Utendahl board. The original offices were at Merrill. It was established as a bit of a front."
 Bear Stearns invested $10 million for a 25 percent stake in Blaylock & Company, headed by Ronald Blaylock, who is black and a former Paine Webber trader. "We're really independent of Bear Stearns on a day-to-day basis," Mr. Blaylock said. "But if they can help us, they will."
 Regional brokers are also embracing minority-owned firms to stanch the loss of business to them. For example, J. C. Bradford & Company, a Nashville firm, has joined forces with Ward & Associates, a black-owned firm in Atlanta, to create Ward, Bradford & Company, which is 40 percent owned by Bradford and 60 percent by Felker Ward, chief executive of Ward & Associates.
 "This arrangement gives us bonds and the opportunity to be in deals we wouldn't be in without Ward," said J. Ronald Scott, national municipal manager at J. C. Bradford. "For them, it helps with overhead. They don't have to have a big network to sell bonds."
 In another case, Estrada Hinojosa & Company, a Hispanic-owned firm in Dallas, recently sold about a 30 percent stake to Morgan Keegan & Company, a Memphis regional firm. Estrada will sell all the bonds it can, and Morgan has a right of first refusal on bonds that Estrada cannot or does not want to sell.
 "I gave up 30 percent ownership," said Robert Estrada, the firm's chief executive. "But it was worth it to have a safety net of capital and to be able to tell an issuer, 'If you put us in a deal, we will sell the bonds and not just be excess baggage.' "
 In addition, Morgan will advance Estrada additional capital to land bigger deals. "This is very different from what people see as a front," Mr. Estrada said. "Those have no intention of selling bonds. But we do. And we can tell clients if they hire us, they get access to Morgan's distribution network. With Morgan and us, it's, 'you help me and I'll help you.' "
 Indeed, minority-owned firms in such deals say they want to avoid the situation faced by many legitimate start-up minority firms: being picked to join an underwriting syndicate, yet not being able to sell bonds. Many small firms in that position have often sold their bonds back to the Wall Street firms in the syndicate, a practice that yields small fees for the minority firm but also raises questions about what real business function they perform.
 
Need for Capital Cited
 "We want to distribute bonds and incur market risk, and we need capital," said Daniel H. Kolber, chief executive of Jackson Securities of Atlanta, whose chairman is Maynard H. Jackson, the black former mayor. Jackson Securities is 15 percent owned by Wheat First Butcher Singer Inc., a Richmond broker.
 "This helps us get off the ground, and it gives Wheat First a return on their investment in us," Mr. Kolber said.
 Public finance firms are often started by women, black or Hispanic brokers with a background in the business but with more energy and brainpower than capital. For years, minority-owned firms with little money were given business by sympathetic public officials -- on the notion that once well funded, these firms could contribute beyond their minority status. As a result, even many legitimate firms, in their early days, did little to earn their fees.
 But regulators say that these firms are different from politically well connected minority-owned firms that do no work but are cut into a bond deal by Wall Street firms trying to curry favor with the officials deciding which firms get business.
 "Without having business directed to them in the past, a lot of good minority firms would not be here," said Richard Y. Roberts, a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission. "But it's gotten to the point that firms are being handed business that have no intention of growing. It's often difficult to differentiate where social policy ends and where you have glad-handing to political cronies."
 
An S.E.C. Investigation
 The S.E.C. is investigating reports of potential abuses involving minority-owned firms in at least three states -- Louisiana, Florida and Georgia -- as part of a larger investigation into political influence-peddling and questionable campaign contributions in municipal finance.
 For instance, in Louisiana, the S.E.C. is investigating an arrangement in which a local minority-owned firm got $240,000 in fees from First Boston and Lazard Freres but sold no bonds. The two Wall Street firms said the payment was suggested by local politicians.
 As another example, the S.E.C. is investigating AIBC Investment Services in Miami, partly owned by a Hispanic city commissioner, which received $350,000 last year without selling a single bond.
 "The whole point of economic opportunity programs is to create a level field," said Robin L. Wiessmann, a principal at Artemis Capital Group, a woman-owned firm. "But we've seen situations where firms are put in because of deals cut, and they've pocketed money with no notion of reinvesting in their firms."
 Complicating the debate is that municipal bond underwritings have fallen offthis year. And, set-aside programs that once assured many minority firms of steady business often work against them -- becoming more of a ceiling on future growth. Some government bond issuers are increasingly lumping all minority-owned firms together and giving each the same amount of bonds to sell, without regard to their size, skills or capabilities.
 "We sometimes get hurt by the tag of minority," said Richard M. Ramirez, chief executive at Apex Securities, a Hispanic- and black-owned Houston firm. "We don't want to be limited to little pieces of a deal. We want a bigger bite at the apple."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 19, 1994, Friday

 CORRECTION:
 A front-page article on Aug. 11 about government securities busi ness set aside for minority-owned brokerage firms reported that the Securities and Exchange Commis sion was investigating reports of po tential abuses involving firms in Lou isiana, Florida and Georgia.
 The article named the AIBC Invest ment Services Corporation of Miami as a firm being investigated. In fair ness, it should have included a com ment from the firm, which denies that it is being investigated by the S.E.C. The commission itself says only that it does not comment on possible investigations.

HEADLINE: AN EXXON VERDICT OF $286.8 MILLION

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER 

 BODY:
A Federal jury in Alaska decided yesterday that the Exxon Corporation should pay $286.8 million in compensatory damages to Alaskan fishermen, about a third of what they said was due them for harm caused by the nation's worst oil tanker spill five years ago.
The verdict was delivered in the second phase of a three-phase trial that began 15 weeks ago in Federal District Court in Anchorage. It was the product of 23 days' deliberation by the jury of nine women and three men on damage claims by more than 10,000 fishermen who work the waters of Prince William Sound, Cook Inlet and Kodiak Island. 
 Exxon had said the losses to commercial fisheries in the region totaled about $113 million; the plaintiffs had sought $895 million in compensatory damages.
After the jury's decision yesterday, Exxon's legal team argued that, on balance, the verdict seemed to favor their side, a point that the plaintiff's lead trial attorney, Brian O'Neill, did not vigorously dispute.
"It isn't what I wanted," Mr. O'Neill said. "I don't know what it means for the next phase. This is a very independent-minded group. Right now you just don't know how the ledger washes. I know it does mean one thing: the case won't settle. It will stiffen Exxon a bit."
In June, ending the first phase of the trial, the same jury found that the Valdez spill on March 24, 1989, was caused by the reckless behavior of Exxon's executives and the captain of the supertanker Exxon Valdez, Joseph J. Hazelwood. In the third and final phase of the trial, which resumes on Aug. 22, the jury will decide whether Exxon is liable for punitive damages. The plaintiffs are seeking $15 billion.
After yesterday's verdict, one of Exxon's trial lawyers, Patrick Lynch, said he was guardedly optimistic.
"The jury is a thinking, careful, judge-like jury," Mr. Lynch said. "They did not accept numbers that either side presented. That makes me optimistic going into phase three that they will listen to the evidence and give us a fair hearing. It's a signal."
The jury's decision yesterday was announced after the markets had closed. The price of a common share of Exxon stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $58.125, down 87.5 cents from the previous day.
In the annals of environmental cases, nothing has rivaled the legal battle under way in Anchorage between Exxon and thousands of Alaskans.
 
Mastering the Case
 On both sides, lawyers amassed millions of pages of documents, interviewed and prepared hundreds of witnesses to appear, if needed, in court, spent months in technical libraries to master such pivotal details as the life cycles of five species of salmon, the potential consequences of exposing herring and salmon larvae to trace levels of oil, and the way to distinguish the chemical signatures of the crude oil that the Valdez carried from Prudhoe Bay from the signatures of oil said by Exxon to be seeping naturally into Prince William Sound.
On top of this came data about marine sediments, the slopes of Prince William Sound's rocky beaches, the importance of sea plants like fucus and kelp to Alaska's marine environment, and whether the spill had injured plant and animal zooplankton, the foundation of Alaska's coastal food web.
From such details, Mr. O'Neill and his colleagues on the plaintiff's legal team built a scientific and economic case that essentially argued two points.
First, the lawyers said that the tanker's spilling of 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaskan waters ruined fishing in 1989, because the spill prompted Alaska to close Prince William Sound and other areas for fishing. Second, Mr. O'Neill said, the spill continued to harm the fishermen in 1990 and 1991 by diminishing the price they received for their fish, particularly in Japan, their largest market.
Third, Mr. O'Neill told the court, the spill caused a cascade of toxic effects to the natural environment in Prince William Sound, ruining salmon and herring fishing by causing genetic damage and other injuries to the fish.
 
Fish Deformities
 A principal witness for the plaintiffs was Dr. Richard Kocan, an aquatic toxicologist from the University of Washington. He testified that he had conducted experiments for the Government in his lab and had determined that when herring embryos were exposed to the trace levels of crude oil that he had collected from the Exxon Valdez, many developed severe birth defects, like misshapen jaws, kinked spines and eye defects.
Dr. Kocan said it was his opinion that the spill had either killed millions of herring or had seriously weakened the survivors. The result, he said, was that Prince William Sound's herring have developed a viral disease that causes lesions and a collapse in their numbers. This year, Alaska closed the sound's herring fishery because there were too few fish and some were sick.
According the verdict form that the jury gave the judge yesterday and that itemized the monetary damages, jurors accepted the plaintiff's evidence that the spill caused hundreds of millions of dollars in direct losses to fishermen in 1989, and the bulk of the $286.8 million that the jurors awarded the fishermen came from damages incurred that year. But the jurors' responses showed that they had largely rejected much of the rest of the plaintiff's case.
The jurors said they agreed with Exxon that the collapse of salmon prices in 1990 and 1991 were not caused by the Valdez spill. Exxon had argued that the price reductions were caused by competition from salmon raised on fish farms in Washington state and elsewhere.
The jury also rejected significant portions of the plaintiff's scientific case, the verdict form showed. The fishermen claimed that lingering toxic damage from the spill in Prince William Sound was expected to cause more than $82 million in losses in the herring and pink salmon harvests in 1992, 1993, 1994 and expected losses in 1995. The jury awarded the fishermen $29.3 million for losses in 1992 and 1993, but nothing for 1994 and 1995.

Torn by Change, Mexican Party Fights On

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 11

 BODY:
As the Institutional Revolutionary Party heads toward what may be the toughest election of its 65 years in power, it is mired in what many of its leaders consider the most profound internal crisis of its history.
Radical economic changes made by the Government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari have grated on the party's traditional support among labor unions and peasant groups. Ambitious efforts to build a new base of individual members rather than organizations have produced more conflict than success. In a society pressing ever more vigorously for democratic change, the party continues to depend on authoritarian controls. 
Yet for all the conflict that the party has endured in a year that has included the assassination of its first presidential candidate and a brutal fight over his replacement, the hulking machine known as the PRI has patched itself together and rolled forward once again.
It has raised tens of millions of dollars, enlisted hundreds of thousands of local organizers and dominated every advertising venue from prime-time television to whitewashed adobe walls. According to a growing number of political analysts and national opinion polls, it also appears increasingly likely that the party will do again on Aug. 21 what it has done throughout its history: Win.
"This party is like a floating log," one of its senior officials said, trying to explain how embittered older leaders of the PRI could have united around Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, the 42-year-old economist whose candidacy many of them tried to block after the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio on March 23. "You either grab on or you sink."
The mere prospect that the PRI could win a plurality of the vote is testament to the extraordinary ability of the world's longest-ruling political party to put aside its differences in the quest for continued power.
At the same time, many analysts believe the party's ability to survive by modernizing its vote-getting apparatus and adapting minimally to a changing political system while resisting more fundamental reform augurs darkly for the country's transition to full democracy.
"The party as it exists is undoubtedly in a terminal crisis and it has been held together only by the authority of the President," said Luis Javier Garrido, a longtime student of the PRI who teaches at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. "The problem ahead is that it does not know how it can make the transition from a party of the state to one more part of the system of parties that is coming into being."
In a speech last week that could prove either hypocritical or of fundamental importance to the PRI's future, Mr. Zedillo answered the rising demand for party democracy by vowing that if elected, he would give up the control that all of his predecessors have exercised over the party's internal affairs and choice of candidates.
 
Backing Down on a Pledge
 President Salinas also promised to make the party independent of the state, though he was never so explicit about how he would do so. He backed down from his pledge, many of his aides say, because he feared the consequences of free choice in an organization in which support for his policies was far from uniform.
And it was notable that when Mr. Zedillo spoke of ceding power over the party to its members, some of the most enthusiastic responses came from leaders of the old guard who apparently understood that their chance at a new political life may have come.
"What was crazy was to see all these men listening to this and applauding ferociously," said one of Mexico's leading businessman, Juan Sanchez Navarro, who was in the audience. "I could not believe they were hearing the same thing I was hearing."
Humberto Lira Mora, the party's electoral secretary, said the PRI "has always been able to allow different generations to mix and antagonistic currents to come together."
"If you study the PRI closely," he added, "you will see that its capacity to change is enormous."
 
Revolution's Heirs
Resisting Change, Seeking Stability

The problems that the PRI now faces have their origins in its stubborn resistance to change despite a radical reorientation of the Mexican economy and gathering pressure for democratic change.
From its creation as the National Revolutionary Party in the wake of another assassination, that of President-elect Alvaro Obregon in 1928, the party was meant to unite virtually all of the political forces that emerged from the 1910 Revolution.
A decade later, President Lazaro Cardenas renamed it the Party of the Mexican Revolution and began to reorganize it by sectors: The National Peasant Confederation handled rural problems. Bureaucrats were assigned to a National Confederation of Popular Organizations. Labor was eventually dominated by the Confederation of Mexican Workers. The farm and labor sectors, especially, would remain central pillars of the PRI.
The system worked well for the small elite of a largely rural nation and made Mexico a relative island of stability and development in a region more accustomed to turmoil. Politicians who controlled a union or province could trade their constituents' support for positions in a vast state bureaucracy. By banning re-election, the system reduced the incentive to break away. With weak opposition and the elaborate use of fraud, PRI candidates almost always won easily.
 
Debt and Independence
 The party's power began to wane as Mexico grew more urbanized and complex. Government could no longer be run by union and peasant leaders and provincial politicians.
After a foreign-debt crisis that exploded in 1982, budgets and jobs were slashed and the party dole shrank quickly. Mexicans began to organize themselves independently, and political opposition grew. Even within the governing party, tensions over the resistance of older party leaders to accommodate change contributed to a split in 1987 that prompted President Cardenas's son, Cuauhtemoc, and some other prominent PRI members to join with small leftist groups in what became the Democratic Revolutionary Party.
As young men like Mr. Colosio and Mr. Zedillo poured into Government, they brought Ivy League degrees but relatively few ties within the party. And as they moved from a closed, state-dominated economy to free trade and export-driven growth, their loyalties shifted from labor and peasant groups that depended on Government protection to middle-class people who relished the cheaper imports and businessmen who bought up state companies.
 
Colosio's Vision of Revival
 Mr. Colosio, who was made head of the PRI after Mr. Salinas took office as President, had a vision for its revival.
He would, he said in an interview at the time, "take the party back to its grass roots," approaching Mexicans as citizens rather than as workers or farmers, and offering to solve the problems of their communities rather than guaranteeing their jobs.
The scheme was closely linked to the National Solidarity Program, an ambitious anti-poverty initiative that Mr. Salinas built into a $3.8 billion-a-year empire of programs ranging from new water and electrical lines to scholarships so that children could go to school instead of to work.
To harness community involvement and assure a political benefit to the Government, the program called for the election of tens of thousands of local "solidarity committees." The new program engaged many of the Mexicans who had slipped beyond the Government's influence during the economic crisis, and identified thousands of local leaders untinged by the corrupt networks of the PRI.
At the party's 14th general assembly in 1990, Mr. Colosio, at Mr. Salinas's direction, began trying to extend the reform to the structures of the party itself.
 
Call for Internal Elections
 Most importantly, he called for the internal election of candidates to high office who in the past had always been chosen by the President. After one of Mr. Salinas's favorites for a gubernatorial nomination was outvoted by the rank and file, however, the practice was quickly scrapped.
The limits to Mr. Colosio's success became evident first when the party's leadership assembled again last year. Labor-union stalwarts, on whom Mr. Salinas had depended to push through controls on wages and the North American Free Trade Agreement, mocked the idea that they could be pushed aside, chanting of the citizens' movement, "Where is it?"
After Mr. Colosio was shot as he left a rally in the northern city of Tijuana, the older PRI leaders rushed to reclaim power. Close associates of Carlos Hank Gonzalez, 66, who amassed one of the country's biggest fortunes during a long career in public service, took over the presidency of the PRI and other key posts. A few others went to officials tied to Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, Mr. Salinas's former Interior Minister and a longtime national-security official.
But in spite of old-line PRI leaders' public grumbling that Mr. Zedillo would be even more "technocratic" than Mr. Salinas, the Yale-trained former Planning and Budget Minister was picked to replace Mr. Colosio. In imposing his choice, Mr. Salinas could risk some opposition within the party because he could assume wider support for his candidate outside it.
Almost as striking as the public challenge to the President's traditional prerogative of naming the party's candidate to succeed him is the way in which bitterly contending elements of the PRI have since been pulled together and harnessed to Mr. Zedillo's campaign.
 
Keeping Solidarity
The Old Guard Fights On

In Baja California, the state where Mr. Zedillo was born and Mr. Colosio was killed, the remnants of the old PRI organization, which suffered the party's first-ever loss of a governorship in 1989, remain in place. In several congressional districts, the candidacies were doled out to old union leaders, farm bosses or figures of the party's old guard.
Jaime Martinez Veloz refers to such figures as members of "the party," almost as though he belonged to another.
Mr. Martinez Veloz, a charismatic, 40-year-old architect who is running for the lower house of congress from Tijuana, is a candidate of the PRI himself. But almost more than that, he is a political product of the Solidarity program.
He has lived in the city less than three years. A former student leader in the northern city of Saltillo, he campaigns in jeans and sunglasses. His conversation is strewn with phrases like "the organization of the people." He tends to describe the moderately right-of-center city government of the National Action Party as "fascist."
And until almost the day he took to the campaign trial, he was the Government official in charge of the Solidarity program in Tijuana, the man most closely identified with the streets it paved, the sewers it dug and the 850 neighborhood committees it formed.
"The truth is, if we did not have that structure, we would never be able to do this," Mr. Martinez Veloz said. By "this," he meant the dislodging of the labor union hierarchy that once controlled his district for the PRI, fought bitterly against his candidacy and then pressured him unsuccessfully to accept one of its members as his second.
Officials of the National Action Party complain that Mr. Martinez Veloz represents merely a modernizing turn on the PRI's traditional dependence on state resources to maintain its political power. Where the old unionists could promise the voters jobs and coerce them with goons at the polls, Mr. Martinez Veloz barnstorms the neighborhoods where he has worked, avoiding explicit promises of more Solidarity projects but making it abundantly clear who has gotten the job done in the past.
"It is grotesque that the head of Solidarity would become the PRI candidate!" said Mario Herrera, a community organizer and political analyst who advises the National Action city government. "The entire basis of his campaign is that structure the Government set up."
Vehemently as it is sometimes expressed, however, such criticism is almost inaudible by comparison with that voiced at more traditionalist PRI campaigns in the area. After National Action won the statehouse in 1989, the new officials discovered checks and allocations that they said showed more than $10 million in direct outlays from the state budget to the PRI gubernatorial campaign.
But in an increasingly competitive political environment, the old controls of the PRI have eroded or broken down in countless ways.
At the international border crossing that connects Tijuana to San Ysidro, Calif., Lino Ronquillo, 34, a street vendor hawking pink-and-white ceramic piggy banks told how his support for the PRI ended abruptly when the opposition took over City Hall and stopped giving out the vendors' licenses through their PRI-affiliated union.
"Before, the union would take us all to certain polling stations to vote, and say that if you don't vote for so and so, you're not going to work anymore," said Mr. Ronquillo, who scoffed at the notion that such ballots were secret. "Now we are independents. You vote for whomever you want."
'Vote Promoters'
Seeking Support With Organization
 The PRI's essential adaptation to the loss of such controls has been one of organization: More than 3,600 PRI lawyers have been signed up to move around the country on election day to defend the party's vote if charges of fraud arise. Another 295,132 PRI representatives -- far more than any other party -- will monitor the 96,000 polling stations themselves.
As part of a strategy that the PRI began to develop in state elections while Mr. Colosio was its president, the party has blanketed Mexico with a network of "vote promoters" who canvass door to door.
In theory, the promoters merely encourage people to vote for the PRI and then, if they say they will, go back to their homes on election day to make sure they have voted or even physically lead them to the polls. As of last Friday, the promoters numbered 520,843 at the block level alone, with 366,111 more working individual sidewalks in the country's 10 largest cities.
Recent interviews with scores of voters around the country suggest that PRI votes will come from a mix of sentiments ranging from the almost-religious faith of those who could not fathom another Government to the cynical resignation of others who assume it would be a waste of time to vote for the opposition in a contest that will surely be decided by fraud.
 
Getting Out the Vote
 But many political analysts say that the persuading, cajoling and getting out of individual votes could be critical for the PRI.
"The fight of the elections is not at the macro level but at the micro level," said Mr. Lira Mora, the party's chief of electoral action. "You have to go to the street, house by house, vote by vote. We tell our candidates where the votes are and they go get them."
In the western city of Guadalajara last week, a courtly former mayor, Gabriel Covarrubias, 64, was out in one of the working-class neighborhoods he was trying to get to send him to the Congress, knocking on doors.
As he rebuttoned the button on his dark wool suit despite the afternoon heat, Mr. Covarrubias agreed with Maria Flores, 72, a retired shopkeeper, that the world had gotten very tough. Very tough.
"We must try to keep what we have," he advised her.

HEADLINE: 2d Atomic Sample, Likely From Russia, Found in Germany

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: BONN, Aug. 11

 BODY:
The German authorities have discovered a second tiny sample of weapons-grade nuclear material that may have been smuggled out of Russia to interest foreign governments or terrorist groups that may want to build atomic bombs, the police said today.
They said they had seized the material, 0.028 ounces of highly enriched uranium-235, in June in Landshut, Bavaria, and have since arrested five Czech and Slovak men and a German woman as suspects in what they surmise was an attempt to arrange the sale of a larger amount to someone who wanted to build a bomb. 
 The amount of uranium-235 seized is minute, about one ten-thousandth of the amount necessary to build a nuclear explosive. But officials are concerned that this might indeed be a sample from a larger amount available on the black market.
"This could turn into the most serious security threat since the end of the cold war, and it is getting steadily worse," a high-ranking German official said. "We have not even begun to get it under control, and we won't unless we all -- Americans, Europeans and Russians -- work at it together."
The police also found two-tenths of an ounce of highly enriched plutonium-239 in May in the garage of a German businessman in Tengen, near the Swiss border in southern Germany. The businessman, Adolf Jakle, is under arrest and has told investigators that other samples of uranium and plutonium from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe were in Germany and Austria.
But senior German officials say Mr. Jakle has not yet led them to any prospective customers interested in buying the material, which is used in nuclear warheads. The authorities suspect he was negotiating with contacts from Iraq or Iran on a deal to make one of those countries capable of building a nuclear weapon.
The police said that the uranium in the latest case was seized on June 13, but that they announced it only now so they could complete their investigations. The German woman, a real estate dealer, was arrested on Monday, the police said, and was regarded as the ringleader.
There is no apparent connection with the plutonium case, but it is also not clear whether the police have any leads to the woman's prospective customers for the uranium. They did not release her name.
"The latest discovery in Landshut shows that international organized crime -- a real atomic mafia -- is at work here," said Gunther Beckstein, the Bavarian interior minister. German officials fear that former officers of the Soviet K.G.B. are involved in procuring the materials for sale abroad by criminal groups.
Russian officials denied that the plutonium found in Mr. Jakle's garage had come from their country, but German experts have told the Government here that they are certain it did.
The Bavarian police said they had also seized 21.2 ounces of uranium pellets not suitable for bombs from a 35-year-old Czech man when they arrested him at a highway rest stop near Munich on July 4. He is not involved in the latest case.
The plutonium, analyzed in the Trans-Uranium Institute in Karls ruhe, could have come from a Russian nuclear power plant or a deactivated atomic submarine, according to the Bavarian police.
During the last year, there have been 123 cases of smuggling of radioactive materials -- mostly cesium or uranium used in medicine or industry -- from formerly Communist countries into Germany, the police said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Increases in European Rates Send Dollar Down vs. Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar plunged against the German mark and declined against other leading currencies yesterday as traders were unnerved by rising European interest rates.
Trading centered on European currencies for much of the day after the Swedish and Italian central banks raised their official lending rates. Those moves, in turn, fanned speculation that the Bundesbank of Germany would raise its rates. 
 The German mark advanced broadly, hitting a record high against the Italian lira. Trading in dollars was thin, exaggerating the dollar's fall, dealers said.
The Swedish and Italian rate increases quickly ended an early dollar rally on news that producer prices rose 0.5 percent in July -- heightening expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term rates next week to head off inflation.
The unexpected rate increases sparked a sell-off in bond markets across Europe and flight from the continent's weaker currencies into the mark. That gave American dealers an excuse to sell the dollar.
With Europe's economy picking up steam, many traders say, other European interest rates are likely to rise, which could put further pressure on the dollar. Rates in Germany already are higher than American rates. Countries with higher interest rates tend to attract capital flows, strengthening their currencies.
"The Swedish and Italian rate hikes came on top of fears that we won't see any cuts in Europe," said Hubert Pedroli, foreign exchange manager for Credit Suisse in New York. "Today, we got the coup de grace."
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5608 German marks, down more than two pfennigs from 1.5844 marks on Wednesday and the lowest level since July 18.
The dollar also fell to 100.15 Japanese yen from 101.45 yen. And it dropped to 1,579 Italian lire, from 1,591 lire.
The British pound rose to $1.5458 from $1.5365.
Compounding the dollar's interest rate woes, the Treasury's offering of $11 billion in 30 1/4-year bonds was poorly received, prompting heavy selling in the bond market.
"There was some panic selling of dollars," said Paul Farrell, manager of strategic currency trading at Chase Manhattan Bank. "There was a bit of an overreaction."
In recent months, weakness in American securities markets has hurt the dollar. Falling interest in dollar-denominated assets among foreign investors means less demand for the currency.
Mr. Pedroli of Credit Suisse said yesterday's events simply gave dealers bearish on the dollar an excuse to sell. He noted that the dollar had been hovering over 101 yen and near 1.59 marks for more than a week.
"Everyone has been waiting for a break either up or down. I think it happened today," he said.

HEADLINE: Fed Nominee Is Confirmed By Senate

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
The Senate confirmed President Clinton's nomination of Janet L. Yellen, a California economist, to the Federal Reserve Board tonight by a vote of 94 to 6.
Senators were eager to put Ms. Yellen on the board before next Tuesday's meeting of the central bank's interest-rate policy committee. 
 It is standard procedure for the Senate to try to hold votes on Federal Reserve nominees before they are next needed at a committee meeting, and Ms. Yellen is particularly popular because she expressed limited enthusiasm at her confirmation hearing for raising interest rates.
Few experts on the Federal Reserve expect Ms. Yellen's addition to the board to have any substantial effect on next Tuesday's meeting. New nominees to the board are seldom outspoken at their first interest-rate committee meeting and have only one voice among 19 members of the committee, said David C. Munro, a Fed watcher and economic consultant in Manhattan.
 
Decision by Consensus
 Ms. Yellen's addition is even less likely to affect the outcome because the committee does not appear to be split into factions that might give her a chance to cast a deciding vote, Mr. Munro said. The committee typically makes decisions by a consensus that Alan Greenspan, the chairman, usually shapes.
The interest-rate committee consists of seven Federal Reserve Board governors and the presidents of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks. The governors and the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York each have a vote at the rate meetings, and no more than four of the other 11 presidents cast votes at the meetings. The 11 presidents take turns casting votes during the course of a three-year cycle.
The Senate Banking Committee had approved Ms. Yellen's nomination last week by a vote of 18 to 1. The only vote against her came from Senator Lauch Faircloth, Republican of North Carolina, who had told Ms. Yellen at her confirmation hearing that her concerns should be limited to "inflation, inflation and inflation."
Ms. Yellen said at the hearing that she would seek to follow the Federal Reserve Act, which under a 1978 amendment calls for the central bank to pursue "maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."
In addition to Senator Faircloth, five other Republican Senators voted tonight against Ms. Yellen's nomination. They were Hank Brown of Colorado, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Charles Grassley of Iowa, Larry Pressler of South Dakota and Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming.
Ms. Yellen, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley who is best known for her writings on unemployment, has been confirmed to a full 14-year term on the Federal Reserve Board. She replaces Wayne Angell, who resigned as his term was expiring in early February and is now an economist at Bear, Stearns & Company.

HEADLINE: Reno Vows to Thwart Exodus From Cuba

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
In a swiftly escalating immigration dispute between the United States and Cuba, Federal authorities announced tonight that a speedboat carrying 20 Cubans was detained in the Florida Keys today, and Attorney General Janet Reno said the Government would take strong legal steps to stop a mass exodus from Cuba.
In a highly unusual evening news conference today, Ms. Reno said any United States-flagged vessels that appeared to be bound for Cuba to pick up immigrants might be stopped, boarded and seized by the Coast Guard. She warned that anyone trying to bring Cubans to the United States may be prosecuted. 
 "The solution to emigration pressures from Cuba is rapid, fundamental and far-reaching political change and economic reform," Ms. Reno said. "Uncontrolled exodus from Cuba does nothing to address Cuba's internal problems and places large numbers of persons at risk on the high seas."
Her remarks revealed the anxiety within the Clinton Administration over the possibility of another 1980 Mariel boatlift, when a rag-tag flotilla of American boats streamed from Florida to Cuba to ferry a cargo of 125,000 Cuban immigrants back to the United States.
The action follows harsh Cuban complaints after four hijackings of vessels in Cuba in the last two weeks by people who made the 90-mile run to Florida. Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, has said he might make lower barriers to immigration if the seizures continued.
Tensions have been climbing since the hijacking of a Government boat on Monday. Cuban officials are demanding the return of 26 Cubans on board. Instead, American officials released all but one of the boat's passengers.
The boat stopped today by United States Customs agents, was boarded at a beach resort in Key Largo, south of Miami. It was the first vessel known to have crossed the Florida straits to bring Cubans into the country, law enforcement officials said tonight, adding that the high-profile announcement of the detention of the craft and its crew of three was intended as a signal that authorities would not tolerate another boatlift.
The three crew members were turned over to immigration officials and were charged with illegally transporting aliens to the United States. The 20 passengers were held at a immigrant center in South Florida for processing under a program that, after a year, permits Cubans to seek permanent residency in the United States.
The Coast Guard is ready to rush more ships to the Caribbean in response to any mass migration from Cuba, the State Department said today.
At the time, Castro said that if Washington did not take swift steps to change its immigration policy, Cuba would make it easier for people to leave the country, and allow their relatives to come from the United States to pick them up.
Justice Department officials said today that each hijacking had been investigated but that no action had ever been taken after such seizures. Cuban officials say this encourages more such criminal acts.
State Department officials have said Mr. Castro has assured them that he would not set off another wave of emigration. In what some Cuban-Americans regard as an effort to soothe Mr. Castro, the State Department appeared to signal a tougher attitude toward hijackers. One State Department spokesman has said the hijackings are disturbing trend that places everyone involved in danger.
The Coast Guard has reported that immigration from Cuba has been increasing. The agency said it picked up 539 fleeing Cubans this month and 5,270 since the beginning of the year. That compares with 3,656 Cubans picked up last year and makes this year the highest level of entries since the Mariel boatlift.

Castro on U.S. Television
 By The Associated Press
Speaking from Havana on a Cuban television broadcast that was carried live on CNN in the United States, Mr. Castro accused the United States tonight of covering up Monday's hijacking and reiterated the accusation that a Cuban military officer had been killed. He said body of Cuban Lieut. Roberto Aguilar Reyes was found on Wednesday.
Mr. Castro also said the United States Government was responsible for the number of Cubans fleeing because of its embargo and its acceptance of Cubans fleeing in rafts and boats, contrary to Cuban law.
"They insist that we be the guardians of the U.S. border," he said. "They've created this situation of violence and hijackings."

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE;
Excerpts From Speeches by Senators on the Mitchell Health Care Proposal

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from statements made yesterday on the Senate floor in the third day of debate over the health care bill, as transcribed by The New York Times from a broadcast on C-Span.
 
STATEMENT BY SENATOR GRAMM
 I can hardly believe my ears when the health care system of the United States of America is compared unfavorably to the health care systems of Canada, Great Britain and Germany. Last year more people died in Canada waiting to get into the operating room than died on the operating table. People all over the world under government-dominated systems are dying because health care that is readily available in America is not available in those countries. And I want to begin my debate on this issue -- since everybody is talking about what we are going to gain by vastly expanding the role of government in health care decisions, I want to start by talking about what we stand to lose. . . . 
 First of all, we have, in the United States of America, the greatest health care system in the history of the world. In the last 25 years, 90 percent of all the pharmaceuticals, 95 percent of all the medical procedures, 90 percent of all the routine miracles that we expect every time we go to the doctor, every time we go to the hospital, they have all been developed by Americans.
It is very interesting to me that so many of my colleagues, when they think of medical perfection in the world, look to the north to Canada, and yet I notice when they and people they love get sick, they never ever go to Canada to try to get well. And yet on any given day in America, in any referral hospital, and I would ask my colleagues today to go out to Johns Hopkins University to their great medical center, and they will find that those referral wards are full of rich or politically powerful Canadians. They're full of people who have had an opportunity to look socialized medicine in the face in Great Britain and Germany and have found that face to be an ugly, uncaring face. And they have come to the United States of America to get health care.
Now, that may not tell some people anything, but it tells me something: and that is we have a lot to lose in this debate as well as a lot to gain. I am not going to support tearing down the greatest medical care system in the history of the world to rebuild it in the image of the Post Office. [Applause.] . . .
But let me talk about access because it is an area where there is a great deal of agreement. And that has all been forgotten in this debate. First of all, we have had now some two dozen bills introduced and every one of these bills tries to deal with the problem we call portability. Every one of these bills tries to make it easier for people to change jobs without losing their health insurance. When we talk about 37 million Americans last year who didn't have health insurance on at least one day, over 75 percent of those people, by some studies, didn't have health insurance for one reason: they changed jobs. And when you change jobs in America, you lose the insurance through the employer you're with and you don't get insurance on the new job until, generally, you've been there for 30 days.
We can solve 75 percent of the problem of people not having insurance on a provision that as far as I know every single member of the Senate supports: Make it easier for people to change jobs without losing their health insurance. That was in the two bills I introduced. It was in the bill that Senator Dole introduced. It's in the Mitchell bill. It's in the Clinton bill. It's in the Gephardt bill. It's in everybody's bill. That's not what we're debating here. Every bill that has been introduced, as far as I'm aware, deals with the problem of permanence. . . .
Then what problems remain if you deal with permanence and portability? Well the next problem is people who already sick, people who have what are called pre-existing conditions. In listening to the White House and listening to some of my colleagues, they sound as if they believe that by passing laws we can eliminate pre-existing conditions. Only God can eliminate pre-existing conditions.
 
STATEMENT BY SENATOR WOFFORD
 In yesterday morning's Washington Post, one of my Republican colleagues was quoted as saying that health care is too important -- get those words -- health care is too important for this Congress to pass a reform bill now. Instead of acting, he says, we should commission a study -- a study! Mr. President, we've had years of studies, mountains of studies. We don't need another study to tell us what is wrong with this system; we need the backbone to fix it. Not after the next election, not sometime in the next century, now! Health care delayed is health care denied.
To those advocates of delay who say the remedy offered by Senator Mitchell is too complicated to understand without a study, that the remedy offered by Senator Moynihan and the Finance Committee and now incorporated in great part in the bill we will be considering from Senator Mitchell, is too complicated to understand without a study, I say study this: this is the Federal employees benefit plan. It's a model of what we are proposing to do, to guarantee all Americans the kinds of private, affordable coverage; the choice of private health plans; not government-run plans, your own doctor plans and H.M.O.'s, your choice, that members of Congress arrange for themselves. What's so complicated about that? . . .
If members of this Congress want more time to study, let them study what it's like to be a middle-class American caught up in the health insurance mess. Let them study what it's like to try to buy insurance on the open market without the help of their employers. So, I'm serving notice that if the defenders of the status quo succeed in blocking this, in causing further delay or study, I will introduce an amendment that will disqualify every member of Congress from participating in the Federal employees health plan until we pass a bill which will do four things: 1, put us on a certain path to universal coverage; 2, open the Federal employee benefits plan to the American people and to small businesses; 3, end insurance discrimination, meaning real portability, meaning an end to pre-existing conditions, exclusions. Senator Gramm said only God can end a pre-existing condition. This Congress, in the bill we're seeking, can end pre-existing conditions, an end to lifetime caps on benefits and an end to discrimination against older Americans. And 4, contains real serious effective measures to control health care costs so we don't increase the deficit. . . .
The problem with our present system of health insurance is that so much of it is phony. You pay and pay and then just when you need it, it isn't there. . . .
I've heard members of Congress say that doing nothing on health care doesn't hurt me at all. Well, it should. It should hurt every one of us if we fail to act, because it sure is going to hurt the American people and the American economy.
 
STATEMENT BY SENATOR BOREN
 I came to this chamber today, I must confess, with something of a heavy heart, Madam President, because I believe we're on the wrong path. Senator McCain quoted Yogi Berra a few moments ago when he said "deja vu all over again." A little over a year ago I think we made a tragic mistake in this country by passing the budget of the United States Government for the first time in modern memory totally along a party-line vote, 51 votes in the Senate and a tie-breaking vote, all from one party, all of the other party in opposition. The same happened in the House of Representatives.
And what a tragedy that is for the country, because like the changes that will come in health care, the need to bring down the deficits of this country will take a long, sustained joint partnership on the part of all of the American people. While we have made some progress toward getting the deficit down, the job is far from over. The Administration's own figures indicate that with additions to the deficit that are anticipated under the budgets we have passed shortly into the next century we will reach the point in which all of the private savings, 100 percent of the private savings in this country, will be used just to pay the interest on the national debt.
That, Madam President, will mean that our economic growth in this country is imperiled and our future will be subject to the decisions of investors in other countries, not in this country. And the only way we're ever going to get the deficit under control and sustain a long-range approach is to have a bipartisan plan, one that will have the support of the vast majority of the American people in both of our political parties. And the only way, Madam President, that we're going to have health care carried through in an efficient and an effective way is to reach a bipartisan consensus so that that plan can be sustained for many years. . . .
And if we ram a bill through this Congress, and I hope my colleagues will hear me, I pray that they will hear me, I plead with them to hear me -- because we've got to stop this train right now and get off and go back to the drawing boards and start on the basis of trying to get something done together.
Let's not destroy the quality of health care in this country by passing a bill along party lines, by having 51 votes and ramming it through. And then waiting until the next election and have it reversed as the political fortunes of one party or another change. Nothing discouraged me more, Madam President, than to read that the First Lady in a press conference two days ago said, "I have a lot of confidence in the outcome, and if it's a 51-vote outcome, fine." And she went on to say that's what we had on the budget and it was fine then.
Madam President, it wasn't fine.
 
 
STATEMENT BY SENATOR KERREY
 Madam President, following on remarks made by the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, an appeal for a bipartisan bill, I'd like to describe what I think are ways for us to close the differences between the Republicans and the Democrats on this very important piece of legislation, and would begin with an observation that two people who are apparently a long ways apart -- at least I think observers would say that we're a long ways apart on this issue of health care -- are much closer than what meets the eye.
In this case, it is the Republican leader. Senator Dole and I share a very similar experience (He's a bit more visible than I). I'm fully dressed, you can hardly tell that I've been the recipient of health care to save my life, without which I would not be here today, which might trouble some in this country. Nonetheless it is important to note that similarity.
I have read Senator Dole's bill, it's got the distinguished Senator from Oregon's name on it as well, it's S.2374 and unlike some who have urged me to come to the floor and say it's a sham, I don't believe it is a sham. I see principles in this bill that are similar to principles I have as well.
Indeed, I think it's quite fair to say that the mainstream group has worked very closely both with majority leader Mitchell and the distinguished Senator from New York and the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts trying to fashion an amendment that would strike many of the government provisions that have been identified so eloquently, and sometimes I might say a bit preposterously, by those who would like to describe the Mitchell bill as a government takeover of health care.
I note with some pride that yesterday's speech by the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Chaffee, identified 10 areas where he's prepared to make changes, where he wants changes made in the Mitchell bill. And I noted with some considerable excitement that the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts immediately went and spoke for a considerable period of time, and my understanding is that there's a possibility of agreement between those two distinguished Senators, apparently of opposite parties and apparently of opposite views. Apparently as well, preparing to resolve the conflicts they have about the Mitchell bill.
If we can resolve those conflicts, Madam President, we will have taken a very big step forward, we will have taken a lot of the government intrusion out of this thing and perhaps we can come to the floor and talk about some other things, some other differences that we have with one another.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Photos: "THE PLAYERS: Debating in the Senate"
 
PHIL GRAMM
 Republican of Texas. A leader of the conservatives in his party, he is expected to wage a strong fight against Senator George J. Mitchell's bill. He has made a reputation in Congress as an opponent of ever-rising Federal deficits, and many in his camp regard a new health care program as a likely cause of more deficit spending.
 
HARRIS WOFFORD
 Democrat of Pennsylvania. His victory in a special election in 1991 rested heavily on his advocacy of a health care bill and, at the same time, refocused Washington on the issue. He is seeking elected to a full term this fall and, as he has sought to depict himself as someone at the center of the debate, passage of a bill would help his campaign greatly.
 
DAVID L. BOREN
 Democrat of Oklahoma. He is a conservative Democrat who has joined with several Democrats and Republicans to form a bipartisan bloc that seeks to come up with a health care plan that is less costly than the Mitchell bill. His view, as emphasized in his speech today, is that an effort should be made through compromise to fashion a bill that would pass with wide support, not a partisan Democratic measure that squeaks by with a narrow 51-vote victory,
 
BOB KERREY
 Democrat of Nebraska. Like Senator Boren, Mr. Kerrey advocates putting together a bill that would win broad bipartisan support in the Senate. He has taken the role of one of the chief Democratic critics of the Mitchell bill, contending that it would not contain rising costs and would centralize control of health care in a Federal bureacracy.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE HOUSE;
Uncertainty Is Clouding Health Bill

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
The course of health care legislation became increasingly uncertain in the House today. The Democratic leadership acknowledged that it would delay all voting on the issue, and a rival bipartisan group unveiled a plan of its own and began trying to muster the conservative votes needed to pass it.
The Democratic leaders, stunned by their loss on the crime bill tonight, later met with their Senate counterparts and White House officials but emerged with nothing definite to say about when they would take up health care. 
 The House had been set to begin the health care debate next Monday and begin voting on Wednesday. But the leaders said today that it would be impossible to meet that schedule because the Congressional Budget Office was still far from completing the necessary financial analyses of the legislation.
The Democratic leaders said tonight that they would keep the House in session next week and try to revive the crime bill, which failed on a procedural vote this evening. "I'm not going to set any kind of deadline on when we can get to health care," Speaker Thomas S. Foley said, "because I don't know when C.B.O. is going to be able to finish."
 
No 'Concocted Excuse'
 Mr. Foley angrily rejected any thought that the leadership was delaying action because it did not have the votes for its proposal.
"The problem," he said, "is that we are all of us -- Republicans and Democrats, everybody in this debate -- committed to the notion that there cannot be an effective debate and vote without clear economic estimates of the cost and reach of the programs.
"There's no mystery about that. It's not some kind of concocted excuse."
Still, in the view of both allies and opponents on Capitol Hill, the delay only added to the problems of the Democratic leaders, who have been struggling to rally their members behind a sweeping bill that would seek to achieve universal coverage by imposing a requirement that employers pay 80 percent of the cost of insuring their workers.
Moreover, the leaders will have to cope with the severe setback dealt them tonight when, despite vigorous efforts by President Clinton, they proved unable to move the Administration's crime bill to the floor. Tony Blankley, a spokesman for Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip, said of the Democratic leadership's health plan: "I know they don't have the votes. I don't think they'll get the votes. And today didn't help them."
The House majority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, said tonight, "I don't think the issues are related that much.
"Obviously, we wanted to win the crime bill," Mr. Gephardt said, but "the health bill is the health bill."
 
The Membership Grows Angry
 Democratic strategists had long been proceeding in the belief that sending members home for their summer recess before they voted on a health care bill would only feed their apprehensions by exposing them to more lobbying. On the other hand, depriving them of the recess week after week, with no certainty as to when they can vote, is only angering them, some lawmakers said. The recess, which has important political uses in an election year, was originally scheduled to begin on Aug. 12 and last until after Labor Day.
"There's no question now the members are discouraged," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat who supports the leadership's plan. "And frankly, the longer we stay here without a vote, the more discouraged they get."
The delay is certain to please some back-bench Democrats, who have been eager to put off a health care vote until they get some sense of what the Senate will do. Senate Democrats are being asked to vote on a much less sweeping bill in which one of the most vexing questions of the debate -- whether employers should be required to pay much of the cost of their workers' insurance -- is answered with a provision that would not require such payments until 2002, if then. Some of the more conservative House Democrats are asking why they should vote for something far more stringent.
 
Rival Plan Offered
 Tensions within the Democratic caucus were evident today when a bipartisan group of 10 lawmakers finally produced their health care plan. They noted that it included no requirements for employer payments, no new taxes and no price controls.
Instead, they asserted, it is a "common sense," moderate attempt to make insurance more accessible and affordable through new regulation of the insurance industry, new market structures like insurance purchasing cooperatives and subsidies for low-income people. It would be financed largely by savings in Medicare and Medicaid, the authors said.
"We sought to develop a new plan that truly fixes what is broken and keeps what works," said one of the plan's architects, Representative J. Roy Rowland, Democrat of Georgia, who acknowledged that it would raise the percentage of insured Americans to only 90 percent, from the current level of 85 percent.
Another sponsor, Representative Jim Cooper, a Tennessee Democrat who has been a persistent critic of the approaches advocated by the Administration and the Democratic leaders, said, "The principles that united people from both parties were that health care reform should be voluntary, it should be market-driven, and it should offer maximum consumer choice."
Democrats close to the leadership said the bipartisan plan had been "held hostage" by the Republicans and, as a result, was lacking on every major goal of health care restructuring. Not only does it fall far short on expanding coverage, they argued, but its subsidies would give little help to working families. Further, the proposal's opponents said, the elderly would be deprived of the prescription-drug and long-term-care benefits that would be provided under other plans.
At a news conference, Representative Vic Fazio of California, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said he hoped that the conservative Democrats among the bipartisan group would return to the leadership fold. The Republicans, he argued, had "an inordinate amount of influence" on the plan.
Mr. Rowland, who said he thought that the bill had enough votes to pass, acknowledged that he had no hard count.
Still, the Democratic leadership can afford to lose very few Democrats. And the bipartisan plan at least complicates the leaders' strategy, particularly if the bulk of Republicans move behind the bill, as some on Capitol Hill expect.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Up 0.5% in July

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
Producer prices rose one-half of 1 percent in July, the biggest increase in 15 months, while retail sales slowed slightly, the Government said today.
But both overall figures masked changes in key sectors of the economy that give contradictory indications of whether the current economic expansion will lead to a sharp rise in inflation. And, taken together, the figures further muddled the question of whether the Federal Reserve would push up short-term interest rates again when its main policy committee meets Tuesday, Wall Street analysts said. 
 Stock and bond markets fell after the release of today's economic reports, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 15.86 points to close at 3,750.90, while the interest rate on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to 7.65 percent, from 7.57 percent. [Pages D4 and D12.]
 
The Parts, Not the Whole
 The overall figures released today were much less important than their components, Wall Street analysts said. The big increase in overall producer prices, for instance, mainly reflected a sharp rise in food and energy prices, especially for coffee and gasoline.
Producer prices for the rest of the economy, which Federal Reserve officials have cited as more important to their interest-rate decisions, only crept up by one-tenth of a percentage point, the Labor Department said.
But producer prices for so-called intermediate goods, like lumber and paperboard, rose four-tenths of a percent in July after an increase of six-tenths of a percent in June, a pattern that several analysts called an ominous harbinger of possible consumer price increases ahead.
Prices for intermediate energy goods, including gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel, rose 1.7 percent, while prices for nondurable manufacturing materials like paperboard, wood pulp and various chemicals climbed nine-tenths of a percentage point.
While overall retail sales fell by a tenth of a percentage point, that figure was deceptive. It mainly reflected a 1.7 percent drop in sales of cars and trucks, which have been in short supply as factories struggle to refill dealer lots that consumers nearly picked clean last spring.
Excluding autos, retail sales rose four-tenths of a percentage point in July. The Commerce Department also revised its estimate of June retail sales growth to eight-tenths of a percentage point, from six-tenths.
Retail sales were especially strong in July at furniture and home furnishings stores, up 1.3 percent, and in restaurants and bars, also up 1.3 percent. Sales at building materials and garden supply outlets rose 1.5 percent while clothing-store sales fell nine-tenths of a percent.
 
'Ambiguity and Uncertainty'
 Allen Sinai, the chief economist at Lehman Brothers, was skeptical that today's figures would tilt the central bank for or against a fifth interest rate increase this year. "They add to the ambiguity and uncertainty of whether the Fed will raise interest rates," he said.
Several other important economic reports are scheduled for release before Tuesday and may also influence the central bank's decision: the Consumer Price Index on Friday and the industrial production and industrial capacity utilization figures on Monday. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, emphasized in Congressional testimony on Wednesday that no single economic indicator determined the course of American monetary policy.
Mickey D. Levy, an economist in the New York offices of Nationsbank, said today's economic news made it more likely that the nation's central bank would raise to 4.5 percent from 4.25 percent its target rate for overnight loans between banks.
"It certainly validates the Fed's moving a quarter of a point," he said. "Unless we get a shocking C.P.I. number, I don't think we'll see a half-point move."
 
Working Off Inventories
 The July retail sales statistics, and the upward revision of the June figures, mean that stores and wholesale warehouses may not be as crowded now with unsold goods as previously thought, said Robert Giordano, an economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. The Commerce Department had announced on July 29 that the economy had grown at a 3.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter, but that more than half the extra goods had gone into inventories as consumer spending slowed sharply.
Based on today's sales figures, Mr. Giordano said, "there's less of a pileup on the shelf than it seemed on the initial report."
Top Federal Reserve officials have said in interviews over the last two weeks that the rising inventories were important because factories might slow down until the extra goods were sold.
Other Federal Reserve officials had played down worries about the inventories, saying that they felt that businesses would likely be able to sell them and that much of the buildup might have consisted of imports. If stores cancel orders for additional imports, foreign factories might slow down but there would be little effect on the American economy.
 
Buying American
 Today's retail sales report appeared to show that American-made goods in particular were selling well, which could be interpreted by the Federal Reserve as a sign of strength in the economy and an argument for raising interest rates. The retail sales figures were held down by a drop in sales of clothing, which tends to be imported, while sales of building supplies and food rose.
Analysts said financial markets would have fallen even more today if retail sales excluding cars had risen by more than the four-tenths of a percentage point that the Commerce Department reported. "If we had gotten a 1.0, I think the market would have gotten annihilated," Mr. Levy said.
Investors fear rapid economic growth because it can lead to shortages of materials and skilled labor and thus produce inflation, which erodes the value of fixed stock dividends and bond interest payments.
Mr. Sinai said the July increase in retail sales, excluding autos, showed some strength in the economy but pointed out that these sales grew twice as fast in June. "Consumer spending in the third quarter, like the second quarter, continues to look on the soft side," he said. "Today's data told me the economy is still on a softer growth path."
Although analysts said they were eagerly awaiting the release of the Consumer Price Index on Friday, Mr. Greenspan criticized the index in his testimony on Wednesday, saying that it overstated inflation.
Paul A. Armknecht, the assistant commissioner for consumer prices at the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, said today that the agency was developing another index for retail price inflation that would address some, but not all, of Mr. Greenspan's concerns.
The new index will be ready by 1996, if the agency has adequate resources, and will be compiled once a year to give policy makers a sense of how much, if at all, the consumer index overstates inflation, he said.

HEADLINE: Italy and Sweden Raise Their Rates

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: ROME, Aug. 11

 BODY:
The Bank of Italy raised its discount rate today, joining Sweden in the first European rate increases to fight inflation in nearly two years.
The move drove down stock prices in Europe and also weakened the dollar. Some analysts said they were concerned that the rate increase could signal the end of rate reductions throughout Europe, especially in Germany. 
 Italy raised its discount rate to 7.5 percent, from 7 percent, its first increase since September 1992. The Italian central bank said in a statement that the rate increase was aimed at allowing "economic recovery to continue without reigniting inflation."
The Swedish central bank, the Riksbank, lifted its money market rate, the securities repurchase rate, to 7.20 percent, from 6.92 percent. It raised its key lending rate -- what it charges banks for loans -- to 8 percent, from 7.5 percent.
"With Italy and Sweden raising rates, Germany can't be far behind," said Paul Kasriel, an economist at Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "Interest rates in Europe are already higher than in the U.S., and now they're heading higher."
"The rate increases show that the recovery in Europe is stronger than we thought," said Mark Vitner, an economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C. Even so, Mr. Vitner said he thought the dollar's slump today was overdone because Germany was still likely to cut interest rates at least once more this year.
The interest rate increases also hurt stocks because of concern that they would jeopardize the fragile economic recovery on the Continent.
Urban Baeckstron, governor of the Riksbank, said the central bank was moving at "an early stage to counter a tendency to increased inflation."
In London, the Financial Times Stock Exchange index fell 28.80 points, to 3,138.2. In Frankfurt, the DAX 30-share index closed 5.09 points lower, at 2,155.28. And the CAC 40-share index in Paris fell 25.24 points, to 2,038.93.
Italian Government bond prices tumbled today, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond as high as 10.38 percent, from 9.74 percent yesterday. The Italian lira fell to a record low of 1,018 lire to the German mark today. It was last quoted at 1,014.09 lire, weaker than 1,006.06 lire on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: At Woodstock '94, Will the Odds Let the Big Bucks Roll This Time?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
A quarter-century ago, a half-million baby boomers gathered on a farm in Bethel, N.Y., to enjoy three days of sex, drugs and rock-and-roll -- and the promoters lost their shirts. As many as 250,000 twenty-somethings are expected to be in Saugerties, N.Y., this weekend to celebrate the anniversary. Only this time the three impresarios who staged the original Woodstock and have returned to produce Woodstock '94 seem to stand little chance of losing money and an excellent chance of making millions.
That prospect has left some news commentators grumpy. But the promoters fiercely defend their American right to do well by doing good. 
 Nobody planned to run a charity event back in 1969, Michael Lang, 49, one of the three, recalls. The idea was to sell a lot of tickets for $18 each, put on a good show and then use the profits to build a commercial recording studio. But the enterprise fell victim to the magic of the moment.
 
No Money for Fences
 Monterey Pop, an earlier music festival in California, drew 28,000, Mr. Lang said, "so we figured on a maximum of 50,000." When it became clear in the last weeks before the 1969 festival that far larger numbers were coming, the young entrepreneurs put their remaining cash into basics to accommodate the crowd. That left them no money to build fences or even to set up ticket booths for those willing to pay.
About $3.3 million was spent -- the bands and the contractors still had to be paid -- and just $1.7 million from initial ticket sales was collected. Mr. Lang's partners, Joel Rosenman, now 51, and John Roberts, now 49, lost $250,000 of their own money and owed the rest to a bank.
The partnership, Woodstock Ventures, eventually recouped its losses with a decade of record and movie royalties. But the memories still rankle: Warner, the distributor, ended up with most of the profit, which reportedly ran to tens of millions of dollars.
 
Older and Wiser
 This time, the promoters are older and wiser, and virtually everything is different, save for their determination to deliver value for a dollar.
The $30 million fixed cost of the project -- everything from the fees for the performers to water tanks with the capacity to serve a city -- has been underwritten by Polygram Diversified Ventures, which is 75 percent owned by Philips N.V., the Dutch giant. Cash and in-kind services of an unspecified value have come from Pepsico, Haagen-Dazs, Nobody Beats The Wiz, Gibson Guitars and Continental Airlines. And in an adjacent field where hippies might have staged a nude happening in 1969, Apple Computer and Philips have erected air-conditioned tents to demonstrate their latest electronic toys.
Much has been written, generally with distaste, about the miles of fencing, the metal detectors, the 1,200-strong security force and the absolute policy of admitting no more than 250,000 patrons at a whopping $135 a person. But little, Mr. Lang argues, has been said about the positive side of Woodstock '94's upscale, button-down approach.
He has a point. Barring food and drink from outside will sharply reduce the amount of broken glass strewn about -- the largest source of injury at Woodstock '69. And a mini-hospital, staffed around the clock with 300 medical people and backed up by three Medivac helicopters, will replace Wavy Gravy's makeshift effort at talking down acid-trippers.
 
A Ban on Alcohol
 Most significant, no alcoholic beverages will be sold or permitted on the 840-acre site. This will sharply undermine the profitability of the food concessions, Mr. Lang notes, but will also reduce the risk of violence.
All that said, will Woodstock Ventures and Polygram, equal partners in the enterprise, come out ahead?
Polygram is unwilling to talk about the finances of a project that Howard Vogel, a Merrill Lynch analyst, notes is "a relatively minor event from the company's long-term perspective." It is still possible, though, to piece together estimates that strongly suggest Woodstock '94 is the closest thing in the music business to a sure thing.
The widely cited cost estimate of $30 million -- four times the budget of Woodstock '69 after adjustments for inflation -- may seem high at first glance. But remember that music is big business now. Rolling Stone magazine estimates that top acts including Bob Dylan, Peter Gabriel and Arrested Development will receive $350,000 for their live performances, compared with just $15,000 last time around.
What about revenues? To date, more than 160,000 people have signed up for three days of peace and music. Even if that figure hits 200,000 by show time today, the box office would be $3 million short of break-even. Food services, with what some call ball-park prices, will surely gross many millions. But unlike most ball parks, Woodstock '94 will have very high one-time costs of preparation and cleanup, and there will be no beer to pad the margins. So it is at least conceivable that concessions will contribute little to the bottom line.
 
Ancillary Rights
 Hence, simple arithmetic suggests that Woodstock '94 could be in the red after the last ticket has been sold and the last slice of pizza is swallowed.
But the prospect of a deficit of a few million dollars on Monday need not faze the producers since a rich pot awaits them from ancillary rights.
Start with pay-per-view television. Access to one day's performance runs $35; two days, with a full 28 hours of coverage from 14 cameras, runs $50. "Three days out, sales are the highest I've ever seen for a concert," said Katherine Lewis, a vice president of Time Warner Cable, which is offering the pay-per-view telecasts in the New York City area.
Mr. Vogel estimates that 1.3 to 1.5 percent of the 22 million homes in the system will probably sign up. At that rate, at least 285,000 viewers will pay an average of $45, for a gross exceeding $12 million. Roughly half of that will be left after the distributors are paid. Some of the remaining amount will go to performers as royalties. And a minimum $3 million should end up on the producers' bottom line.
Next is the audio recording, due out in November. Mr. Vogel estimates the base sales of any album featuring this much brand-name talent and with this much publicity at 2 million copies, with much higher numbers possible. And while profits depend crucially on the unspecified terms of the royalty contracts with the performers, it is hard to believe that Polygram and Woodstock Ventures won't net a few dollars per recording.
 
The Movie Outlook
 Then there is the movie. There is no guarantee this film will do as well as its blockbuster namesake. But Woodstock '94 does start with a variety of advantages.
The director, Barbara Koppel, is an Academy Award winner in documentary film. The break-even point is low since the performers will receive percentage royalties rather than up-front fees. Most important, perhaps, is that this Woodstock movie is to be widely distributed on home video.
Last but hardly least there is the market for the logo, the outline of a bird sitting on a guitar. Unlike earlier sales promotions, says one relieved insider, "there will be no Woodstock underwear or air-freshener." But those are about the only products to be excluded. Along with the expected T-shirts, sweats and posters, the promoters have licensed an official Woodstock '94 condom.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE SENATE;
Centrist Group Is Seeking Consensus on Health Care

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
A bipartisan group of senators, more concerned about cost controls and bureaucracy than about the loudly debated topics of universal coverage or employer mandates, met for nearly three hours tonight to try to clear a path to consensus in the health care debate.
The centrist group, which calls itself the "mainstream coalition," had a major role in the Senate Finance Committee debate several weeks ago, but has been in partial eclipse ever since. 
 But its Republicans are the most conciliatory voices in this week's Senate debate, and the Democratic allies of Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, are eager to deal with them. These Democrats hope that some changes in Mr. Mitchell's bill could win their support, especially since the moderate Republicans' main concern does not appear to be the universal coverage provisions which President Clinton has said cannot be weakened.
 
Back to Basics
 The coalition itself is not sure whom it wants to deal with, and how. So today, several members said after the meeting, they went back to basics and began discussing what an acceptable health insurance bill should contain, not how to achieve it.
Senator John H. Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, said the group planned to stay in touch with both Mr. Mitchell and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, whose bill it also finds unsatisfactory in terms of cost controls. "The ideal objective would be to have everybody aboard," Mr. Chafee said tonight. "But maybe I'm dreaming."
 
One of Its Largest Crowds
 In a reflection of the Senate's uncertainty about the battle lines of health care legislation, the mainstream group attracted one of its largest crowds ever to today's meeting. There were 14 senators present, 7 Republicans and 7 Democrats.
The Republicans ranged from Senator James M. Jeffords of Vermont, the only member of his party to support President Clinton's original bill, to Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, who is quite conservative. Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey may have been the most liberal Democrat there today, and Senator David Boren of Oklahoma the most conservative.
The senators were unwilling to discuss the substance of their discussion today, which they conducted with only a single staff member present. Mr. Chafee said they were "going over some of the hot button issues" of health care to see where they stood.
Senator David Durenberger of Minnesota said the group's thinking was "rather than sit around and complain about other people's work, let's revisit our own." But he added, "Nobody knows how many votes there are for anything."
 
Amendments and Rewrites
 The obvious tactical alternatives before the group are to try to amend the Mitchell bill; amend the proposal put forward by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader; orassemble an entire bill from scratch. Since the group lacks the sort of staffs whom committee chairmen or leaders command, the last option is perhaps the most difficult.
Senator Mitchell says his bill would cover 95 percent of Americans by 2000, mainly by offering Federal subsidies to help the poor buy insurance. Senator Dole's bill offers smaller subsidies and less coverage.
Since the Mitchell proposal is likely to be before the Senate and open to amendment on Friday, amending it may be the simplest device. Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, predicted after leaving today's meeting that "the mainstream group is going to work with Mitchell," by offering amendments to reduce bureaucracy and "taking away the argument that this is a government takeover."
Mr. Chafee said the group expected to meet again Friday morning and to be able to announce its position later in the day.
 
Attack by Gramm
 Otherwise, today's Senate debate produced more heat and squabbling than progress. Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican, led off for his party, assailing the Mitchell bill, saying it would fail because "the government domination approach wil not work."
Senator Robert Bennett, Republican of Utah, called for delay, saying the American people wanted action postponed. Senator Boren took the same tack, saying: "Let's stop this train. Let's stop this mistake."
But Senator Harris Wofford, a Pennsylvania Democrat, who won election to the Senate in 1991 in a campaign in which he emphasized health care problems, shot back that "health care delayed is health care denied."
And Senator Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, challenged Republicans who disliked the bill to propose changes. "To delay would be cowardly," she said. "To filibuster would be cowardly."
 
Moynihan Has Changes
 Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who heads the Finance Committee and has been managing the Democratic speakers, again attacked the Mitchell bill over its provisions for medical training, a sore point for New York's many teaching hospitals. Mr. Moynihan has already succeeded in removing precise limits from the Mitchell bill, but it still calls for overall reductions in the number of residencies in hospitals and aims to have 55 percent of medical graduates work in primary care rather than specialties.
"In my judgment," Mr. Moynihan said, "it would be an act of hubris for the United States Senate to presume to know what the course of medical science will be, let alone to try to dictate that course through regulatory controls."
Supporters of limits like those he decried argue that a surplus of specialists is a major cause of health care inflation, as more specialists simply perform more procedures, often unnecessarily. Mr. Moynihan said later that there was merit to that argument, but that other means than an arbitrary limit on residencies should be found to deal with that problem.
Senator Frank Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, announced today that he would support Mr. Mitchell's bill.
 
'In Our Country Every Day'
 "No family should be forced to choose between putting food on the table and taking care of their children's health." he said in a statement issued today. "Or chose between helping with a college education and health care. Or jeopardizing their own retirement to take care of a parent stricken with Alzheimer's disease. But that happens in New Jersey and our country every day."
Mr. Mitchell's bill, he said "does promise to extend quality health care to our people at affordable prices, whether they work for a large corporation, a small company, or are self-employed."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Drop On Rate Speculation

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday, after two Government economic reports increased speculation that the Federal Reserve was ready to raise interest rates again.
Investors also reacted negatively to the higher-than-expected average yield at the Treasury's auction of the new 30 1/4-year bond, the last leg of the Treasury's quarterly refunding. The average yield at the auction of the new bond was 7.56 percent, the highest since November 1992 when the yield was 7.66 percent. 
 The market could be in for more selling today if the Consumer Price Index for July turns out to increase more than expected.
In trading in the secondary market, the outstanding 6 1/4 percent 30-year bond fell as much as 15/32 percentage points just before the results of the auction were released, but recouped at the close of the New York market to finish down 29/32 at 8325/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, jumped to 7.65 percent -- its highest point since July 13 -- from 7.57 percent on Wednesday.
 
 
Producer Prices
 Yesterday, the Labor Department reported that the Producer Price Index for July rose by five-tenths of 1 percent, largely as a result of a 42.8 percent increase in coffee prices, while the core rate, excluding food and energy, rose a muted one-tenth of 1 percent. The Commerce Department said that retail sales dropped one-tenth of 1 percent in July.
In the face of today's consumer price report and next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy making committee, "there is a lot of nervousness in the market," said Mr. Charles Roden, a managing director and head of fixed-income investing for Josepthal, Lyon & Ross. "Trading is very thin and every move in prices is magnified."
Mr. Roden added: "The surprise at this point of the game would be if the Fed did nothing. And while many long-term investors are worried about the economy, it is the long end of market that has held up well relative to short end."
Before the auction results were announced, traders and investors had been expecting the average yield in the auction to be 7.55 percent. The 30 1/4-year bond will be issued Aug. 15 and will mature on Nov. 15, 2024.
 
 
Zero-Coupon Bonds
 Last year, the Treasury decided to sell bonds twice a year instead of quarterly, and borrow more money at shorter maturities. Officials chose a 30 1/4-year bond at this quarterly refunding, instead of the regular 30-year bond, to spread out the interest rate payments on the bonds. Some economists have noted that an odd-dated maturity helps the market for zero-coupon bonds.
Unless the Treasury sold an odd-dated bond, securities firms would not be able to meet demand for zero-coupon bonds with a May or November maturity date, the months dropped from the quarter financing schedule last year.
Yesterday, the Treasury also sold $7 billion of 38-day cash management bills at an average rate of 4.37 percent. The cash management bills are used to meet short-term borrowing needs beyond the cash raised through securities sold at the Government's regularly scheduled auctions.
In the corporate market, the Money Store Inc. sold $600 million in triple-A-rated asset-backed securities through a trust. The securities, which are backed by home equity loans, were divided into several parts and priced through Prudential Securities and CS First Boston.
The average life for the issue ranged from one year to 15.3 years and was priced to yield from from 6.332 percent to 8.491 percent. Underwriters said the yield spread over Treasury securities with similar maturities was from 68 basis points to as much as 120 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
One of the parts offered to investors consisted of floating-rate securities with an average life of 4.6 years that were priced at par to float 45 basis above the one-month London interbank offered rate.

HEADLINE: Attention Shoppers: Internet Is Open

BYLINE: By PETER H. LEWIS 

 BODY:
At noon yesterday, Phil Brandenberger of Philadelphia went shopping for a compact audio disk, paid for it with his credit card and made history.
Moments later, the champagne corks were popping in a small two-story frame house in Nashua, N.H. There, a team of young cyberspace entrepreneurs celebrated what was apparently the first retail transaction on the Internet using a readily available version of powerful data encryption software designed to guarantee privacy. 
 Experts have long seen such iron-clad security as a necessary first step before commercial transactions can become common on the Internet, the global computer network.
From his work station in Philadelphia, Mr. Brandenburger logged onto the computer in Nashua, and used a secret code to send his Visa credit card number to pay $12.48, plus shipping costs, for the compact disk "Ten Summoners' Tales" by the rock musician Sting.
"Even if the N.S.A. was listening in, they couldn't get his credit card number," said Daniel M. Kohn, the 21-year-old chief executive of the Net Market Company of Nashua, N.H., a new venture that is the equivalent of a shopping mall in cyberspace. Mr. Kohn was referring to the National Security Agency, the arm of the Pentagon that develops and breaks the complex algorithms that are used to keep the most secret electronic secrets secret.
Even bigger organizations working on rival systems yesterday called the achievement by the tiny Net Market a welcome first step.
"It's really clear that most companies want the security prior to doing major commitments to significant electronic commerce on the Internet," said Cathy Medich, executive director of Commercenet, a Government and industry organization based in Menlo Park, Calif., that hopes to establish standards for commercial transactions on the Internet and other networks.
The idea is to make such data communications immune to wiretaps, electronic eavesdropping and theft by scrambling the transmissions with a secret code -- a security technique known as data encryption.
While Commercenet and other organizations have been working to develop a standard for the automated data encryption of commercial transactions, the small band of recent college graduates who formed the Net Market Company in New Hampshire appear to be the first to implement such technology successfully.
Tests of Commercenet's encryption system, which is based on algorithms -- mathematical formulas -- developed by RSA Data Security Inc. of Redwood City, Calif., are expected to begin this fall.
Commercenet hopes to create an easy-to-use industry standard for protecting Internet transactions.
For now, Net Market's approach is available to the limited number of computer users who have work stations running the Unix software operating system and a sophisticated Internet navigational program called X-Mosaic. The data encryption program is called PGP, for Pretty Good Privacy, which is based on the same RSA algorithms used by Commercenet.
PGP is available free, but it requires technical expertise to download it from the Internet. But within a few months commercial versions of PGP are expected to be available for personal computers using the Windows and Macintosh operating systems, which comprise the vast majority of computers in North America.
 
Security Breaches Reported
 The widespread adoption of standard data encryption tools cannot come too quickly for many Internet entrepreneurs, who hope to foster new levels of commerce on the rapidly growing network.
Alarmed by increasing reports of security breaches on the Internet, many people and businesses are reluctant to transmit sensitive information, including credit cards numbers, sales information or private electronic mail messages, on the network.
But the use of standard data encryption software, which scrambles messages so they can be read only by someone with the proper software "key," has been hindered by a combination of Government regulations and software patent disputes.
Experts say the PGP encryption software used by Net Market is at least as robust as the so-called Clipper encryption technology that the Clinton Administration has been pushing as a national standard. But unlike the Clipper system, the software keys for opening and reading PGP-encrypted documents is not controlled by the Government.
A version of PGP for individuals is available free through the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but users must retrieve it from an M.I.T. computer through the Internet.
Organizations wanting to use PGP for commercial purposes must obtain it on the Internet from a company in Phoenix called Viacrypt, a maker of computer security software and hardware tools. Prices for PGP begin at $100 a copy.
 
A Browsing Feature
 One achievement of the young programmers at Net Market was to incorporate PGP into X-Mosaic, the software that many Internet users rely on for browsing through the global network.
X-Mosaic is a software tool that allows the users of Unix computers to browse a service of the Internet called the World Wide Web, where companies can post the electronic equivalent of a glossy color brochure with supporting sales or marketing documents.
In the case of Noteworthy Music, the record retailer that leases a "store front" in Net Market's Internet computer, a shopper can look at color pictures of CD album covers.
Mr. Kohn, a 1994 honors graduate in economics from Swarthmore College, came up with the idea for Net Market during his junior year abroad, at the London School of Economics. There, he persuaded an American classmate, Roger Lee, to join his venture.
Mr. Lee, who graduated from Yale this past spring with a degree in political science, is president of the company. For technical expertise, they recruited two other partners from Swarthmore, Guy H. T. Haskin and Eiji Hirai.
The four men live upstairs in the house in Nashua, commuting downstairs each morning to run the business. Because of the pressures of running the system and debugging the software, they rarely venture outside, even though they have a backyard swimming pool.
"We don't get much sun," Mr. Kohn said, "but we're down to a case of Coke a day."
 
'An Important Step'
 Although Net Market has been selling various products like CD's, flowers and books for several months on behalf of various merchants, yesterday was the first time they had offered digitally secure transactions.
"I think it's an important step in pioneering this work, but later on we'll probably see more exciting things in the way of digital cash," said Philip R. Zimmermann, a computer security consultant in Boulder, Colo., who created the PGP program.
Digital cash, Mr. Zimmermann explained, is "a combination of cryptographic protocols that behave the way real dollars behave but are untraceable."
In other words, they are packets of worth that have value in cyberspace, the same way dollars have value in the real world, except that they have the properties of anonymity, privacy and untraceability. Many details remain to be worked out, Mr. Zimmermann said.
For now, Mr. Brandenberger, despite his historic transaction yesterday, will be paying with plain old dollars, when he gets his credit card bill. And sometime today, the Sting CD will arrive by fairly conventional means -- shipped FedEx from the Noteworthy Music warehouse in Nashua.

HEADLINE: At the Bar;
When this lawyer for New York City recounts La Guardia stories, she means her old boss.

BYLINE: By Richard Perez-Pena 

 BODY:
At a reception for the newest of New York's corporation counsels earlier this year, Edith I. Spivack was asked to say a few words about several of her former bosses in the New York City Law Department. When she got to Victor A. Kovner, who was corporation counsel in 1990 and 1991, she said she had been around to celebrate his bris.
She wasn't joking. When Mr. Kovner was born in 1937, Ms. Spivack was a lawyer in the Law Department and attended his brith milah, or bris, the religious rite of circumcision on the eighth day after birth. 
 Today, at age 84, Ms. Spivack is still there, as the Executive Assistant Corporation Counsel, one of the agency's half-dozen highest positions. For members of the calculator crowd, that means she has been on the city payroll for 60 years, a record for the Law Department, possibly for the city.
There is a temptation to call Ms. Spivack, who has worked for nine mayors and 21 corporation counsels, an institution. In a career that has spanned much legal and political history and has brought her into contact with some noteworthy characters, she has shown remarkable tenacity and a knack for defying expectations. But institutions are often sluggish creatures, and sluggishness doesn't suit Ms. Spivack at all.
She scampers through stories, peppering breakneck speed narratives with asides -- "Do you know about the Seabury investigations?" -- to insure that younger listeners can keep up. A few of her tales are ribald, like the one about Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia dispatching her and other women in his administration to determine whether a burlesque show had artistic merit. (Their verdict: smut). Others are harrowing, as when, at age 75, her back was broken in a car accident in Albany, where she had gone to argue a case.
She also has stories that sound medieval to contemporary ears, about the days when few women practiced law, let alone while raising children, and fewer still declined to take their husbands' names.
She had a moment of fame in 1980, in a showdown in her office with the Colombian consul. The cash-starved city had begun charging consulates for water, and Colombia had refused. Ms. Spivack threatened to turn off the tap; the consul capitulated.
Her career is notable not only for its longevity but also for the law she has practiced. Her colleagues attest that she has unparalleled expertise on property taxes, her specialty since 1944.
"She has participated in virtually every piece of legislation, every major case in this area, and generations of lawyers in that office have learned the subject from her," Mr. Kovner said.
In the early 1970's she represented the city in the Penn Central bankruptcy, collecting $93 million in delinquent taxes and interest on the railroad's Park Avenue real estate. A few years later, she helped negotiate the $2.3 billion Federal loan that staved off city bankruptcy.
Allen G. Schwartz said Ms. Spivack defused the first crisis he confronted as corporation counsel in 1978. The city faced $2 billion in refund claims under a Court of Appeals ruling against its property tax structure. "She negotiated settlements with all these property owners so that the city wouldn't be bankrupted," Mr. Schwartz said.
Ms. Spivack grew up in the Western Bronx and on the Upper West Side, graduating from Barnard College in 1929 at age 19. Though her parents were not well off -- she had been able to attend college only through a Regents scholarship -- she went on to Columbia Law School; it was only the third year in which women were accepted.
"My father's friends would say to him, 'Why does she have to go to law school? She's probably going to get married,' " Ms. Spivack recalled. "But my mother said, 'If Edith wants it, she can have it.' "
She graduated in 1932, at the nadir of the Depression, but met greater obstacles than the feeble economy. Most firms she approached told her that they did not hire women, while many would not take her because she was Jewish. A few, she said, kept their women lawyers in trusts and estates, "where all the clients were dead and no one would see you."
In December 1933, she married Bernard H. Goldstein, whom she had met at Columbia. At age 87, he, too, still practices law, as a partner at Tenzer, Greenblatt, Fallon & Kaplan in Manhattan. In tribute to her parents, Ms. Spivack kept her family name.
When LaGuardia took office in 1934, political appointees were swept from the Law Department and replaced through civil service testing. Told that the city had no money to pay her, Ms. Spivack joined the department as a volunteer. She was hired in July, at half salary -- $1,700 a year.
When her two daughters were born, in 1941 and 1946, her maternity leaves consisted of hoarded sick days and vacation. Each time, her return to work was met with surprise from colleagues. Still, she said, she was treated with respect and never suffered sexual harassment. "I know that other women had to put up with that, but I never did," she said, crediting her good fortune to the honorable bent of the men with whom she worked.
One of the first city employees to take advantage of the elimination of mandatory retirement in the early 1980's, Ms. Spivack says she has never seriously entertained the notion of retiring. She still takes the 6:20 A.M. train every day from Port Washington, L.I., and more often than not she is the first person in the office on Church Street.
Her pension has grown so large, she says, that she would make more money collecting it than collecting paychecks -- one reason, she concedes, that some of her co-workers think she's "a little nuts" for continuing to work.
But then she insists, "One of the things that I don't get terribly concerned about most of the time is what other people think."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
A young American agency turns to a British import to raise its creative pitch.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
A LEADING British creative director is joining Berlin Wright Cameron as the agency, nearing its first anniversary, seeks to emphasize further its creative capabilities.
Jon Matthews, a copywriter who has helped to produce popular and successful campaigns at BMP DDB Needham in London for accounts like the Barclaycard credit card and Clarks children's shoes, is coming to Berlin Wright in New York in the new position of creative director. Scott Burns, a partner in the agency, continues as executive creative director. 
 "I got a telephone call from a headhunter in London asking if I could recommend someone for this job," Mr. Matthews said in an interview, "and I said, 'Apart from me?' "
"I've always thought about the U.S.," he added, "because I've always been a great admirer of the best of the U.S. work."
When Mr. Matthews, 35, arrives at Berlin Wright early next month, he will join a lengthening list of British advertising talent migrating to the United States. Indeed, at the agency, which has billings of $150 million to $175 million from clients like Volkswagen of America, NBA Properties, Conde Nast Publications and the G.E. Rewards credit card, he is the fourth bundle from Britain. The others are Tony Wright, president and partner; Ewen Cameron, planning director and partner, and Alison Butler, head of client services.
"Sometimes, when we go to new business meetings," Mr. Wright said, "and Ewen and I are presenting, we say, 'We do have some Americans back at the agency.' "
Yet Andy Berlin, chairman and chief executive, insists that his agency, which opened almost a year ago as a spinoff from DDB Needham New York, is no Madison Avenue chapter of the Anglo-American Amity League.
"One problem with American advertising is that I don't think it's attracting the caliber of people it did 15 or 20 years ago," he said. "The British industry, at least until the recession, certainly had been attracting those people."
His penchant for British staff members, he added, also reflects an admiration for BMP DDB Needham, which he considers "one of three great models" along with BBDO Worldwide and the Leo Burnett Company. Of Berlin Wright's British quartet, all but Mr. Wright worked for BMP DDB Needham.
British executives plying their trade in this country have met with mixed results. For instance, of two recently imported to work for Bates Worldwide in New York, one, Les Stern, has already returned to London, while the second, Andrew Cracknell, is relinquishing his oversight of the New York office's creative output to take on more of a worldwide role. Campaign, the British advertising trade weekly, described those shifts as "bringing down the curtain on what has been a less than successful experiment at rejuvenating the U.S. shop with British talent."
Mr. Wright said the difficulties British executives face may stem from "the culture of the advertising industry being very different here than there, much older and much more serious."
"To be in advertising in Britain is a complete life style," he added. "You go to the pub at six o'clock with everyone you work with and you see everyone else you know."
Mr. Burns likened it to "a great big Martin Amis novel."
To Mr. Matthews, the cultural differences between the two countries "are not that big."
"We watch the same movies," he said, "only we get them three months later." One that filmgoers of both nations enjoyed was the British comedy "Four Weddings and a Funeral," which features as a malaprop-prone clergyman the actor Rowan Atkinson, who portrays an inept spy in Mr. Matthews's Barclaycard campaign.
Mr. Matthews began his career in 1981 as a client, working for Unilever on washing powders -- detergents on this side of the Atlantic -- and soaps. He switched to the agency side four years later after he had what he described as "a real 'road to Damascus' experience: I was asked to write this campaign for mayonnaise and had the most fun in my life."
He worked at the London offices of J. Walter Thompson, Gold Greenlees Trott and Collett Dickenson Pearce before joining BMP DDB Needham in 1990.
Mr. Wright called the hiring of Mr. Matthews "another phase of our development."
"We really want to put our investment in people who create ads," he said. "It's a lopsided investment in the creative department -- lopsided by industry standards."
Mr. Matthews, in addition to writing, will assume administrative duties from Mr. Burns, who has been supervising the 30 members of Berlin Wright's creative department while handling his own writing assignments. Mr. Matthews will report to Mr. Burns.
"They're a talented group of young children," Mr. Burns, who is 32, said of his charges, laughing, "but they need care and supervision and watering. I like to write."

Some Wonder if This Is When Cheering Stops By Claire Smith

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
In a game that supplies an endless amount of irony in its laborious collective bargaining wars, one of the more intriguing situations unfolded at Veterans Stadium last night.
Fernando Valenzuela, who as a rookie injected the one iota of innocence into the strike-ravaged 1981 season, took the mound for the Phillies in what could be his swan song as a major league pitcher. 
 Valenzuela is now, of course, a grizzled veteran of who knows how many years of age (that has always been one of baseball's bigger mysteries). But in 1981, Valenzuela represented youth, enthusiasm and a touch of idealism in a game that dripped with cynicism by the end of a 50-day strike.
Valenzuela, a darling of the fans before the strike, was still that when the walkout ended officially with a much-delayed All-Star Game in Cleveland, the beginning of a truncated second half of the season. Just about every other All-Star had used up his allotment of good will during the strike, as far as a booing, angry crowd at Cleveland Stadium was concerned. But not Valenzuela, a youngster with little command of the English language but in obvious command of any kind of sentiments that survived the off-field strife.
Now, 13 years later, another strike that could wreck the major part of a season is at hand. And Valenzuela was called on to start one of the final 10 games scheduled before the clock stopped where the players warned it would if the owners insisted on pushing for a salary cap. "Yes, yes," Valenzuela said with a smile when reminded that this was where he kind of came into the game -- in the middle of a labor fracas.
Then he went out and gave another crowd yet more reason to cheer in an otherwise grim situation, pitching eight innings of one-run ball in a game the Phillies won, 2-1, in 15 innings.
The 37,605 fans who filed into Veterans Stadium were cordial as the two teams turned in professional efforts. But, as the players know, the fans of '94 feel much like the fans of '81 about work stoppages. The public didn't commiserate 13 years ago when players had to work temporary jobs to avoid going penniless. They certainly won't be any more sympathetic in an era of million-dollar-a-year-plus averages.
Believe it or not, the players of 1994 understand that anger, just as the players in 1981 did. "You're never going to win that battle," said Pete Incaviglia of the Phillies. "The players are obviously the ones who are going to be torn up, in the media, by the fans. That's just a part of the game."
Rusty Staub, an announcer for the Mets, the club for which he played in 1981, agreed. He said he fully understood the reason behind the fans' targeting. "I feel a real attachment to the emotion that fans have," he said. "It's very difficult for them to comprehend when they see the money that's in the game. But it's not just about money. It's more about power and who's going to have the power, who's going to have the authority."
Players like himself risked their livelihoods, if you will, in 1981. Because there was no guarantee that the owners wouldn't turn to replacement players, as the National Football League owners did a few years later. There was no guarantee that the fans, whose money accounted for much of the economic base, would, indeed, come back.
The treacherous nature of that strike, as well as the one in 1985 and the lockout of 1990, has not only been drilled into the players who have arrived since then but is still very fresh in the minds of ex-players like Staub and veterans like Incaviglia. And, undoubtedly, Valenzuela, who went from being a $32,500 minimum-wage rookie to being a millionaire many times over.
So it's not surprising, and quite understandable, when a Staub says, "To just give it back, in the form of a salary cap, I just don't think it's going to happen."
And so it is that players with much more than money at stake are supporting their union. Players like Valenzuela, Don Mattingly and Larry Andersen, all of whom know that a prolonged strike could sound a death knell for their careers.
"If it is the end for me, it's not really the way I'd want to go out," said Andersen, a pitcher in his third decade in the major leagues. "But if the strike ends my career, I correlate that with the guys who are chasing records -- so be it."
Many people will never understand that sentiment. Never understand why the Matt Williams, Ken Griffeys, Frank Thomases and other record-chasers fully echo those sentiments. Why a Mattingly, on the brink of his first-ever post-season does, too. It's a unity, Incaviglia says, that helps fuel the cause when it is needed the most. Like now, when the players stand very much alone against public sentiment.
And since the players feed off the single-mindedness of veterans and rookies, of $7 million-a-year players and minimum-wagers, another strike to test the will of owners has occurred.
Now fans have only to wait and stew. And players and owners have only to pray that when they settle this mess, they will come back to parks like Veterans Stadium and find a modicum of forgiveness.
If the two sides do return the game to the field soon, veterans like Valenzuela, Mattingly and Andersen will get to breathe some more life into their careers. And 1994's versions of the young Fernando, like Jason Jacome, the Mets' rookie starter who pitched seven innings of one-run ball last night?
If today's rookies are lucky, like Valenzuela once was, they may yet hear the cheering again. Just like the players eventually did in 1981 when, as Rusty Staub says, "the fans put the anger aside when the saw their first great play or somebody got their first big hit to help their ball club win a game."

Steinbrenner Trying to Make 'Economic Sense' of It All

BYLINE: By MIKE WISE 

 BODY:
George Steinbrenner, whose profitable baseball operation stands to be one of the biggest losers from a prolonged strike, admitted yesterday that he has a problem with his fellow owners arguing for competitive balance.
But the Yankee owner claims he has not broken ranks, that he will remain a good soldier and that he plans on supporting his peers throughout negotiations, regardless of how the owners are being represented. 
 He declined comment when asked in an interview during yesterday's game whether by taking this stance he was giving the owners' chief negotiator, Richard Ravitch, a vote of confidence. Instead, he preferred to shower baseball's acting commissioner, Bud Selig, with praise.
Steinbrenner especially took issue with one of the owners' main selling points in negotiations, that of smaller-market clubs being financed by larger-market teams and how revenue sharing would hurt the game.
"It's very difficult for Ravitch to argue competitive balance, per se, when Montreal, with the second-lowest payroll, has baseball's best record," Steinbrenner said. "Maybe they just don't support baseball in Montreal. In that context, it's like any good business. Year after year if your store doesn't get the customers, you move it or you close it."
Steinbrenner said he doesn't consider the Expos "truly a small-market club."
 
Helping the Small-Market Teams
 "If anyone deserves the fans' support," he said, "it's Montreal. But we still have to bring some economic sense to baseball. We need to bring sense whereby the Pittsburghs and Milwaukees can survive. We never want what happened to Pittsburgh again, where they lost their players.
"We have to find a way to help those teams."
With the Yankees in first place this late in the season for the first time since 1987 and possibly headed for the post-season for the first time since 1981, Steinbrenner separated his emotions for his club from labor-management matters.
"That would be very selfish and shortsighted on my part," he said of the prospect of missing out on the post-season. "There's a lot of things about the whole picture I don't like. But if you look at the long haul, we've got to do something."
 
Feeling for Mattingly
 Regarding Don Mattingly's possible retirement should the strike pre-empt part of next season, he said: "I think that was in the heat of frustration. I wouldn't compare it to George Foreman saying he's going to retire, but I think he's too competitive to give back a year on his contract. He wants to play.
"My heart bleeds for the guy. Here he is, after all these years, and now this."
Steinbrenner also reiterated his stance concerning owners being present at the bargaining table.
Then, when asked why he has not been more vocal among the ownership group, he said: "Bud Selig is leading this ship. I've got enough on my plate. I'm tired of the harpooning and hits he's taking.
"My interests are being represented. I do not intend to show any split in this group."

The Hidden Horror

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Even in a world with Rwanda and Bosnia, the cruelty at this place has been horrifying: an invasion by a foreign army that has killed as much as a third of the population.
The place is East Timor, the killers the Government and army of Indonesia. East Timor is half of an island 300 miles north of Australia, so remote that Indonesia has been largely successful in hiding from the world the slaughter and repression it has carried out since occupying the territory in 1975. 
 The shroud covering the occupation was pierced in 1991, when Indonesian soldiers fired into a crowd of mourners at a cemetery, killing more than 100. An American was there and wrote about the massacre, and a Briton filmed parts of it.
Now we have powerful new evidence of the horror in East Timor. John Pilger, an Australian reporter, and two others went in incognito and used hidden cameras. British Independent Television has shown their film, "Death of a Nation: The Timor Conspiracy."
The film includes firsthand descriptions, ghastly in their detail, of the mass killing of Timorese civilians. It also has much new material on the role of Britain, Australia and the United States in aiding Indonesia and condoning the invasion.
President Ford and Secretary of State Kissinger visited Indonesia for several days just before the invasion. Philip Liechty, a C.I.A. official there at the time, says in the film that he is sure President Suharto "was explicitly given the green light to do what he did."
Mr. Liechty says that most of the weapons used by Indonesia, as well as ammunition and even food, were American. Aides cabled Secretary Kissinger that such use of materiel supplied for "defense" would violate American law. He excoriated them for putting the point in writing, saying that it might leak and embarrass him.
The Pilger film quotes Mr. Kissinger as telling a staff meeting: "Can't we construe a Communist Government in the middle of Indonesia as self-defense?" The Timorese, 90 percent of them Roman Catholics, had shown no sympathy for Communism. They just wanted independence for their country.
Today, nearly 20 years after the invasion, the Suharto Government continues to make strenuous efforts to prevent international discussion of East Timor. It put pressure on the Philippine Government to limit a conference on the subject in May and is now trying to stop a meeting in Malaysia.
But more evidence of continuing repression is emerging. Some of it comes from Western journalists who have been allowed into East Timor this year on tours that were carefully controlled but that nevertheless let reality slip through from time to time.
The Economist magazine had a writer there with others on a guided tour in April. He wrote that they were treated to robotic praise of Indonesia but that discontent was evident. The Indonesian-appointed Governor, Abilio Soares, admitted to them that between 100,000 and 200,000 Timorese had died as a result of conflict since the invasion. Before, the population was 688,000.
A conservative British weekly, The Spectator, had a piece in February by Edward Theberton. On a visit to East Timor he found it reminiscent of the Baltic States when they were under Soviet occupation, full of soldiers and informers and lies. The striking sights, he said, were the countless cemeteries. He concluded that President Suharto was "the Pol Pot of East Timor."
The world is said to be suffering from compassion fatigue these days. A place as small and distant as East Timor is going to have a hard time persuading major governments to support its people's desire, simple as it is, for the right to express their views in a referendum on how they should be governed.
But President Clinton will have an opportunity to say a private word to President Suharto this fall, when he is scheduled to go to Indonesia for a summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. He could at least make clear American disapproval of the repression in East Timor.
And the press should continue to bring the world's attention to the reality of East Timor. In that regard it is shameful that "Death of a Nation," which has been seen in Britain and 35 other countries, has not yet found an outlet on American television.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
No Runs, No Hits, No Errors: Baseball Goes on Strike

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
With the two sides in baseball's labor dispute far apart and rigid in their positions, major league players went on strike after last night's games, shutting down the season with the eighth work stoppage in 23 seasons.
The dispute, centering on the owners' demand to create cost control by putting a limit on player payrolls, was so severe that negotiators for the two sides didn't even bother to meet and barely spoke to each other yesterday. 
 There were early reports, later denied, that some owners had made suggestions intended to generate movement on their side. Barring a change in the owners' position, which has occurred in previous shutdowns, or a collapse of the players' solidarity, which never has happened, the strike threatens to wipe out the last 52 days and 668 games of the regular season and, for the first time, the playoffs and the World Series.
Baseball's labor history since the inception of the union in 1966 is filled with strife. The owners have locked out the players three times, all in spring training, while this is the players' fifth strike. The longest strike occurred in 1981, when the players shut down the major leagues for 50 days. The most recent strike, in 1985, lasted only two days, Aug. 6 and 7.
"There is no doubt in my mind the players are united, as always, and the owners are united this time for a significant series of reasons," Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, said. "But having said that, now we have to figure a way to solve this thing."
No one had a clue how to do that yesterday, as the 10 games on the schedule slipped past and brought the players closer to their strike deadline.
The Yankees, who last week assured themselves of being in first place in the American League East at the time of the strike, played at Yankee Stadium yesterday, losing to the Toronto Blue Jays, 8-7, in 13 innings. When Selig, during a telephone interview, asked who won the game, he was told the teams were in extra innings and extending the season. He laughed, but people on both sides found little else humorous during the final day.
The Mets approached the strike with a 15-inning 2-1 loss at Philadelphia last night. The game at Oakland between the Athletics and the Seattle Mariners, which ended at 12:45 A.M. E.D.T., might have been the last in a season of remarkable individual performances, including Tony Gwynn's pursuit of a .400 batting average (he's hitting .394) and a core of sluggers chasing home-run records.
If the dispute were to be resolved in time only to play the post-season, the new expanded playoffs would start with Montreal at Los Angeles and Cincinnati at wild-card Atlanta in the National League and in the American League the Yankees at wild-card Cleveland and the Chicago White Sox at Texas.
Off the field, some owners, including George Steinbrenner of the Yankees, spoke out in ways that the union interpreted as hopeful, and reports circulated that some were trying to maneuver behind the scenes if not to avert a strike at least to create some movement that could lead to a settlement in time to salvage the season.
But Selig, the Milwaukee Brewers owner who earlier had presided over a conference-call meeting of the owners' executive council, denied that the owners had any intention of budging from their position on limiting player payrolls through a salary cap. The executive council runs baseball in the absence of a commissioner.
The players, who want to maintain the existing free-market system, are striking because they are certain the owners would imposed their salary cap in the off season after declaring and impasse in negotiations.
The most intriguing maneuver mentioned during the day was a reported effort by an unidentified group of owners to come up with a way of averting the strike. The group, meeting by telephone conference call Wednesday evening, was said to have considered proposing that the union agree to eliminate salary arbitration in exchange for the owners' granting free agency to players after three years of major league service, instead of the current six years, with no restrictions.
But the group also was said to have rejected the idea in the face of loud objections from some of the small-market clubs, which want greater sharing of revenues like local television deals and gate receipts. The owners adopted a revenue-sharing plan last January, but it is contingent on the players' acceptance of a salary cap.
 
'Little Bit of Movement'
 Peter Angelos, owner of the Baltimore Orioles, said he had heard talk of the swap of salary arbitration for earlier, unrestricted free agency. "I think there's a little bit of movement," he said by telephone from Baltimore, "but I don't know where it's coming from."
Jerry McMorris of the financially successful Colorado Rockies went even further. Speaking in Denver, he said he believed the salary cap was a negotiable issue. "I think we could negotiate a settlement that did not include a salary cap," he said.
One owner who wanted to avert a strike indicated last week there weren't enough owners to force a change in the salary-cap stance. "If there were, it would've been done, but it wasn't," he said.
People on the players' side who heard of the owners' conference call said they believed there was a perception by Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief labor executive, that some owners wanted to try to get a settlement and he killed the effort. Ravitch did not return a telephone call seeking comment on the union's understanding of those events.
Ravitch and Donald Fehr, the union chief, appeared together on the "Today" show yesterday morning but did not speak to each other the rest of the day, according to people on both sides. They appeared together on yet another television show, "Larry King Live," last night. They have scheduled no bargaining sessions, having met last on Wednesday.
"Nothing has changed," Fehr said as the first pitches of the last games approached. "That's it."
 
'Most Exciting Season'
 In Washington, President Clinton urged both sides to find a way to get back together and finish the season.
"There are a lot of little kids out there who want to see this season come to a close," he said, "and there are a lot of not-so-little kids out there who know that this is the most exciting baseball season in 40 years."
At Yankee Stadium, Steinbrenner offered mixed views on the dispute. Referring to Ravitch's contention that a salary cap is needed to maintain competitive balance between wealthier clubs and poorer clubs, the Yankees' principal owner said, "It's difficult to argue competitive balance in view of Montreal having the second-lowest payroll but the best record in baseball."
But he added: "The thing is to enable them to keep some of those players, to have the financial wherewithal to do it. We don't want to happen to Montreal what happened to Pittsburgh, where they couldn't afford to keep those players."
When earlier remarks by Steinbrenner appeared in The Philadelphia Inquirer yesterday, he appeared to be making the first break in the solidarity of the ownership group. But in his comments yesterday, he seemed to soften his stance, saying: "As far as splintering from the group, absolutely not. We are as strong as ever. I don't see any splintering whatsoever."
 
Owners at the Table
 Steinbrenner nevertheless reiterated his view that owners should sit at the bargaining table, a position articulated strongly by the players.
Angelos also said he thought owners should attend bargaining sessions, but only as observers.
"That is a reasonable request by the players," he said.
Despite the prospect of having no more games this season, Bill Giles, the Phillies' managing partner, left his team's game before it was over, walking out in the 11th inning with the game tied, 1-1. Giles explained, "I have to get up early and drive to Vermont to go fishing."

HEADLINE: How Clinton Can Be F.D.R.

SERIES: HEALTH CARE: SECOND OPINIONS -- An occasional series.

BYLINE: By Alan Brinkley; Alan Brinkley, professor of history at Columbia, is author of the forthcoming "The End of Reform: New Deal Liberalism in Recession and War."

 BODY:
After a year and a half in office, the Administration finds itself in a bizarre political condition. It is so beleaguered -- even the anticrime bill was rejected in the House yesterday -- that Bill Clinton's own pollster is encouraging Democratic candidates not to identify themselves too closely with him this year. Yet it is also agonizingly close to a monumental policy achievement.
Liberals (and others) have dreamed of national health insurance in vain for nearly a century. Even five years ago, passage of any such program seemed virtually inconceivable. Now, uncertain as its prospects remain, it is closer than it has ever been. 
 Other Presidents have encountered great political difficulties. And others have pursued and achieved grand social policy ambitions. But never has an Administration straddled these two courses in the way that this one is trying to do.
The character of the national health care reform (if any) that emerges from Congress will reflect President Clinton's boldness and weakness. The boldness of the effort is clear. No domestic proposal since the Social Security Act of 1935 would affect the lives of so many Americans. And unlike Social Security, health care legislation will pass -- if it does -- over the strenuous opposition of an extraordinary range of well-financed and ferociously active interest groups as well as Republicans determined to deny the Administration a victory.
Any plan Congress approves will only faintly resemble the complicated proposal the President submitted. But that will not, and should not, prevent him from receiving the lion's share of the credit (or blame) for the result. Franklin D. Roosevelt did not initiate, and for a time opposed, the most important provisions of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. He had little to do with drafting the Social Security Act. Yet both are linked to him.
The pressure for health care reform comes from many places and was building well before Mr. Clinton embraced the issue. But if a serious program is enacted, it will be his achievement more than anyone else's. No President has staked so much political capital on universal health care; that Mr. Clinton has done so, so steadfastly, is all the more striking because he has so little capital to spare.
For that very reason, the battle reflects his considerable political weakness. He has been criticized for a lack of firmness and commitment. He will be strongly tempted to veto any bill that does not guarantee universal coverage. But he also badly needs a victory and will be tempted to accept almost any package that substantially expands coverage. Both temptations pose dangers.
The history of the Social Security Act of 1935 suggests the risks of making an excessively rigid commitment to universal coverage. When it was enacted, its benefits fell much further short of universality than almost any health care measure now debated. Huge categories of people were excluded.
When the first pension payments began, in 1940, they reached fewer than a quarter of all workers and virtually no one outside the paid labor force. Yet within four years, Congress began to expand the system. Today, Social Security pensions are the closest thing we have to a universal system of social insurance. Whatever its flaws, it is the most popular and politically unassailable social program the Government has ever produced.
The Social Security Act was successful because it established the principle that Americans were entitled to certain social protections. That principle quickly produced almost irresistible popular demands for continued expansion of the system. Surely, legislation establishing the principle but not the reality of universal health care would similarly generate substantial public pressure for expansion.
On the other hand, the 1965 Medicare Act illustrates the dangers of establishing a principle of entitlement without an adequate structure for financing and containing it. President Lyndon B. Johnson believed, correctly, that once he established the principle of a right to health care for elderly people, it would be impossible ever to rescind it. But he established no effective mechanisms for controlling the costs, and by the late 1970's they were growing at a phenomenal rate. Later efforts to contain them led to a shifting of economic burdens to other groups of recipients, driving up insurance premiums for people under 65 and helping to push many out of coverage altogether.
The unintended consequences of Medicare are among the causes of today's health care crisis. And they support Mr. Clinton's argument that a system too far from universality could make things worse, not better, for people who need help the most.
The President faces the unenviable task of balancing these conflicting legacies -- from a position of political weakness. The result will, no doubt, be far from perfect. But it seems reasonable to expect him to insist that any legislation at least create a path toward an effective system of universal coverage (as the Social Security Act did) and not a route to crippling imbalances in the cost of health care (as the Medicare bill inadvertently managed to do). If he can achieve this, the controversies swirling about him are likely to seem as ephemeral in the end as the long-forgotten partisan squabbles of 1935.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Rose 0.3% in July

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose three-tenths of a percent in July, buoyed by rising gasoline and grocery store prices, and business inventories increased in June, the Government said today.
Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, consumer prices rose only two-tenths of a percent, slightly less than many analysts had expected. Financial markets rallied strongly on this signal that the so-called core rate of inflation might still be under control. Lower inflation puts less pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates again soon. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 17.81 to close at 3,768.71, while the interest rate on 30-year Treasury bonds dropped to 7.50 percent from 7.65 percent. [Pages 38 and 46.]
 
 
 
Doesn't Clear the Air
 Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who heads the Council of Economic Advisers, played down the overall rise in the Consumer Price Index. "You instead see signs, if you take out the volatile food and energy prices, that the core inflation rate remains subdued," she said in a telephone interview.
Wall Street analysts said that today's economic indicators did little to clear up the general confusion about the economy's health, and would not push Federal Reserve officials noticeably in favor or against higher interest rates at a meeting on Tuesday of the central bank's interest-rate-policy committee. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has said repeatedly that the central bank is worried about possible future inflation and is not trying to set policy based on price increases that have already occurred.
Inventories of manufacturers, wholesale distributors and retailers rose four-tenths of a percent in June, led by a 1.4 percent increase in retail inventories, the Commerce Department said. The overall increase was twice as large as analysts had expected, even given the department's estimate on July 29 that inventories grew more in the second quarter than at any time since the end of 1987.
 
 
 
Slow Growth Is Seen
 Some Wall Street analysts said the extra inventories meant that growth was more likely to slow in the coming months as stores cut back on new orders until consumers cleared their shelves. "The economy is decelerating and inflation remains subdued," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch.
The increase in inventories particularly surprised analysts because the Commerce Department said on Thursday that retail sales, excluding cars and light trucks, had grown four-tenths of a percent, also more than many analysts had expected.
Darwin Beck, an economist at First Boston in New York, said that the only way sales and inventories can both increase by unexpectedly large amounts is if the American economy produced even more goods in the second quarter than anyone had previously thought. The Commerce Department estimated on July 29 that the economy grew at an annual pace of 3.7 percent in the second quarter; it is scheduled to refine that estimate on Aug. 26.
"We will have higher growth in the second quarter than previously estimated," Mr. Beck predicted.
But Ms. Tyson at the Council of Economic Advisers said such speculation was premature. "I don't think there's any reason to draw that conclusion yet," she said in a telephone interview today.
 
 
 
Optimism in Southeast
 In one possible sign that growth will not slow later this year, manufacturers in the Southeast expressed optimism about future sales in a monthly survey released today by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The bank's regional indexes of output, shipments and new and unfilled orders all increased.
But the Atlanta Fed also said that a sharply rising share of Southeastern manufacturers reported paying higher prices for materials and charging higher prices for their products.
Consumer prices rose particularly fast in July for coffee, up 22.4 percent; fresh fruit and vegetables, up 3.4 percent; gasoline, up 3.5 percent, and airline fares, up 1.3 percent. The overall price increase was held down by falling prices for beef, down 1.2 percent, and clothing, down four-tenths of a percent.
Many products rose in price roughly in line with the overall Consumer Price Index, including car prices, up four-tenths of a percent; medical care costs, also up four-tenths of a percent, and housing, up a tenth of a percent.

 
 
Remarks by Fed Governor
 While today's economic indicators may have provided no clear clues to the Federal Reserve's intentions, off-the-cuff remarks this morning by John P. LaWare, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, convinced some analysts that another quarter-point increase in short-term interest rates on Tuesday was even more likely than it already seemed.
Reuters reported that Mr. LaWare said he expected the economy to grow at a pace of 3.25 to 3.5 percent this year, and by 2.7 percent to 3 percent next year. He spoke in Randolph, Mass., before the South Shore Chamber of Commerce.
In contrast, the Fed officially estimated at its July meeting that the economy would grow 3 to 3.25 percent this year and 2.5 to 2.75 percent next year.
An upward revision of those estimates could mean that the Federal Reserve is more worried that the economy may overheat and feed inflation, said Eugene J. Sherman, director of research at M. A. Schapiro & Company, a New York brokerage firm. Such worries would put pressure on the central bank to raise rates again.
Mr. LaWare, a former chairman of the Shawmut National Corporation, is the Federal Reserve's top expert on banking issues, but is widely believed to rely on the central bank's influential staff for economic forecasts. He was traveling today and could not be reached for comment.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE;
Mitchell Sees Room for Dealing On Rival Health Care Proposals

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Taking a major step toward agreement on national health insurance, Senator George J. Mitchell, the majority leader, said today that the issues raised by bipartisan moderates led by Senator John H. Chafee appeared to be negotiable.
Mr. Mitchell said he could not judge the details of the group's proposals, which are expected to focus chiefly on questions of bureaucracy, cost controls and malpractice litigation, until he receives them on Tuesday. 
 But, referring to a Senate speech two days ago in which Mr. Chafee outlined his own concerns, the majority leader said, "Those appear to be matters where there can and should be discussion and compromise among reasonable people."
Mr. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, said that there would be areas of disagreement in addition to those he listed in his speech but that he did not believe that Mr. Mitchell would find any of the moderates' proposals unreasonable.
The Chafee group is not expected to challenge the efforts of Mr. Mitchell's health insurance bill to seek universal coverage, including a provision that might ultimately require employers to pay half the cost of insuring their workers, a point on which the moderates are not united. In the end, some members of the group might oppose a bill on that point, but most do not regard it as a central issue.
If the Chafee group's precise package, which Congressional aides will spend the weekend writing, proves acceptable to Mr. Mitchell, it is almost certain to command the support of other leading Democrats, like Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who has been working very closely with the majority leader.
With their backing, Mr. Chafee's "mainstream coalition," whose fluctuating membership reached a high of 16 senators today, could command a Senate majority for its proposal.
But while Mr. Mitchell was on the verge of progress with some Republicans, others were threatening to stall.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, blocked any effort to set a vote on an amendment, the first offered to Mr. Mitchell's bill, that is intended to speed insurance coverage for children and pregnant women. Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, said that 28 Republicans still had opening statements to make in the Senate's health care debate and that several needed three or four hours each.
After Senator Kennedy told reporters that this was the equivalent of a filibuster, Mr. Packwood took the Senate floor again, this time to attack him. Mr. Packwood said the Republicans' speeches were the only way they could educate the public about the weaknesses in the Mitchell bill. "It may take us days, or weeks, or months," he said, and then quoted Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's vow, at the Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse in Virginia during the Civil War, to "fight it out on this line if it takes all summer."
 
Needed: A Boost for the House
 But the indefinite delay that has gripped health care efforts in the House appeared more ominous than any contentiousness in the Senate. Thrown off balance by the defeat of the Clinton Administration's crime bill on Thursday, House Democratic leaders are trying to figure out how to rescue that measure and regain some momentum that would help health care legislation.
Action in the Senate could restore House confidence, especially if Mr. Mitchell can preserve his requirement that employers pay half the cost of their workers' health insurance should subsidies and other measures not push insurance coverage to 95 percent of the public by 2000.
The moderates are focused on less-debated sections of the Mitchell bill, for instance its provisions on malpractice litigation and on competition among cooperatives that would be created to help individuals and businesses buy insurance.
Several of the issues they have identified, like the size of the businesses that would be required to insure their workers through such cooperatives, were discussed in Mr. Kennedy's Labor and Human Resources Committee when that panel was drawing up a health care bill earlier this year.
Republicans on the committee then, like members of the coalition now, favored increasing the number of businesses that would be exempted from any such requirement. The Republicans' preference was defeated in committee, but only after they told Mr. Kennedy that even if he made the change, they would not support the bill. Now, with real votes on the table, Mr. Kennedy and his allies would have reason to make a deal.
Some of the moderates' other concerns, like how detailed the benefits package should be or how insurance rates could be adjusted for age, and for how long, are the stuff of obvious compromise when senators are ready to cut a deal.
And there might be easy agreement on some of the coalition's other proposals, like allowing the states to establish more stringent rules on malpractice litigation than the Federal standards that the bill would create. Another probably painless change would be to permit insurance plans created for associations -- like those of lawyers, for instance -- to continue even if new ones were barred in an effort to prevent young, healthy people from clustering together in an insurance pool.
Even issues of more complexity, such as altering the bill's methods for preventing spending from outrunning estimates, would appear to be negotiable.
But there are still several obstacles to agreement, even beyond the details that turn up in the moderates' proposals.
Some of the senators at today's meeting of the "mainstream coalition," especially its Republicans, want to draft an entirely new bill rather than merely a package of amendments. Mr. Mitchell and his allies do not want to start from scratch, which would be a very time-consuming process.
Nor is it clear how the Senate minority leader, Mr. Dole, will respond. Mr. Chafee said today that the group would be presenting its ideas to him too, but since his underlying proposal is very different from Mr. Mitchell's, it is not clear what would happen next.
An aide to Mr. Dole said today that the Senator would like to hear the group's proposals but believed it was necessary to start over and prepare a whole new bill.
The floating membership of the bipartisan group itself is another complication. Today, for example, 16 senators attended the coalition's meeting, and two of the Democrats there -- Sam Nunn of Georgia and David L. Boren of Oklahoma -- later announced that they were going to introduce an entirely different bipartisan health proposal, patterned on a measure offered by a bipartisan House group.
Senators Nunn and Boren were joined in that enterprise by two Republicans who have often attended the moderates' meetings: Senators Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico and Robert F. Bennett of Utah.
Just after 5 P.M. today, the Senate took up the first amendment to Mr. Mitchell's bill. The stated aim of the amendment, offered by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, is to speed up by 18 months, to next July, the Mitchell bill's provision that private insurers be required to include preventive care for pregnant women and infants as a standard benefit in any health policy they sell.
Easy agreement might have been expected on this "motherhood" proposal. But after an hour in which several Democrats spoke in favor of it, Mr. Dole rose to complain that Mr. Dodd had simply "farmed out the floor" for speeches suggesting "that the Democrats like children and we don't like children."
"Maybe I haven't been here long enough to understand what I thought was going on," Mr. Dole allowed. "Or maybe I've been here too long." Later, other Republicans asked how such a measure might increase premiums -- or tax deductions by employers who chose to pay for such benefits, thus reducing tax revenue.
"We'll ask him more later what the revenue impacts might be," said Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, who predicted a vote next week.

Chart: "Players: The Senate's 'Mainstream Coalition' "
The bipartisan group called the "mainstream coalition," which is planning to offer a package of health care ammendments, has six core members, although other senates have been allied with it on various issues. The six core members are:
 
JOHN H. CHAFEE: Republican of Rhode Island. Mr. Chafee, the organizer of the "mainstream coalition," has contended that the bill introduced by Senator George J. Mitchell would impose "the heavy hand of government intervention in the private market." Senator Chafee, who will introduce the coalition's alternative next week, also maintains that the Mitchell measure would not hold down costs.
 
DAVE DURENBERGER: Republican of Minnesota. He maintains that the Mitchell measure would establish an unneeded bureaucracy, impose anti-competitive rules and shift costs onto working people. He points to the success of health maintenance organizations in Minnesota as cost-effective providers of high quality health care.
 
JOHN C. DANFORTH: Republican of Missouri. He said that his opposition to Senator Mitchell's bill was grounded in both economics and philosophy. "His subsidy for low-income people is necessary," Senator Danforth said, "but he's also created entitlements for prescription drugs and long-term care. We can't do that. That's a mistake."
 
JOHN B. BREAUX: Democrat of Louisiana. His opposition to the Mitchell measure is based partly on its provision that could eventually require employers to pay half of workers' health insurance premiums. A Congress sitting in 1994 cannot know what will be needed in 2001 and should not seek to lock in a solution now, he says.
 
BILL BRADLEY: Democrat of New Jersey. Senator Bradley supports the Mitchell provision on employer payments, which is said meets his goal fof reaching universal coverage through "shared responsibility." But he opposes the cost-containment provisions of the Mitchell bill, which he says would impose taxes on too many people.
 
KENT CONRAD: Democrat of North Dakota. He objects to the Mitchell measure on the grounds that it would create a huge new bureaucracy and cause the Federal deficit to balloon. Senator Conrad has called for a health care program that would pay for itself. (pg. 8)

HEADLINE: Democratic Leaders Promise to Try Again on Crime Bill

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
After the worst legislative drubbing of the Clinton Presidency, Democratic leaders in Congress promised today that they would revive the crime bill that the House of Representatives sidetracked on Thursday and win its approval next week.
 The Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, said that crime legislation and the procedural hurdle that blocked it this week would be the main order of business before the House beginning on Tuesday. He predicted that one way or another the bill would get to the floor.
 
 Others in the House echoed that view. But no one was sure what would have to be done between now and then to guarantee enough votes.
 "I feel that some kind of crime bill will pass," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat who was largely responsible for steering the crime measure through the House the first time around. He suggested that when they return next week, House leaders would figure out a way to "rejigger the dial a bit" to win enough votes for passage.
 The problem is that the bill that was blocked on Thursday was a delicate compromise molded over weeks by Senate and House negotiators to satisfy various interests. "Every change we make is going to make it better for some groups and worse for others," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan.
 By a vote of 225 to 210, the House defeated a procedural motion that would have allowed the bill itself to come up for a vote. The majority was composed of an unusual coalition of Republicans and 58 Democrats. Most of those Democrats represent rural districts and opposed the bill's ban on some assault weapons, but 10 were black representatives from big cities who objected to the bill's provisions on capital punishment.
 Republicans and Democrats alike said that if the bill can clear the roadblock of the procedural motion, it will be passed overwhelmingly by the House. Few lawmakers want to be seen as voting directly against a bill that is called an anti-crime measure.
 And in the Senate, Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democrat from Delaware who heads the Judiciary Committee, said, "Whatever they get out of the House, I'll pass."
 
Gleeful Republicans
 Republicans, an increasingly unified and aggressive minority in the House, reveled today in the embarrassment they had handed the Clinton Administration and their Democratic antagonists in the Capitol.
 At a news conference, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip, said the vote should teach President Clinton that if he wants his legislative agenda to succeed, he must work with Republicans.
 Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, teased the Democrats for having overassessed their strength when they brought the crime measure to the floor. If the Democrats hope to get health legislation approved, he said, "they'd better be better at counting votes than they were on crime."
 Taunting the President, Republican leaders from the House and Senate faxed a letter to Mr. Clinton on Air Force One offering to meet with him when he returned from Minneapolis to Washington tonight "to discuss how we can work together to pass a strong crime bill as soon as possible."
 
White House Rebuff
 Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, declined for the President. In a letter to the Republican leaders, Mr. Panetta wrote: "What disappointed me, and what disappointed the President, is that the very spirit of bipartisanship you wrote about today was torn asunder in the House."
 Among the main provisions of the crime bill, which would cost $30 billion over six years, are financing for 100,000 new police officers nationwide; a ban on some assault weapons; the death penalty for scores of crimes; financing for new prisons; social and rehabilitation programs for criminals and those at particular risk of becoming criminals, and a guarantee that people would be sentenced to prison for life if they were convicted of a violent felony for the third time.
 The National Rifle Association lobbied with all its considerable might against the ban on assault weapons, and some lawmakers said that striking that provision from the bill might win enough votes for passage. Others said that dropping the ban would lose more votes than it would gain.
 Another possibility would be to drop from the bill provisions that Republicans referred to as pork barrel. The Republicans pointed particularly to a $10 million grant for a criminal justice center at Lamar University in Beaumont, Tex., the alma mater of Representative Jack Brooks, chairman of the Judiciary Committee and head of the House conferees on the legislation.
 Asked if he would permit the grant to be dropped, Mr. Brooks, a Democrat from Beaumont, replied: "Hell no! Are you out of your mind?"
 For the bill to be changed, it would have to be reconsidered by the House-Senate conference committee. Senator Biden said he was opposed to reconvening the conference, and he argued that the leaders in the House should try to switch the eight votes necessary to win approval of the measure as it stands.
 It is always hard to get lawmakers to switch votes once they have been cast without some face-saving change in the legislation. But it has been done before. In 1985, for example, the House rejected a similar procedural motion, thus denying Ronald Reagan a vote on his bill to change taxes, the most important legislation of his second term.
 Mr. Reagan went to the Capitol, met with all the members of his party, pleaded for their votes and won approval of the motion the second time around.
 Mr. Clinton may not be popular enough in Congress or in the country to pull off a similar feat. Asked to assess the President's muscle, Senator Biden suggested that reporters take a look at recent public opinion polls that show Mr. Clinton at the lowest point of his Presidency.
 Going into the vote Thursday night, Democrat leaders said today, they thought they had commitments of "yes" votes from 200 of the 256 Democrats, 15 of the 178 Republicans and the one Independent, two short of the 218 votes needed for a majority.
 The leaders said they thought that if the vote went down to the wire, two or three representatives who had not committed themselves would succumb to pressure and put the tally over the top. That is what happened last year on the President's budget, which was approved in the House by a two-vote margin.
 But this time, the last two or three votes were not forthcoming. Once defeat was certain, several representatives who had promised their votes if they were absolutely necessary voted "no."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Roster: At Issue In the Crime Bill"
 
Some Republicans and conservative Democrats who opposed the anti-crime bill say their objections are based in part on spending for crime-prevention programs that they considered unnecessary. The measure would have provided more than $7 billion over six years for various prevention programs like the following:
 
Community Schools - $630 million for after school, weekend and summer programs to provide children with positive activities and alternatives to the street life of crime and drugs.
 
Youth Employment and Skills Crime Prevention Grants (Y.E.S.) - $650 million to provide jobs to young adults in high crime areas.
 
Violence Against Women Act - $1.8 billion to fight violence against women.
 
Local Partnership Act - $1.8 billion to local governments for anti-crime efforts, such as drug treatment, education and jobs.
 
Community Economic Partnership - $300 million for lines of credit to community development corporations to stimulate business and employment opportunities for low-income, unemployed and underemployed people.
 
Anti-gang grants - $125 million for programs to give people positive alternatives to gangs (such as academic, athletic, artistic after-school activities, mentoring programs, scout troops, and sports leagues).
 
Midnight Sports - $40 million for midnight sports leagues for youths in high-crime areas.
 
Olympic Youth Development Centers - $50 million for the U.S. Olympic Committee to develop supervised sports and recreation programs in high-crime areas.
 
Boys and Girls Clubs - $30 million to establish clubs in low income housing communities, and $10 million to encourage police officers to live in those communities.
 
Visitation Centers - $30 million for supervised "safe havens" where divorced or separated parents with a history of physical or sexual abuse may visit their children.

HEADLINE: Statement By N. Korea And the U.S.

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: GENEVA, Saturday, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the text of the statement issued early today by negotiators for the United States and North Korea:
Both sides reaffirmed the principles of the June 11, 1993, DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea]-USA joint statement and reached agreement that the following elements should be part of a final resolution of the nuclear issue: 
 1. The DPRK is prepared to replace its graphite-moderated reactors and related facilities with light water reactor (LWR) power plants, and the USA is prepared to make arrangements for interim energy alternatives to the DPRK's graphite-moderated reactors. Upon receipt of USA assurances for the provision of LWRs and for arrangements for interim energy alternatives, the DPRK will freeze construction of the 50-megawatt (e) and 200-megawatt (e) reactors, forego reprocessing, and seal the Radiochemical Laboratory, to be monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
2. The DPRK and the USA are prepared to establish diplomatic representation in each other's capitals and to reduce barriers to trade and investment, as a move toward full normalization of political and economic relations.
3. To help achieve peace and security on a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, the USA is prepared to provide the DPRK with assurances against the threat or use of nuclear weapons by the USA, and the DPRK remains prepared to implement the North-South Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
4. The DPRK is prepared to remain a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to allow implementation of its safeguards agreement under the Treaty.
Important issues raised during the talks remain to be resolved. Both sides agree that expert-level discussions are necessary to advance the replacement of the DPRK's graphite-moderated program with LWR technology, the safe storage and disposition of the spent fuel, provision of alternative energy, and the establishment of liaison offices. Accordingly, expert-level talks will be held in the DPRK and USA or elsewhere as agreed. The DPRK and USA agreed to recess their talks and resume in Geneva on September 23, 1994.
In the meantime, the USA will pursue arrangements necessary to provide assurances for the LWR project to the DPRK as part of a final resolution of the nuclear issue, and the DPRK will observe the freeze on nuclear activities and maintain the continuity of safeguards. . . .

The Economy
Consumer prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent in July, buoyed by rising gasoline and grocery prices, while business inventories increased in June, the Government reported. Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, consumer prices rose only two-tenths of 1 percent, less than many analysts had expected. [Page 37.] 
 The Clinton Administration and House Republicans reached agreement on the broad outlines of deals on financing for a world free trade pact and on the Administration's future trade negotiating authority. The move was seen as another step toward Congressional approval of the accord. [37.]
The Government announced the largest clothing recall ever, a quarter-million rayon skirts made in India that can be set on fire with a cigarette and burn faster than a newspaper. [6.]
 
Companies
Comcast is intent on staying in the home shopping business because the company's top officials, Ralph and Brian Roberts, believe the $2 billion industry still has plenty of room for growth. The trick is to make the programming evolve beyond impulse purchases by couch potatoes to become a service that competes with mail-order catalogues for the dollars of busy, sophisticated people with specific shopping needs. [37.]

Walt Disney will pull "The Lion King" from movie theaters after next month, even though the animated film is still drawing crowds.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Battling Presidential Contenders Converge on Economic Matters

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Aug. 12

 BODY:
As the three leading candidates head toward Mexico's presidential election next week, they have shown surprisingly little disagreement over what could well have been a major issue: The ruling party's economic dealings with the United States and the shock treatment it has used to transform Mexico's system of free enterprise.
 Long one of the most ardent supporters of state ownership of businesses, the Mexican Government has almost entirely withdrawn from the private sector during over the last six years and thrown open the economy to fierce competition, especially from American companies.
 
 Unemployment has soared, and Mexican businesses felt they were left to sink or swim in the new economy and tougher competitive environment created by Mexico's entrance into the North American Free Trade Agreement. Yet, while the candidates are worlds apart in their political views, the handling of the economy has not become a dividing line in the campaign.
 The clearest signal of the extent to which many Mexicans seem to have conceded their need for a free market comes from the leftist candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, known by its Spanish initials, P.R.D.
 He rejects nearly all the current Government's social and political policies but basically supports the ruling party's approach to fighting inflation and encouraging development. He has also abandoned his opposition to the trade pact, saying only that some sections, especially those dealing with the crops of small farmers, should be renegotiated.
 Both Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, and Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the conservative National Action Party, or the PAN, also say they will uphold the trade pact. They both plan to stick to the basics of the Salinas administration's economic itinerary, a double-edged approach that rigidly controls inflation while relying on the market, rather than Government intervention, to spur real growth.
 All three candidates have said that they would carry on the major modernization projects undertaken by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, which include privatizing or dissolving more than 900 state-owned companies and granting autonomy to the central bank. They differ only in some details of how the Government can encourage economic growth.
 "The opposition has learned that there is no room for adventures, for tinkering with sound economic and fiscal policies," said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, a business consultant in Mexico City who is often critical of the Government. The ruling party, he said, has realized "that it has sacrificed economic growth for the sake of some economic goals."
 
Feelings of Insecurity
 Many Mexicans say they feel the Salinas administration has destroyed the meager security they once enjoyed. They are especially galled by the number of Mexican billionaires -- 24, up from 2 when Mr. Salinas took office. Economic injustice was a central complaint in the Chiapas uprising last January.
 But, unlike the mood in the 1988 election, in which 29 percent of voters expressed anger over low wages and rising prices by voting in large numbers for Mr. Cardenas, sentiment this year is different. Real wages are still below the levels they had reached in 1980, but they have increased every year since 1988.
 Perhaps more important, the daily shock of rapid inflation that enraged Mexicans every time they went to buy a bag of beans in the mid-1980s no longer exists. The PRI Government has managed to bring down inflation from an annual rate of 159 percent in 1987 to below 8 percent.
 "People have noticed very dramatic changes in lifestyle that have to do with the economic reforms," said Alejandro Hernandez Delgado, director of the center of economic studies at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico in Mexico City. "Some of those changes are as simple as going to the supermarket and seeing stable prices and a larger variety of goods produced in Mexico and outside."
 
Shoring Up the Peso
 Nonetheless, the need to demonstrate the economy's stability and shore up confidence in the peso prior to the vote last year on the trade pact led the Government to keep interest rates high.
 That, combined with doubts about the pact, meant the economy slumbered until the beginning of this year. Then came the rebel uprising in Chiapas state in January and the assassination of the PRI candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, in March, which caused the recovery to stumble. First quarter growth this year was only 0.5 percent.
 Of the three candidates, Mr. Zedillo is the business community's clear choice because of his economics degrees from Yale, the time he spent working at Mexico's central bank and his preference for an open market free from most Government controls. As his standing has risen in polls in the last three weeks, the Mexican stock exchange and money markets have responded favorably.
 Mr. Zedillo acknowledges that the hard-line approach to economic modernization that he helped draft as Mr. Salinas's Budget and Planning Minister has cost many jobs and created hardships. He is expected to focus less on fighting inflation and more on encouraging growth.
 He has said that he will not privatize the three remaining big state-owned enterprises -- oil, electricity and railroads -- and wants to offer more subsidies and credits to help local businesses adapt to post-Nafta competition.
 If Mr. Fernandez de Cevallos were to win, he would not be expected to fiddle much with Mexico's economic path since the PRI has adopted as its own many PAN proposals from previous years. He has said Mexico should try for "more humane growth" that does more to assure people jobs and provide businesses with the capital to compete. He supports the trade agreement, has proposed transferring some responsibilities for economic development from the President to Congress and has talked about the need for a balanced-budget law.
 It is Mr. Cardenas who represents the biggest question mark if he beats the odds and wins. He has considerably moderated the radical leftist economic views he espoused in the 1988 presidential election, apparently in the hope of winning over middle class voters. He now accepts the main Salinas ideas of opening up Mexico's economy and controlling inflation and debt -- a big change from 1988, when he said Mexico should not pay its huge debt at all.

HEADLINE: World Trade Pact Advances With Some Bipartisan Deals

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration and House Republicans took another step today toward Congressional approval of a world free trade agreement, reaching the broad outlines of deals on financing for the accord and on the Administration's future trade negotiating authority.
But many obstacles remain before the agreement to reduce tariffs and other trade barriers, which was reached in December, can become part of American law. The legal language for today's deals is still being drafted, House Democratic leaders have yet to endorse the compromises and a conference has yet to be held to reconcile differences between House and Senate versions of the approval legislation. 
 That conference could be especially difficult because of the nature of today's deals. One calls for Congress to review American participation in the trade pact after five years, with a possible vote then on whether to pull out, said Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the ranking Republican on the Ways and Means Committee.
Mr. Archer added that the financing package reached today would not actually make up for all of the revenue reductions the trade pact would cause as less money is taken in from tariff duties. The package eliminates a $1 billion tax on retail inventories that offended Republicans, but does not replace it with anything, leaving the House-Senate conference to decide how to raise the money.
While most trade experts expect the agreement to be approved eventually, it remains unclear whether Congress can find the time and political energy to reach a decision this year, particularly given the bitterness of struggles over crime and health care bills.
Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat who brokered today's deals, emphasized that putting them into legal language might be difficult. "The agreement that has been reached conceptually is still subject to drafting," he said. "I am cautiously optimistic that it will be finalized pending the outcome of the drafting."
Mr. Archer said that an aide to Representative Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia, had also endorsed today's arrangements. He predicted that the full Ways and Means Committee would endorse the deal on Tuesday and that the House-Senate conference would start soon thereafter.
If approved by Congress, the trade pact would reduce tariffs around the world and bring new industries like farming and accounting under the free-trade rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It would also replace the existing GATT secretariat in Geneva with a new World Trade Organization that would have broad powers to arbitrate international trade disputes.
 Today's deal also calls for reviving for two and a half years the President's so-called fast-track authority to negotiate a trade agreement and submit it to the House and Senate for a single vote in each chamber with no amendments allowed. The Administration had been seeking a seven-year renewal of the authority, which lapsed on Dec. 15, 1993.

HEADLINE: Bonds Post First Gain In 5 Days

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose yesterday for the first time in five days after the Consumer Price Index report showed that prices were up only modestly in July.
The report raised questions about the size of the next interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve. 
 The new 30 1/4-year 7 1/2 percent bond rose 20/32 , to 1001/32 , for a yield of 7.50 percent, down from 7.65 percent the previous day. On Thursday, the Labor Department said the Producer Price Index had risen a stronger-than-expected five-tenths of 1 percent in July, and weak demand at the Treasury's $11 billion bond auction that day had pushed bond yields up 8 basis points.
Marilyn Schaja, a money market economist for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities, said the concern about higher inflation numbers and expectations of a fifth increase in interest rates had left the market oversold.
She said that with the July inflation numbers indicating only a moderate inflation threat, there appeared to be some indication that the Fed could get by with an increase of only 25 basis points in the Federal funds rate, rather than the 50 basis points that had been expected.
Ms. Schaja said the consumer price figures indicated that even though there had been increases in the basic commodity indexes, price increases had not flowed through to the consumer level yet, an indication that producers might be having difficulty passing along price increases at the retail level. That, in turn, may be an indication that the Fed's tightening might not be as severe as expected.
Consumer prices rose three-tenths of 1 percent in July, mostly because of coffee prices, which posted a record surge of 22.4 percent, and increases in the prices of energy and automobiles.
The core rate, which excludes food and energy costs, was up two-tenths of 1 percent last month.
During June, both the overall index and the core rate rose three-tenths of 1 percent. So far this year, the index has risen at a rate of 2.7 percent, the same rate as during the first several months of 1993.
One reason for consumers' resistance to price increases might be stalled growth in consumer income. In a separate report, the Labor Department said Americans' weekly earnings, adjusted for inflation, were unchanged in July from June, and up only three-tenths of 1 percent from a year earlier.
Yesterday, the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment rose more than expected, to 92.6, in the preliminary August reading, from 89.0 in July.
Analysts said the expectations component rose to 81.4, from 78.5, and the currenct conditions component jumped to 110.1, from 105.4. Business inventories rose four-tenths of 1 percent in June, also slightly higher than expected.
The Commerce Department also reported yesterday that business inventories rose more than expected in June, but traders said it was an old number.
Tempering the market's reaction to the inflation numbers, a Federal Reserve governor, John P. LaWare, said he was much less optimistic about the inflation outlook, and sent a strong signal that he thought interest rates should rise again.
An increase may come as early as Tuesday, when the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that sets monetary policy, is to meet.

HEADLINE: Dow Jones Rises 17.81 On Low Inflation News

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Stocks followed bonds higher yesterday, after a smaller-than-expected rise in July consumer prices stirred hopes that the Federal Reserve would be less aggressive in raising interest rates next week.
"I'm not so sure it's a lock the Fed will now raise rates," said Bruce Bittles, market strategist for J. C. Bradford & Company in Nashville. The Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, will meet on Tuesday and Wednesday. 
 Stocks were also buoyed by a resurgence of takeover speculation in drug and food companies, traders said.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 17.81, to 3,768.71, more than offsetting a drop of 15.86 points on Thursday and finishing the week 21.69 points higher.
 
Exxon Is Bid Up
 Caterpillar and Exxon accounted for more than half of the Dow's gain yesterday. Caterpillar climbed 2 1/8, to 105 1/8, after the maker of construction machinery said its sales of heavy equipment had jumped 20 percent in July, from the comparable month a year ago, an indication that 1994 sales would be stronger than expected.
Exxon rose 2 1/8, to 60 1/4, after a Federal jury awarded damages that were far smaller than had been sought by the Alaskan fishermen who were hurt by the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989. The $286.8 million award was less than a third of the $895 million requested, and raised speculation that the final punitive damages would be less than the maximum $15 billion that analysts had estimated.
Broader market indexes also rebounded yesterday from the previous day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index soared 3.07 points, to 461.95. The Nasdaq composite index rose 3.41 points, to 731.61 The American Stock Exchange market value index gained 0.45 point, to 443.70.
Almost three stocks rose for every two that fell on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading was moderate, with 249.3 million shares changing hands on the Big Board.
 
Favorable Inflation News
 Stocks rose after the Labor Department reported that the July consumer price index rose three-tenths of 1 percent. The so-called core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose just two-tenths of 1 percent.
The evidence that inflation has not accelerated lifted bond prices, pushing interest rates lower. The yield on the Treasury's new 7 1/2 percent 30 1/4-year bond fell to 7.50 percent, down from 7.65 percent on Thursday.
The C.P.I. negated the higher-than-expected rise in the producer price index, reported on Thursday, analysts said. The P.P.I. rose five-tenths of 1 percent, amid surging coffee and gasoline prices, more than the four-tenths of 1 percent increase that economists had expected.
Investors were watching the two inflation reports for signs of whether the Fed panel would vote to raise interest rates a fifth time this year. Higher rates slow down economic growth and crimp corporate profits.
 
Drug Stocks Are Active
 Drug stocks were active amid renewed takeover speculation. Three drug companies, Syntex, Eli Lilly, and Amgen were among the four most actively traded stocks today.
Syntex fell 1, to 21 5/8. The company denied speculation that Roche Holding A.G.'s $5.8 billion takeover offer for Syntex had unraveled.
Roche's bid for Syntex, coupled with American Home Products' $8.5 billion tender offer for American Cyanamid, has fueled speculation of more drug industry marriages, analysts and traders said.
Lilly shares rose 1/2, to 53, amid unconfirmed speculation of a bid by Britain's Glaxo Holdings.
Food stocks rose on speculation that Sandoz's $3.7 billion offer for Gerber Products in May would not be the last such acquisition. Kellogg rose 1 3/4, to 55 3/8; General Mills gained 1 11/32 , to 53 31/32 , and Quaker Oats rose 1 3/8, to 74 7/8.
In Tokyo yesterday, Japanese stocks slipped. The Nikkei index of 225 issues lost 157.53 points, closing at 20,663.83.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Prices Are Down Sharply For Silver, Cotton and Oil

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Silver prices retreated yesterday, pulled down by economic factors and heavy selling in gold.
On other commodity markets, cotton plunged the daily trading limit and oil prices fell sharply. The Commodity Research Bureau's index dropped 1.90 points, to 229.70. 
 "One of the key factors that hurt silver was the very aggressive producer selling of gold overnight," said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist with Merrill Lynch Futures in New York.
"The producers do not have a long-range constructive view of the market," he said. "So when a little rally developed, they used it as a selling opportunity."
 
Pressure From Economic News
 Silver also had trouble with a combination of economic factors, including a "very tame" Consumer Price Index, a surge in bond prices and a 61-cent drop in crude oil, Mr. O'Neill said. The Government reported yesterday that consumer prices rose three-tenths of a percent in July.
The selling of silver accelerated during the day, turning the decline in silver futures into a full retreat.
Silver for September delivery lost 13.3 cents, to settle at $5.07 an ounce, at the Commodity Exchange in New York, while October gold fell $2.50, to $378.50 an ounce.
Cotton futures prices plummeted in reaction to a huge production estimate released after the close of trading on Thursday. The October cotton contract was down the 2-cent limit, at 69.27 cents a pound, at the New York Cotton Exchange.
The Agriculture Department estimated the 1994-95 American cotton crop at 19.195 million 480-pound bales, more than one million bales higher than what the market was expecting.
 
Move by Short-Sellers
 Crude oil futures dropped below $18 a barrel before bouncing back slightly. September oil settled at $18.05 a barrel, down 61 cents, at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Traders said the market was under attack by short-sellers who felt the bullish trend in oil prices was ending. Oil prices have surged in the last two months since a strike by Nigerian oil workers disrupted petroleum production and exports.
Other energy futures also declined. September heating oil fell 1.15 cents, to 48.57 cents a gallon, while September gasoline was down 2.08 cents, at 55.22 cents a gallon.
Elsewhere, deterioration of the Australian wheat crop gave wheat futures prices a lift. September wheat gained 5.75 cents, to $3.4175 a bushel, on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Reports from Australia estimated that country's crop at 10 million to 11.5 million tons, compared with the 12.5 million tons projected a day earlier by the United States Agriculture Department.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Trims Early Losses After Bond Prices Move Up

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the German mark yesterday but ended modestly lower against most other currencies as most American dealers shrugged off an early plunge in European trading and focused instead on bond and stock rallies on Wall Street.
For a second day, European investors fled to the perceived safety of the mark in the wake of Thursday's interest rate increases in Italy and Sweden, which fueled expectations of higher rates across the Continent. 
 A strong recovery in the Treasury bond market on positive inflation data helped offset the dollar's weakness in Europe, where the dollar dropped sharply against the mark and fell at one point below 100 Japanese yen.
"The dollar looked precarious this morning," said Steve Jury, chief dealer in New York for Union Bank of Switzerland. "But we recovered in tandem with the bond market after the C.P.I. data. If it wasn't for the bond market, the dollar would have come off quite a bit."
The Labor Department reported a modest rise of three-tenths of 1 percent in the Consumer Price Index last month. Inflation-wary bond investors reacted by bidding the price of the 30 1/4-year Treasury bond up 20/32 .
 
Unchanged Against Yen
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5515 marks, down from 1.5608 on Thursday. But it ended unchanged at 100.15 yen.
The British pound rose to $1.5473, from $1.5458.
New York dealers adjusted their positions in anticipation of an increase in short-term interest rates after Federal Reserve policy makers meet on Tuesday. The central bank is widely expected to raise its target for the Federal funds rate -- the interest banks charge each other on overnight loans -- one-quarter to one-half percentage point in a preemptive strike against inflation.
A positive reception in the bond market to the expected rate increase would support the dollar, since demand for the currency rises when American securities perform well.
"Demand for dollar assets isn't there right now," said Earl Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. "We need a rally in the bond and stock markets to get some demand. Clearly it depends on how the bond market reacts to the Fed next week."
A rate increase would also benefit the dollar by narrowing the gap between American rates and the higher European rates, a disparity that tends to draw short-term investment funds away from the United States.

 BODY:

I.R.A. Withdrawals
At age 70 1/2, I must begin withdrawing 6.25 percent annually from my I.R.A., which I am going to do in monthly installments. In future years, will I have to withdraw more than 6.25 percent, and how is the amount calculated?
MARTIN MUCKLER, Flushing, Queens 
 The 6.25 percent minimum withdrawal from an individual retirement account is based on a single life expectancy of 16 years for someone who is age 70 1/2. Each year, this life expectancy will decline under one of two methods: term certain and recalculation.
Under the term certain method, your initial fixed life expectancy is reduced by one each year, so that in the second year your life expectancy is 15 years. Under the recalculation method, life expectancy is recomputed every year because it increases over your lifetime, so that in the second year your life expectancy is 15.3 years. Under both methods, the percentage to be withdrawn will be greater in the second and succeeding years.
"You may want to consider naming an individual as the beneficiary of the I.R.A. to extend the life expectancy," because then a joint life expectancy could be used, said Joel S. Isaacson, president of Joel Isaacson & Company, a New York financial planning firm.

Limits on Pension Rollovers
Will the I.R.S. allow monthly pension checks from the New York City Teachers Retirement System to be rolled over into an individual retirement account if the recipient endorses them to the I.R.A.? WILLIAM RAUSNITZ, Arverne, Queens
To qualify for tax-deferred treatment in an individual retirement account, all the money in the qualifed retirement plan must be rolled over in what is called a lump sum distribution. The full distribution must be received within a single taxable year.
"Since payments in this case will extend over more than one year, it will not be considered a lump sum distribution and therefore not eligible for tax deferral," said Stuart Kessler, senior tax partner of Goldstein Golub Kessler & Company, a certifed public accounting firm, in New York. "This rule affects not only a teacher receiving distributions from a qualified plan, but also all taxpayers who elect or are distributed periodic retirement payments."

When Not to Refinance
If one has a mortgage at 10.5 percent and five years left to go, does it make sense to refinance the mortgage at the lower rates now available?
M. SPEIDEL, Forest Hills, Queens
Your early mortgage payments largely covered interest costs, while your current payments mostly repay the principal. For this reason, many real estate specialists say it probably does not make sense to refinance this particular mortgage.
"With five years remaining, there would be substantial closing costs, which would lessen any immediate cash flow savings between the 10.5 percent mortgage and the current fixed mortgage rates of approximately 8.5 percent," said Robert Mascali of the Gioffre, Gioffre & Mascali law firm in Port Chester, N.Y. "Additionally, since most mortgages are self-amortizing and loaded with interest up-front, the cash flow savings would, in fact, be reduced as well."

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Time to Turn Choosy As Utilities Compete

BYLINE: By Francis Flaherty 

 BODY:
THAT old gray mare of investing -- the electric utility -- ain't what she used to be. While people can still get utilities' customary slow, sure amble to high dividends, looming competition in the industry means investors may have a different ride altogether.
True, the nation's 100 electric utilities, hammered by interest rate rises, were off nearly 28 percent in early July from a year ago. And true, bargain hunters have since bid them back up, just a bit. No surprises there. Although safe in many ways, utilities have always had interest-rate risk. 
 But never before have they faced competition, and soon they will. Manufacturers, miffed at high electric bills, have prodded regulators in California and elsewhere to dismantle utilities' longstanding monopolies.
"The speed may vary from state to state, but the momentum can't be stopped," Barry Abramson, an analyst with Prudential Securities, said. So, dowdy utilities are getting into fighting shape -- merging, cutting costs and sealing foreign deals.
And, as utilities adapt, so must investors. "Now, it matters much more which utility you buy," he said.
Regional economics is one factor to consider, Wilbur Simao, an analyst with Sterne, Agee & Leach in Atlanta, said. "The major growth we'll see is in the Southeast," he said, forecasting above-average revenue growth of 4 percent a year for Duke Power in North Carolina and 3.5 percent for Florida Progress.
"If a utility can add 50,000 new customers a year, it blunts the edge of competition," Mr. Abramson said.
But the real growth will be abroad, making overseas activity a big plus. Mr. Abramson likes CMS Energy in Michigan; it has three Argentine joint ventures and is scouting more Latin American prospects, and it is building two power plants in India and two in the Philippines.
And Duke Power, Mr. Simao said, has ventures in Argentina and Australia, plus a land-office business in "exporting its nuclear expertise."
But high dividends -- utilities' star feature, often double or more the 2.8 percent average of general equities -- are losing some shine. Utilities now disburse about 80 percent of their profits in dividends. Under competition, however, this payout ratio is likely to fall, for utilities that retain more profits will be better able to finance new ventures. Mr. Simao very much likes Duke's 67 percent payout.
What about costs? "Cost-cutting is the most important thing," said Douglas Fischer of A. G. Edwards. He likes Wisconsin Energy, which expects its work force -- 5,800 in 1993 -- to be slimmer by 1,000 by December.
But some costs cannot be trimmed, Mr. Abramson cautioned, and investors should heed the distinction. American Electric Power in Columbus, Ohio, is low cost "because it has only one nuclear plant, and it was built 20 years ago when costs were cheaper." But Centerior Energy in Cleveland is high cost because its nuclear units are newer, with bills still to pay.
Utilities cannot do much about another matter sharply affecting their fortunes: regulation. California "forces them to buy expensive solar, wind and geothermal power," Mr. Abramson said, "and under pollution rules they can't use low-cost coal." Both policies mean high expenses. But Florida has "reasonable regulation," said Mr. Fischer, who likes the FPL Group, a utility there.
Mr. Abramson favors utilities with many residential customers because "the fiercest competition will be over the big industrial ones." And Mr. Simao likes those with the safety of several power sources -- coal, oil, hydro or nuclear.
Investors willing to comparison-shop should do so soon. Despite utilities' recent uptick, their long fall this year has depressed prices. Florida Progress -- $28.75 a share, up 12.5 cents, at Friday's close -- is a bargain under $30, Mr. Simao says, as is the Public Service Company of Colorado for anything under $28. It closed at $26.75, up 12.5 cents, on Friday.
Investors must find not just good utilities, but ones suited to their needs. With its foreign ambitions, CMS Energy of Michigan is an aggressive company that growth investors might like. Income seekers, though, may like something less bold.
Is all this too complicated? Then defer to the experts who tend $22.6 billion in 81 utility mutual funds. But the funds are changing, too, as both the electric utilities and the phone companies they hold evolve.
"Phone companies used to be safe, regulated investments, too," said John Teall of Lipper Analytical Services. But with the coming information superhighway, he said, "They may make a lot, or they may be road kill."
So, like utilities, the utility funds are adapting. "Many are buying more foreign stocks and real estate," Natalie Andrus of Morningstar said. Others are more conservative. With the funds, the story, too, is more complication, but more choice.
Eric Ryback, manager of the $12 million Lindner Utility Fund, takes a head-on stance. "We redefined utilities to include cable, oil, gas pipeline and phone equipment," he said, "and 35 percent of our assets are foreign."
The growth-minded may like Lindner -- its diversification can blunt interest-rate risk, too -- but its 4 percent to 5 percent dividend may disappoint income seekers. An alternative is the Franklin Utilities Fund, which is 90 percent invested in electrics and yielding 6.3 percent.
"There will be winners, there will be losers" as utilities compete, Mr. Abramson said. For investors, that means dissecting these fated monopolies carefully to tell which is which.

Baker, Vendor, Scalper, Sigh: Strike Costs City Millions

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
From ticket scalpers to hot dog roll bakers to souvenir vendors who sell Yankee or Met knickknacks, yesterday was the beginning of a midsummer nightmare: no baseball, no customers and no cash.
The bartenders, bookies and concession vendors could only get out their calculators and weep. The City Comptroller's office estimates that each home game adds about $2 million to New York City's economy. 
 The 52 home games that remained on the schedule -- 24 for the Yankees, 28 for the Mets -- would have brought in about $104 million, including ticket sales, hotel rooms for the visiting teams and a host of less direct expenditures.
 
Bleak Echoes of 1981
 For small businesses that get by on small slices of the total, a long strike would be devastating. At the Yankee Tavern in the Bronx, around the corner from where the division-leading Yankees were not playing, the owner, Joe Bastone, figured he would lose 40 percent of what he usually takes in during the summer. Around the corner at Stan's Sports Bar, the owner, Lou Dene, was looking back, thinking ahead and worrying.
"The last time they had a strike, in '81," he said, "it took us three years to get back in the black."
The first day of the strike brought layoffs for about 1,500 concession vendors who work at Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium. They will not be eligible for unemployment benefits until the walkout has been going on for seven weeks, the same as the players. Never mind that the players take home far bigger paychecks.
 
It Makes No Difference
 "We don't distinguish between people who are striking and people who are indirectly affected," said Frederic Buse, the state director of unemployment insurance.
George Pena, who got his job at a Yankee Stadium souvenir stand only three weeks ago, maintained that he was directly affected, no matter what the state labor laws say. "It's billionaires versus billionaires, and I'm living week to week," he said. "I've been to so many places and there's hardly anything out there. It was hard enough to get this, and now I'm out."
Even his boss was worried about making ends meet. "During the off season I sometimes work in a pharmacy," said John Zale, who owns the stand at Yankee Stadium and another at Shea, "but it's tough to get because they know you're leaving in the spring. Who wants a 48-year-old C.E.O. with souvenir experience?"
Economists said that the strike had the potential for costing the city more than if it had been called, say, last year, when neither the Yankees nor the Mets were playing as well. This year, with the Yankees in first place and the Mets in third, the New York economy loses, as employees who lost their jobs cut back on their own spending, crimping other businesses that had depended on them.
 
A Bonanza Squandered?
 And if the strike is not settled before the scheduled end of the regular season on Oct. 2, the city could miss the bonanza of the Yankees in the playoffs or the World Series.
"In a year when the Rangers showed how much a winning team could do for a city, that's almost incalculable," said Mitchell Moss, a professor at New York University, referring to the Stanley Cup champions. "The playoffs are where the high rollers really spend money. The attendance is so good, it's better to have post-season games because there's more money coming into the city. More people were buying Ranger T-shirts in the spring than ever went to Rangers games."
Post-season games would have meant sold-out hotels, said Jeanine Moss, a spokeswoman for the New York City Convention and Visitors Bureau. But she said that the tourist industry would not be hurt if the strike ends before October because regular-season games draw relatively few out-of-town visitors.
For economists, then, the question becomes how Yankee or Met ticket-holders spend the time, and money, they would have spent at the stadiums.
 
Tracking the Money
 "Some people will probably say, 'I'll go to the city anyway, go to the movies,' " said Prof. Joseph Tracy, an economist at Columbia University. "I have a feeling the money will get spent, but people are fairly specific about what they do. When I got tickets for the Rangers for my 9-year-old, if those games had been called off, I wasn't going to bring him in for something else."
Obviously, it is too soon to say whether baseball fans think that way. John Tepper Marlin, the number-crunching economist at the Comptroller's Office, figures that each home game brings in $2.6 million for the Yankees and $1.5 million for the Mets.
About two-thirds is in direct spending -- tickets, parking, hot dogs and so on. The rest is in indirect expenses, a category that covers what the teams and concessions spend on supplies as well as what the employees spend their paychecks on.
Marlin estimated that each dollar spent on a home game generates $1.52 for the city economy, a figure he said was probably a bit on the low side; the conventional wisdom is that each dollar spent at the much shorter United States Open tennis tournament yields $1.59.
It was not immediately clear how much money the city, which collects rent from the two teams, stood to lose.
 
Does Anyone Win?
 Are there any winners? Cable television customers, if they don't mind missing games. Time Warner Cable, which owns or operates cable systems in four of the city's five boroughs, said it would not charge for SportsChannel until the strike ends or the fall basketball and hockey seasons begin. Time Warner offers the MSG network on its standard tier of programs, and officials said a reduction in the basic rate would depend on how much MSG reduces what it charges Time Warner.
Cablevision, which runs systems in Brooklyn and the Bronx, said it would credit customers who call and cancel their premium sports services, including SportsChannel and MSG, which it offers as a premium service. Cablevision officials said there would be reductions for customers who did not cancel, depending on how much SportsChannel and MSG reduce their charges to Cablevision.
Some companies have tried to win business from fans who suddenly have time on their hands. "Has the baseball strike shut out your group event?" asked an advertisement for a cruise line, Spirit Cruises.
Has the baseball strike meant a surge in bookings?
"If we do feel anything, it won't be for a week," said Steve Cruz, the sales manager at Spirit Cruises. "We're sold out this weekend and into next week."

HEADLINE: In His New Play, a Message for Friel's Critics

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: DUBLIN, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Brian Friel's new play, "Molly Sweeney," a tale of blindness, both physical and psychological, and, above all, of self-delusion, opened at the Gate Theater here on Tuesday night.
 The philosophical musing that led many critics to fault his last effort, "Wonderful Tennessee," is muted in "Molly Sweeney." And Mr. Friel, who is directing a play of his own for the first time and who has declined all requests for interviews, seems to admonish his critics explicitly in dialogue at the end of the play.
 
 Critics for all major Dublin newspapers have praised "Molly" enthusiastically, and the Dublin theater establishment has already begun to feel that Mr. Friel, generally considered Ireland's best living playwright, is on the way to more acclaim like that accorded his "Dancing at Lughnasa" three years ago here, in London and on Broadway, where it won a Tony. By contrast, "Wonderful Tennessee" closed on Broadway last fall after only a few performances.
 "Molly" is to run for at least two months in Dublin before moving in November to the Almeida Theater in London. The Gate's director, Michael Colgan, has made it clear he would like to see "Molly" staged in New York City, but no deals have been struck.
 
A More Intimate Setting
 Mr. Friel chose the Gate rather than the Abbey, Ireland's prestigious national theater, which produced both "Lughnasa" and "Tennessee," because, he told Abbey officials, the 330-seat Gate was a more intimate house and better suited to his three-character play. The Abbey is almost twice the size of the Gate.
 "Beautifully wrought and exquisitely written," wrote David Nowlan in The Irish Times, the most influential newspaper among Dublin theatergoers. A "deeply moving and heart-rending piece of theater," wrote Lorcan Roche in The Irish Independent, the country's most widely circulated paper.
 The first notices by London critics were also highly favorable. Michael Coveney said on BBC radio, "This has restored Friel, put him back on course." Claire Armitstead of The Guardian called the play "a searing new piece, stuffed with portent."
 "Molly" has only three actors, each of whom tells the story of a 40-year-old blind woman in Ballybeg, Mr. Friel's usual village, and the results of an operation to restore her sight. The actors do not interact with one another; they narrate intermittently to the audience from a darkly colored set by Joe Vanek that seems to reflect Molly's affliction as well as the motives of two men, her husband, Frank, and her surgeon, Mr. Rice.
 The title role is played by Catherine Byrne, who was in the casts of both "Lughnasa" and "Tennessee." Molly, who as a child was never sent to a therapeutic institution because her father was too cheap, has adjusted to her blindness, held a job in a health center, learned the beauty of flowers by smell and touch and taken sensuous pleasure in swimming. In a reference to an exhilarating dance scene in "Lughnasa," Mr. Friel has Molly recall how she danced wildly, though blindly, around her house.
 
A Follower of Berkeley
 Her husband, Frank, played by Mark Lambert, is a garrulous, unemployed pursuer of failed enterprises, like the breeding of Iranian goats, which, because they are in a permanent state of jet lag, must be fed at odd times. Frank adopts Molly's blindness as a new project for his own ego. He also delivers, quite humorously, the playwright's philosophical musings on physical and spiritual blindness, referring to the thesis of the 18th-century Irish philosopher George Berkeley, that nothing exists unless it is actually perceived. In "Tennessee," some critics thought, the philosophy was nailed awkwardly into the dialogue; in "Molly," the philosophy gets laughs.
 The surgeon, played by T. P. McKenna, has a practice that has shrunk since his wife left him. The retinal operation is to revive his career and sense of self-worth. Molly goes along, more out of curiosity than any deep need to regain her vision.
 The operation works; the two men gloat. But Molly finds the visible world frightening: objects seem to jump up at her; the world moves too fast. Gradually, she slips back into sightlessness, which, the experts say, may be physical or may be her refusal to acknowledge what she can see. The men drift off. At the end of the play, Molly seems to express Mr. Friel's mild scolding of those who disliked his philosophizing in "Wonderful Tennessee."
 Recalling the surgeon's questions, Molly says: "Oh my God, he's asking you profound questions about good and evil and about the source of knowledge and about big mystical issues! Careful! Don't make a fool of yourself! And of course all the poor man wanted to know was how much vision I had."

HEADLINE: Teaching the Next Generation to Give of Themselves;
Family Foundations Take On the Task of Getting the Young Interested in
Philanthropy

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
As children, generations of Rockefeller offspring were introduced to philanthropy with encouragement to put nickels and dimes from their modest allowances in the collection basket passed at church.
 Thousands of families with much smaller and newer fortunes -- the Rockefellers of Main Street -- are also looking ahead to the next generation, making sure the philanthropic spirit is instilled in their children. 
What is at stake is who will take charge of 24,000 family foundations that gave away $6 billion last year, an amount that accounts for 75 percent of all foundation grants.
 Getting young people interested in philanthropy -- whether to create their own charities, serve on foundation boards or decide where to donate money -- is important for another reason, said Dr. James A. Joseph, president of the Council on Foundations, the trade association for the country's 36,000 corporate and private foundations.
 Young people stand to inherit $6 trillion to $8 trillion in the next 30 years, he said, citing a widely used projection, which is based on Federal surveys of household wealth, devised by a Cornell University economist, Dr. Robert Avery.
 To make sure nothing is left to chance for the next generation, philanthropists are adopting a variety of tactics, including these:
 *Ruth Cummings Sorensen, a granddaughter of the philanthropist Nathan Cummings, is shepherding her 8- and 9-year-old children to Israel, where the three will study Hebrew and teach English to Ethiopian Jews for a year.
 *Katie Nord-Peterson of the Nord Family Foundation has composed and illustrated a book of verse for her 4-year-old son, likening philanthropy to an apple tree that gives shade, fruit and seeds to perpetuate its usefulness.
 *The Frey Foundation of Michigan has created an adjunct board with a small budget so third-generation Freys will learn about making grants.
 *A number of foundation leaders, including Peter C. Goldmark Jr., president of the Rockefeller Foundation, act as informal mentors to young people with inherited wealth.
 
New Patterns
 Most family philanthropies are small, with endowments under $5 million. A few, like the Pews of Philadelphia or the McKnights of Minneapolis, are in the billion-dollar class.
 The young will be less tied to conventional patterns of giving than their parents or grandparents, Dr. Joseph said.
 The Florence V. Burden Foundation, in New York, is a case in point. Mrs. Burden, a member of the Vanderbilt family, created the foundation in 1967 to work in two fields, aging and criminal justice. Today, reflecting the wider interests of its third- and fourth-generations, the philanthropy's $13 million in assets also help people with AIDS, battered women and abused children.
 "We support non-pretty issues like child sexual abuse that others won't touch," said Margaret Burden Childs, who is co-chairwoman of the foundation. "In the old days, we just sat and deferred to our elders, without having input. Now there is no idea we cannot bring to the table and we treat each other's ideas with respect."
 Mrs. Burden, who was in her 40's before she was brought into the foundation, does not want the same thing to happen again. So she is already grooming her grandson, Donald Arthur Macdonald 3d, who is 12. "I'm pummeling, I'm flogging him to come visit interesting community organizations we support," she said.
 
'Least Bureaucratic'
 The Norman Foundation, in Manhattan, is another family philanthropy made up of grandchildren and great-grandchildren of Aaron E. Norman, an early partner in the Sears, Roebuck & Company merchandising empire.
 "We have terrible meetings," his grandson, Frank A. Weil, an investment banker and the foundation's president, said with obvious relish. "We interrupt each other, we don't listen sometimes. We are the least bureaucratic foundation around."
 The Norman Foundation was an early supporter of the civil rights movement and continues to promote voter registration and to finance organizations upholding the legal rights of immigrants, people with disabilities, lesbian mothers seeking custody, battered women and environmental advocates.
 "We help people deal with institutions that control their lives but over which they have little control," Mr. Weil said. "That's our theme."
 The Cummings Foundation's interests range far beyond those of its founder, Nathan Cummings, a Canadian-born merchant who built a small food distribution company into the Sara Lee Corporation. Mr. Cummings was content to be an arts patron and to write checks for medical research and Jewish charities.
 The foundation, which has $300 million in assets, has its headquarters in a 100-year-old loft building overlooking Lincoln Center. The headquarters serves as a handsomely decorated showcase for its current involvement in the contemporary arts, health, the environment and multiculturalism.
 
Bringing Family Together
 After Mr. Cummings's death in 1985, his heirs agreed to build on his interests in Jewish life and to encourage spiritual harmony with other cultures. They sent Jewish scholars to visit the Dalai Lama and brought Tibetan scholars to stay at Jewish summer camps in this country. They help rekindle Jewish culture in the former Soviet Union, assisting congregations and religious schools. They support efforts by black and Jewish academics to tackle anti-Semitism.
 Working together in the foundation has brought the widely scattered relatives closer as a family, said Mrs. Sorenson, who is taking her children to work in Israel.
 "I love this work," she said. "I want my children to understand and share, hoping they will get the bug."
 Young people have a different approach to philanthropy than their parents or grandparents, said Elizabeth J. McCormack, who has been an adviser to several generations of Rockefellers, and is chairman of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation of Chicago.
 Older generations were more interested in creating and supporting institutions in research and the arts, she said. "Younger members want to be engaged directly in the activities they help finance," she said. "They want hands-on experience. They are more committed to causes than to institutions."
 
Building Partnerships
 As a teen-ager, Peggy Dulany accompanied her father, David A. Rockefeller, on his trips abroad as the chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank. "Because I was a wide-eyed kid, I could ask questions of government officials or bankers with impunity."
 Then, fresh out of high school, she spent a summer in Brazil working in a health clinic in Rio de Janeiro and lived with a family in a favela, a squatter settlement. "This was my key formative experience," she said, "discovering how people with few material resources used creative energy to survive." It led eventually to her establishing the Synergos Institute, in Manhattan, to generate economic development by building partnerships in 20 countries between poor, grass-roots groups and donors and policy-makers.
 Steven C. Rockefeller, a professor of religion at Middlebury College in Vermont, remembers laboring over an account book for his father, showing his purchases and charitable spending, a family tradition going back to John D. Rockefeller Sr.
 His children have had other reminders of family philanthropy, including the credo of John D. Rockefeller Jr., which they saw carved into granite at Rockefeller Center's channel gardens. Steven Rockefeller recites his grandfather's words from memory: "I believe that every right implies a responsibility; every opportunity, an obligation. Every possession, a duty . . ."
 
The Rise of Consultants
 The younger Rockefellers have access to a staff of philanthropic advisers, headed by Charles D. Terry. But small family foundations often make do with little professional help. Increasingly, they use consultants to avoid the administrative costs of an office or staff.
 They can reach out, for example, to H. Peter Koroff, who describes himself as a "plain vanilla businessman" who has served on 29 community-organization boards. Based in Boston, he advises foundations, corporations and wealthy individuals through his nonprofit organization, the Philanthropic Initiative.
 The Melville Charitable Trust, one of 25 family philanthropies he serves, is based on a fortune from retailing. The foundation concentrates exclusively on fighting homelessness in Connecticut and the directors spent six months with Mr. Koroff's staff immersing themselves in the subject. They put money into preventive measures like job training and work to overcome neighborhood resistance to low-cost housing. They provided a $1.3 million loan for a shelter in Stamford for women and children that offers counseling and other services.
 "We have supported efforts by the homeless to let the public know they are not 'bums' or 'welfare cheats' but real people in trouble," said Frank Melville, the president of the trust, who is devoting his retirement years to the philanthropy.
 His son, Stephen, joined, and other relatives may do so but only if they demonstrate serious interest, he said."That's not our approach," he said, if they are not serious.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S LIFE WORTH?

BYLINE: By ERIC P. NASH; Eric P. Nash is a researcher for this magazine.

 BODY:
AMERICANS LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT THE BODY is not a commodity and that no price tag can be put on a human life. American law, in fact, forbids the selling of body parts. But at a time when few subjects are sacrosanct, legal scholars and doctors are wrestling with such thorny issues as compensation for families of deceased organ donors and financial incentives to increase the supply of available organs. And this leads to the inevitable question: What is the value of a human life?
If a life were seen as the sum of the salable body parts, then in countries where the sale of human organs is not so much legal as tolerated the value of a human being is upward of $300,000. The value of the hormones alone makes each of us a potential $6 million man or woman. 
 It is, of course, still possible for a woman to create a new life without having to pay anyone a cent. But for women who require heavy-duty medical assistance, the cost of another life can range from $1,800 (for artificial insemination) to $36,000 (for another woman to carry the would-be new life; which comes out to $5.35 an hour, based on a 280-day pregnancy) to $800,000 (for six cycles of in vitro fertilization for a couple in which the woman is over 40 and the man has a low sperm count).
It wasn't that long ago -- 1969, to be precise -- when we were all worth 98 cents. That was the value of the body's chemical components: five pounds of calcium, a pound and a half of phosphorous, some potassium, sulfur and sodium and a pinch of magnesium, iron, copper and iodine. With inflation factored in, the value of these chemicals today is $8.84.
Since everything is relative, the value put on your life should anything untoward happen to you depends on the amount of money you make, whether you have children, whether you show incredible promise and so on. In New York, when it's violent, a life can be worth a bomber jacket ($350), a pair of sneakers ($100) or as little as $2. Last June, the kidnappers of Alfredo Harp Helu, a billionaire Mexican banker, reportedly asked for just under $30 million. In rural China, a man can "buy" a wife by offering her "owner" about $1,000.
An ethicist might say you can put a value on human life but you shouldn't. A theologian would say you can't, although a careful reader of the Bible would find that in Ecclesiastes even the preacher noted: "Money answereth all things."

HEADLINE: If You Film It There, the Tourists Will Surely Come

BYLINE: By ANN HORNADAY 

DATELINE: WINTERSET, Iowa

 BODY:
FILMING OF "THE BRIDGES OF Madison County," starring Clint Eastwood, will not start until the beginning of September, but already the denizens of Madison County, Iowa, have their doors, hearts and tills open. The best-selling novel on which the film is based has been a boon for this quaint and stately region of south central Iowa, which has come to enjoy a cult popularity heretofore reserved for Graceland and the grassy knoll.
But with the arrival of Hollywood, the residents of Winterset (pop. 4,200), the county seat, are looking forward to a further economic boom. Given the experiences of other small towns that have served as locations for movies like "A River Runs Through It" (Bozeman, Mont.) and "Field of Dreams" (Dyersville, Iowa), Winterset can only hope that tourists will come with cameras, maps and money long after the production's last Winnebago has fled down Route 169. 
 But first there is money to be made from the production itself. To accomodate the expected infestation of up to 100 movie stars, dolly grips, makeup artists and other members of the cinematic enterprise, the town is putting its best foot forward. Ten residents have offered their houses for rent (no takers yet). Sherry Ellis, the executive vice president of the Chamber of Commerce, has put together a compendium of services ranging from dry cleaning to wallpaper hanging. She also compiled a guide to more than 230 local flea markets and antique shops, "which should be an asset as far as prop hunting goes," she said.
No doubt such hospitality will be worth Ms. Ellis's while: when a major motion picture is filmed on location outside Hollywood, the surrounding area usually reaps millions. During the filming of "Steel Magnolias," for example, $4 million was spent in Natchitoches, La., according to Roger Riley, a professor of recreation and parks administration at Illinois State University who has made a specialty of studying the economic impact of filming on communities. "Dances With Wolves" infused the state of South Dakota with $12 million in production money, and $10 million was spent in British Columbia during the filming of of "Roxanne."
And Winterset has already reaped income from "Bridges." Robert James Waller's book, on the New York Times best-seller list for two years, has increased local retail business by up to 30 percent, according to Ms. Ellis, thanks to thousands of romantic tourists retracing the ill-fated steps of Robert Kincaid, a rugged yet sensitive National Geographic photographer with a penchant for naming trucks, and Francesca Johnson, the lonely farm wife who falls in love with him and then carries a torch for 30 years. In 1993, 40 tour buses wended their way through Winterset, whose previous claim to fame had been that it was John Wayne's birthplace; this year, more than 150 are booked to come through. Bridge-o-mania includes T-shirts, six books by Mr. Waller, a video called "The Magic of Madison County," and Mr. Waller's CD "The Ballads of Madison County," as well as postcards and books of local poetry, all featuring the county's six covered bridges (one of which sits on dry land in a park in Winterset).
Most locals agree that the Northside Cafe is the model for the cafe in which Robert is sneered at by moralistic locals in the book. At the Northside on a recent summer morning, the regular 9 o'clock kaffeeklatsch of Wayne Griffith, Bernard Wight and Jim Breeding seemed optimistic but blase about the impending arrival of stars and film makers. (The role of Francesca was still uncast as of last week, with the top candidates thought to include Meryl Streep, Isabella Rossellini and Jessica Lange.) " 'Cold Turkey' was a good experience," said Mr. Wight, referring to the last movie filmed in Winterset, in 1970, about a town that tries to stop smoking. He doubts however that many people will want to move out for duration, in order to rent homes to the film makers.
Ms. Ellis of the chamber of commerce predicts that most of the cast and crew will rent in nearby Des Moines. "We only have 47 hotel rooms here," she said. (Lindy's Motel, in which Robert Kincaid is said to have stayed while wooing Francesca, has been shuttered, and along with it the chance for some poetic closure.)
Not surprisingly, Winterset is taking many of its cues from Dyersville, about 200 miles to the northeast, where "Field of Dreams" was filmed in 1988. Although that town of 3,500 didn't profit enormously from the actual production (most goods and services were brought in from Dubuque), the Dyersville Chamber of Commerce was prescient enough to buy the merchandising rights to the movie from Universal. "Now we have a full scale T-shirt silkscreening shop," said Jacque Rahe, executive director of the the Dyersville Chamber of Commerce, "and we started the whole souvenir bit." (According to Ms. Ellis, no merchandising deal with Warner Brothers, which is producing "The Bridges of Madison County," has been agreed to yet.)
Since the release of "Field of Dreams" in 1989, Ms. Rahe estimates that at least $2.5 million has been spent by tourists coming to Dyersville. The most popular attraction is the ball field itself, the subject of some contention after the film wrapped. The film's baseball diamond was built on land belonging to two farmers, Don Lansing and Al Ameskamp. When filming was completed, Mr. Lansing kept the baseball diamond on his half as a tourist attraction; Mr. Ameskamp plowed his part of the field back under to grow corn. "My wife, Rita, wasn't too happy," Mr. Ameskamp says. "But I thought, 'Who the heck comes back to a movie site?' "
True to the movie, however, the film makers built it, and the tourists came. When movie fans flocked to the road on which Mr. Lansing and Mr. Ameskamp live, Mr. Ameskamp got the hint. "In a roundabout way, the public politely asked me to put it back," he said, referring to the rest of the diamond. "I decided I made a mistake. I apologized plenty for it."

THE RESTORED "FIELD of Dreams" movie site has attracted up to 50,000 visitors a year, some of whom -- imagine -- turn up without bat or ball. "Rita said, 'We can fix that, by gosh,' " said Mr. Ameskamp. "So for a buck you can rent a ball and a bat and go have your fun out there. Strangers play together like they've known each other all their lives. About this time of the year, it's a constant ball game, morning 'til night."
The closest counterpart to "The Field of Dreams" baseball diamond in "The Bridges of Madison County" is the Roseman Bridge, the covered bridge where Robert and Francesca conduct their most important trysts. Wyman R. Wilson, a Farm Bureau Insurance representative, has lived next to the Roseman Bridge for 24 years. "I met with the 'Field of Dreams' people in Dyersville, to get an idea of what to expect," Mr. Wilson said. "I'd like to think I have a better handle on it than they did," he said in a reference to Mr. Ameskamp and Mr. Lansing.
Last June, Mr. Wilson opened the Covered Bridge Shop, a tiny tumbledown souvenir shop barely visible through the trees. Inside can be found Roseman Bridge caps, T-shirts, teddy bears, as well as mugs, key chains and cards. A "genuine piece of the Roseman Bridge, when Robert Kincaid and Francesca Johnson were there," sells for $7.50. (The wood was harvested when the bridge was renovated in 1992.) A vial of Roseman Bridge sand costs $1.
Last month, Mr. Wilson got the news that the film's director, Bruce Beresford, had decided against casting the Roseman Bridge as the Roseman Bridge. (This month, Mr. Beresford dropped out of the movie; a Warner Brothers spokesman said no new director had been signed as of last week.) Apparently, the Roseman Bridge cannot hold the heavy equipment necessary for filming; a steel bridge is being shedded over with wood to approximate the old Iowa covered bridge. Will that affect his plans for the shop? "I'll tell you what," he said cagily, "the mere fact that they're doing the movie isn't going to hurt me any." Indeed, the first two weeks after opening his shop, Mr. Wilson's guest book boasted hundreds of names.

 Because the cult popularity of the book is already so high, expectations are that "The Bridges of Madison County" will exceed "Field of Dreams" in local profit. "This is going to be very big," said Dr. Riley, who is undertaking a study of the economic impact of the production of "The Bridges of Madison County" and the resulting tourism on Winterset and its environs.
According to Dr. Riley, after "Deliverance" was released in 1972, the film fostered a flourishing raft and expedition business in Rayburn County, Ga., where it was filmed. (And "Deliverance" was a film about people being attacked on a scenic river.) After "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" was released in 1977, the number of visitors to the Devils Tower National Monument in Wyoming increased by 75 percent. Even more significantly, he added, "When they did a survey 12 years later, more than 20 percent of visitors said their initial source of interest was the movie."
Since "A River Runs Through It" was filmed on the Madison, Gallatin and Jefferson rivers in Montana (standing in for the Blackfoot River), the increase in fly fishers to the area has been palpable. "I get a number of calls from people who say 'Oh, we saw where "A River Runs Through It" was filmed in Bozeman,' " said Racene Friede, the Bozeman, Mont., convention and visitors' bureau coordinator. "And they're interested in seeing the actual Blackfoot River." Loni Stimac, the director of the Montana film office, said, "The new Meryl Streep movie, 'The River Wild,' which is about whitewater rafting, was filmed here. We've spoken with the whitewater rafting companies in the area and told them to expect an increase when the movie comes out" in September.

 So important have movie-induced tourism dollars become that the Great Smoky Mountains Railway in Dillsboro, N.C., has sued Warner Brothers for lost tourist revenue on "The Fugitive." As it turns out, the railroad agreed to let the studio film the train crash scene in Dillsboro on the condition that the Great Smoky Mountains Railway be given a screen credit; the credit did not appear. Orville Coward, the attorney for the railway, estimated that at least $10 million in revenue was lost to the railway, which is a tourist attraction as well as a working railroad. A Warner Brothers spokesman refused to comment on the suit.
Over the next five years, Dr. Riley and Carlton Van Doren, a professor at the department of recreation, parks and tourism sciences at Texas A&M University, will trace economic development Madison County. Dr. Riley predicts that the tourists pulled by "Bridges" "will have a significant impact not only on Winterset and Madison County but also Iowa."
Dr. Riley is also interested in how Winterset residents feel about the coming invasion. "What you usually see is an initial euphoria," he said. "Then, after a while, they start getting ticked off. We'll survey them every two or three years to see if this euphoria changes to tolerance and then if tolerance changes to actual resentment, which has been documented in other tourist destinations like Florida."
But Iowans may be too repressed (or plumb nice) to harbor actual hostility toward tourists. "I suspect that what will happen in Winterset is that euphoria will gradually change to indifference," Dr. Riley predicted.

HEADLINE: Reviving a True Classic on West 42d Street

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
ONE DOES NOT SIMPLY VISIT THE NEW Amsterdam Theater. One journeys there. Yes, it can be reached easily enough, through an entrance in the base of a small office building at 214 West 42d Street, just west of Times Square. Yet in the ripe lusciousness of its ornament, the sinuous twining of its floral forms, the generosity of its public rooms and the sheer spectacle of its volume, the 91-year-old Art Nouveau landmark is far removed from the tattered, brazen, razor-edged city outside.
Few people, however, emerge from the long-deserted playhouse without thinking that this distance ought to be bridged, that there must a way to restore the cavernous ruin to the enchanted garden it once was. 
 It may prove to be the theater's salvation that one of those people was Michael D. Eisner, chairman and chief executive of the Walt Disney Company.
His guide was the architect Robert A. M. Stern, who heads the design team for the planned refurbishment of 42d Street, a project in which he had been trying to interest Disney for some time, without success.
On the spur of the moment one Friday evening in April 1993, the Disney chief accepted Mr. Stern's invitation to a tour of the New Amsterdam. The next morning, they trooped through the crumbling interior, where plaster chunks had fallen scabrously amid colonies of wavy-capped white fungi.
"Walking through the New Amsterdam was like going through a dark, damp and musty cavern," Mr. Eisner recalled, while Mr. Stern likened it to a scene from "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."
Mr. Eisner said he was "astonished that this once-grand theater could have become so run-down."
"Yet I sensed the grandeur that it once had," he said, "and I thought, 'Wouldn't it be marvelous if this theater, and this whole district, could be brought back to their former glorious stature.' "
Ten months later, Mr. Eisner was back in New York, this time at City Hall, to announce Disney's plan: lease the New Amsterdam from New York State for 49 years, restore and modernize the two-balcony house with the help of a $21 million low-interest government loan, increase seating to 1,810 from 1,600 and stage live productions, either new shows or adaptations like the enormously successful "Beauty and the Beast."
No decision has been made yet on what to do with the devastated shell upstairs that was once a 700-seat rooftop theater called the Aerial Gardens.
And Disney may yet back out of the entire deal if the cost runs much higher than the current $29 million estimate. The Tishman Urban Development Corporation and the architectural firm of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates are now readying detailed plans that will arm Disney by year's end with enough information to make a decision.
Should Disney go ahead, audiences might assemble under the New Amsterdam's 80-foot-high dome in September 1996 for the first time in 14 years. Until then, The New York Times will revisit the theater from time to time to record the project as it unfolds.

 "It's a great spectacle house and Disney will use it for spectacles," said the architect Hugh Hardy. "In that way, it is a tremendously benign re-use: for big, popular, schmaltzy entertainment. It wasn't built for high art."
But it was built -- every square inch of it -- to dazzle the theatergoer. The architects were Henry Beaumont Herts and Hugh Tallant (designers of the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the Lyceum Theater on West 45th Street, among other landmarks) and the artists were legion.
"When you walk in, you realize why this theater was so prominent," said Laurie Beckelman, chairwoman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. "It was pure fantasy. That's why you went to the theater. This kind of atmosphere no one could create in your daily life. It was like walking through the mirror to Wonderland."
And Disney aims to re-create that sensation. "The experience we would like our guests to have is that the New Amsterdam is beyond their expectations," said David L. Malmuth, vice president for corporate real estate at the Disney Development Company. "Bringing it back to its former beauty will be astonishing in itself."
Who needs mouse ears? After all, the New Amsterdam already has 16 peacock sculptures by St. John Issing, each one 5 feet high, perched in vines around the proscenium arch. Popeyed monkeys, industrious squirrels, bashful pelicans and vigilant owls nestle in the green-glazed terra-cotta balustrades on the grand staircases by Thorbjorn Bassoe. From the newel posts peer the haunting visages of Shakespearean characters.
In the lobby, Siegfried does violent battle with a ratchet-backed, gape-jawed dragon in one of a dozen friezes by Roland Hinton Perry. Other panels show the languorous Titania snuggling with an ass-headed Bottom, Macbeth confronting the witches and Hamlet encountering his father's ghost.
Surprises abound. Over the entrance to the foyer lurks "Progress," an allegorical female figure who cradles a sailing ship in her arms, with stars and sun rays behind her. In the reception room at the back of the auditorium is a fireplace practically large enough to live in. No less ample is the smoking room downstairs, whose elliptical colonnade is linked by intertwined ribbons of stone.
Complementing the abundant details are remarkable spatial qualities. Most theaters have only a narrow passage at the back of the orchestra but the New Amsterdam has a grand promenade with a rounded series of vaults and arched openings through which tantalizing vistas can be glimpsed.
Thanks to the stylistic curves of Art Nouveau and the absence of supporting pillars under the balconies, there is an organic wholeness to the auditorium, a seamlessness in the junction of walls and ceiling.
Above the proscenium is a richly allegorical 45-foot-wide mural by Robert Blum and Albert Beck Wenzell. Nudes, knights and a small menagerie are used to depict Poetry, Truth, Falsehood, Melancholy, Romance, Love and Death. Above the mural, the dome begins.
Up near the dome, at the top of the second balcony, the oxygen seems thinner and the height is dizzying. Yet the stage appears almost close enough to touch. This sensation of intimacy is achieved through the use of overscaled decorations, which tend to make the giant room seem smaller.
Impressive as its design may be, there is even more to the New Amsterdam -- a spirit so strong that it is sensed even by government officials, who are supposed to be unsentimental about such things.
"That's the magic of the place -- that feeling of time," said Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Development Project Inc. Her agency, a subsidiary of the New York State Urban Development Corporation, took over the New Amsterdam in 1992.
"You can't wipe that away," she said. "The ladies in bustles. The fat old men with their gleaming tuxes and cigar smoke. The chorus girls. You've got to be able to feel its ghosts. You should be able to walk in and remember."

 Architectural remembrance cannot be too literal, however. "You have to do a restoration in a way that feels authentic," Mr. Hardy said. For instance, he noted, if lighting levels for the house matched those of 1903, modern audiences would think it far too dim because "our appetite has been so increased."
As another example, if public circulation were authentically re-created, patrons holding the cheaper seats in the second balcony would enter by a small door on 41st Street, avoiding the lobby, foyer and promenade. Such economic segregation will not do today.
Also, there is no way for disabled patrons to reach the balconies. And there are not nearly enough washrooms for women. At the time the New Amsterdam was constructed, the powder room was literally that -- a place to powder one's nose.
"The society in which that theater was built isn't ours," Mr. Hardy said.
True enough, although the review in The New York Times of "A Midsummer Night's Dream," the production that opened the New Amsterdam in October 1903, bears a striking parallel to what contemporary critics said about the abundance of special effects in "Beauty and the Beast," after its April premiere at the Palace Theater.
The Times described "an unceasing showing of the things that mechanical skill could accomplish," which "in many ways charmed and delighted the senses of the listeners, though it sometimes seemed almost as if it overburdened and wearied them."
Florenz Ziegfeld moved his Follies to the New Amsterdam in 1913 and the revue played almost every year until 1927, accompanied by Ziegfeld's Midnight Frolic in the Aerial Gardens upstairs. In those days, the theater's ornamental abundance was easily matched by the talent on or behind the stage. One single edition of the Ziegfeld Follies, in 1918, involved Irving Berlin, Eddie Cantor, W. C. Fields, Marilyn Miller and Will Rogers, with scenic decorations by Joseph Urban.
The New Amsterdam was the last legitimate theater on 42d Street in 1937 when it bowed to motion pictures. The side boxes, which bore designations like heliotrope, violet and buttercup, were removed. (They are to be restored by Disney.) "A Midsummer Night's Dream," this time the Warner Brothers version, inaugurated the theater's 45-year career as a movie house.
The Nederlander Organization, one of three major theater owners in the city, acquired the New Amsterdam in 1982, anticipating the rebirth of 42d Street under a government-sponsored project in which four enormous new office towers would be constructed at the Times Square crossroads, beginning in 1985.
But the theater renovation went seriously awry in 1983, when work was begun in the Aerial Gardens for Peter Brook's production of "La Tragedie de Carmen."
"They discovered that the steel was rotten up there," Mr. Hardy said. "So they opened up the roof to look at the steel. The engineer said, 'You've got to replace the steel.' The Nederlanders said, 'Forget it,' and all work stopped. That's when the rains came in."
"It wasn't benign neglect," Mr. Hardy said. "They walked away from the whole project."
Not at all, said Robert Nederlander, president of the organization. "What we were really waiting for was the city or the state to proceed on 42d Street," he said. "They ran into a whole series of problems. This caused a delay of a substantial period of time. Producers at that time were unwilling to put shows into the New Amsterdam."
Meanwhile, he said, the Nederlander Organization spent "significant amounts of money" to maintain the structure in the years it was empty.
Whether the Nederlanders turned their backs or were paralyzed by the failure of the redevelopment plan to materialize, there is no question that the New Amsterdam deteriorated on their watch.
"The main theater was ready for a production in 1982 and a couple of years later it looked like it was ready to be demolished," Ms. Beckelman said.
Jack L. Goldstein, special assistant to the president of Actors' Equity Association and a theater-preservation advocate, said that "the darkest hour for me was when I walked in there and was shocked to see mushrooms growing."
In August 1992, the state took control of the New Amsterdam and set about to stabilize the building. The roof was patched, the facade was repointed, windows and doors were sealed, rubble was carted out, a net was built to catch plaster falling from the dome and a giant gas-fired heater was installed in the orchestra pit to dry out a decade's worth of dampness. Workers had to shovel snow off the roof last winter after the drains froze.
Mr. Malmuth, of Disney, remembered his first visit. "I was both excited and terrified," he said. "You walk through and think, 'Isn't it fantastic?' It doesn't take much imagination to picture opening night in your mind's eye. But it will take so much work to get there."
One of the biggest changes to the auditorium would be the expansion of orchestra seating into the promenade. This plan was approved by the landmarks commission a dozen years ago when it was proposed by the Nederlanders, said Brian Hogg of the commission staff, who is reviewing the project.

SOME CHALLENGES ARE AS plain as the word "ASBESTOS,"
printed in swirling Art Nouveau letters on the fire curtain. The presence of the fire-retardant material, once a selling point, is now an environmental anathema. But Ms. Robertson said thankfully that "the percentage of asbestos is low."
Far more worrisome is structural integrity. "There's a lot of rotten steel up in the air," Mr. Hardy said, meaning the parapets and main roof trusses overhead. "It's rusted away to the point where it no longer has stability and tensile strength." The replacement cost is already roughly $1 million more than anticipated, he said.
Cost is not the only potential deal-breaker. Disney will not proceed unless there are some substantial new neighbors on 42d Street. The fate of the office towers, construction of which was officially postponed two years ago, "does not affect us one way or the other," Mr. Malmuth said. "But some life on those corners is important to us."
"The judgment we were trying to make was whether this was the right time to make a bold move," he said. "Those are tough calls to make because you could be very wrong."
Ms. Robertson said Disney's timing will be just right. Two weeks ago, the state reached agreement with the office tower developers for an interim refurbishment plan. She said the state is in "serious negotiations" over 42d Street sites with four entertainment companies, including the Tussauds Group of London, the owners and operators of Madame Tussaud's wax exhibition.
The New Victory Theater, opposite the New Amsterdam, is to reopen next year with performances and programs for young audiences. The Warner Music Group is understood to be interested in the Selwyn Theater, several doors west, as a studio. And eight teams, including one composed of Disney and the Tishman Realty and Construction Company, responded to the state's request for developers interested in building a hotel on Eighth Avenue, between 42d and 43d Streets, where pornography now reigns. Disney is also pursuing the idea of a "megastore" nearby, but ultimately it is only one of many players on 42d Street.
"One of the exciting and scary parts of the project," Mr. Malmuth said, "is the recognition that we won't control what we call our guests' experience beyond the theater entrance. It's a new thing for us -- to be part of a real city."

HEADLINE: SNET and Its Union, Tennis and 2,500 Jobs

BYLINE: By JACK CAVANAUGH 

 BODY:
IS a public utility company justified in paying eight tennis players a half million dollars for a three-day exhibition in New Haven when it is in the process of eliminating 2,500 jobs in the state?
No, say officials of the union that represents most of Connecticut's telephone company workers, but, yes, says a spokesperson for the Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation, better known as SNET. 
 The exhibition event, known as the SNET Classic, is scheduled for Aug. 24, 26 and 27 at the Connecticut Tennis Center, near the Yale Bowl. And while Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and New Haven city officials have hailed the event as a boon to the area, others have questioned the wisdom of further enriching a tennis multimillionaire like Steffi Graf when, they say, the money could better be spent to prevent ongoing layoffs.
"Where do they get the half-million dollars to pay the tennis players when they're eliminating so many jobs?" asked Daniel C. Keating, president of the Connecticut Union of Telephone Workers Inc., which represents the vast majority of SNET's employees. "To us, it's strange."
 
The Women's Lineup
 Graf, the world's top-ranked women's player has won more than $1 million in prize money this year and is in a field that includes five other players in the top 20: Lindsay Davenport, Jana Novotna, Gabriela Sabatini, Mary Joe Fernandez and Zina Garrison Jackson.
All eight players -- Brenda Schultz and Chanda Rubin are also appearing -- will receive guarantees, along with bonuses depending on how well they do in the single elimination event, which is not part of the Women's Tennis Association tour. Tournament officials would not say how the $500,000 will be distributed, but Graf is almost certain to receive the largest individual share.
During a 28-player exhibition tournament in Mahwah, N.J., last month, Graf received "appearance money" of nearly $400,000, along with her winner's purse of $40,000, for playing four matches in four days. The 25-year-old German star's overall annual income has been estimated at $10 million, with most of the money coming from commercial endorsements.
SNET is also a sponsor of the Volvo men's tournament, which opens tomorrow at the tennis center. That tournament, which was moved to New Haven from Stratton Mountain, Vt., in 1990, offers more than $1 million in prize money, including $152,000 to the winner. The 56-player Volvo tournament, which runs through next Sunday, includes Andre Agassi, Boris Becker, Ivan Lendl, Michael Stich, Petr Korda and defending champion Andrei Medvedev. SNET is also a sponsor of the annual Greater Hartford Open men's professional golf tournament.
 
Rallying in Protest
 As for the SNET Classic, Mr. Keating said that members of his union would hold rallies outside the tennis center for all three days of the women's tennis event. "We hope to have as many as a few thousand members picketing to let people know how we stand," he said. "We're not trying to hurt the city of New Haven, but we want our position known."
A spokeswoman for SNET, Beverly Levy, said she sees nothing incongruous about sponsoring the SNET Classic while at the same time eliminating jobs. "The tournament is good for our business," Ms. Levy said. "It's an ideal advertising and marketing opportunity for SNET. And over the long term, it can help make our company stronger and create more jobs."
Under a restructuring plan, SNET has eliminated 1,000 jobs over the last year -- including both management and union-covered positions -- and plans to eliminate another 1,500 by January of 1996. "The downsizing is necessary for us to survive because of our competition," Ms. Levy said. "And that competition drives us to be more aggressive in our approach. We've got to win over more customers, and the tennis tournament is one way to do it. It helps give us exposure, and it also enables us to showcase a lot of our products right at the site."
 
Focus of Media Attention
 Whether the Volvo tournament and the SNET Classic do indeed benefit the New Haven economy is arguable. The events do help focus some media attention on the city, but, contrary to predictions by the Volvo promoter, Jewell Productions Ltd. and boosters of the event, interviews with restaurant owners, hotel managers and other business people indicate that few of the spectators venture into the downtown area. In general, the local business people say, residual economic benefits from the Volvo tournament have been nil.
Indeed, the only proven beneficiaries, apart from concessionaires and part-time employes at the tennis center, have been the city of New Haven and the state, which receive a percentage of ticket revenues. On the other hand, the tennis stadium, the second-largest in the United States after the Louis Armstrong Stadium at the National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadow, Queens, home of the U.S. Open, was built with state bond money at a cost of approximately $15 million. But for more than three years it sat unused, except for the Volvo tournament, which, including the qualifying event, lasts just nine days.
This summer, there were finally some signs of life. Since July 2, five concerts have been held at the center, and three more are scheduled -- with Julio Iglesias on Aug. 28, Alan Jackson on Sept. 1 and James Taylor on Sept. 2. Previously, there had been only one concert at the stadium: Crosby, Stills and Nash in June of 1992.
"We're now on our way to amortizing the cost of the stadium," said Mitch Truwit, the executive director of the Tennis Foundation of Connecticut, the nonprofit organization that operates the center. "It's a beautiful venue for concerts and the sound is great. And we're hoping to have many more concerts."
 
Concern About Concerts
 Some residents of the Westville section of New Haven, a quiet residential neighborhood close to the tennis center, had expressed concern about the staging of concerts, citing potential noise and ancillary problems attendant to outdoor musical events. But Mr. Truwit said that the five concerts held had not evoked any complaints. "We've had no incidents of any kind, and there've been no complaints," he said.
Mr. Truwit, who is also executive director of the Baseball Foundation of Connecticut, which serves as a liaison between Yale University and the New Haven Ravens minor league baseball team that plays at Yale Field across from the tennis center, said the foundation would like to see other events staged at the tennis stadium.
"We'll probably have some events held there during the International Special Olympics next year," he said. "And we've also considered boxing and beach volleyball."
While the foundation plays a role in all events held at the tennis center, the tennis tournaments and exhibitions, along with the concerts, are put on by Jewell Productions. Jewell is headed by Jim Westhall, who has been involved with the Volvo tournament since 1971, and Ben and Beau Segal, the father and son who operate the Oakdale Musical Theater in Wallingford.
Plagued with problems during its first few years in New Haven -- bad weather, a rash of early round upsets of high seeded players and a cracked stadium court -- the Volvo had a relatively smooth run last year.
There will be day and evening sessions starting tomorrow, with the final scheduled for next Sunday.
Ticket prices range from $10 tomorrow to $62 for choice seats at the final. Prices for the women's event also start at $10, but top out at $28 on the final day.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Tighter Credit? London Market Yawns

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
IN London's financial markets, it is now considered a sure thing. Having nursed its economy back to some semblance of health, and with signs of possible inflation flickering on the distant horizon, Britain will undoubtedly begin raising interest rates in the next several months.
With the benchmark base rate brought down over the last two years from 12 percent to its current 5.25 percent -- its lowest level in 20 years -- Britain's imminent about-face on monetary policy is hardly a surprise. The United States, whose economic cycle has been running six months to a year ahead of Britain's, began raising rates in February to head off inflationary pressures. The rate-cutting cycle in continental Europe, which has lagged a year or more behind Britain's, is itself drawing to a close, as last week's rate rises in Italy and Sweden demonstrated. 
 Equity markets generally do not like rising interest rates, which tend to siphon capital off into bonds and other rate-sensitive investments. But in this case, analysts said, the London stock market is likely to shrug off the shift to tighter credit, in part because it has been expected for so long that when it comes it will be yesterday's news.
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares closed on Friday at 3,142.3. The index has rallied modestly from just over 2,900 at the beginning of July, after plummeting from a high of 3,520.3 in February, when the Federal Reserve in the United States began nudging rates up.
Analysts said that in addition to having already factored in the effects of a rate rise on the order of half a percentage point before the end of the year, the market has benefited from the solid earnings performance of many British companies.
"Our view has been and remains that in the period from the beginning of February, when the Fed moved, the U.K. equity market has already discounted the interest rate outlook," said Joe Rooney, an equity strategist at Lehman Brothers in London.
"From that point of view, the market won't and shouldn't discount the same event twice over," Mr. Rooney said. "Having made the transition to an earnings driven market, we feel comfortable with the market after this correction."
Indeed, while the London market was jarred somewhat by the unexpected rate rises in Italy and Sweden last week, it remained considerably more calm than its counterparts in continental Europe.
The London market rose four points on Friday, while the DAX index in Frankfurt tumbled 30.6 points, or 1.42 percent, and the CAC-40 index in Paris fell 31.98 points, or 1.57 percent.
Mr. Rooney said the London market could hit 3,250 by the end of the year, and 3,340 12 months from now.
"The U.K. is a very tricky one at the moment, but I'm erring on the optimistic side," said Richard Davidson, an equity strategist at Morgan Stanley in London. "The U.K. is quite clearly going to raise short interest rates before the end of the year, but we have a good earnings, valuation and productivity story."
Mr. Davidson said that the London stock market's price-to-earnings ratio of 15.7 based on projected 1994 earnings still makes it a good buy, as does its dividend yield of 4.4 percent, especially given the low levels of inflation and interest rates. He said retail stocks, such as Storehouse, W. H. Smith and Next, as well as utilities, which have been strong performers, would be attractive plays on the continuing recovery.
Britain has been enjoying a steady if unspectacular recovery. The economy is expected to grow this year by 2.8 percent, and by a similar amount next year. Inflation stood at 2.4 percent in June, with only spotty evidence of any significant upward pressure on prices.
Still, the Bank of England and the Conservative Government seem determined to break Britain's long history of allowing inflation to roar out of control during recoveries. The Government has said it wants to keep inflation below 4 percent.
"The current picture of output growing above trend and inflation continuing to fall remains favorable," the Bank of England said in its August report on inflation. "But if official interest rates were to remain unchanged over the next two years, then it is probable that inflation would gradually rise to a level above the mid-point of the target range."
Those with a positive outlook have history on their side, according to research done by Sushil Wadhwani, an analyst at Goldman Sachs in London.
Mr. Wadhwani looked at the performance of the London market in five previous periods in which rates turned up after hitting a trough. In all five cases -- in 1972, 1975, 1977, 1984 and 1988 -- stocks fell in the month following the upturn in rates. But, in four of the five cases, equities had gained ground a year later. In three of those cases, the gains were substantial, including 22 percent gains in 1984 and 1988.
Merrill Lynch, in a similar study of market performance in 1977, 1984 and 1988, found that equities declined an average of 6.6 percent in the three months following an upturn in rates but rose an average of 25 percent in the first 18 months following the upturns.
"It is not of course the interest-rate rises themselves that cause the equity market to rise," Merrill Lynch said. "Each episode was also associated with strong earnings or dividend growth, which is exactly what we forecast for 1994 and 1995."

Peat Marwick Settles S.& L. Charges, and U.S. Keeps Hunting
 The folks at KPMG Peat Marwick, the nation's fourth-largest accounting firm, got something they understand last week: a number. Dogged like other accountants by uncertain liability for audits of failed savings and loan institutions, the firm settled Federal charges over the crisis for $186.5 million -- a tab of $116,563 for each partner. The payment, mostly covered by insurance, is "an intelligent business decision," said Jon C. Madonna, the firm's chief, and the deal did add up nicely when compared to some other Federal S.& L. settlements by the Big Six. But the Government's figures are pretty nice, too. Federal agencies have collected $2 billion from accountants, lawyers and other professionals from the S.& L. debacle -- half from four big accounting firms. "And the program is still young," a Government spokesman said, with hope. The payments are funneled to institutions made insolvent by the S.& L. crisis.
 
At P.& .G, Profit Follows Flub
 The lesson may be to stick to soap. Tarnished by a $102 million loss in its third quarter from bad derivatives investments, Procter & Gamble regained some shine last week, announcing net earnings of $406 million in its fourth quarter. At 56 cents a share -- up 12 cents from the comparable quarter last year, excluding adjustments -- the results impressed analysts and spurred P.& G.'s chief, Edwin L. Artzt, to write the tale's epitome. "This was a good year," he said, "and if not for the derivatives it would have been a great year." Even more notable: P.& G. achieved its results despite sales not much higher than a year ago.
 
Internet: New Way to Spend!
 Credit card issuers rejoiced last week when some young, intrepid entrepreneurs successfully conducted the first secure retail transaction on the Internet, the global computer network. "Secure" is the key word; without a practical way to keep credit card numbers confidential, businesses will balk at turning the Internet into a major marketplace. Using a scrambling technique known as data encryption, though, tiny Net Market Company of Nashua, N.H., has solved the problem. And what was the pioneering purchase? A compact disk, "Ten Summoners' Tales," by rock musician Sting. Price: $12.48 plus shipping.
 
Disney Turns Interactive
 Built on imagination, the Disney company had nonetheless envisioned little future for itself on the information superhighway. Until last week, that is, when the company announced a venture with three Baby Bells -- Ameritech, BellSouth and Southwestern Bell -- to offer video services to homes. The venture is still vague, with no word on how ownership or profits will be split, but the Bells' reach to 50 million customers in 19 states makes the deal's potential broad. That is, if Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, has really discarded his well-known disdain for the superhighway and believes, as Tinkerbell would surely hope.
 
Valdez Catch: $287 Million
 About 10,000 Alaskan fishermen reeled in nearly $287 million in damages from Exxon last week, courtesy of a Federal jury deliberating over the Valdez oil spill of 1989. But the compensatory award was much closer to Exxon's damage estimate of $113 million than to the fishermen's $895 million goal -- and that's how the paid parties saw it. "It's not what I wanted," said the plaintiffs' lead lawyer. But it's not over till it's over, and the jury in Anchorage will next consider whether Exxon should pay punitive damages for the mishap. The plaintiffs are asking for a whopper: $15 billion.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Rockwell, Russia in Air Plan
 Faster and safer are an odd mix in the world of transportation, but that's what Rockwell International and Russia's aviation-research agency expect from their plan to modernize the nation's air-traffic control system. Announced in Moscow last week, the project will eventually trim hours from flights between the United States and the Far East, and enhance safety by enabling planes near or over Russia to rely upon both Russian and American navigational satellites. True, it's yet one more story about the cold war's demise, but there's a kicker. Rockwell is getting $4.7 million in financing -- from the Defense Department. For Kenneth A. Medlin, a Rockwell executive vice president, the deal represents "defense conversion at its very best."
 
China Lands a Boeing Deal
 When Boeing announced it would invest $100 million in a Chinese plant to make the tail sections of its most popular plane -- the 737 -- the reasons were several and self-evident. One, China is a big Boeing fan, with 52 of the nation's 79 plane purchases last year coming from the Seattle manufacturer. Two, China is looming ever larger on Boeing's ledgers, with 14 percent of the company's 1994 deliveries destined for that fast-emerging market. And three, Boeing competitors Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas are also energetically investing in China and chatting up the Chinese. Uncounted was Wichita, Kan., where the 737 tail sections are currently made. But to union complaints that last week's deal hurts American workers, Boeing just pointed to reasons 1, 2 and 3.
 
THE ECONOMY
 
Greenspan's Secret: Stories
How do Alan Greenspan and his Federal Reserve colleagues divine where inflation is headed? Complex computer models? Reams of statistics? Forecasting formulas? In part, yes, Mr. Greenspan told Congress last week, but there are also . . . stories. The Federal Reserve chairman used a dressed-up phrase, "detailed readings of firm behavior," but he essentially meant stories -- stories from companies, trade groups and others about rising prices. Changes in the American economy and statistics' assumptions about economic relationships makes mere data insufficient for decision making, Mr. Greenspan said.
 
Prices Up, Sales Down, Be Wary
Alan Greenspan's reliance on stories (see above) was vindicated last week, when the Government's July figures for producer prices and retail sales were released -- and at once were labeled misleading. Producer or "finished goods" prices rose half a percentage point, but the rise came mainly from coffee and gasoline prices, not from the prices that make the inflation-wary Federal Reserve snap to. And while retail sales fell one-tenth of a percentage point in July, the drop did not mean consumers wanted to buy less. It just mirrored auto makers' difficulty in restocking car lots that buyers had picked clean last spring. Fittingly, the deceptive data just "adds to the ambiguity" of whether the Fed will raise interest rates, said one economist.
 
Companies Tapped for Wiretaps
 The electronic frontier needs sheriffs like any other, and the F.B.I. says bills introduced in Congress last week will give it the technological draw on cyberspace bandits. Under the proposals, telephone and cable companies must alter their networks to make wiretapping easier, and they will get $500 million in Federal money to pay for the modifications. Company executives were reluctant to be deputies in the deal, however; one testified that $500 million is "severely underestimated." The true costs are "very, very difficult" to come by, agreed the F.B.I. director, Louis J. Freeh. But, he warned, "I certainly know what the cost of not proceeding will be."
 
Info Highway: No Traffic Jam?
 It all depends. That's the answer to the commercially pressing question of how many people ride the Internet, the global computer network. Cyberspace demographers often say 20 million to 30 million, but when Network Wizards, of Menlo Park, Calif., counted 3.2 million computers on the Internet in a survey last week, doubts arose. Not over the machines, but over how many people use each of them. About 10 people per machine is a common assumption; it underpins the 20 million to 30 million estimate. But some revisionists now say 3.5 people per machine, and some say 5 to 10. Riding on it all: how many potential buyers pass by the electronic storefronts that businesses are now scrambling to build.

HEADLINE: The Nation: The Odds on Health Care;
Going From a Good Bet to (Maybe) Even Money

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
HARRIS WOFFORD is a soft-spoken, unabashedly idealistic, professorial sort of man. When he ran for the Senate in Pennsylvania in a special election in 1991, whatever small national reputation he may once have enjoyed had long since faded. He appeared to have little chance against Dick Thornburgh, his Republican rival, a former Governor and United States Attorney General.
But he struck political gold. His television commercials contained one memorable sentence -- "If criminals have the right to a lawyer, I think working Americans should have the right to a doctor" -- and it melted Mr. Thornburgh's lead like butter in August. Mr. Wofford won, and politicians everywhere scrambled to get on the "right" side of the health care issue, whatever that was. 
 Among those who followed the trail blazed by Mr. Wofford was Bill Clinton, the Governor of Arkansas, whose campaign for the Presidency was already under way by the time of the Wofford-Thornburgh race. Health care became a key issue in New Hampshire, hotly debated by Mr. Clinton, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and former Senator Paul E. Tsongas, among others. Words and phrases like "managed care" and "spending caps" and "mandates" soon assumed a prominent place in the political vocabulary. By the time Mr. Clinton took office in January 1993, he was pledging a cheaper, more comprehensive system of health insurance that would cover everyone and could never be taken away.
The public was never united behind Mr. Clinton, but his was a popular initiative at first. Senators of both parties spoke of the need to control health care costs and to extend the safety net -- some with messianic intensity, like Jay Rockefeller, the West Virginia Democrat, other with dutiful bipartisanship, notably including the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole of Kansas. At first, no one wanted to be enrolled as an opponent of reform.
As recently as September 1993, 56 percent of the voters in one poll said they approved of the President's health care plan, with only 24 percent disapproving. Critics walked gingerly around the edges of the debate, talking of refinements, not of outright opposition.
 
Getting Perplexed
 But as Americans learned more about what Mr. Clinton planned, as they followed (or ignored) the deliberations of the various panels, study groups and committees, as they listened to the politicians and the experts talk and talk, they got more and more perplexed. In a survey taken by The Washington Post and ABC News late in June, for example, fully 53 percent of the respondents said that they opposed the President's plan; yet more than three-quarters said that they favored a guarantee of universal coverage, which is precisely what Mr. Clinton has been trying for months to wrest from a recalcitrant Congress.
So what happened? How did the President lose his momentum? How did health care legislation -- widely described as the major social innovation of the decade -- turn from a pretty sure bet into a questionable proposition?
Many things have contributed to the change, but one of the most important, surely, is the growing perception that this is a liberal undertaking.
When big businessmen, as epitomized by the Business Roundtable, still seemed interested in backing Mr. Clinton, because they thought he could help them control costs, that gave the measure a centrist coloration. But cost control faded as a central objective, employers were increasingly identified as the source of the needed revenues, and businessmen turned away from the President.
Then, too, the improvement in the economy -- for which voters, curiously enough, seem to give Mr. Clinton little credit -- has caused people to be less fearful about losing their jobs, and with them their health insurance. That, some White House officials believe, has taken some of the urgency out of the debate. Public attention has turned to crime and other urban problems.
Credit or blame for the change goes also to the work of the armies of anti-Administration lobbyists, backed by Harry and Louise on the nation's television screens, and to Mr. Dole's decision to fight the President, and to the sheer complexity of the issue. Detail is always the enemy of public persuasion, and Mr. Clinton was unable to keep the focus on the broader, unifying points.
Then, too, the slide in Mr. Clinton's overall popularity and the growing public impression of him as a beleaguered and accident-prone President must have hurt the backing for his health care plan as well.
For whatever reasons, many voters began talking last winter about their antipathy toward new government bureaucracies and their fears that they would lose their right to choose their physician or that medical care would be rationed. They talked less about the horror stories -- friends and relatives who were unable to buy medical insurance or who had lost what they had.
 
Changing Their Course
 The politicians heard the change of tone and rapidly altered course. No longer do members of Congress fear, as they did a few months ago, that if they do nothing before adjourning this fall, they will be in trouble at the polls. Stop rushing, many of the Republicans said in debates last week; this is too complicated; better to wait and get it right. Even outright opposition no longer seems like a dangerous political course.
When voters were asked last month in a New York Times/CBS News poll what they would do if their Representative voted "no" on health care, there was no clear pattern. About four of 10 said they would be less likely to vote for the Representative, but just as many said it would make no difference, and 16 percent said that they would be more likely to support the Representative.
In the House and in the Senate, the balance is shifting slightly toward the moderates -- people like Senator John Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, and Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee, who would do something, but not everything Mr. Clinton still wants, to change the health care system. Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, introduced legislation whose goal is to cover 95 percent of Americans by the year 2000.
At the moment, with the White House reeling from its unexpected defeat on crime legislation, to say nothing of its Whitewater difficulties, everything is nevertheless still to play for. There is no consensus, no widely accepted conventional political wisdom. But this, from a fence-sitting Senator, comes close: "Passing something is better politics than passing nothing, but not by much, and only if it is something that looks like a modest if honest effort."

HEADLINE: The World: Hands Off;
In Mexico, U.S. Hones Art of Laissez-Faire Diplomacy

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY

 BODY:
ONLY last fall, as the United States anguished over the uncertainties of a new economic partnership with Mexico, the cry in Congress was: How can we propose free trade with a neighbor that does not hold free elections?
The Clinton Administration answered emphatically that the North American Free Trade Agreement would enable the United States to push Mexico more quickly and effectively toward a fuller democracy. It prevailed, and Nafta is now a central fact of commerce and investment between the two nations. 
 Yet a week before the Presidential election that will provide a crucial test of Mexico's democratic progress, the role of the United States in this country's politics has at the very least been extremely discreet. A House resolution drafted months ago with a roaring demand for "full-scale international observation" of the vote finally passed on Monday with a watered-down expression of hope that political reforms will be successful.
As the United States gropes to find a proper balance for its sometimes conflicting foreign policy concerns of democracy and trade, it has largely left Mexico to find its way to a more democratic political system by itself. In part, that is a consequence of the many signs that Mexico may indeed be finding its way. In part, critics say, it is the mark of a foreign-policy team that can't seem to see past Haiti.
Yet it is also the product of a growing American understanding that deepening economic ties are a more complicated diplomatic tool than pressure, and that Mexico, for all its underdevelopment, is not El Salvador.
"There is a recognition that you really can't do that much about Mexico," said Peter Hakim, who is President of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington-based think tank. "Despite Nafta, there is a big difference between big countries and small countries on this. I think U.S. politicians have come to realize that they can't really influence it, that the changes have to come from within Mexico."
In a broad sense, the United States is unquestionably a bigger part of the Aug. 21 vote than it has been of elections in the past. With Nafta in place, gringo eyes are on Mexican politics as never before. Hundreds of accredited American "visitors" will watch the vote, and American political parties have helped pay for the thousands of Mexicans who will act as formal observers. More important, it is taken for granted that a significant reprise of the blatant fraud that characterized elections here in the past would not only prompt Mexicans to take to the streets but would prompt American investors -- whose money is critical to the Mexican Government's ability to cover its huge trade deficit -- to sell their Mexican stocks.
Some American officials say that what Washington has come to understand is simply that Mexico's stake in the expanding economic relationship with the United States is overwhelming. It would be counter-productive, they say, to bluster about what the Mexican Government should do when a gentle reminder of the two countries' overlapping interests tends to be sufficient. "When I speak publicly," the United States Ambassador to Mexico, James R. Jones, said, referring to his rare applications of public pressure on the Mexican Government, "I put it in terms of the economic consequences of something, because that's more important to them than the reaction of our Government."
As ever, the limits on United States involvement in Mexican political affairs are defined by the deep nationalism of a country that still often views its neighboring superpower more as an enemy than a friend. While many Americans assumed that such feelings would wane with the implementation of the trade accord, they have tended to be surprised this year.
Representative Robert G. Torricelli, the New Jersey Democrat who heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee's Subcommitee on Western Hemisphere Affairs, thought it entirely appropriate when he and the House majority whip, David Bonior of Michigan, proposed a non-binding resolution that criticized past Mexican elections and called for a wide opening to foreign observers.
"Given the new economic partnership between the United States and Mexico, people in Mexico cannot expect everything to be the same," Mr. Torricelli reasoned. "There is some ascending right to be heard. Whether the process is free and fair is a legitimate international question. There is some ascending right to be heard."
But when Mr. Torricelli came to be heard in Mexico, he was almost immediately branded non grata. Newspaper editorials attacked him, politicians across the ideological spectrum shunned him, and the Government all but ignored him.
One State Department official described the threat of such a backlash as "a very real, immutable limit to what we can do in Mexican politics." But critics of that policy tend to see nationalism as a convenient excuse for inaction that effectively supports Mexico's governing party. Like most of its predecessors, they say, the Clinton Administration has put Mexican stability above democracy by accepting the Institutional Revolutionary Party's determination of when the latter threatens the former. Mexico is not El Salvador, by this argument, because the United States wouldn't challenge its new partner on such a basic issue as political change and doesn't have a constituency in the United States demanding that it do so.
American officials protest that Mr. Jones, for example, vigorously pressed President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and his aides to put aside the idea of a military solution to the peasant rebellion that broke out on Jan. 1 in the southern state of Chiapas. Citing another important, albeit benign, intervention, they note that within 24 hours after the assassination of the governing party's presidential candidate on March 23, the Clinton Administration also opened a $6 billion line of credit to Mexico to block a run on the peso.
But as the Mexican Government and political parties have engaged in furious debate over legal reforms to insure a fair election, the United States has been almost invisible. During a visit to Mexico City in May, Secretary of State Warren Christopher openly prodded his hosts to allow foreign election observers. But some American officials described that step as an attempt to guard against instability by diluting the potential for a leftist outcry against perceived fraud.
The Clinton Administration has insisted that it will recognize whoever wins a vote that is widely seen as fair. But with the governing party's replacement candidate, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, well ahead in most opinion polls, the more important test of a commitment to democracy may be how much fraud the United States will tolerate.
"The U.S. Government is quite content to see an election process go forward that it thinks the PRI will win," said Medea Benjamin, the head of a delegation of American "visitors" to the election. "What is important is what the U.S. Government will do after the election if there is evidence of significant fraud. I think it still has to prove to the Mexican people that it is as concerned about Mexican democracy as it is about the Mexican stock market."

HEADLINE: Ideas & Trends: Playing the Statistics Game;
Even if the Numbers Don't Add Up

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ONE in four women attending college will be raped, the statistics seem to say. More than half the 55 million married women in the United States will be victims of domestic violence. Hard to believe? How about this: Immigrants soak up $44 billion more in government services than they pay in taxes. Or is it that they contribute $25 billion more in taxes than they use in government services?
 It can depend on whom you ask, and on which answer fits a particular agenda.
 
 If America is the land of the free, it is also the home of the telling statistic, numbers proffered by politicians, interest groups or businesses to cajole, comfort or frighten the public into accepting their particular view of the world. Increasingly, as in the examples just cited, the statistics are confusing, contradictory or just plain wrong.
 
In Math We Trust
 America has always loved to quantify things. Indeed, the first governmental duty listed in the Constitution -- even before power to declare war or levy taxes -- is to conduct a census every 10 years. For a democracy supposedly wary of capricious governmental decrees, statistics are particularly important. After all, numbers are seen as neutral, nonpartisan, unbiased -- all the things we say we want our government to be.
 Playing with numbers is an old political game. But in recent years more and more statisticians and demographers are becoming troubled by the misuse of statistics. As computers and more sophisticated methodology has made data gathering cheaper and more precise, interest groups and businesses are bending and shaping the results.
 "There are more numbers, more statistics, more counting being done," said Cynthia Crossen, author of "Tainted Truth: The Manipulation of Fact in America" (Simon & Schuster, 1994). "And more and more of it is being done by people with a particular economic and social agenda." What concerns Ms. Crossen and others is that statistics, which were once held in high esteem, will go the way of television advertisements or promises by campaigning politicians -- dismissed out of hand as lacking credibility. "Numbers are a tremendously useful tool -- the census data prove that," Ms. Crossen said. "The worry is that there are so many of them and so much is being manipulated that people will become cynical and jaded."
 Advocacy groups say it is all well and good for academics to compose odes to the purity of data. In the highly charged world of interest group politics, the correct spin is important, and if gaining that means manipulating numbers or emphasizing one set of statistics over another, then so be it.
 "The issues that the advocacy groups deal with are so politicized," said Priscilla Salant, an economist at Washington State University who has studied how non-profit groups use information. "They're always in the front lines of controversy. As a result, in a lot of cases, information is used like ammunition."
 But manipulation of data -- or more often selective use of statistics -- is only half the problem, some experts say. Equally troubling is a resistance to using more modern, more sophisticated techniques and measurements to supplement or supplant traditional data-collection methods. Such changes often make the measurements more accurate. But in these days when so much public policy and public money is directed by numbers, accuracy is not always the goal.
 Consider the battle over using statistical sampling methods to adjust the 1990 census. For the most part, statisticians and demographers say the techniques would make the 1990 count more accurate. But some lawmakers -- both Democrat and Republican -- from places that would lose clout as a result of an adjustment oppose revising the figures.
 "The letters I got pro or con adjustment were entirely in favor of picking the number -- adjusted or unadjusted -- that best favored their constituency," said Barbara Everitt Bryant, who headed the Census Bureau during the Bush Administration and who recommended at the time that the census count be adjusted. "The letters sounded more like fund-raising appeals."
 At the same time, proposals to make the census and other Federal forms more precise by adding a category called "multi-racial" has caused some civil rights groups to worry that it might lessen the official count of black Americans.
 
'Winners and Losers'
 "Anytime you develop the notion of winners and losers you color the view of scientific decisions and you risk data that is based on outcomes and not facts," said Representative Thomas C. Sawyer, the Ohio Democrat whose subcommittee oversees the Census Bureau.
 With so many causes and problems clamoring for attention and government money, boosting figures becomes a way of moving to the head of the priority queue. Specific problems, be they homelessness, AIDS, battered women, discrimination or child care, cry out to be addressed, not just because it's the moral thing to do, but because so many people supposedly are at risk. "It's not enough to say that something is a problem or that it's a growing problem or that it's something that we need to focus attention on," said Jeffrey Passel, a demographer at the Urban Institute. "We have to put a number on it. If we can't put a number on it, then it's not a serious problem. And that, in itself, leads to some very bad statistics."

Kneeling at the Altar of Death: From Belief to Fanaticism

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

 BODY:
IT is an enduring paradox, how religions that teach peace can be taken by some adherents to justify acts of violence and bloodshed.
 Combatants in some of the world's seemingly intractable conflicts often boldly wear their religious identities, whether in Bosnia, the Caucasus or Northern Ireland. But in many cases, their spiritual beliefs are a minor feature in a more complicated conflict, one that turns on ethnic rivalries, a clash of national claims or economic interests.
 
 Even less understandable -- and unnerving for the rest of society -- are the destructive acts of individuals or shadowy groups who claim to be acting on God's behalf.
 Over the last dozen years there has been no shortage of the latter, whether it be the suicide bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut, attributed to radical Shiite groups, or the killing of an abortion doctor in Pensacola, Fla. In the latter case, the suspect is Paul Hill, a former minister who had claimed a theological justification for such killings. Mr. Hill, who faces state murder charges, was indicted Friday by a Federal grand jury on charges of violating the new Federal law demanding freedom of access to clinic entrances.
 Acts like these, from the furthest fringes of religious militancy, beggar the comprehension of mainstream believers, whose faiths contain explicit checks against such random violence in divine prohibitions against murder, and which also provide peaceful outlets for confronting evil, such as prayer and proselytizing. But historic faiths like Christianity, Judaism and Islam also confront the fact that their texts are complex, and thus vulnerable to selective readings that qualify their central message.
 
What Does the Bible Say?
 To take but one example, in the Gospel of Mark 9:40 Jesus tells his disciples, "He that is not against us is for us." Luke 9:50 contains a similar statement. But in Matthew 12:30, Jesus says this: "He who is not with me is against me."
 Creeds, religious teachings and theological arguments have been developed over time within established religions to interpret such passages and guide an adherent's spiritual understanding. But experience of God is ultimately a personal matter. "When you're talking about the divine, the sacred, you're talking about something that precedes our notion of right and wrong," said Scott Appleby, associate director of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences's Fundamentalism Project, a scholarly study of religious militance worldwide.
 Last week, after two months in hiding, the feminist writer Taslima Nasrin fled her native Bangladesh for Sweden, after militant groups reportedly offered a $5,000 reward for her death, charging that she had defamed Islam. Ms. Nasrin, 32 years old, said she had been misquoted in a newspaper article that said she urged revisions in the Koran to cut passages that encouraged discrimination against women.
 Of course, throughout history individuals have spoken of having a profound experience of God and coming away transformed, with peaceful intent. Some have become preachers or teachers; others have built hospitals or founded religious orders.
 After a conversion experience at about age 39, followed by mystic visions, the 16th-century Spanish Carmelite nun St. Teresa of Avila wrote a number of books on prayer and the contemplative life that remain profoundly influential to this day. Three centuries earlier, another personal, spiritual revolution transformed a wealthy Italian merchant's son into St. Francis of Assisi, founder of an order of mendicant friars, and one of the more popular figures in Christian history.
 But what of those relative few who have felt inspired to acts of destruction?
 Authorities on the subject can only raise questions that may offer insight into who goes down the road to religious violence.
 Does a believer come to identify with God so closely that he or she sees the world shorn of nuance and ambiguity, where other persons seem either all good or all bad?
 Does that believer find a special significance in the "signs of the times," taking complex social problems as evidence that the present is not only a unique, cosmically important period of history but one requiring drastic, even violent, human action?
 For example, the AIDS epidemic, pornography, a rising divorce rate, teen-aged pregnancy and, especially, abortion are read not simply as society's failings, but as clear warnings of something much worse at work, the forces of evil struggling with God for mastery of the planet.
 "You begin to believe the demonic is really in control, and you have to employ the means of the demonic to fight it," Mr. Appleby said, describing what would be the extreme response to such a religious-historical view. "It's not a loss of confidence in God's power, it's a belief that God is acting through me."
 In other words, to act -- even destructively -- is to demonstrate faith.
 Further, he suggested that a millennialist consciousness is often at work. "There's a sense of ordinary time and extraordinary time, and this is extraordinary time."
 Another frame for understanding the religious consciousness that may lead to violence can be found in early societies, which possessed belief systems that sharply distinguished their own members from outsiders.
 Speaking of those societies, Ernest Wallwork, a psychoanalyst and professor of religion at Syracuse University, said, "Many, many religious groups have seen themselves as peculiarly human and the enemy as sub-human." It is a way of looking at the world that can appeal deeply to a human need to project one's own failings onto others. "There's a narcissistic feeling that comes from being able to identify the evil in another," Mr. Wallwork said.
 Furthermore, he said, many groups, whether they be tribes or nations or factions within a social or political struggle, build up their own narratives over time, creating a body of stories in which their opponents are identified with any number of wrongs.
 "In a curious way, the aggressive motives are attributed" to the victim, Mr. Wallwork said. "It legitimates killing."

Bosnia, Where Facts Strangle Principles

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
YUGOSLAVIA, founded in 1918 as the "Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes," proved to be an artificial creation. In the absence of authoritarian rule -- the royal dictatorship of the 1930's or Marshal Tito's postwar Communist rule -- it tended to disintegrate, riven by the forces of ethnic and religious division.
 Twenty-eight months after the recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina by America and the European Union, the existence of this former Yugoslav republic as an independent state also appears tenuous. Ill-conceived and born into war, Bosnia -- a fragmenting piece of a fragmented land -- continues to confound the peacemakers.
 
 The argument for its inevitable dissolution is simple: as a microcosm of the former Yugoslavia, a country where Islam meets Christianity and the line of the Great Schism still divides the Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats, Bosnia must prove as artificial and doomed as its mother country.
 That, at least, has been the stubborn contention of the Bosnian Serbs, whose rejection of the latest "contact group" peace proposal from the United States, Russia, Britain, Germany and France amounted to a statement that Bosnia, in any configuration, is unacceptable. "Why do you oblige us to live with our enemy?" asked Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, repeating his demand for an independent Bosnian Serb state.
 
Firm Principles (In Principle)
 After more than two years of war, it was a pertinent question. The answer, of course, is that to do otherwise would destroy several international principles -- the inviolability of borders, the right of people of different religions to live together, the refusal to reward brutal aggression. Secretary of State Warren Christopher stated emphatically last month that Bosnia will remain a single state within its recognized frontiers.
 But words are one thing, deeds another. The United States and the West have already demonstrated emphatically that they are unwilling to fight for such principles in Bosnia. All the signs are that it is now much too late.
 In the place of action, the uneasily allied five major powers have opted for something predictably half-hearted -- a tightening of trade sanctions on Serbia. Then last week President Clinton gave the Bosnian Serbs until Oct. 15 to agree to the peace plan or face a lifting of the arms embargo for the Muslim-led Bosnian forces.
 To many American officials and others, the embargo has always been morally indefensible in that it denied an internationally recognized country the means to defend itself; so its end will assuage consciences in Washington. But it would seem more likely to worsen the fighting than quickly alter the course of the war, since the Serbs' military advantage is such that it could take years to match; in any case, the allied Croatian and Muslim forces are already receiving some arms clandestinely.
 Meanwhile, with his new deadline Mr. Clinton has effectively given the Serbs an extension of two months in reviewing their attitude toward what was initially portrayed as a take-it-or-leave-it plan, offering 51 percent of Bosnia to the Government and 49 percent to the Serbs in a loose union.
 President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, concerned that his economy cannot take another winter of sanctions and convinced that Serbian goals can now be secured through diplomacy, last week decided to take prompter action. He cut off the logistical and financial support essential to the military rampage that has left the Bosnian Serbs with 70 percent of Bosnia's territory.
 If sustained, Mr. Milosevic's cutoff will have more impact than international bluster. The Bosnian Serbs will be militarily weakened, but they still have the support of radical parties in Serbia and the Orthodox Church, and it is not clear that Mr. Milosevic will be able to maintain the cutoff if the military tide turns in Bosnia.
 What is clear is that neither Mr. Milosevic nor the international community has the ability to solve the Bosnian conundrum or prevent the war there from getting worse.
 "The only question now is how violent the war will be and how far it will spread," said Jonathan Eyal, a director of the Institute for Strategic Studies in London. "But it will certainly rumble on for a long time. After the failure of the latest peace plan, we should give up the obscene idea of keeping Bosnia together, accept the country's outright division, and admit that we have no more principles to defend."
 Bosnia today overflows with hatred. It is in every village, every war-lacerated community. Lost kin and lost homes have fueled an avenging fury. Murat Hurtic, a Muslim salesman who lost his home near Doboj at the beginning of the war and now lives in Sarajevo, is typical. He has spent months investigating what happened to his younger brother, Kasim, arrested by the Serbs in May 1992. Now he has learned that his brother was murdered by a Bosnian Serb named Goran Granic in a prison camp near Sarajevo on July 18, 1993.
 "Bosnia is too small for this Granic and there are tens of thousands of Serbs like him," Mr. Hurtic said during a recent conversation in Sarajevo. "I would like to hunt him down and kill him in front of his family."
 A friend, Murat Lihic, retorted: "And then Granic's kids will try and find your kids and kill them and what will you have gained?"
 But the Bosnian war is too raw for such arguments based on reason. As in the Middle East for decades, where Israelis and Palestinians looked past each other, each side in Bosnia simply wants the other to disappear.
 The Bosnian Serbs cling to the fantasy that the Muslims they have butchered are the victims of an aberration that led them to convert to Islam during the centuries of Ottoman rule in Bosnia, and that one day they will revert to being Christian Slavs.
 The Muslim-led Bosnian Government refers to its enemy as the "Belgrade regime," as if the Serbs of Bosnia did not exist. War, not diplomacy, is seen by the Government as the only way to "liberate" Bosnia.
 
Treacherous Ground
 But what is Bosnia? A millennial state fighting against a large-scale Serbian invasion, the government says. In truth, an expanse of breathtakingly beautiful land ruled, since the collapse of the medieval kingdom, by various outside authorities -- Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, Communist -- and subject to outbreaks of hostility between its Muslim, Serb and Croatian inhabitants.
 On such treacherous ground, prudence is a virtue. The consent of all three Bosnian nations was clearly a precondition for independence without war. But distracted by other matters then viewed as more pressing, the United States and Europe tried to will Bosnia into being as an independent state without the consent of its Serbs. The West looked at principles -- a majority of people in Bosnia had expressed their right to self-determination by voting for independence -- rather than at history and at facts.
 The Serbs, who had refused to vote, then confounded a largely legitimate grievance by perpetrating the worst barbarities in Europe since those of Nazi Germany.
 Since then, peace plans have tried, and failed, to put the Bosnian genie back in the bottle. But Bosnia is a land with no clear ethnic identity -- like the former Yugoslavia, the former Czechoslovakia and the former Soviet Union -- and all such countries have proved prone to fragmentation in the post-Communist world. Yugoslavia itself was created in the name of the self-determination of the southern Slav peoples, but endlessly lacerated by tensions between Croats and Serbs.
 King Alexander, in 1929, tried to preserve the country by redrawing its administrative map to blur the existence of Serbia and Croatia and applying autocratic rule; Tito tried in 1945 by putting a hermetic seal over its civil strife. But in the end a country unwanted by its inhabitants cannot survive. It may be thus, too, with Bosnia.

Haiti Is a Land Without a Country

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: BARBE PAGNOLE, Haiti

 BODY:
WHEN Haitians say their country has a state but is not truly a nation, as they often do, they are thinking of places like this mountain hamlet.
 There's never been electricity here, and drinking and bathing water comes straight from the same small stream. The nearest hospital is more than three hours down a rocky, rutted dirt track, and the closest public high school is almost as far away. The presidential palace in Port-au-Prince may be less than 125 miles away, but in rural areas like this one, home to 70 percent of the Haitian population, the government rarely makes its presence felt, except when the police or tax collectors appear.
 
 Regardless of whether the Clinton Administration's confrontation with Haiti's military rulers results in an American invasion or some other outcome, this country will inevitably be haunted by its heritage of malign neglect should it ever get the chance to try to build a functioning democracy.
 Though the authorities in Port-au-Prince like to pretend that Haiti is a conventional nation-state, historically the Government has been "not a source of providing services or protecting citizens, but a mechanism of enrichment and appropriation for those who control it," said Alex Dupuy, a Haitian scholar who teaches sociology at Wesleyan University in Connecticut. "It's a predatory state that preys on the population at large" and offers little, if anything, in return.
 That makes the challenge of nation-building -- a goal envisioned in the United Nations Security Council resolution of July 31 authorizing an American-led invasion of Haiti -- a daunting one for any potential occupying power, and one factor certainly troubling American policy makers as they pause at the brink of intervention. Because of decades of misgovernment, "everything is a priority here," said Suzy Castor, co-director of the Research and Training Center for Economic and Social Development in Port-au-Prince.
 
'Nothing to Build On'
 An assessment of American options prepared by two researchers for the Strategic Studies Institute of the Army War College is particularly pessimistic about meeting the challenge, warning that turning Haiti into a modern state may be impossible.
 "There is almost nothing to build on," the authors of the 62-page study, Donald E. Schulz and Gabriel Marcella, concluded. "Haiti's human and material resources are either in such short supply or have been so degraded by poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition, disease, violence, corruption, overpopulation, rapid urbanization, deforestation and soil erosion as to raise serious questions about its continued survival as a society and as an independent nation-state."
 Even before the current crisis erupted over the military's refusal to restore the elected Government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power, Haiti was the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, with a per capita income of $370 a year.
In a country of roughly seven million people, there are fewer than 1,000 doctors, which helps explain why life expectancy is a mere 56 years, one in every eight babies dies before reaching the age of 1, and 70 percent of all children are estimated to suffer from some form of malnutrition. Two thirds of the population is illiterate, and the state school system is so small and ramshackle that fewer than 5 percent of eligible students are enrolled in government high schools.
 Addressing those needs will require billions of dollars, Haitian and foreign experts agree. But the ability of Haitian society to absorb that kind of investment is extremely limited. "It would be like trying to pour a gallon of water into a thimble," one Haitian Government economist said.
 In any case, many of the doctors, engineers and administrators whose services would be required in such an effort have been killed by the military and their enforcers or driven into exile.
 Nevertheless, the most difficult obstacles preventing the construction of a modern, democratic state in Haiti "are not material -- they are psychological and cultural," Mr. Schulz said. The tradition of a predatory, oppressive state has left Haitians deeply distrustful of government, which, combined with a suspicion of foreigners, is likely to complicate efforts to improve the lot of the average Haitian. Even Haitian-Americans eager to help reconstruct the land of their birth are likely to be regarded as "submarine spies, a fifth column of American imperialism," said Georges Michel, a Haitian historian who has written extensively on the 1915-34 American occupation of Haiti.
 
The Allure of Force
 In addition, Haiti's political culture has long been characterized by what Roger Gaillard, a leading historian, describes as "an admiration of force, even among educated Haitians." Political disputes are settled not by negotiation, but through the exercise of power, often in crude and brutal fashion, and respect for democratic procedures and obligations is minimal.
 "The only people who get squeezed for taxes are the poor peasants, because they cannot face down the tax collector or pull political influence," said Anthony Maingot, an expert on Haitian society who teaches at Florida International University in Miami.
 Those attitudes are especially strong among the urban economic elite who have in the past used the state to advance their own interests and ignored their fellow citizens. "They cannot recognize that the voice of someone who lives in Cite Soleil," a large slum on the edge of Port-au-Prince, "has the same value as their own," Ms. Castor said. "They do not accept the concept of one man, one vote. There is a disdain for people."
 Nor is there much of a tradition of gratitude: Mr. Michel warned that no occupying power should expect its efforts to build a modern and democratic Haiti, no matter how earnest, to be applauded.
 "The foreigners will never be able to do enough," he said. "Even if Clinton paves the streets with gold bullion, there will be people who say he should have used platinum."

Congress Decides a Crime Bill Doesn't Pay

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TO hear the politicians tell it, millions of Americans are cowering in their homes, cringing in fear. To hear the pollsters tell it, crime is the No. 1 issue on their minds.
 But year after year, Congress stops short of enacting legislation that would curb the sale of guns, limit appeals by death row inmates and increase Federal spending on police protection. This odd circumstance has continued virtually unabated for more than a decade. But only in the last five years has it hardened into the sort of trenchant political warfare that sabotaged the latest big anti-crime bill last week.
 
 Because of a combination of politics, emotion and plain, old-fashioned intransigence, Congress has done the unthinkable: voted to deep-six, at least for now, what most voters say they want. In an election year, too.
 Representative Charles E. Schumer, the glib Brooklyn Democrat who has championed a number of anti-crime measures as chairman of a House Judiciary Committee panel on criminal justice, said the issue has fallen prey to debates over values rather than solutions. "People on the left feel the death penalty is immoral," he said as he plotted a legislative rescue attempt. "People on the right feel all the money should go to punishment. The pattern is, you get a group on the left and a group on the right crowding out the center, and saying no."
 "There is just not enough force in the center to overcome the left and the right," he added.
 Crime and violence have consistently ranked as "the most important problem facing the country today" in New York Times polls taken since Bill Clinton took office, and as immediate concerns about the economy began to fade. But when Louis Harris and Associates, a private polling organization, asks whether crime is one of "the most important issues for the Government to address," the issue slides into second place behind health care. The message: Americans are worried about their safety, but they do not necessarily expect -- or trust -- the Federal Government to make things better.
 This sort of information gives Congress room to spurn the President, as it did last week. But when a measure this ambitious seems to be headed for this big a fall, neither the White House, which had lobbied hard for this year's $33 billion anti-crime measure, nor the odd coalition of pro-gun Republicans and anti-death penalty Democrats who defeated it, quite understands who gets to declare victory. It's clear who lost, though: President Clinton. And it is also
 clear that a persistent short circuit has developed between the American public, which craves some kind of action on crime, and Congress.
 Much of the clash is rooted in old-fashioned interparty bickering. Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the chairman of the House Republican Conference, boiled it down to stinging partisan eloquence when he declared to Democrats on the House floor on Thursday, "Your President is just not that important to us."
 
The Kitchen Sink Problem
 Another reason that so many anti-crime measures lurch forward, then fail, is that they are weighted down by endless provisions, both the grand and the dubious. Big bills can be easily bogged down by their everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach. Any number of provisions obnoxious to particular groups can be rallying grounds for opposition to the whole bill -- the dynamic at work in Thursday's procedural vote, when blacks and liberals opposed to the death penalty joined conservative gun-control opponents in derailing the legislation.
 In 1990, a wide-ranging bill similar to the one that Mr. Clinton is fighting for now was stripped down to its bare bones before President Bush signed it. Along the way, it shed like so much ornamental wrapping paper provisions that would have expanded the death penalty and restrict semiautomatic weapons.
 In 1986 and 1988, votes just before elections brought about the passage of drug-control measures that authorized only $4 billion in new spending and focused on increasing Federal penalties for drug crimes. Democrats and Republicans sparred to get credit.
 But last week's vote showed that generalized muscle-flexing on the crime issue no longer guarantees success for Republicans or for Democrats. "What the voters are asking for on crime is very specific and very clear," said Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster and president of the Tarrance Group. "They want the criminals taken off the streets and kept off the streets. Period."
 If voters are paying close attention, Mr. Goeas said, they will display little angst over the defeat of a bill that would pay for measures like midnight basketball leagues. They mostly want punishment, he said. But Mr. Goeas and other Republicans conveniently ignore the bill's expansion of the death penalty (on paper, at least) to cover dozens of Federal crimes, its inclusion of money for 100,000 more police officers and funds for prisons.
 The Clinton team is still studying the lessons of 1968, when Richard Nixon made law and order a central part of his platform. Republicans made the Democrats look like wimps that year, and the label has stuck.
 Until last week, Mr. Clinton thought he had turned the tables. He still thinks he can.
 "Those people are going to go to hypocrisy hell," Paul Begala, a White House political adviser, said of the Republicans. Mr. Begala is silent on what will happen to the Democrats -- 58 strong -- who joined the Republicans in voting against the President.
 Mr. Schumer promises to try to revive something this year, and Mr. Clinton vows to fight for it. But Mr. Schumer sounded demoralized: "It is one of the great mysteries of American politics why the people's anguish about crime doesn't translate into public action."

HEADLINE: WOODSTOCK '94: THE OVERVIEW;
Woodstock Redux: New Sea of Young People

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SAUGERTIES, N.Y., Aug. 13

 BODY:
The 25th-anniversary Woodstock celebration today took on the look of a benign natural disaster attended by more than 200,000 mostly cheerful victims.State officials declared the concert site and its parking areas filled to saturation and began blocking off roads as far as 15 miles away to try to stop more people, including ticket-holders, from coming.
A vast sea of tents and bodies swamped the rolling hills, woods and creek beds of the 840-acre farm where the festival is being held this weekend, making it increasingly difficult to clear away accumulating trash and maneuver emergency vehicles. Rivers of people inching their way toward toilets, telephones, water and food snaked interminably past encampments of tents and groggy, recumbent bodies. 
 The New York State Police predicted it would take 20 to 25 hours to clear the site after the concert winds down late Sunday because most people will have to be loaded onto school buses and shuttled to parking lots as far as 30 miles away. The task could become complicated by thunderstorms late Sunday afternoon.
Rain was already falling steadily by late this afternoon, and as many as 100 people could be seen dancing to the rap music of Cypress Hill in a large mud lagoon in the main festival field. Elsewhere, people could be found completely covered in mud in scenes reminiscent of the thick mud that engulfed the original Woodstock.
A 44-year-old Long Island man was found unconscious and was later pronounced dead after being flown to a hospital in Kingston. He was identified as Joseph G. Roussel of West Babylon. The authorities said the cause of his death was complications from diabetes. Otherwise, various medical personnel reported treating from 600 to more than 1,000 injuries, most of them minor, including overdoses and dancing injuries.
Despite mounting problems, many in the crowd didn't seem to notice. Some said they had expected nothing less. And when the concert charged into high gear shortly after noon and one of the few original Woodstock performers here, Joe Cocker, launched into "Feeling All Right," anyone with a dissenting view lost all chance of being heard above the roaring approval of the crowd.
And when Mr. Cocker later broke into "With a Little Help From My Friends," which he sang at the original Woodstock and which most of the crowd had probably seen him perform in the concert film, tens of thousands of people raised their arms to the sky and began singing, too, in what some said was the emotional high point of the festival so far.
But it seemed unlikely that the festival would acquire the cultural and mythic heft of its predecessor, despite the promoters' suggestions that the potential was there. For too many people at the three-day event, it seemed to be primarily a very big concert with a very big budget before a very big crowd.
"There's certain things in life that there's only one of," said Marie Rice, a television reporter in her 40's from Buffalo who was not covering the festival but had come anyway with her sister and a friend. "There's only one Love Canal. There's only one Elvis. And there's only one Woodstock."
A few people suggested the event was marked by an awareness of the new generation's "own Vietnam": environmental pollution, diminished opportunities, economic stagnation, perhaps AIDS, depending on who was asked. But others said those issues did not pervade the festival in the way that the Vietnam War is remembered to have energized the original Woodstock.
 
'Vote for What?'
 Volunteers for Rock the Vote, a group that fights voter apathy by encouraging young people to register, said they were struck by how many people didn't know what voter registration was. "Vote for what?" they said they were repeatedly asked.
"To say our generation has its own Vietnam is maybe trying too hard to make a specific link between generations," said Eric Morris, a 24-year-old writer from Manhattan who is working on a book about the Black Panther Party. "Our generation is in the process of defining itself. We may never have our Vietnam. But maybe most generations don't."
The crowd was mostly young and mostly white, full of 17-year-old high school students thrilling to the sight of so many seeming soul mates. But there were many others: Vietnam veterans, Danish tourists, vacationing families from South Carolina, even children as young as 6 who had become lost. Yuppies appeared to be a tiny minority.
 
Changed by Woodstock
 There were even a few original Woodstock veterans. George Quinn said he came this time in part because the first one changed his life. He had been 27, a construction worker who defended the war. His reason for attending was to see Janis Joplin, but the sight of "that many people in one spot that were entirely nonaggressive" made him realize there were other ways of living.
Mr. Quinn went home and eventually left his wife and moved into what he described as a colony of hippies near the site of the original Woodstock festival, Bethel, N.Y. There he met Nancy Monaghan, now 47, with whom he has lived the past 21 years and with whom he was attending this weekend's festival.
Many this time came simply for the music, geared to people in their late teens and 20's. But others were drawn, in ways few could articulate, by the power of the Woodstock name. "Most of us are looking for something we know we're not going to find here," said Taras Mauch, a 21-year-old student at the University of Massachusetts. "But we know we've got to look."
For those with credit cards and Woodstock scrip, which is the required currency, there were innumerable ways to spend money: official dog tags, official comics, official Woodstock phone cards, Frisbees, key chains, disposable cameras, amusement-park rides, nose piercings, wind chimes, serapes, body suits, body painting, popcorn. Some other things were harder to come by, but reportedly not impossible. A youth stood forlornly in the crowd with a hand-printed sign: "I want acid."
 
Drinking, Dancing and Deer
 The injuries treated at the festival's 104-bed hospital included 30 LSD and alcohol-related overdoses, said Kathy Yanas, a spokeswoman. She said they included some 30 injuries from moshing, a sometimes violent form of contact dancing, and a broken nose incurred in a run-in with a deer.
By early today, all the parking lots were declared full and closed. Because of inexperienced workers, 20 percent of the lots' capacity had been wasted, officials said. Thousands of people had passed up designated camping areas and pitched their tents in the vast field facing the main stage. From the stage, festival officials repeatedly beseeched them to move.
Though state and festival officials said no one else would be allowed to enter the site and only local traffic would penetrate the perimeter of roadblocks, people arriving with and without tickets, some of whom said they had hiked for miles, continued to walk through gates at the shuttle-bus drop-off point. But tonight, one of the promoters, John Scher, said special efforts were no longer being made to keep people out. "We're not killing ourselves to stop people who find ways to get in," he said.
At least a few local residents were enjoying the town's new-found notoriety. "From now until the end of time, when people ask where you're from and you say Saugerties, they'll say, 'How was it?' ," said Chris Connerton, 39, a building contractor.
A few, at least, didn't want to stick around to find out.
James and Michelle Payne, a couple from Davison, Mich., both aged 24, came expecting the proverbial once-in-a-lifetime story they could tell the children they don't yet have. Instead, they found a place where it took two hours to go to the bathroom and where people, including themselves, paid $11 for a small cheese pizza.
It was supposed to take the Paynes a little over 9 hours to get to the festival; it took 15. Arriving in Saugerties in the middle of the night, the Paynes were sent 30 miles north to a parking lot that was closed. From there, they were sent to a lot 25 miles south.
"We're just going to drive until we find a motel," Mrs. Payne said late Friday night, unmoved by the news that all motels for miles around were full. "We really expected more. They forgot the true meaning of the original Woodstock."

HEADLINE: Billions at Stake in Debate on a Gold Rush

SERIES: Who Owns the West? -- First article of a periodic series.

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: COOKE CITY, Mont.

 BODY:
In 1872, the Sioux Indians still roamed free over part of the northern Plains, Wyatt Earp had yet to draw a bead on the Clanton gang and President Ulysses S. Grant signed two laws that would shape the American West.
One created the world's first national park, at Yellowstone, a place whose theatrical geysers and waterfalls were still thought to be a fiction from Thomas Moran's paintbrush. 
 The other virtually opened the entire West to hard-rock mining, stipulating that the search for gold, silver and copper would take precedence over anything else on Federal land. Anyone inclined to get friendly with a mule and a pick could go clawing at a piece of earth on the public domain and, if minerals were found, buy that claim for no more than $5 an acre.
Most of the boom towns spawned by the mining law are empty now, lost to the elements. But the law is still on the books, and it has helped to start a new gold boom, the biggest in American history.
This time around, Federal records show, the prime beneficiaries are foreign-based corporations, not small prospectors. And the big companies are mining gold at a record rate from public land without paying a dime in royalties.
They are also rushing to convert the most valuable mines on Federal land to private holdings, paying the same rate as the "sourdoughs," the first crop of miners, did in 1872: $2.50 to $5 an acre. This year, private companies are trying to take title to taxpayer-owned land holding minerals worth more than $34 billion, according to estimates by the Mineral Policy Center, a private research group that tracks mining.
Critics lash out at the 1872 law as the last and greatest of the Old West giveaways, exploited well beyond its intent.
But its defenders, led by Western senators, say that even if the prospectors of 1994 are based in London, Brussels and Toronto, they provide high-paying jobs in small communities and keep alive a venerable industry. For many of these Westerners, the effort to change the mining law represents more than an economic threat; they see it as an attack on tradition and a way of life.
A showdown seems likely in Congress, where a bill to overhaul the law is threatened with a filibuster by Western senators.
All the arguments in the debate can be found here in Cooke City. Like two rivers born from the same source and then coming back to face each other after a meander through time and terrain, the 1872 mining law and the first national park are in direct conflict here.
 
The Debate
Fight for Control Of Vast Lands
 Three miles from Yellowstone National Park, Noranda Inc., a Canadian conglomerate, plans to hollow out a mountain that is said to contain more than $500 million in gold, silver and copper. For the Federal land, they will pay $225. While Yellowstone officials say the mine poses a half-dozen threats to water, wildlife and the general sanctity of the 2.2-million-acre preserve, Noranda, which is based in Toronto, says it can all but guarantee that a lake full of mine waste will not seep into the park.
The flash point at Yellowstone is part of a struggle that will set the tone for control of public lands well into the next century. Gold, which drew hordes of people to West, is now the source of one of the biggest fights over power in the 11 Western states, where half the land is in the Federal domain.
All Westerners live within an hour or so of some public land. But who controls that land -- be it mining companies, irrigators, cattlemen, wildlife advocates or Washington bureaucrats, all whom have been mixing it up in recent fights over mining, grazing, timber and water rights -- is at the heart of this latest battle for the West.
On one side are Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and two-thirds of the House of Representatives. Last year, the House passed a bill that would impose an 8 percent royalty on the values of minerals taken, eliminate the sale of land that now goes for the price of a large ballpark hot dog and set environmental standards for cleanups.
On the other side is a core group of Western senators and governors, who agree that the 1872 law needs changing but say the House bill would hurt mining companies, discourage exploration and put a clamp on a boom that has made the United States the second-leading gold-producing nation, behind South Africa.
"This would be the death knell of American mining," said Senator Malcolm Wallop, Republican of Wyoming.
Somewhat lost in the debate, supporters of the bill say, is the original intent of the law, which was to spur the economy and help the small prospector. While mining once drove the West's economy, it is now at the lowest level ever as a percentage of the overall jobs picture.
A total of 40,000 people -- fewer than 1 Westerner in 1,000 -- work in hard-rock mining, according to the Bureau of Mines. There are more people -- about 60,000 employees -- working for the ski industry in one state, Colorado, than there are hard-rock mine employees in the entire United States.
But the mining industry and some Western politicians say that the relatively high-paying jobs are the backbone of areas like Elko, Nev., and that the money has kept alive some dying towns.
The industry, which has a skillful lobby, longstanding support from crucial Western senators and a historic link to early white settlement, has been able to maintain power even as its economic importance has faded. The companies have succeeded in fighting back more than a decade of Congressional efforts to charge a royalty, and they expect to prevail this year, too.
Even if they are troubled by foreign dominance of mines, many Western politicians are willing to put aside their quibbles to fight the larger battle over control.
"They are trying to stick it to us, in every little way they can," said Senator Wallop of Mr. Babbitt's plans to charge mining royalties and higher grazing fees.
Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, said: "This is not about money. We are defending our Western heritage."
The real agenda behind the modern push to change how the land is used and what to charge for it, Senator Simpson says, is to drive out miners and cattle. "These people should have the guts to come out and say what they're really after," he said, referring to many of the new Western environmental groups. "They don't like cows because they poop too much. And they don't like mines because they mar the scenery. They would like to to get rid of them all."
As things now stand, mining is clearly the leading power over public lands, with more than 400 million acres at the industry's disposal. Though logging and livestock grazing is permitted in large parts of the open West, users pay regulated fees and are restricted by a host of environmental regulations.
"Tradition dies hard," Mr. Babbitt said. "The mining companies are saying: 'We've held our ground for 122 years. We're not going to give up now.' "
 
The Danger
Yellowstone Fear About Mine Waste
 Here in Cooke City, an eagle's flap of the wings from Yellowstone, Noranda has been trying to get title to 45 acres of national forest land to complete its holding in the New World Mine, in a high, forested valley above the park.
Under the law, if minerals are found, and a mine operator can prove he can take them out, the Government must sell the land at the 1872 price. In 122 years, more than 3.2 million acres have been sold, or patented, as the process is called.
Park rangers at Yellowstone say their worst nightmare is just a few hundred miles to the south, high in the San Juan range of the Rocky Mountains, where another Canadian company has left the Government with a $100 million cleanup job. After extracting 280,000 ounces of gold from the Summitville mine, Galactic Resources of Vancouver, British Columbia, declared bankruptcy in 1992 and left Colorado.
It left behind a leaking, toxic soup of cyanide and heavy metals; the waste has killed 17 miles of streams and polluted water supplies in lower valleys, infuriating farmers and fishermen. The Environmental Protection Agency is spending more than $40,000 a day to contain the disaster.
The West is full of dead rivers, rust colored from mine waste, a legacy of the fact that the 1872 mining law has no cleanup or reclamation requirements. There are more than 10,000 miles of dead streams, by one Federal estimate.
In Montana, the operators of the Noranda mine say they can pull eight million tons of ore out of a mountain that shadows Yellowstone, fill a 77-acre lake 10 stories deep with mine waste and then seal it for eternity, without threatening the park.
It will be a showcase mine, says Allan Kirk, chief geologist for the project.
Summitville, Mr. Kirk said, "was an embarrassment," and should not be held up as an example of what can happen here. He says the mine waste will be cradled in a high valley and cannot leak into the park.
But Stuart Coleman, the natural resource director of Yellowstone National Park, says there is no worse place to put a mine than here, nearly 10,000 feet above sea level, in one of the most seismically active areas of the continent, a home for grizzly bears and moose.
 
The Companies
Western Politics, Big Investments
 The last Western revolt against Washington, the Sagebrush Rebellion of the late 1970's, was a political movement focused on local control, keeping Federal bureaucrats at bay and opening more Federal land for mining, grazing and logging. The states felt that the Federal grip was so restrictive on so much land that it was stifling economic opportunity.
The 1990's fight, critics of the 1872 law say, appears to be more about holding on to century-old subsidies that have proved to be a bonanza to some companies. Nowhere is this more evident than in mining.
Trying to determine who controls mining, the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, reported in 1992 that 283 mining operators accounted for 92 percent of production.
Of the top 40 companies taking minerals from public land, 23 are subsidiaries of foreign corporations or are largely controlled by foreign companies, according to the Interior Department.
While these companies pay nothing for minerals, oil and coal companies have long paid billions for their right to take public resources, as the law requires. In the last 25 years, the American oil industry has paid nearly $100 billion in lease fees and royalties to the Government -- or 12.5 percent of sales.
The hard-rock mine owners argue that their ventures are highly speculative, with no guarantee of a profit, and that it is much easier to calculate risk and cost with oil, gas and coal.
Still, critics wonder how the big gold mining companies have been able to hold on to a privilege that the big oil companies lost more than 70 years ago. The reason, says Charles Wilkinson, professor of law at the University of Colorado, is because mining is the oldest and strongest of the "lords of yesterday" that have long held power in the West.
"The Western economy has settled into the comfort of a unique kind of welfare system," Mr. Wilkinson wrote in his book, "Crossing the Next Meridian" (Island Press, 1992).
But one person's welfare system is another's livelihood.
"There needs to be an incentive" to make the huge investment mining requires, said Terry Fiske, a vice president with Echo Bay Mines, a large operator based in Edmonton, Alberta.
The 1872 mining law was intended as a logical extension of the Homestead Act, in line with Jeffersonian thought about the small farmer, merchant or prospector.
The Congressional Record from 1872 shows clearly that the law was intended as a temporary measure to help the average American "build their little homes, improve the land, raise his peach trees and potatoes and conduct his mining and farming operations at the same time," as one Congressman put it.
In the first few years of the law, boom towns rose out of every other gully. Cooke City at one time had nearly 5,000 people (its current population is 100), as people panned for gold in streams and dug into mountainsides.
But once the surface gold was gone, prospectors became laborers. Picks and shovels were replaced by mountain-boring drills and train tracks deep into the earth. The mining towns that developed -- Butte, Mont.; Kellogg, Idaho; Park City, Utah, and Aspen, Colo. -- became hotbeds of unionism, not independent sourdoughs.
By 1940, three corporations -- Kennecott, Phelps Dodge and Anaconda -- controlled 80 percent of the West's copper output.
As markets for gold, silver and copper went flat, Western mines closed, leaving behind more than 500,000 abandoned sites and 50 billion tons of waste.
In the early 1980's, a new technology -- a process in which cyanide is used to leach out particles of gold invisible to the naked eye -- helped to spur a rush back to the old mines. The new mines required millions of dollars and were highly automated. So, even though the United States increased its gold output 10-fold in 12 years, the hard-rock mining industry shed nearly half its workers.
Modern techniques make it nearly impossible for a small operator to make any money, mining experts say. The most productive gold mines in Nevada use $6 million mechanical shovels and $1 million trucks. The tires alone, 12 feet in diameter, cost $20,000 apiece.
Mr. Kirk, the Noranda geologist, showed off a piece of ore with a swirled streak of gold embedded in the side. It is a core sample from deep inside Henderson Mountain, the peak above Yellowstone. But most gold yet to be mined will not be this visible. He said the company would have to mine nearly four tons of rock to get a single ounce of gold.
Asked if the 1872 law was ever meant to be used by companies the size of Noranda, Mr. Kirk shook his head.
"The 1872 law has served its purpose," he said. "It needs reform." But he said the House bill, with its 8 percent royalty, would discourage many smaller companies from looking for gold.
Last year, 10.6 million ounces of gold was mined in the United States -- three times as much as was taken in 1853, the peak of the California gold rush. About 43 percent of that gold was taken from public lands. When mine operators lease land from private owners, they often pay far higher royalties.
Mine owners have filed patent requests on 612 claims covering 240,000 acres, a threefold increase over the pace of decade ago.
In May, in what Mr. Babbitt called "a historic giveaway," the Interior Department gave a Canadian mining company title to one of the richest veins of gold in the United States. The agreement, ordered by a Federal judge, allowed the American Barrick Resources Corporation to obtain title to public land containing gold valued at $8 billion to $10 billion in Nevada. For the 1,800 acres in the claim, the company paid the Treasury $9,000.
The Canadian owners of the Nevada mine note that they have spent millions of dollars developing the ground and have played by all the rules. They say they provide a stable base of employment in a state dominated by gambling. In places like Elko, the streets are not exactly paved with gold from American Barrick's venture nearby, but the huge mine has brought a measure of visible prosperity.
Mining wages, on average, are far higher than in most blue-collar jobs in the West, though they last only until the gold is played out, or about 10 years for most newer mines operating now.
When asked why the United States has become the land of opportunity for foreign-based companies, the mine operators cite several reasons -- good roads, stable government, accessible ports, supportive politicians and the fact that the gold, copper, platinum and silver on public lands are free. Some Canadian provinces, by comparison, charge their own companies a royalty of up to 12 percent on the minerals they remove from the ground.
Although there are many American companies now riding the new gold boom, the foreign companies still dominate because they have been at it longer, building on new techniques developed when many American mines were dormant, experts say. Also, there are tax advantages for keeping the corporate base in another country while operating in the United States.
For the most part, they strictly follow the law, officials say. "They are ripping off the American people fair and square," Mr. Babbitt said.
A question remains about whether any small-time prospectors are still benefiting from the law that was set up to help them.
Senator Wallop said a significant change "would really hurt the small prospector, and believe me, there are a lot of them out there."
But a search for sourdoughs turns up a lot of abandoned mines and lonely hillsides. Here in Montana, the vast Gallatin National Forest near Yellowstone has more than 3,000 mining claims filed on it. But with those claims, there is only one active mine, said Sherm Sollid, chief geologist for the forest. That mine is run by a subsidiary of a Canadian-controlled company, TVX Gold Inc.
David Amsk, who works as a real estate agent and railroad employee in Livingston, Mont., owns several claims on 120 acres.
"I guess you'd have to call it a hobby," Mr. Amsk said. "There's no way I could be in a position to mine. That would cost millions."
But he made some money by leasing the land to a foreign-owned company.

HEADLINE: U.S. Officials Urge Caution On Arms Pact

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Clinton Administration officials expressed caution today about the accord that United States negotiators reached with North Korea to settle the dispute over its nuclear program, saying that North Korea has a lot to do to win the diplomatic recognition promised in the agreement.
The officials also said that major differences remain that could derail the agreement, in which the United States said it was prepared to establish closer diplomatic and economic ties in exchange for North Korea's promise to freeze its nuclear program and to stop reprocessing nuclear fuel into weapons-grade material. 
 "Progress has been made, but the lion's share of work is before us," said a White House official. "We'll judge the North Koreans by their performance."
Concerned that the North Koreans might fail to deliver on some of their promises, as has happened several times before, Administration officials refrained from trumpeting the agreement as a major breakthrough.
In interviews, several Administration officials sent strong signals to North Korea that if it was serious about normalizing relations and increasing trade with the West, it had to demonstrate through concrete actions that it was prepared to halt its program to separate the plutonium needed for nuclear weapons or to develop the weapons.
 
Commitment to Treaty
 With the accord, signed early today in Geneva, North Korea committed itself to ban all nuclear weapons and to remain a member of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which limits the spread of nuclear weapons. It also agreed to halt indefinitely all reprocessing of nuclear fuel and forgo reprocessing of 8,000 spent uranium fuel rods already extracted from a reactor, a procedure that would help it separate more plutonium.
In return, the United States said that it would work with its allies to help North Korea replace its existing graphite reactors with more modern light-water reactors, which are less capable of producing weapons-grade, fissionable material.
A senior official said that the United States might hesitate to exchange diplomatic missions with North Korea unless its Government agrees to let international inspectors investigate two nuclear waste sites where Washington thinks it can discover whether North Korea had made enough plutonium to make several nuclear bombs.
Assistant Secretary of State Robert L. Gallucci, Washington's chief negotiator in the talks that sought to break an 18-month dispute, said Friday that North Korea had agreed in principle to allow such inspections. At the same time, however, one North Korean official in Geneva vowed before the accord was reached never to permit such inspections.
Among the other areas where Administration officials are demanding concrete follow-through were North Korea's promise to stop building two large new reactors and its pledge to seal off its facility for reprocessing spent uranium rods into weapons-grade plutonium. "We're not going to take North Korea's word on faith," said a senior Administration official. "The freeze will be monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency in Pyongyang, and we'll keep our eyes on that."
 
'A Cautious Step Forward'
 Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security adviser and a frequent critic of the Clinton Administration's policy on North Korea, said in an interview that today's agreement was "a cautious step forward if everything in it is implemented."
"We've had a number of agreements with them over the last couple of years, none of which paid out," he said. "It's important to implement everything that needs to be implemented on the North Korean side before we start giving away things."
After repeated criticisms over the Administration's policy on North Korea, officials took pains today to assert that they were not being naive and that they would demand actions and not just words.
Although the United States and North Korea have scheduled the new set of high-level talks in Geneva on Sept. 23, American officials said they were certain there would be a multitude of low-level contacts before then.
American technicians will meet with North Koreans to discuss how to handle the 8,000 spent nuclear rods, which are in a cooling pond. The North Koreans say they fear that the rods will corrode dangerously if they are not removed soon. Not fully trusting North Korea, the Administration wants the rods reprocessed outside North Korea.
Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who once called for bombing North Korea's atomic facilities to end its nuclear threat, said the agreement "has some promising aspects to it." But he said that he feared that inspectors might still not gain access to the nuclear waste sites, and he said that he wanted North Korea to destroy, rather than seal, its reprocessing plants.
"If we can get an accounting for the original diversion, if we can satisfactorily dispose of the rods in the ponds and if we can dismantle the reprocessing plans and remove this threat, then we should certainly move forward" with diplomatic ties and other measures, he said.

HEADLINE: Cuban Exiles Not Pushing for Boatlift

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Fourteen years ago Derek Stirrup, hired by anxious Cuban-Americans here, picked up 43 of the tens of thousands of refugees who had left Cuba's port of Mariel and took them to the shores of Florida. This week, he could be found taking a group of tourists from Texas out for an afternoon of deep-sea fishing off Key West.
Cuba's leader, Fidel Castro, has threatened to clear the way to the United States for any Cuban who wants to leave, raising concern here of another huge wave of immigration. But Mr. Stirrup, the first mate of the 43-foot charter cabin cruiser Grand Slam, has not received any offers to help out again. Nor is he looking for any. 
 Another boatlift, he said, would help keep Mr. Castro in power. "If we hold out, I think we'll get his bluff and he'll be through," said Mr. Stirrup, 32, whose great-grandmother came from Cuba.
Mr. Stirrup's attitude reflects a consensus evident in both Florida and Washington that Americans should not allow another boatlift like the one that brought 125,000 Cubans to the United States from Mariel in 1980.
 
Support for of Clinton Stand
 Even the Cuban exiles who financed people like Mr. Stirrup last time say they support the Clinton Administration's efforts to prevent another Mariel by prosecuting those caught transporting refugees. Many are wary of the problems that Mariel wrought in Florida, but more important is the notion that keeping the discontented in Cuba may help bring Mr. Castro's downfall more quickly.
Nonetheless, some exiles find it difficult to reconcile political goals with humanitarian concerns. These include Omar Barrero, 55, who came here from Mariel with his wife and three children.
"It is very difficult," said Mr. Barrero, who found steady work in construction, bought a house and became grandfather to eight American-born children. "They are the ones who are in the bad situation."
 
Florida Prepares for Influx
 And in the nervous calm, Florida prepares. Miami's school board has already approved a contingency plan for makeshift special schools in movie theaters and other places. State agencies, under the direction of Gov. Lawton Chiles, have held drills on an emergency "mass immigration" response plan not unlike that used for hurricanes.
The plan envisions the transfer of immigrants out of the state by Federal authorities within 72 hours.
"Governor Chiles has worked very hard to seek assurances that Florida won't become the single spot where migration stays," said Ron Sachs, a spokesman for Mr. Chiles who noted that the state spent $150 million on the Mariel immigrants that was not reimbursed by the Federal Government.
Tension between Cuba and the United States has been heightened by the hijacking by defectors of four Cuban Government vessels in two weeks; in the most recent case, Mr. Castro asserted, a Cuban naval officer was killed. Mr. Castro says the United States has encouraged the hijackings by accepting the immigrants and has warned that he may open the ports again if it does not desist.
 
Cubans Offshore Daily
 All the while, Cubans are spotted off South Florida's coasts every day, with more than 729 arriving so far this month alone. The Clinton Administration warned this week that while it would continue to give refuge to those who escape the island it would prosecute smugglers.
The Administration made good on its warning this week by seizing boats and detaining several people suspected of smuggling Cuban refugees. These people now face up to five years in prison and fines of $250,000.
Among non-Cuban Miamians, there is a sense of vulnerability, if not of impeding disaster. Some say they will move out of the state if there is another boatlift.
"The United States has to draw the line in accepting refugees," said Todd Weintraub, 29, who sells decorative glassware. "How can we absorb 100,000 refugees when we have trouble taking care of ourselves?"
But there is also ambivalence. Fred Rubenstein, 50, a lifelong resident and nautical store owner who says he carries a gun because of the increase in crime since Mariel, worries about overcrowding. But he says he would welcome anyone who wants to come. "Immigration is how we all got here," he said.
Among Cuban exiles, too, there are mixed feelings. Many point at the first anti-government rioting in Havana this month as an omen of the beginning of the end. While in 1980 there was no realistic hope that Mr. Castro's government would collapse, they say, Mr. Castro has since been weakened by the loss of Soviet political and economic support and should not be aided by an exodus of the discontented.
Mr. Castro has said the migration is primarily the result of the United States embargo that he calls a "criminal economic blockade against our country." Like other Floridians, many Cuban-Americans are also gripped by memories of what Mariel has wrought. They remember the violence committed by criminals released by Mr. Castro, the school overcrowding, the shortage of housing and the the tarnished image of South Florida.
 
'A Conflict of Interest'
 "We have to take care of our city," said Pedro Freyre, 45, a lawyer who came to Miami in 1960 and who helps head a committee on Cuba for the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce. "We have children here. We're beginning to see the fruits of our labor. There's definitely a conflict of interest."
Even without a boatlift on the scale of Mariel, immigration officials say Cuban arrivals have grown significantly this year.
Since January, according to the Coast Guard, 5,450 Cubans have landed on Florida's shores, compared with 3,656 for the all of last year. And Dade County officials, who estimate their area ultimately absorbs the vast majority of the Cuban refugees, say that although the boats have captured the most media attention, about 1,000 Cubans a month become illegal immigrants by overstaying their tourist visas after arriving at Miami International Airport. The cost of that immigration is also a factor in Florida's cold reception toward Cuban refugees. Governor Chiles last March released a report that estimated that illegal immigration from Cuba, Haiti and other countries cost Florida $884 million a year, including $180 million in limited English-proficiency programs, $13 million in health care and social services and $28 million in law enforcement against criminal aliens. The state has sued the Federal Government for compensation of costs incurred in serving a population estimated at 345,000 illegal immigrants.
As they arrive in tattered clothes, sunburned and bleary-eyed but smiling, the refugees say they are escaping an island whose economy has deteriorated so much that necessities are nearly impossible to come by.
But even the most recent refugees say they are unsure that any more Cubans should be allowed to follow.
"It's not a good idea," said 20-year-old Alexander Mendez, who arrived on Thursday aboard a raft with three friends. "They'd have to tow the whole island to the United States."

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE WHITE HOUSE;
Administration Drawing Criticism for Unfocused Tactics in Lobbying on Health Care

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
It is true that the Clinton Administration did something else on Thursday besides beseech the public and Congress to support national health insurance. But the charts and battle maps of the White House's health care lobbying campaign suggest that anyone would have a hard time proving it.
On Thursday, the charts say, the Secretary of Health and Human Services was talking to Newsweek about health insurance, conducting interviews about health insurance by satellite with reporters in seven states and meeting with officials of the National Association of Public Hospitals. The Labor Secretary was talking about health insurance with U.S. News and World Report, the cable network CNBC and the editorial board of The Los Angeles Times. 
 The charts say the Energy Secretary was explaining health insurance to Louisiana reporters; the Transportation Secretary, Arkansas and Tennessee; the Veterans Affairs Secretary, Georgia; the Agriculture Secretary, Alabama and Louisiana; the budget director, the District of Columbia; the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, Connecticut; the chief economist, California; the head of the Small Business Administration, Rhode Island and the nation via C-Span. The Interior and Education Secretaries and the environmental administrator were doing radio interviews on health insurance in unspecified locales.
The White House chief of staff was on Capitol Hill. So was the deputy chief of staff in charge of lobbying for health insurance. Hillary Rodham Clinton was in Hartford, excoriating insurance companies for their opposition to national health insurance.
 
Many Generals in Trenches
 The President had planned to invite a bagful of House members to his office for a little arm twisting on health insurance, just as he did with about a dozen House members in a session earlier this week. But he was waylaid by the need to lobby for crime legislation.
In the war over legislation to overhaul the health insurance system, the White House strategy is to put all the generals -- scores of them -- into the trenches. It is an impressive way to fight, but some Democratic critics, including supporters of universal health insurance, say it is also one reason the Administration is having so much trouble.
In that view, the White House has lobbied on too many fronts and with far too many commanders when what is most needed -- especially now -- is a tightly focused attack on the wavering Democrats and Republicans in Congress. Instead, over the last 18 months, control over the effort has passed among any number of hands, from Mrs. Clinton to the President to five Congressional committees to the House and Senate Democratic leadership to a White House strategy team which has itself been subsumed under Mr. Clinton's new chief of staff, Leon E. Panetta.
"The problem with the White House's lobbying on this issue is a classic too-many-chiefs-and-no-Indians problem," one member of the Democratic leadership in Congress, who asked for obvious reasons not to be named, said in an interview on Friday. "They have so many people tripping over each other claiming they can make decisions that it's hard to get a straight answer on anything."
 
'A Major Undertaking'
 The reply to that complaint is that any legislative crusade for an issue as complex as national health insurance, and with as many well-financed opponents, has to be waged in as many places as possible.
"This is a major undertaking." said one aide to the House majority leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri. "The hunger for information is so great that everyone needs to be out there. Otherwise, lack of knowledge will be your undoing."
Indeed, both White House officials and their allies in Congress have said from the start that theirs is a grass roots strategy to mobilize the country behind universal insurance coverage, and then to use the tide of citizen support to wash away opposition in the House and Senate. They liken the current battle to the legislative crusades for Medicare and civil rights in the 1960's, when shifts in public opinion broke the back of conservative opposition in the very midst of House and Senate debates.
This time, public interest is again cresting as the debate begins. What is less certain is that the weight of opinion has again swung to the Democrats' cause. But that is not for lack of effort.
 
Many Cooks in Kitchen
 After a spring in which the Administration sat out of the health care debate while allies in Congress wrote legislation, the sort of White House campaign machinery that pushed some of Mr. Clinton's other disputed proposals into law has ground into action.
The head mechanic is Harold M. Ickes, the New York lawyer who holds the official title of deputy chief of staff and, more informally, the political brains behind the insurance battle. But it is hardly that simple. Mr. Ickes sets strategy not just with the approval of the Clintons, but also Mr. Panetta, who has appropriated an equal role in the process and who works personally with Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill. Both men work with Mr. Clinton's chief lobbyist, Pat Griffin, whose official responsibility is to round up the House and Senate votes the White House needs.
There is also a "war room," of course, a warren on the ground floor of the old office building next to the White House in which about 30 aides chart and execute Mr. Ickes's sales strategy. Teams of officials attack on separate fronts: lobbying Capitol Hill, courting the press, deploying the Cabinet, scheduling publicity events, and coordinating with private supporters like the unions that helped sponsor the bus caravans that rolled into Washington early this month.
And there is the First Lady's office, which has its own staff of health care experts and publicists to help promote Mrs. Clinton's vision of insurance legislation around the country.
 
Congress Given Information
 In fact, the morning staff meeting of White House lobbyists on health care is a small convention by itself: about 40 people, from Congressional aides to agency officials to a representative of the office of Vice President Al Gore's wife, Tipper.
That does not include the President and his top staff, who are busy by themselves. Mr. Griffin, and lately Mr. Panetta, have worked with House and Senate leaders on a roster of lawmakers who are most open to persuasion by the White House. Mr. Clinton has met personally with 40 or 50 and has telephoned dozens more; Mr. Gore, Mr. Panetta and Cabinet members have retraced their steps.
All 535 members of Congress have been given sheaves of paper explaining how various health insurance proposals would benefit their states or Congressional districts or, in the case of legislation the Administration opposes, how they would be hurt. The White House has dispatched Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Laura Tyson, the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, to brief a lawmaker or two personally on the Democratic proposals.
In the Senate, officials say Mr. Clinton has talked at length to about 20 senators, including 10 or 11 Democrats who are undecided whether to support the compromise version of national insurance being offered by the White House's chief ally, Senator George J. Mitchell, the majority leader. In the House, the Administration focuses on groups of recalcitrant members with similar concerns -- freshman Democrats, for example, who were elected on a pledge to cut the budget deficit and worry that an expensive new health care plan will push up spending.
"A lot of times, it's just walking people through the dynamics of what you're trying to accomplish," said the aide to Mr. Gephardt. "These are complicated issues, and a lot of members have detailed questions, very detailed questions about how this plan works."
It is an effort that sounds unwieldy, and it may be. But despite the political difficulty Mr. Clinton's insurance crusade appears to face, there is at least some evidence that his message is getting through.
Senator Ernest F. Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat, is one of those on the fence, and his home state has been bombarded with commercials, newspaper advertisements, manufactured news events and high-toned politicians on one side of the issue or the other.
In the past, Mr. Clinton has lost such opinion wars in conservative South Carolina. "During the budget debate last summer, the calls we got were resoundingly against the President's budget plan," said Andy Brack, an aide to Mr. Hollings. "But this time, it appears there are calls for and against the Administration."

HEADLINE: South Korea Sees North's Move as Helpful

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Long distrustful of its neighbor to the north, South Korea reacted positively but cautiously today to what analysts here called a surprisingly broad agreement reached in Geneva by the United States and North Korea.
Government officials and analysts here said that while the accord could defuse tensions on the Korean peninsula, it might end up being only another in a series of seemingly promising agreements made by North Korea that are never carried out. The South Koreans also said the agreement in Geneva failed to explicitly address one of South Korea's central concerns: that there be inspections of nuclear sites in North Korea in an attempt to determine whether it already has nuclear weapons. 
 Despite some misgivings, South Korea is expected to play a central role in providing North Korea with modern nuclear reactors, costing about $4 billion, as part the accord. The offer is expected to be made on Monday by President Kim Young Sam in a speech to commemorate the 49th anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule.
In a joint statement issued in Geneva this morning, North Korea agreed to forgo future production and processing of plutonium that could be used in bombs. In return, the United States promised to arrange for North Korea to receive modern light-water reactors, which produce less plutonium than the graphite-moderated reactors now being used. The two nations also agreed to take steps to establish diplomatic and economic relations.
 
Focus Turns to Neighbors
 With North Korea and the United States having resolved some of their differences, attention will now turn to whether North and South Korea can resume their dialogue. They had been planning an initial summit meeting on July 25, but it was postponed after the death of Kim Il Sung, the longtime North Korean leader.
Analysts expect that South Korea's President, in his speech on Monday, will try to restore a more positive atmosphere and will reiterate the South's readiness to engage in dialogue with the North, though he will stop short of calling for the summit meeting to be rescheduled.
But if there is to be any thaw in North-South relations as a result of the Geneva accord, it was not evident here today. North Korea's official news agency continued to issue diatribes against the South. And the South Korean police again clashed with students who wanted to hold a pro-North Korean rally in honor of Korea's liberation from Japan.
Perhaps not to upstage President Kim, and perhaps out of caution, the Government here issued only a brief statement today in which it said it took a "positive view" of the Geneva agreement because it set forth the principles for future negotiations. The statement, issued by the Foreign Ministry, also said Seoul would closely cooperate with Washington to "completely resolve" the North Korean nuclear issue.
"We also consider that North Korea has taken a step in the right direction to insure past, present and future nuclear transparency," it said.
 
Wanted Inspections Missing
 Several analysts and newspaper editorials here expressed disappointment that the agreement did not explicitly call for inspections of two suspected nuclear waste dumps that could hold clues to the question of whether North Korea has reprocessed plutonium and therefore might now have atomic bombs.
Robert L. Gallucci, the chief American negotiator, said in Geneva today that the accord includes language that, while not explicit, commits North Korea to agree to an inspection of those sites, but North Korean officials disputed this.
It was Pyongyang's refusal to allow inspections of those sites that prompted it to threaten to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in March 1993, setting off the nuclear crisis. Unless this issue is resolved, commentators said, South Korea will still be troubled by the threat of a nuclear attack.
"It's a positive step forward, but it doesn't really take care of the one fundamental concern that we have," said Kim Kyung Won, president of the Seoul Forum for International Affairs and a former Ambassador to the United States.
 
Distrust Behind Skepticism
 Another cause for skepticism here is the deep distrust of North Korea and a belief that it does not live up to its agreements.
"We've had such bad experiences with North Korea in our long negotiations," said Cha Young Koo, a researcher at the Government-sponsored Korea Institute for Defense Analysis.
About two and a half years ago, North and South signed a broad agreement calling for economic cooperation, cultural exchanges, communications and other measures. The two signed a declaration calling for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. But neither agreement amounted to much in practice because the two sides could not agree on detailed adherence.
The Geneva accord also includes some diplomatic risks for Seoul. There is some fear here that a reconciliation between Pyongyang and Washington could result in Seoul's being isolated. That clearly seems to be the intention of North Korea, which has all along insisted on dealing with Washington alone. However, Washington consulted frequently with South Korea during the Geneva negotiations to make sure its ally did not feel left out.
The Pyongyang-Washington agreement to move to normalize relations could also mean that Japan and European countries will also move to recognize North Korea. That would undo some of the leverage South Korea gained by establishing relations with Russia and China, both of which had been North Korea's two main allies.
As for the summit meeting between North and South Korea, Seoul's position is that because North Korea postponed the meeting, North Korea should restart the process. In addition, Seoul wants to see Kim Jong Il, the son and presumed successor of the late Kim Il Sung, officially be given the position as head of state. It is therefore likely that some lower level dialogues will resume first.
Analysts here said that the Geneva agreement shows that Kim Jong Il -- or whoever is running North Korea these days -- is placing a high priority on economic affairs. But others cautioned that it was too early to say how, or whether, Kim Jong Il is departing from the policies of his father, who had set in motion the negotiations that led to today's agreement.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
North Korea's Foreign Policy
 GENEVA, Aug. 13. (Reuters) A senior North Korean official said today that he expected no foreign policy changes under Kim Jong Il.
The statement, by Deputy Foreign Minister Kang Sok Ju, appeared intended to counter speculation of a power struggle or major policy change. He said North Korea remained committed to unifying the Korean peninsula and easing tension over its nuclear program.
Mr. Kang, who concluded the agreement with the United States today over Pyongyang's disputed nuclear program, asserted that Kim Jong Il had overseen all aspects of Government policy for 20 years before the death last month of his father, President Kim Il Sung.
Asked about North Korea's chain of command and how he consulted with Pyongyang, he said all policy was discussed democratically by the officials concerned before being sent to a "higher destination" for approval.
"Our dear leader comrade Kim Jong Il has been overseeing the overall affairs of our country -- political, military, economic and foreign affairs -- for as long as 20 years," Mr. Kang said. "So I think from that perspective you can make your own judgment as to how we got the final approval."

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE;
Excerpts From the Debate in the Senate on Health Care Legislation

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from statements made yesterday on the Senate floor in the fifth day of debate over the health care bill, as transcribed by The New York Times from a broadcast on C-Span:
 
 
STATEMENT BY SENATOR COHEN
 In the fall of 1992 Senator Dole, Senator Chafee, myself and several others approached the majority with a list of what we called 11 points of commonality between Republican and Democratic proposals. And we met with the majority leader's task force on more than one occasion to press for these reforms, on which there was broad-based bipartisan agreement. And they were significant steps that we believe could and should immediately slow the growth of health care costs and increase access to quality health care for millions of Americans. And frankly, Mr. President, we were rebuffed. We were told that the reforms were not comprehensive enough and anything short of comprehensive reform would not do. 
 Mr. President, let me say very frankly it was a stall; it was a stonewall. I believe it was a political tactic to delay any reforms until the elections were over in November. That's what happened.
The Democratic majority wanted a perfect issue and not an imperfect solution, a perfect political issue at that time because we had broad-based agreement and we could have passed something.
So here we are, two years later, still talking about the same principles on which we know there's broad-based bipartisan agreement. Portability, no pre-existing condition exclusion, affordable coverage, standard access, emphasis on prevention, cost containment, administrative simplification and stronger efforts to combat fraud and abuse. We all agree on those provisions, and they're part of the Dole-Packwood bill; they're also part of the Mitchell bill.
The problem is that the majority leader's bill goes far beyond those areas of agreement and I believe would drastically alter the delivery of health care in this country.
Now I've listened to the debate and I must tell you, I have been moved by the recitation of the tragic stories that have affected and have afflicted so many thousands and perhaps millions of Americans who lack the kind of health insurance coverage the current system fails to provide. And I can't agree more that we must do something -- everything we can -- to correct the situation for the families who are suffering on a daily basis.
But what's most tragic of all, Mr. President, is that virtually every single situation that has been so poignantly described in this chamber during the past portion of four days would have been helped immediately -- would have been helped immediately by the proposals set forth by Senator Chafee, myself and others. All of those situations would have been covered, virtually all, maybe one exception. . . .
And we're told that the President of the United States is now pursuing a 51-vote strategy. Mr. President, let me suggest that may -- may -- and I'll talk about that at length in a moment -- it may be in the political interests of the President to pursue that strategy. I think it's bad for the country. And let me just suggest why.
 
Questions of Strategy
 If we are to pursue a 51-vote strategy in this chamber, or 52-vote and perhaps one or two more, I can assure you that the very next thing that's going to happen after the elections in the fall, we on the Republican side expect to gain several more votes; it may be one, it may be two, conceivably could be ten, but whatever the number -- I don't want to alarm the chairman of the Finance Committee, just a moment, but let's say anywhere from one to five, let me compromise -- that we expect may come to our side. In any event, what will take place, whatever the margin is of increase, I can almost assure you, from the day we come back into session next January an effort will be made to undo the legislation that passes by a 51-vote strategy.
And the President will sit in the White House, and he will exercise his veto, and depending upon how many members are added to this side of the aisle, he may be successful. He will spend the next two years of his Administration vetoing legislation. . . .
Mr. President, I -- I have a profound sense of -- of apprehension about any strategy that seeks to ram something through on a party-line basis on something this important because there are people of good will on both sides. There are many good things in the Mitchell amendment, and there are many good things in Senator Dole's proposal as well -- in the Dole-Packwood proposal.
The decisions we make in the -- in the coming weeks are going to have a profound consequence for every single American. It's going to control the future direction of one-seventh of our nation's economy. And we shouldn't even begin to contemplate enacting sweeping reforms unless they're broad-based and bipartisan.
 
STATEMENT BY SENATOR MOYNIHAN
 Mr. Mitchell, the majority leader, said today that issues raised by bipartisan moderates such as by Senator John H. Chafee appeared to be negotiable.
And of course they are.
I think we all need to ask ourselves what particular form of ineffectiveness, of almost entropic decline in our capacity to produce results. Whether it's institutional, systemic, I don't know.
Twenty-five years ago, a Republican President -- you can say that now -- proposed a guaranteed income which twice passed the United States House of Representatives and died in the Senate.
There were those who said it was too much and those who said it was too little. And those who made the calculation that -- my goodness! -- if a Republican will do this, think what the next Democrat will do.
That same Republican President proposed universal health care and employer mandates. And I'm standing three feet from the Republican manager of the bill here -- Senator Packwood -- who introduced it. And again the calculation was made: Some thought it too much, but on our side some said it was not enough. We can get more. Think -- if that man would give us this, think how much more we get.
And got nothing.
Now that is the record: We got nothing. A quarter-century of impasse, and I think it's only the spirit in which he speaks that we will move on. Because, you know, we're not -- we are not getting better in some respects. . . .
We've not been looking to our affairs very competently, and we continuously, continually miss these opportunities. There is an element of the neurotic in this: the element of the individual who repeatedly states one desire and behaves in a way that thwarts that desire -- a very common neurotic pattern. I don't have to tell a person of the, of the Senator from Maine's insight with these matters.
I thank him for his address. I yield the floor.
 
STATEMENT BY SENATOR WELLSTONE
 Madame President, let me start off or start out with the obvious, because I think it's been lost in some of the debate. The obvious point is that the Mitchell bill, which represents a lot of hard work on the part of the majority leader, nevertheless, for a very long period of time, leaves out some 14 million Americans. It's not a universal coverage bill.
And most people who were following this debate and who think about their own lives understand that when 14 million people are left out, that could very well be them. . . .
But the fact of the matter is, whereas the President promised affordable health care, the majority leader's bill still leaves all too many families, when we get beyond this care and these services, but other services people need and other health care they need, still paying up to 20 percent of their family income. . . .
The majority leader has really made an effort to bring a bill to the floor, and I applaud him for that. But then I see discussion of some of these other efforts. Yesterday we had the Boren-Nunn-Domenici-Bennett bill introduced and I just would have to say, and maybe later on this is a point of debate, there's no universal coverage -- 90 percent of Americans, still talking about 24 million men, women and children without protection. That's what C.B.O. is going to say. . . .
Madame President, then I read The New York Times today and I get the sense that the majority leader's bill, which is not universal coverage, which is not the same benefits that we have, which is not employers contributing 70-some percent, which is what we have, may yet be even further weakened. We've got all sorts of other discussions about how to water down the bill and weaken the bill while at the same time, over and over and over again, the vast majority of people in the country keep saying they're for universal coverage. The vast majority of the people in the country keep saying they're for employers paying their fair share.
Madame President, these pieces of legislation or alternatives, which further weaken the majority leader's bill, which is quite weak in present form -- I, myself, have made no decision whether I can support this bill in present form, much less if it's weakened. I think then support would be very problematical -- do nothing about the trend. 1980, 24.2 million Americans uninsured. 1992, 38.9 million. We can't be talking about legislation that keeps things as they are or weakens the proposal, given the kind of trends we see within our country. . . .
Today, I sent a letter to the majority leader, actually with my colleagues, Senator Simon, Senator Feingold, Senator Moseley Braun, Senator Metzenbaum and Senator Harkin. And what -- and I will just read from a couple of paragraphs.
"As we continue to support your efforts to achieve portable health care coverage for every American, we want you to know that we are gravely concerned about several aspects of the bill you've introduced. Further movement away from the goals of universal affordable coverage would cause us to question even more seriously our ability to support the bill."
 
Strengthening the Bill
 Mr. President, I want to make it clear that we meant those words, and we'll be meeting with the majority leader at 11 o'clock Monday. I won't read from the rest of this letter but I will tell you, Mr. President, that for myself -- and I think I speak for some of my colleagues, although they have very important amendments as well -- we're ready to come to the floor with amendments to strengthen this bill. . . .
There is no reason why we can't achieve universal coverage for everyone sooner by having an earlier time line for insurance reforms insure getting an employer mandate by 1999 if necessary. We'd like to find a way to get to what was the commitment we made earlier.
Number two, Mr. President, we ought to improve the contributions that employers make. If the United States Congress, if in our case our employer contributes 70 percent of the premium, then we should have an amendment that says that as a matter of fact in this health care reform plan, that should be exactly the way we move to finance it. The same quality plan, as good as what we have. . . .
But I want to say today on the floor of the Senate that we have now reached the point where the majority leader has brought out a bill. It's got some fundamental weaknesses. He believes it's a first step. I hope it will be a first step. Right now, I'm not sure. But what I do know is that some of these alternative efforts just simply weaken it and water it down to the point where I guess all of us can have a fancy name and an acronym and say we've done something great, but certainly it doesn't live up to once we what said -- what we once said, which is: We ought to make sure that each and every citizen, each and every man, woman and child, can afford humane, decent health care for themselves, their loved ones and their children. . . .
If this bill gets further weakened, if this reform effort is hijacked, then there are some of us in the Senate who I think are going to fight as hard as we know how to.
And certainly I view this meeting with the majority leader on Monday as being important. It is quite one thing to present your very best as a reform effort and say it's a step forward. It is quite one thing to say don't make the perfect the enemy of the good. I agree. It's quite another thing to get to the point where you've got a piece of legislation that's so weakened, so watered down, so hijacked, so blocked by all those huge interests that have poured all that money into senators and representatives, with all their power and clout, with the people who need this reform the most left out. It's like the people who need the change don't have the power and the people who have the power don't want the change. When we reach that point -- and I think we're close to it -- I think there are a number of us in the Senate that will draw, quote, the line in the sand on that.

William S. Cohen
 Republican of Maine. A moderate, Mr. Cohen is a member of the self-described "mainstream coalition" seeking to find a compromise bill that can attract a bipartisan majority in the Senate. He comes from the same state as the majority leader, Senate. George Mitchell, and the two have a cordial reliationship.
 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan
 Democrat of New York. The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Moynihan has bipartisan credentials, having served in both Republican and Democratic Administrations before coming to the Senate. His committee steered away from many elements in the Clinton Administration's initial health care proposals, and the legislation it produced, after further modifications, formed the backbone of the proposal under debate in the Senate.
 
Paul Wellstone
 Democrat of Minnesota. A liberal freshman Senator who taught the politics of protest at Carleton College. He favored a health care bill providing universal coverage entirely financed by the Government through a Canadian-style single payer plan, something with little support in the Senate. A member of the Labor Committee, which passed a more liberal health care bill than the Finance Committee's, he wants to strengthen the Mitchell bill.

HEADLINE: Republicans Uneasy About Giuliani Effort on Crime Bill

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's offer to help President Clinton revive the crime bill in Congress showed no immediate results yesterday, even as there were signs of dissatisfaction from the Mayor's fellow Republicans.
On Friday, the Republican Mayor appeared with the Democratic President in Washington and Minneapolis and promised to lobby House members who had scuttled the bill. But yesterday, one of the members closest to the Mayor, Representative Susan Molinari of Staten Island, said no amount of cajoling would change her position on the bill as written. 
 Ms. Molinari, a Republican, said she would support only a tougher bill that included such provisions as an amendment that would allow prior convictions of sexual offenders to be admitted more easily as evidence in court.
And even though Ms. Molinari and her politically established family on Staten Island were vital supporters of Mr. Giuliani in his mayoral campaigns, Ms. Molinari expressed dissatisfaction that the Mayor had sided so visibly with the President.
"It was a little disconcerting to see him on the stage with the President when he gave one of his most partisan speeches yet," she said of the Mayor's appearance beside Mr. Clinton at the National Association of Police Officers in Minneapolis on Friday.
Mr. Giuliani spent the day yesterday visiting friends and family on Long Island. A spokesman, Manuel Papir, said the Mayor did not want to comment on his lobbying, including whom he had called or what he had said. On Friday, aides said the Mayor would call 8 to 10 members of Congress.
Ms. Molinari said the Mayor had not contacted her -- either before flying to Washington or since returning. Asked about the Mayor's offer to lobby, she said, "To be frank, I would have expected a little more communication up to this point."
In light of Ms. Molinari's remarks, it was unclear how much success Mr. Giuliani could have in winning over votes for the bill.
The only other member of the city's 14-member delegation who voted against the bill was Charles B. Rangel, the influential Democrat from Harlem who has differed with Mr. Giuliani on such matters as the location of an economic empowerment zone and the merger of the city's three police forces. Mr. Rangel did not return a telephone call yesterday seeking comment.
 
Risks and Benefits
 For Mr. Giuliani, the first Republican Mayor of New York in a generation, the highly visible appearance with the President and his promise to rally support for a bill he praised as good for the city held both risks and benefits.
In a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans 5 to 1, Mr. Giuliani could reap the rewards of national exposure on a law-and-order issue. One aide said yesterday that the Mayor's office had been pleased with news accounts of Mr. Giuliani's appearance beside -- and even applauding -- Mr. Clinton.
At the same time, Mr. Giuliani could risk offending his Republican colleagues in New York and Washington, who have fought the Democrats over the crime bill.
In Washington, party leaders did not criticize Mr. Giuliani openly. Tony Blankley, a spokesman for Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip in the House, said it was understandable for the Mayor -- or any other elected official -- to support a bill that would have a local benefit.
"We understand he's representing the City of New York," Mr. Blankley said. "There was a lot of money being offered up in the package, and it's perfectly reasonable for the Mayor to do what he needs to do for his constituents."
Still, he said, the Republicans in the House had to worry about "the proper national approach."
 
'An Embarrassing Cousin'
 But other Republican officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said yesterday that some party officials were dismayed by Mr. Giuliani's coziness with Mr. Clinton.
One Republican who would speak for attribution, Jay Severin, a political strategist, said it made sense for Mr. Giuliani to demonstrate over and over for Democratic New Yorkers the fact that "he is not a right-wing Republican."
The difficulty is that the effort could turn him into "an embarrassing cousin" within his own party, Mr. Severin said. "This is a very fine line," he said.
Representative Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat who was one of the bill's chief sponsors, praised the Mayor yesterday. He said Mr. Giuliani's crime-fighting credentials as a former Federal prosecutor could help sway members of the house in New York and its suburbs, Republicans and Democrats.
"We only need to switch eight votes," Mr. Schumer said. "If the Mayor can switch just one or two, that would be a godsend."

HEADLINE: Canadian Gem Scheme Leaves Americans Holding the Stones

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 13

 BODY:
He had bought old coins in the 1970's, when investments in something solid seemed the best hedge against rampant inflation. Dr. Kane Zelle, now a retired gynecologist from Tequeste, Fla., held on to the coins for two decades. But in January 1993 he received what appeared to be a very tempting offer in a letter from a Toronto gemstone trading company.
There was just one hitch: the buyer would purchase the coins only if Dr. Zelle first bought two emeralds. A few days later, Dr. Zelle mailed checks for $6,750 and $5,400 to the gemstone company, Gheko Fox Yamoto. But a week before he was supposed to sell his coins and emeralds, the company disappeared, and an appraiser told him that his new emeralds were worth only $900. 
 "I'm old enough I should never have been suckered into this thing," said Dr. Zelle, who is 77. "I'm really embarrassed by it."
Dr. Zelle was not the only person to be duped. Hundreds of people across the United States were caught up in what the authorities described as the largest telemarketing scam in Canada.
 
$35 Million Fraud
 By early 1993, Canadian officials were already investigating Gheko Fox Yamoto, which operated out of an office building in Markham, Ontario, 10 miles north of Toronto. But it was not until a cluster of complaints from Pennsylvania in March of that year that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Metropolitan Toronto Police fraud squad joined the Federal Trade Commission and the United States Postal Inspection Service in the inquiry.
Last month, a Federal grand jury in Harrisburg, Pa., indicted 25 people and eight corporations, all affiliated with Gheko Fox Yamoto, as well as nine other people and two other corporations on charges they bilked up to 1,000 people out of a total of $35 million. Six defendants have pleaded guilty. Next week, at least three more Canadian gem sellers will be arraigned in Federal District Court in Harrisburg.
What was unusual about the fraud was that Canadian salespeople preyed on American investors who already owned gemstones, or in some cases coins. Consumers thought they were selling their gemstones; instead, they became buyers.
 
'Commitment Trap'
 Officials say the mastermind of the scheme was Robert MacFarlane, whose operation seemed to fit the pattern of what Dr. Anthony R. Pratkanis, an associate professor of psychology at the University of California at Santa Cruz and co-author of "The Age of Propaganda: Everyday Use and Abuse of Persuasion," calls "the commitment trap." As part of the trap, the salesperson establishes himself as an authority figure and then in stages lures the investor into becoming more involved.
Around 1990, Mr. McFarlane obtained lists of coin and gemstone investors from the late 1970's and early 1980's, the authorities said. He hired salespeople who called the investors and insisted that the gemstone owners send in the certificates of authenticity before the exchange would agree to sell the investor's stones. Sometimes, the officials said, the salespeople would warn that an "overseas buyer" would make the deal only within the next 48 hours, so the American investors had to act quickly to buy any additional gemstones needed to complete the portfolio, in Dr. Kane's case emeralds.
In a second round of calls, the salespeople would say that the deal had fallen through, but that they had found another buyer. Except this one did not want emeralds, he wanted rubies. The scenario, officials said, would be replayed time after time.
The Canadian companies actually sent real gems of demonstrably low quality to the American investors, and often insisted that investors call the International Better Business Bureau. But an International Better Business Bureau does not exist, and all calls were forwarded to the same suburban Toronto office in which the salespeople worked.
 
Company After Company
 Sgt. Ronald J. Belanger of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said that Mr. MacFarlane earned $10 million in two years, then sold his interest for $300,000 in 1991 to three associates, Allen Grossman, Michael Schaumer and Eugene Yermus, trading as Gheko Fox Yamoto Capital Management as well as Equity Control Exchange, International Exchange Board, Capital Exchange Board and Associated Overseas Investor Services. In one year, they made $22 million. A fourth man, Paul Demsky, who was indicted separately along with eight associates, was a MacFarlane salesman who broke off and formed Pan-Asia Asset Management Exchange and gave office space to Pacific Tower Asset Management Exchange. The two exchanges grossed $3.3 million from June 1992 to April 1993.
Involvement by the American authorities in the case began after Robert G. Finkbeiner, the 52-year-old director of Lutheran Social Services in York, Pa., filed a complaint in March 1993 with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. By then he had already paid Associated Overseas Investor Services $1.2 million, most of it borrowed from his employer, banks and several individuals.
He said he was initially contacted by the company in July 1992 and asked whether he wished to sell gemstones bought years before. But to complete the portfolio, a salesman told him, he had to buy another gemstone. Mr. Finkbeiner did, but when it came time to sell the completed portfolio, there was a problem. As it turned out, there would always be a problem: the size of the stones, or the number, or simply that the "purchaser" was getting divorced, went bankrupt or died. Mr. Finkbeiner's debts mounted as the Toronto businessmen threatened that subsequent deals would be lost if he didn't increase his investment. He was "just terrorized by that thought," he told his lawyer, Richard K. Renn of York. He told the banks he was borrowing money to invest in his brother's business, Mr. Renn said.
 
Losing Everything
 Mr. Finkbeiner was indicted in Federal District Court on counts of bank fraud and mail fraud, and also was charged by the state with theft by deception and forgery. He pleaded guilty last May to all the charges and is serving a 15-month sentence at the Allenwood Federal prison camp in Montgomery, Pa., concurrent with an 18- to 36-month state sentence. On May 18, he was removed from the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America's list of ordained ministers on May 18.
After Mr. Finkbeiner complained to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, "we were besieged with complaints from every conceivable state in the union," Sgt. Belanger said.
In March 1993, the Mounted Police seized the computer records of the Canadian company. Although the businessmen thought they had erased all pertinent information, Canadian computer experts were able to retrieve the financial records of the entire operation.
The National Consumers League, a national fraud information center, receives from 250 to 300 consumer calls daily to its consumer telephone line (1-800-876-7060) and encourages potential investors to stand back, think about the purchase, call somebody, talk to an accountant and never invest in something about which they know nothing.
Gemstone fraud, which has been escalating over the past three years, represents 30 percent of the dollar value of complaints in all telemarketing fraud reported to the Federal Trade Commission, said Robert D. Friedman, assistant director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the commission. The 10 indicted companies alone account for one-third of the total dollar volume of complaints, Mr. Friedman said.
Richard H. Grove, 68, a Carrollton, Ohio, pipeline foreman, holds out a slim hope that he might see some of the $100,000 he invested from 1991 to 1993. He bought his first stone in 1980 and his last in 1989, all through telephone sales. Then the calls reversed and he was enticed to sell his stones. "Every time they said they had them sold," Mr. Grove said, "but by the time they got around to settling up, they wanted you to buy another stone, or pay the commission up front."
Mr. Grove added: "I have my downer days, when you kind of hate yourself for getting into this mess. I had a guy call from Toronto the other day, and he wanted to sell my stones. I said 'I thought you were in jail!' He never did call me back."

HEADLINE: A Russian Outpost Now Happily Embraces Asia

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KHABAROVSK, Russia, Aug. 8

 BODY:
Strange things are happening in this graceful port on Russia's Asian frontier. A popular Korean takeout place has opened at the corner of Leo Tolstoy and Kim Yu Chen Streets. Women are wearing cotton sundresses bought from Chinese salesmen who live across the border, 20 miles away. A visitor from Seattle has set up an espresso bar.
And at the top of the city's Intourist Hotel, part of a chain that in most Russian cities still seems about as innovative as an old Communist Party boss, Japanese businessmen perform karaoke and eat Tokyo-quality sushi (while paying for it with fistfuls of yen.) 
 Built more than 100 years ago on the Amur River as a fortress against the menace from the East, Khabarovsk has seen the future, and it is not in Moscow.
"We belong to the East," said Galina I. Lysenko, the deputy economic director of the Khabarovsk region, which has 1.6 million people but is twice the size of Japan and runs from the Manchurian border to Magadan. "The world, even in Russia, is reforming along new lines, and the only thing that makes sense for us is to integrate ourselves into the economics of Asia."
That has always made sense for what is essentially an Asian city, of course, but until the end of Communism it had never really been possible. Although Khabarovsk is far closer to Seoul and Tokyo than to Moscow, this part of the Russian Far East chafed for decades as bureaucrats sat in the Soviet capital and decided how much housing was needed here, where local officials could buy their textiles, what crops they should plant, and how much heat was required to survive the harsh winter.
 
In a New Orbit
 Now, with official blessings -- and a few misgivings -- from a federal Government that has been struggling hard to reward economic innovation, Khabarovsk has edged steadily into the orbit of the countries it was created to defend against: China, Japan, Korea. Suddenly hotel lobbies are full of American mining executives and Japanese geologists planning their next trip to forage for gold or diamonds. Russian workers who still shop on Lenin Square and stroll down Marx Prospect are struggling to learn Japanese or Korean.
The city's brave new freedom has found it looking East more and toward the center of the country less every month. This has caused some concern among many people here, who do not want to lose their ties to Russia. And it has also worried officials in Moscow who have long relied on this region's cheap, plentiful commodities. But these days, geography, not politics, often determines destiny in Russia
"We can't do it any other way in a free-market economy," said Mrs. Lysenko, who has been leading the move toward integration with Khabarovsk's Asian trading partners. "The transportation costs of shipping materials and receiving consumer goods from central Russia are too much for us to afford."
More than 250 joint ventures are operating here now, dozens having started in the past year. So far most big companies have only a symbolic presence and employ few local workers. But some -- Gold Star for example -- have already hired several hundred residents to make televisions.
South Koreans alone have opened 39 new businesses -- from manufacturing companies to restaurants -- since July 1993. The Japanese, who have the biggest, and in most ways the most visible, presence here, have had trouble keeping up their initial brisk pace because return on investment has been slow. And American companies, particularly Western mineral and timber concerns, have suddenly started showing up as well.
 
Much Wealth Is Undeveloped
 Part of the reason for all the action is that this region oozes with undeveloped wealth. The Khabarovsk territory leads the Russian Far East in logging and lumber production, and its trove of minerals and metals is practically unparalleled in the world. For companies looking to cash in on the next great boom town, this area seems as good a bet as any to be the modern Klondike.
"If you are not here now you don't deserve to be in this business," said Nikolai T. Yakouba, the general director of Russian Far East trade for JK International, an American timber company based in Oregon. "When it all goes, it's all going to go very, very fast."
But when, and whether, "it" will all go remain major and unanswerable questions. Good will and desire can get a company only so far. Economics have to do the rest, and Khabarovsk is in no way immune to the problems that have beset Russia as the country gropes its way toward a new economic structure.
There are more than 100 factories in the region, most of them pitifully out of date. The slump in national production -- official figures put the drop at 25 percent compared with the same period last year -- has been at least as brutal here as anywhere else.
Nearly every enterprise is in debt to somebody -- a business or the Government. Many have already had to close for two or three months this year because there was not enough money to pay fuel bills. Inflation, while lower than it has been, still causes havoc with personal buying power. Many factories are unable to pay full wages and unemployment looms on the horizon.
To help the situation along, the city has taken some of the most aggressive steps in the country to attract foreign investment. Because it needs help getting its great mineral wealth out of the ground, it has rewarded any foreign company that comes in and tries to do it. Registration of foreign companies, so onerous in many parts of Russia, usually takes two days. The first two years after a foreign company declares a profit it remains exempt from local taxes. If its investment of foreign capital is more than $5 million, the exemption lasts three years.
 
Rapidly Changing Rules
 The rules of economic life change so rapidly in Russia it is almost impossible to measure them, particularly in the Far East. Last year, according to local economic data, almost 10 percent of all accumulated investment in the Khabarovsk area was from foreign companies. While this might seem like a low figure, it is twice what it was two years ago. In addition, the region earned $150 million in essential hard-currency exports to Asia last year -- again not much, but more than any other area in Siberia or the Far East.
"They are doing everything they can to help us," said Sekijima Ryoichi, the local representative of Mitsui, the Japanese trading giant. "The government here understands that our profits will be their profits. And that if we can make it, so will they."
But as Mr. Ryoichi sits surrounded by the expensive goods he imports -- Sony stereos, Panasonic televisions, Yamaha outboard motors, Lipton tea -- he concedes that the market in this city of 600,000 has not grown as fast as he had originally hoped. "You have to be committed for a very long time," he said. "But eventually we think it will all pay off."
Not all companies agree with him. The Japanese, first here with their high-quality merchandise, have taken another look and most have decided to slow their pace. Extravagant plans to expand the international airport, which already has flights to Anchorage, Seoul, Harbin, China, and Niigata, Japan, have been put on hold. Japanese backing has not disappeared, but it has slowed considerably.
There are not too many people here buying Walkmans or fancy rice boilers, so Chinese peddlers have become the dominant sales force. They sell cheap clothing, instant noodles and lots of junky toys.
 
Chinese Cause Concern
 People here worry about the Chinese influence, in part because of the low quality of the goods they import and partly because they do not bring much money into the economy. There is also a personal animosity based on years of tension between two poor, but competing, superpowers.
The Russian manager at the fancy new Sapporo Hotel here, where every room has a temperature control panel, Japanese heaters on the toilet seats, and a stereo console next to the bed, admitted in an interview that Chinese guests are not welcome, though not exactly forbidden.
"They don't carry themselves well," said the manager, Anatoly M. Dolinsky. "They are loud and rude and don't take good care of the rooms."
South Koreans meet a different sort of welcome, however. They are among the fastest growing employers in the region, with a new Gold Star television factory north of the city and several other manufacturing plants planned.
"They are here to help us," said Mr. Dolinsky, whose clientele, nonetheless, is virtually all Japanese and whose hotel has a 10-foot-high Japanese flag in the lobby. "And we do need the help."

HEADLINE: With 2 Valdez Trials Down, Big One Is Coming Up

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER 

 BODY:
Now that the jury in the Exxon Valdez trial in Alaska has reached its second verdict, both sides in the exhausting legal contest that has lasted all summer are making preparations for the third and most important stage.
The questions that will be put to the jury are these: Should the world's largest oil company pay punitive damages for soiling Alaskan waters in 1989 with 11 million gallons of oil, and if so, how much? 
 Lawyers for Exxon and for the plaintiffs both said in interviews that they intended to frame their arguments around the same issue: whether Exxon's top executives reacted appropriately in the weeks after the spill. Whatever the outcome, the damages the plaintiffs have gained so far are already the second highest ever in an environmental accident, after the $470 million in damages stemming from the 1984 chemical poisoning in Bhopal, India, legal experts said.
The plaintiffs' trial team, led by Brian O'Neill, a 47-year-old lawyer from Minneapolis, will present Exxon as a callous, calculating industrial bully interested not in cleaning up the spilled oil but in shoring up its image. Mr. O'Neill has said he is seeking $15 billion in punitive damages.
 
Exxon Cites Spending
 Exxon's trial team, led by James Neal of Nashville and Patrick Lynch of Los Angeles, is prepared to argue that the company set an exemplary standard for reacting to an industrial disaster. It said that Exxon had already spent $3.4 billion making amends and that no additional punitive damages were warranted.
For the lawyers and clients on both sides, the Valdez disaster has been an ordeal, the legal equivalent of a journey up the uncharted Amazon. The Federal trial is now in its 15th week. Another trial against Exxon on some of the same issues is taking place simultaneously in state court in Anchorage, where some of the same plaintiffs are seeking $100 million in compensatory damages.
Although the trials are the marquee events, the conflict between thousands of Alaskans and Exxon really began in the days after the spill on March 24, 1989, and it may continue years longer with appeals. Like the grand landscape of the state in which the disaster occurred, everything about the legal aftermath has been off the scale. Legions of lawyers from at least 120 firms flew into Anchorage in 1989 and raced the oil out of Prince William Sound and down the Kenai Peninsula and Kodiak Island, all the way signing up thousands of clients.
From that swarm of lawyers evolved a confederation of 15 firms, which have invested roughly $20 million in direct expenses and twice as much in unpaid time preparing motions, gathering evidence and interviewing witnesses. They represent about 15,000 fishermen and other Alaskans.
Exxon, meanwhile, unleashed its vast resources in an effort to smother the plaintiffs' case before it reached trial. Led by the well-crafted motions filed by John Daum, a Los Angeles lawyer, the company achieved a large measure of success. The case the plaintiffs brought to trial is smaller than their lawyers had wanted. Large groups of clients, like cannery workers and businesses that said they had been harmed from the spill, were barred from the proceedings.
Nevertheless, the plaintiffs' case is still the most important court challenge Exxon has faced since Standard Oil, its predecessor company, was broken up in a Government antitrust action in 1911.
 
One Case, Several Phases
 The volume of evidence and the complexity of the legal and economic issues were so great that Judge H. Russel Holland of Federal District Court divided the case into three phases. A fourth phase, a catchall for plaintiffs not covered by the three other phases, may be tried before a separate jury, possibly as early as the fall.
In the first phase, which ended on June 13, the plaintiffs won a clear victory when the jury of nine women and three men decided that Exxon was reckless for permitting a captain with a known history of alcohol abuse to command a supertanker. The jury's finding of recklessness opened the way for the third phase, which is scheduled to begin on Aug. 22.
In the second phase, which ended on Thursday, the jury decided after 23 days of deliberation that Exxon should pay $286.8 million in compensatory damages, about a third of what commercial fishermen said was due them for harm caused by the spill.
Despite what lawyers for the plaintiffs said was a disappointing result in phase two, they nonetheless have gained in settlements and a jury verdict $404 million in damages from the spill. Before the phase two verdict, Exxon had agreed to settle claims with Alaska natives for $20 million, bringing the total that the plaintiffs have obtained from the oil company to $306 million. In addition, last year the seven oil companies that own and operate the Trans-Alaska Pipeline -- including Exxon -- settled with the plaintiffs for $98 million more.
In an interview, Mr. O'Neill said he was prepared during the third phase of the Exxon case to reprise some of the arguments he introduced at the trial's start three months ago. Then, Mr. O'Neill told the jury that Exxon had repeatedly ignored warnings about the drinking problems of the Exxon Valdez's captain, Joseph J. Hazelwood. He also accused Exxon's senior executives, among them Lawrence G. Rawl, the company's chairman and chief executive at the time of the accident, of lying to the jurors during their trial testimony.
Mr. O'Neill has said he believes it would take a $15 billion punitive damage award to wound a corporate giant and change its behavior. "Somehow, you need to take these institutions and say that just isn't a decent way to act," Mr. O'Neill said last month in an interview in Anchorage. "You need to say, The culture of your company has gone so sour we need to bring it back and do something about it. We need to shock them into some kind of corporate personality change."
 
Exxon Cites Its Response
 Exxon, on the other hand, is preparing to argue that its senior managers were stung by the Valdez spill and that the company's behavior has been exemplary ever since. The most important witness for Exxon during the third phase is expected to be Lee R. Raymond, the company's chairman and chief executive.
An important behind-the-scenes legal adviser for Exxon in Anchorage is Jack Clarke, a former senior vice president of Exxon and a former member of its board. In an interview in Anchorage in June, Mr. Clarke said Exxon had been given little public credit for accepting full responsibility for the spill and then spending $3.4 billion to help Prince William Sound and thousands of Alaskans recover.
Of that amount, $2.1 billion was spent to scrub oil from beaches and take other cleanup measures, a company spokesman said. In 1991, Exxon settled state and Federal claims related to the spill for slightly more than $1 billion. In addition, immediately after the spill, it established a claims settlement program and voluntarily paid $300 million to about 11,000 fishermen and other Alaskans who were harmed, many of whom are now plaintiffs in the Federal trial.
"What are the plaintiffs' lawyers saying about that?" Mr. Clarke said. "They say Exxon's people are liars. They speak out of both sides of their mouths. They ignore all that we've done."
Mr. Clarke added: "When I look at the punitive damage issue, I firmly believe there shouldn't be a punitive damage award. And certainly not one in the multibillions of dollars. Look at how we responded."

HEADLINE: Coffeehouse Slashing Suspect Viewed as Troubled Neighbor

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Aug. 13

 BODY:
When Richard and Karen Stimson watched news reports of the wild stabbing spree in a New Haven coffee bar Sunday night in which seven people were injured, the couple knew right away the suspect was most likely their next-door neighbor, the disheveled man they knew only as Louie.
They felt almost certain because the reports had said the man, Daniel Silva, 38, was ponytailed, had his dog with him during the attack, and had fled on a bicycle. 
 Mr. Silva was arrested a short time after the stabbings, and was charged with seven counts of assault in the first degree. He is being held on a $800,000 bond and is undergoing psychiatric evaluation by the State Department of Corrections in Hartford.
The Stimsons and other neighbors described Mr. Silva as a man of limited intellect who was handy and could build bicycles. They said he rode around the Fairhaven section of the city on a bicycle collecting junk, always with one or more of his dogs.
 
Arson Before Stabbings
 Earlier on the day of the stabbings, the Stimsons had watched in horror as Mr. Silva's home went up in flames, and they said they had not seen him since. On Friday, Mr. Silva was charged with first-degree arson in the fire.
Mr. Silva's lawyer, Jerome Rosenblum, suggested that his client was upset because he believed that his mother, who was hospitalized, had died. Whatever the reason behind the stabbings, neighbors said that Mr. Silva had come from a troubled family and appeared to have encountered violence in the past.
"He said there was a lot of mental illness in his family, and he was always babbling about relatives hurting and threatening him," Mr. Stimson recalled. "But there was another side to him, too. He always shoveled our sidewalk during winter without expecting anything in return, and sent us a very warm Christmas card."
Mr. Silva's lawyer, Mr. Rosenblum, said family members had told him that his client, an unemployed junk dealer, had grown up in neighboring West Haven and had attended West Haven High School without graduating. He said they told him that Mr. Silva had lived with their mother in New Haven for the last 20 years.
 
Thought Mother Had Died
 Neighbors said that while Mr. Silva never spoke about his childhood, he often talked of being hurt and threatened and was often overheard in loud arguments with his mother.
"Several weeks prior to all of this he said something about some relatives of his who he was afraid were going to torch his house before he was ready," said Ms. Stimson. She said he refused to explain what he meant by that, but she added that Mr. Silva had told her on numerous occasions about a violent family, though he was never specific. "He showed me what he said was a wound on one of his legs and said it was painful to be stabbed."
On Sunday, the police said, Mr. Silva carried out the stabbings, wounding seven people at the cafe, which is on Audubon Street in the city's arts district, not far from Yale University.
Mr. Rosenblum said that before the stabbings his client had become convinced that his ailing 79-year-old mother, Florence Mary Silva, had died. Mrs. Silva was released to a nursing home on Friday from Yale New Haven Hospital, where she had been treated since July 31 for acute diabetes.
 
Mother's Room Changed
 In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Rosenblum said: "When he went to the hospital last week to see her, his mother had been moved to another room and somewhere along the way he started believing she was dead. I really don't know how or why he came to believe that."
Cathy Zaorski, a hospital spokeswoman, said that Mr. Silva did visit with his mother on Aug. 4 after showing concern about where she was.
"Her room had been changed and he asked where she was," said Ms. Zaorski. "But we never got the impression he thought she was dead."

HEADLINE: Another View on the Yen's Rise

 BODY:
To the Editor:
If a dim possibility of political reform and an increase in trade surplus are the major causes of the recent dramatic appreciation of the yen, it seems to contradict the fact that the Japanese Government had never been more ready to reform than after the fall of the Liberal Democratic Party in 1992, the same period the yen rose 25 percent against the dollar ("Who Controls the Yen? Just Japan," Viewpoints, July 24).
Furthermore, Japan's increasing trade surplus has more to do with the appreciating yen than any underlying policy change in recent years. Japan is not any more of an export-oriented country now than in the 1980's. As recession arrived in Japan, however, companies restructured, slowed the recycling of overseas profit and slowed overseas expansion. There was a decline in overseas investment by Japan, which certainly increased demand for the yen and drove up its price. That may be one of the causes of its recent appreciation. 
 Japan's investment in other countries, mostly the United States, may have been counteracting upward pressure on the yen (mainly because of the trade surplus) for years by decreasing demand for the currency. When this counteraction was temporarily lifted because of the recession, the yen appreciated abnormally.

HEADLINE: Maybe Inflation Is to Blame?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Surely J. E. Lighter is mistaken in "A Word About Money, Cash, Coin . . ." (Viewpoints, July 31), in which he defines a sawbuck as a $20 bill. A sawbuck is a $10 bill; a double-sawbuck, $20. I have always assumed these terms were inspired by the 19th century bills that denominated their value in Roman numerals -- "X" for $10, "XX" for $20 -- because of the designation's resemblance to a sawbuck, a rack used to support wood for sawing.

HEADLINE: Employer Mandate? We Already Have One

SERIES: Health Care: Second Opinions-An occasional series

BYLINE: By Michael S. Dukakis; Michael S. Dukakis, Democratic candidate for President in 1988, is professor of political science at Northeastern University.

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
As the nation follows the great debate in Congress over health care reform, one issue stands out: will we require all employers to contribute to the cost of insurance for the company's workers and their families? Listening to the critics of the so-called employer mandate, one would think the nation was facing the issue for the first time.
 In fact, requiring employers to contribute to the cost of maintaining the social welfare of their workers is very much a part of American tradition. It began in Massachusetts and Wisconsin earlier in this century with workers' compensation and unemployment compensation, both of which were subsequently embraced by Congress.
 
 Then came Social Security and Medicare. And virtually all Americans agree that employers should be required to pay a decent minimum wage and observe acceptable standards of occupational safety and health.
 At every stage, when it has been suggested that employers bear some of the responsibility for these costs, the same arguments have been made over and over again. It will be an intolerable burden on small businesses. It will result in a devastating loss of jobs. It will stifle entrepreneurship. Each time the critics have been wrong.
 Now we are told by opponents of the bills submitted by the Democratic leaders of Congress, Representative Richard Gephardt and Senator George Mitchell, that we really don't need to require all employers to contribute to their employees' health insurance because so many of them already do, and that a pastiche of insurance reforms and subsidies for low-income people can get us close to universal coverage. Once again they are wrong.
 Not only will reforms without an employer mandate increase the cost of health insurance for employers who provide coverage and for their employees, failing to require all businesses and workers to contribute to the cost of insurance will continue to saddle responsible employers with a kind of tax on every premium they pay. This hidden tax represents the cost of free care for the employees of businesses who refuse to provide coverage for their workers.
 The Massachusetts experience is a case in point. In April 1988, as Governor I signed a universal health care bill designed to do for Massachusetts what Hawaii has so successfully done since 1974 -- provide health insurance for every Massachusetts worker and his or her family and for people who might be temporarily unemployed or suffer from a serious disability that makes it virtually impossible to buy affordable coverage. (Hawaii, which requires employers to pay at least half their workers' insurance costs, boasts the highest percentage of insured residents of any state: 96 percent.)
 Massachusetts carried out those provisions of the bill that provided for coverage of the disabled, students and the unemployed, and today, thanks to the 1988 law, nearly 100,000 residents have health insurance who didn't have it before.
 Unfortunately, we provided for a phase-in of the employer mandate some four years after the effective date of the law, and Gov. William Weld has done his best to kill or delay its implementation.
 In the meantime, he has continued to impose an 8.5 percent tax on certain hospital charges to pay for the free care that hospitals and community health centers provide to uninsured workers and their families.
 Ultimately, a tax is included in the premiums paid by employers and their employees who do insure. And today that tax amounts to an additional burden on responsible employers and their employees of $355 million a year, up some $20 million in the past two years alone.
 Actually, the tax in Massachusetts is a lot lower than it is in most states. In states with much larger numbers of uninsured workers, the free-care tax on businesses that provide insurance can run as high as 20 to 30 percent.
 Unless all businesses and their employees contribute to the cost of health care, the burden of paying for the uninsured will continue to go up as more and more workers lose their coverage.
 Earlier this year, the Labor Department released figures showing that the number of employers who cover their workers has been dropping steadily since 1988.

In short, we have a hidden employer mandate today. It is forcing responsible businesses to pay for health care for their competitors. It is making it increasingly difficult for small businesses who want to insure their employees to do so. And it is grossly unfair.
 That is why I hope Congress will learn from our mistakes here in Massachusetts. Requiring all employers and their employees to contribute to the cost of health insurance is the fairest and most effective way to achieve a goal everyone can support -- comprehensive health insurance for all Americans that can never be taken away.

A Magazine Turns a Corner, Bolstered by the Cafe Boom
 The Java Journal, which styles itself "Manhattan's Cafe Culture Magazine," started up last December with an initial investment of $3,000 each from Paul Millman, the publisher, and Peter Waack, the editor, and they had to underwrite the first four issues. But with the August issue, they say, advertising revenue entirely covered printing and production costs, though they have yet to draw salaries. 
 The partners say their magazine's progress reflects the continuing coffee bar boom. The Java Journal's data base contains 350 New York City cafe listings, Mr. Millman said, adding, "A year ago, there was 25 percent of what there is out there now."
The monthly art and literature magazine based on cafe culture is given away in cafes, coffee shops, restaurants and the lobbies of some New York City hotels.
 
For Low-Income Women, Entrepreneurship Training
An intensive program aimed at giving low-income and unemployed women the skills they need to start a business will be offered starting next month by the American Women's Economic Development Corporation. The classes, financed by the Department of Employment, are free and take place once a week for 26 weeks from 2 to 9 P.M. There is also a compulsory eight-week internship in a business related to the student's interest.
In the most recent program, the corporation said, 26 of the 36 women enrolled were graduated, and about half of them have since started their own businesses, ranging from catering and clothing design to accounting. Marcia Firestone, the vice president for training, said of the students, "Their particular craft or skill can be made into a business, without them having to become an employee of corporate America, and it can enable them to take care of their families."
 
4 Brooklyn Mainstays Join Forces to Sell Themselves
Four of Brooklyn's premier institutions, joined in an effort to sell themselves as a single tourist destination, have brought forth their latest marketing tool, a four-color brochure entitled, "A Day in Brooklyn." The brochure, underwritten by grants from the New York State Urban Development Corporation and the Tourism Grant Program of the New York City Business Assistance Corporation, sets forth the attractions of the four partners, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Prospect Park, the Prospect Park Wildlife Center and the Brooklyn Museum. It is distributed at hotels and visitor centers and at each of the four institutions.
Signs, banners and subway advertising have also been developed. And a trolley to transport visitors between sites is scheduled to start this fall, running from the skating rink in Prospect Park to the parking lot shared by the Brooklyn Museum and the Botanic Garden.

HEADLINE: At Agency For Drivers, New Chief Has Plans

BYLINE: By ELISABETH GINSBURG 

 BODY:
COMPLAINTS about the Division of Motor Vehicles are as perennial as tie-ups on the turnpike.
Maybe that should not be surprising. After all, New Jersey is a small state crammed with 4.8 million cars and the 5.4 million people who drive them. The division charged with keeping track of New Jersey motorists and their machines is an administrative behemoth with a yearly budget of $107 million, revenue of $700 million and 2,500 employees around the state. 
 Hundreds of drivers do business with the division every day at agencies, driver testing centers, inspection stations and regional service centers. Everyone knows that such business can mean long waits, sometimes multiple visits and frayed tempers on the parts of the public and clerks alike.
But the winds of political change have swept a new director into the division's Trenton headquarters. On June 27, Richard Heyman, a veteran legislator, began his job as chief executive of an agency that is required to be efficient and easy to use while delivering an increasing number of services in a way that keeps costs in line. He, his managers and employees all have ideas about how to accomplish those goals.
Mr. Heyman has come to his new job in an optimistic frame of mind. "Everyone here understands that this is a service business," he said, adding that clients will see changes within the next 18 months as all the agencies and service centers are upgraded. Plans for a fifth regional service center are on the drawing board, though no site has been selected. A hiring moratorium will probably continue, Mr. Heyman said, but managers at the sites, at Wayne, Deptford, Eatontown and Trenton, are working on ways to deploy counter clerks more efficiently during rush periods.
The new director's plans include the establishment of a telephone line that people can call to find out how long they will have to wait at specific locations. He also hopes to see more transactions by mail.
Division officials say some of the problems and slowdowns arise from lack of public awareness.
"Except for our regular customers, everyone has the problem of not understanding the system," said Martin Casey, who has worked for the division for nine years and is regional coordinator at the Wayne service center.
 
Impact of Changes in Laws
 Mr. Casey also said many motorists appear in person when they could transact their business by mail, and others come without the documentation needed for their transactions. Motorists who arrive with adequate documentation, Mr. Casey added, can still find themselves at the ends of long lines if they visit at lunchtime or at the end of the month.
Both customers and employees are at the mercy of the state and Federal lawmakers and division bureaucrats who enact laws or change regulations causing increases in volume. In July 1992, for example, the division dropped its requirement that driver license applicants show proof of legal United States residency. The same month, budget cuts forced the division to curtail evening and Saturday hours at inspection stations.
Barbara Wells, who is now a Communications Workers of America union representative for the division, was working at the Wayne service center during that period. "The line stretched all the way around the outside of the building," she said, "and met again at the door."
Other sites were similarly crowded. The public outcry was so loud that the residency policy was reversed after a month, reducing applications from resident aliens, and the Legislature restored money for extended hours.
Within the last year, the Parking Offense Adjudication Act made it possible for local governments to turn over the names of motorists with multiple parking violations to local courts. The courts then suspend the offenders' licenses and notify the D.M.V., which sends out suspension notices.
Suspensions are effective immediately, and before an individual driver can take to the roads again, he must report to the local court, pay the fine and then take proof of payment to the D.M.V. Though restoring a license takes only a short time, and the legislation has provided a financial windfall to municipalities, it has also added to customer volume at the division.
Next year, when provisions of the Federal Clean Air Act go into effect, waiting times at inspection stations, which averaged 16 minutes a car for the first five months of 1994, will almost certainly increase.
Mr. Heyman says that to meet the new requirements, New Jersey inspection stations will have to be remodeled, with extra lanes added for new emissions testing. Since these mandates come without Federal funds, increased waiting time will be coupled with increased costs for vehicle registration and other transactions.
 
Effect of Staff Shortages
 Staff shortages continue to cause stress for the work force and the customers. Elizabeth Ferguson, a seven-year division employee, works at the customer service counter at the Springfield agency location. On a busy day, Ms. Ferguson said, her office may handle 1,000 transactions. "We are not overstaffed," she added.
Cheryl Barber, a records technician in the Wayne service center, said her unit's two clerks signed in 600 to 900 customers a day. Many drivers need conferences with records technicians before their suspended licenses can be restored.
According to Ms. Barber, technicians are required to see 25 customers a day. "Most of us do 40 to 50," she said, adding that her unit and the Wayne center in general are "definitely understaffed."
Mr. Casey agrees, noting that a moratorium on hiring imposed during the Florio administration is still in effect. "Even if you promote someone, you have to get permission to replace them," he added.
If conditions were ideal, the regional coordinator said, he would hire 25 percent more employees to work at Wayne, which handles 2,000 transactions a day and is the division's busiest site.
At some locations, an enlarged work force would only aggravate another problem: parking. Between Jan. 1, 1994 and the end of June, the Wayne Police Department was called 13 times to direct motorists away from the overflowing parking lot. The Wayne Police Chief, Donald Pavlack, said this was an improvement over previous years, when calls came in "on a nearly daily basis."
At Wayne, situated on Route 23, frustrated customers of the division have occasionally parked on the shoulders on both sides of the six-lane highway, sometimes attempting to jump over the center divider to get to the building.
Mr. Casey noted that Wayne's parking problem has eased in the years since the division rented a separate parking lot for employees' cars and added an enhanced-hours unit to extend the business day. Other locations, however, as in Moorestown, which has parking spaces for only 10 to 15 cars, have similar troubles.
Division employees like Ms. Barber, Ms. Ferguson and Joann Keenan, receptionists at the Newton location, say management could have a more efficient agency by communicating with the employees. The three women are shop stewards for the Communications Workers, which represents most of the clerical and counter personnel.
They say they and their counterparts work under pressure, sometimes in cramped quarters, in jobs that often have little room for advancement. The division's top managers, Ms. Ferguson said, need to cultivate a more hands-on leadership style, including visits from Trenton to the various agencies and regional service centers.
Ms. Barber said the division's other managers often come from the inspection stations rather than the agencies and have trouble relating to the concerns of the employees they manage. This sentiment is echoed by a union slogan, "We Want to Be Respected, Not Inspected."
 
More Technology Expected
 Employees and customers alike will see more technology at work in the future, Mr. Heyman said. He foresees the day when finger imaging will allow a motorist to insert a finger in a scanner at a division office. The fingerprint scan will not only verify the person'sidentity, but also summon up his entire driving record. Cars registered in the state will be electronically tracked on the anniversary of the day they were first registered.
Mr. Heyman said that in the future the need for economy and efficiency might result in "much greater involvement of the private sector."Such privatization, however, could be opposed by the unions representing the division's employees.
Both Mr. Casey and Mr. Heyman are complimentary toward the division's work force. According to the director, letters containing compliments about employees outnumber complaints by "10 to 1."
"I have to give the employees a lot of credit," Mr. Casey said.
Mr. Heyman said, "Our reputation is improving."

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
In Europe, Dollar Dipped, But Rates Still Favorable

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
WHAT a pain: You start planning a European vacation in the winter, when the dollar has one value; you get to Paris or Rome or Madrid in the summer and the dollar is worth something different. True, sometimes it is worth more. Last summer, for example, American visitors were pleasantly surprised. But not this year. It's blues time again for the ol' greenback.
The odd thing is that around two million Americans come to Europe every year no matter what's happening to the dollar. If they're rich, they don't worry about the exchange rate. If they're on a tight budget, they still have to look for bargains. In the end the difference between well-heeled travelers and others is far wider than any swing in the dollar. 
 Still, what tourist doesn't always glance at the dollar rate when strolling past a bureau de change? Who doesn't wonder if tomorrow's rate will be better? It's a hypnotizing world, but also a mysterious one. If the Federal Reserve in Washington doesn't know why the dollar goes up and down, how are we to know?
Only one thing is clear: that the dollar has lost value in recent months. But -- and here's an important but -- it has not lost all the value that it gained in late 1992 when the British pound, the Italian lira, the Spanish peseta and assorted Scandinavian currencies were forced to devalue. So the dollar is still worth 20 to 30 percent more in much of Europe than it was two years ago.
An example or two will suffice. On July 1, 1992, the dollar was worth 1,130 lire and 95 pesetas, while the pound was worth $1.91; on Jan. 1, 1994, the dollar's value had inflated to 1,700 lire and 143 pesetas, while the pound's value had fallen to $1.49. So in relative terms, the dollar's recent slide is not that bad. Last Monday (Aug. 8), the dollar was still worth 1,580 lire and 130 pesetas and the pound cost $1.54.
There is another plus. Western Europe is just beginning to pull out of a protracted recession and, feeling the squeeze, many hotels and restaurants have learned to compete.
In Madrid, for example, some five-star hotels surrendered one of their stars in order to lower their prices by as much as 40 percent. In Paris and Rome, more restaurants now display their fixed-price menus in the hope of enticing passers-by.
Bargains notwithstanding, the dollar now goes considerably farther in Southern Europe and Scandinavia than it did in, say, August 1992. But it still does not walk tall in Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and France, where currencies are loosely pegged to the German mark. And it is, of course, against the mighty mark -- and the distant Japanese yen -- that the dollar has fared poorly of late.
Put differently, when the Italian lira, the British pound and others slumped in value in late 1992, they were in fact devalued against the German mark. And now that they have found their new levels, they are still measured principally against the mark. So what counts for the dollar is its value against the mark -- and, after that, everything else falls into place. On July 1, 1992, the dollar was worth 1.49 marks; on Jan. 1, 1994, it was worth 1.74 marks; on Aug. 8 this year it was worth 1.54 marks.
But one day it should all become simple. The European Union countries -- 12 now but 16 on Jan. 1 next year when Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden are expected to join -- are committed to creating a single currency by 1999.
They may not all meet that deadline, but sooner or later it should happen. And at that point, the dollar will have a single rate throughout Western Europe. It won't stop the dollar's value from fluctuating, of course, but at least American travelers won't have to hand over outrageous commissions to a new bunch of exchange houses every time they cross a border.

HEADLINE: Advertising's Role in Health Care

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
AS competition for patients among Westchester's hospitals grows, so do those institutions' budgets for advertising. And while some observers of the health-care scene worry that critical dollars are being diverted from patients' bedsides, others argue that aggressive marketing has become an economic necessity in light of the sea changes taking place in medicine and the delivery of health care.
"It's part of an industry shakedown happening all across America, and Westchester is no exception," said Arthur E. Weintraub, president of the Northern Metropolitan Hospitals Association in Newburgh, a nonprofit organization representing 40 hospitals in the Hudson Valley. "Advertising is a valid attempt on the part of hospitals to convey their mission in today's world." 
 Mr. Weintraub said that while the current advertising frenzy was being played out in newspaper, radio and television ads throughout the country, it had taken on an added dimension in Westchester, where hospitals felt the pressure to compete with large institutions in New York City.
"Here the message is about not getting lost in the big city environment, about being close to home and the personal touch," he said.
At the 461-bed New Rochelle Hospital Medical Center, John R. Spicer, president and chief executive officer, called his hospital's $250,000 advertising budget for next year a "necessary evil."
 
Getting Lost in the Shuffle
 "If left to my own devices, I wouldn't move in this direction," Mr. Spicer said, "but we have New York City hospitals to the south and Greenwich Hospital to the north, and we feel the pressure."
At White Plains Hospital, Melissa J. Weisstuch, a spokeswoman, said the concern was about not getting lost in the shuffle. "If you are not out there telling people about the services you have, they may think you don't have them," she said.
White Plains Hospital, a 300-bed institution, has earmarked $200,000 for its advertising campaign next year, twice as much as the amount that some hospitals more than twice its size have budgeted.
At St. Agnes Hospital in White Plains -- which boasts a hyperbaric (or pressurized) chamber, used in the experimental treatment of various diseases, a balance function center for inner ear problems and state-of-the-art laparoscopic surgery (where an instrument is introduced into the abdomen) performed with three-dimensional lenses -- Mary deBarros, a spokeswoman, said: "People think they have to go to New York City for specialized care, but that's not true. It's all right here in their own backyard in their little community hospital."
 
'Perception of Viability'
 In addition to trying to meet the competition from New York City, some hospital administrators said they were also battling an image problem at home.
"Good, bad or indifferent, advertising adds a great perception of viability," said Edward A. Stolzenberg, the county's Hospitals Commissioner, who oversees the 1,000-bed Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla. The medical center has budgeted $100,000 for next year's advertising, and Mr. Stolzenberg said that the money would go toward positive advertising to compensate for some negative press reports. "I would have preferred not to use scarce health-care dollars on advertising, but we had to," he said. "We had no choice."
William Tan, president and chief executive officer of the 184-bed St. Agnes Hospital, also said he was using advertising to overcome a public perception that the hospital was not doing well.
"We have not enjoyed good public relations because of fiscal troubles and the public perception that there might be a cutback in services," he said. "For us, advertising is a necessity." At Sutton & Partners, an advertising firm in Old Greenwich -- which lists St. Agnes Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital in Harrison and Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville among its clients -- Stephen Katcher, president and creative director, said hospitals were being driven by the need to attract not only prospective patients but doctors as well.
He said that the doctors were the hospitals' chief sources of referrals.
"All in all, it has become very competitive, a quiet kind of war," Mr. Katcher said.
In an attempt to correct the flagging image of St. Agnes Hospital and to tout its affiliation in recent years with New York Medical College, Sutton & Partners uses the headline "University care in a community setting" in its ads.
For St. Vincent's Hospital in Harrison, a psychiatric division of the same hospital in Manhattan, the agency's ads show a picture of a 16-year-old girl with the caption, "It turns out the only one who thought I was a bad person was me."
And for Lawrence Hospital, which is promoting its maternity care, geriatrics department and sports medicine and rehabilitation service, the advertising message is, "The more you know about Lawrence Hospital, the better you'll feel."
 
Need for Reassurance
 At CMA Advertising in White Plains, Gary Blum, president, said that in an uncertain environment, hospitals were intent on "getting the message out about what makes them unique."
He added: "People need to be informed because things in the health-care industry are changing daily. They need to be reassured about services, quality of care and a hospital's reputation." He would not say which hospitals were his clients.
While some Westchester hospitals are taking quarter-, half- and even full-page ads in local magazines and newspapers, others are promoting their services -- a physician referral service, for example -- on printed train schedules. Some are buying radio time. And others are trying to reach the public through what is known as advertorials, an advertisement that looks like a newspaper article and often appears on the editorial pages.
"Whatever way, it's our responsibility to get the message out," said Jon B. Schandler, president of White Plains Hospital Center. "Sometimes it's hard to draw the line between PR and all-out advertising."
 
More Intense Elsewhere
 However strong the competition is in Westchester and the surrounding New York metropolitan area, it is "far more intense, more competitive" in other areas of the country, said Jeannie H. Cross, a spokeswoman for the Healthcare Association of New York State, which represents 400 public and private hospitals, nursing homes and agencies.
She said hospitals in New York had adopted a "more informational tone" in their advertising than hospitals in other areas. "They don't scream at you here," she said. "They just say that this is a service they have to offer."
Sally J. Rogers, a spokeswoman for the United Hospital Fund in Manhattan, observed that advertising had been "slow to come to New York," where occupancy rates for hospital beds remained high, compared with other parts of the country.
In Westchester the occupancy rate averaged 80.3 percent in 1992, the latest year for which figures are available, and in New York City it was 84.7 percent -- much higher than in other parts of the country. In Texas, for example, the occupancy rate in 1992 averaged 56.4 percent, and in Florida, it was 61.3 percent.
 
Blaming the Media
 Ms. Rogers said the high occupancy rates in the New York metropolitan region were the result of poverty and attendant problems like drug and alcohol abuse and low-birth-weight babies. Because the hospitals continued to be busy, she said, they were more likely to purchase low-profile advertising.
Some hospital administrators, angry about the need to pay for advertisements, blamed newspapers, television and radio for not paying more attention to their efforts.
"From my point of view, hospitals are a public service, and the media should provide the space and time to promote our services," said Richard J. Gerber, vice-president for development and public relations at Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in North Tarrytown, an affiliate of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.
"Just because our neighboring hospitals are advertising is not a good enough reason for us to do it," he said. The 215-bed hospital spends about $100,000 a year on what Mr. Gerber called pure advertising, which includes a half-page ad in the Yellow Pages.
 
'Too Much Me-Tooism'
 Criticism has also been directed at the Westchester County Medical Center, which is partially supported by taxpayer dollars, for allocating some of its funds for advertising.
"Should a county hospital be in competition in the same arena as a private hospital?" asked Stephen P. Tenore, the Chairman of the County Board of Legislators. As a critical care hospital -- the only one of its kind in the Hudson Valley region -- the Medical Center was not in competition with other local hospitals, he said.
Rhoda Weiss, a national health-care consultant based in Santa Monica, Calif., said she saw "too much me-tooism and panic" in many hospitals' advertising campaigns and added that the dollars would be better spent on community health outreach programs for high-blood-pressure screening and cancer detection, for example.
"What you pay for in a full-page ad could immunize every child in Westchester," Ms. Weiss said. "Doesn't that make more sense to you?"

HEADLINE: SOAPBOX;
The Sad Value of Max's Dime

BYLINE: By WALTER MOSLEY; Walter Mosley is a Manhattan writer whose most recent novel is "Black Betty."

 BODY:
WHEN I was nine years old, I overheard my mother and father talking about a man, a friend of theirs, who had been sentenced to life in prison for murdering another man. This friend, I'll call him Max, shot his victim at the neighborhood barber shop in Los Angeles in a dispute over a dime wager in a back-room craps game.
"Max asked him for his money," I remember my father saying, almost proudly. "And when he didn't get it, he shot him dead." 
 I didn't know Max, and I had no knowledge, outside of TV Westerns, about death by shooting. But I did know something about dimes. With a dime you could buy two Hershey bars or a Superman comic book.
Even at the age of 9 I knew that a dime wasn't worth a man's life. So later on, when my mother wasn't around, I asked my father why Max really killed that man. I knew that there were all kinds of secret reasons why things happened in the world. My father was the only one who was willing to share those secrets with me.
"He killed him because he had to," my father said.
"But why?"
"Because Max never had a thing, and he was afraid that anything he ever got might be the last. When you come up like that, you fight for what's yours. You have to."
"But it was just a dime."
"When you're a poor man, every dime you ever get is your last one. And if you let somebody take that dime from you, you might as well dig your own grave. Because once somebody takes something from you, everybody else will know and then they'll all do it. Even if you're just a little boy and mourners come into your house when your mother dies. They'll steal the pennies right out of your piggy bank and make you sleep in a coal bin."
My father was sad after our little talk, and I didn't press him further. I knew that the story about a mother's wake was his own. I also knew that my father identified with Max and might have committed the same kind of violence, when angered, if it wasn't for his love for me and my mother.
I knew all of this almost unconsciously and with a kind of logic that I couldn't apply to the rest of the world -- at least, not at that time.
But my father's words come back to me when I think about today's world: Kids with guns, teen-age pregnancies, what we call random violence. We all want it to stop, but no one seems to know how.
I certainly don't know.
My father didn't give answers. What he taught were secrets -- why things happened, not how to control them. He taught me there were reasons for everything, that it was up to me to understand their logic so that, hopefully, I could survive.
I understand Max. He lived in a kind of poverty of mind. He had to fight every day of his life and didn't have the shelter of a father's love.
But it's not only Max. I have a friend today who lives in a tough part of Manhattan. When junkies came to her door, time after time mistaking it for a dealer's place, she called the police. After hearing her address, the police officer laughed and, before hanging up, said, "If you want to be safe, you'd better move."
But how can she move? It's twice the rent to be in a better neighborhood -- first, last, and one month for a deposit.
How can she stay? How can she open the door, or approach home at night? That answer is easier at least -- she has no other choice. Poverty makes people do things that seem impossible and unbearable.
When there's no one to protect your interests, you protect yourself or you give up. You arm yourself with courage, love or guns -- or you buy a dream and lose yourself therein.
A child who is threatened every day, who has seen other children murdered, arms himself. A man is willing to risk his life over a small wager. A girl just out of puberty makes a baby. A boy is proud of all the children he can sire.
Sadly, it all makes sense. There is reason. The unloved child, the gun, the white powder -- death. It's not random. And if there is evil, the whole of the society must share the guilt with the perpetrators.
Because this is the world we have settled for. The secret, in this case, is our own complicity. Not a conspiracy against the poor but a fear so great that we begin to deny reason.
Teen-agers having babies are perceived of as welfare frauds, not children seeking love and their human birthright, creation. Youngsters bearing sophisticated automatic weapons are frightening and should be disarmed. But we mustn't let our fear mask the true villains -- the ones who arm them.
Young men and women -- uneducated, unemployed and unloved by an aging society -- live in a world that has metamorphosed true wisdom, civility and grace into profit, object sex and an endless procession of lurid media events.
In short, our world is undone. We have abandoned our poor and even our children. We seek shelter in ignorance. There is definitely evil and danger in the world we live in, but only with clear eyes can we see the extent of the damage and the possibilities for survival. Only if we can comprehend the true value of that dime in Max's eyes can we see the real threat to our world.

DANGEROUS DESIRES
By Peter Wells.
220 pp. New York:
Viking. $20.95. 
WITH a screenwriter's gift for knowing how little to include, Peter Wells renders the contemporary urban characters inhabiting this volume of short fiction -- South Pacific islanders roaming New Zealand's coastal cities and seaside resorts -- in achingly spare vignettes. There is the sense of life captured in extremity, in intensely felt moments of longing or pain.
The eight selections, including three novellas, in this first collection evoke a unified mood that stems in part from the geographical isolation of their New Zealand setting and that land's mixed racial history. Like many of Mr. Wells's characters, an out-of-work wanderer named Henry Lawson, taking a stroll in "Encounter," feels displaced because he lacks a strong cultural identity, reflected by the changeable nature of his appearance. "In dubious lighting" he can pass "as a European of around 30, possibly of Italian ancestry." At other times he believes that he resembles nothing so much as "a Polynesian princess." But on a long night walk through an "infinitely tedious village," Henry thinks, in a self-deprecating tone typical of Mr. Wells's New Zealanders, that he is no more than "that discount thing, an islander."
The author's circumspect characters often find themselves wandering alone or sitting in lonely motel rooms or seeking tourist attractions in unfamiliar towns, searching for something they lost. In "Bum to You, Chum," Nick Burns, a refugee from Auckland, arrives at the resort town of Sulphur City with nothing but some faded photographs of the women who raised him. He has just learned that one of them is his real mother. There are clues in this town to his mother's life and to his own identity, but Nick waits a long time before he even leaves his room. When he finally goes out, he returns not with a further clue to his past but with a much younger man he has met in a park. His desire for contact is bruised and tentative, as if he was ultimately more comfortable with strangers than with himself.
Other characters in this collection meet up with long-forgotten lovers whom they barely recognize, or return disillusioned to the places where they were once in love or just briefly, excitingly, in lust. Story titles like "Of Memory and Desire" and "Sweet Nothing" suggest the atmosphere of frustrated yearning and wistful regret that permeates the action. Mr. Wells, co screenwriter and co-director of the film "Desperate Remedies," writes in clean, economical prose that crackles with ironic flourishes. Though he can occasionally sink to overweighted phrases like "He fell into profound blackness," his language is generally concise and expressive.
But despite his skill at short fiction, I can't help thinking that this is a novel trapped in a story collection. Surprisingly, the strongest and most novelistic pieces are not the novellas but three interrelated stories. In the first, "Perrin and the Fallen Angel," Mr. Wells introduces Eric Westmore and Perrin McDougal, whose 17-year-long friendship is at the point of unraveling because Perrin has AIDS. The story opens with Eric in the bar of the soon-to-be-demolished Alexandra Hotel, which he affectionately calls "the Alex," a remnant of Edwardian Auckland that "looked like the tiara, Eric always thought, of a minor Scottish peeress."
With the Alex "being reduced to dust," Eric reminisces about his past with Perrin, going back to the night in 1969 when the friends met on the first occasion either one of them had gone into a gay bar. They were "so spectacularly isolated," Mr. Wells writes, that when "their eyes located each other" it was "like radar -- radar of the dispossessed." Mr. Wells sketches their friendship in a few brief episodes that suggest everything that has passed between them without exhaustively recounting their history together.
The richness of their intimacy is simply and beautifully presented. In the succeeding stories, "Outing" and "Dark and Light," Mr. Wells catches up with Eric and Perrin near the end of Perrin's illness, and after his death. The stories form a chronicle, not of lovers and family members but of friends, and they movingly reflect the central importance friendship occupies in the gay community, especially in the time of AIDS. It is hard not to want an entire volume devoted to scenes like the one at the end of "Outing," in which Eric watches his closest and oldest friend drive away, alone, in Eric's car. "And seeing Perrin move off, odd, slow and cumbersome, trying so hard to control his own fate, Eric watched his dear love, his friend, turn the corner, with as much grace as possible, attempting to execute his own exit."

UNHEALTHY CHARITIES
Hazardous to Your
Health and Wealth.
By James T. Bennett and
Thomas J. DiLorenzo.
269 pp. New York:
Basic Books.
$25. 
THE time is surely right for a tough-minded look at the country's big medical charities. Health care occupies political center stage, and there are signs that community service is experiencing a new wave of energy. Meanwhile, thanks to lingering fallout from the United Way mismanagement scandal of 1992, the nonprofit establishment has lost the public's once-unimpeachable trust.
All of which makes "Unhealthy Charities" such a missed opportunity. James T. Bennett of George Mason University and Thomas J. DiLorenzo of Loyola College, both professors of economics, focus on what they call the Big Three: the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association and the American Lung Association. Their indictment -- and that is certainly how their book reads -- is as sweeping as it is unforgiving. They complain that the Big Three devote too much money to public awareness campaigns, which they consider "thinly disguised fund raising"; spend too much time educating doctors and nurses rather than assisting victims; and allocate too many grants to a narrow clique of hospitals and universities.
There may be some merit to these complaints, but the authors routinely overdo it. Take the familiar public service tag line "See your physician for regular checkups." Do we really believe that this slogan amounts to a campaign to "admonish the public to increase their consumption of medical services under the halo of charity"?
The book's more reasonable arguments suffer from the armchair quality of its research. An in-depth investigation of the policies and culture of the three charities should necessarily include tough interviews with individuals inside these organizations. Instead, "Unhealthy Charities" serves up a barrage of bloodless facts and quotations from Congressional hearings, newspaper articles and financial documents.
The result is lots of information, but little insight. Mr. Bennett and Mr. DiLorenzo present a wealth of detail about the 1992 annual meeting of the California chapter of the American Cancer Society, right down to the menus: a marketing team "met in the Hilton's Roosevelt A room and enjoyed coffee, muffins and juice in the morning; dined on the $17.95-per-person California Bistro luncheon selection; and, at 3 in the afternoon, enjoyed soft drinks, mineral water and two dozen cookies -- at $15 per dozen."
AT other times, the authors exhibit an irritating faux naivete. After reviewing financial statements, they report, "we were shocked by what we found: health charities plead for money for programs to aid those in need while at the same time holding millions of dollars in cash, stocks, bonds, real estate and automobiles."
The United Way fiasco underscored the potential for abuses by nonprofit organizations. But
should economics professors be "shocked" that the American Heart Association invests its endowment funds in securities, or that the American Cancer Society owns office buildings?
For all its flaws, "Unhealthy Charities" does leave the reader with the sense that something is amiss with the Big Three. These huge, powerful charities seem uncreative and uninspired, more concerned with perpetuating themselves than with fighting disease. In this, of course, they exhibit the same culture of complacency as so many big organizations that have been around for 70 or 80 years. I.B.M. and General Motors were almost destroyed by decades of success. Should we expect bold innovation from the people who brought you Christmas seals?

HEADLINE: Planned Airport Rail Can Use Little-Known East Side Terminal

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The new light rail link planned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for La Guardia and Kennedy International Airports is the most important economic development in the New York metropolitan area in decades. It should not be derailed by a poorly thought out Manhattan terminal on the site of the former Alexander's department store at Third Avenue and 59th Street. 
 The Queensboro Bridge was built in 1909 as a combined rail and highway link between Manhattan and Queens. The trains, called streetcars, ran on the outer lanes of what is now the lower deck. The Manhattan train terminal, still underground at Second Avenue between 59th and 60th Streets, was abandoned in the early 1950's in favor of the Q60 bus, which still runs back and forth across the bridge, but does not use the long-abandoned Manhattan train terminal. This terminal could be remodeled for the new airport-bound train.
The vaults underneath the Queensboro Bridge, now used for storage, could be converted into parking for taxicabs loading and unloading passengers from First Avenue only. Then Second and Third Avenues would be free of the cab traffic feared by protesting East Siders.
But even without this Manhattan terminal, the Port Authority ought to build the train as planned, linking Queens Plaza, La Guardia, Shea Stadium-Willets Point Boulevard, Jamaica Station and Kennedy Airport.
The two airports together are Queens County's largest employers, and airport employees invariably drive to work, crowding the Long Island Expressway, Grand Central Parkway and Van Wyck Expressway. Linking the Long Island Rail Road, IRT No. 7 and IND E subways to La Guardia and Kennedy by rail will allow thousands of airport workers to take the train to work, taking millions of automobile trips a year off these supercongested highways.
New York started in 1624 as a national seaport in lower Manhattan. By the early 20th century, the city was a transcontinental railroad terminal centered in midtown at Pennsylvania Station and Grand Central Terminal. Today they are commuter terminals, mere shadows of their glory days.
New York has grown into a national and international airport terminal centered at La Guardia and Kennedy. To keep New York as the country's central city, it is imperative that international air and local rail be linked.

HEADLINE: Let Us Also Decry the Violence Abortion Does

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The violence that brutally erupted in the fatal shooting of Dr. John Bayard Britton and James H. Barrett at the abortion clinic in Pensacola, Fla., is highly repugnant, reprehensible and has rightly met widespread condemnation. 
 The violence that provoked this tragedy is the antithesis of pro-life movements, which ideally denounce whatever threatens human life or undermines human dignity, not focusing on a single issue like abortion.
The murders have been justly repudiated by religious and civic leaders and groups. Federal agents have properly been deployed to halt violence at abortion clinics.
Violence is not a univocal or one-dimensional reality. The term has been applied to revolutionary and guerrilla movements attempting to transform governments perceived as brutally oppressive.
The word has also been employed in a more extensive but realistic fashion to "institutional or structural violence" by political and religious leaders, sociologists and economists to describe the unjust policies of governments that have doomed many of their people to a dehumanizing existence characterized by widespread disease, malnutrition, illiteracy, inadequate or nonexistent health care and numerous other disabilities.
While we rightly condemn the violent deaths in Pensacola and use all available means to protect life, it is important to recall that many conscientious citizens decry the violence they perceive in abortion on demand.
Women indeed have reproductive rights and a right to privacy. Other inalienable rights to life, liberty, free speech, assembly, to bear arms, are guaranteed by the Constitution, but they are conditioned and limited so as not to violate the rights of others.
A woman's reproductive rights and her right to privacy must be respected and legally protected, but cannot be so absolute as to inflict violence upon the fundamental right to life of the unborn, the most vulnerable of any society, which is judged by its concern for the most defenseless.

HEADLINE: Suburban Expansion Fed By an Influx of Minorities

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
After decades in which America's cities worried primarily about white flight, cities are now facing the increasingly rapid departure to the suburbs of middle- and working-class minority members.
No longer the contained, homogenous "Leave it to Beaver" bedroom communities of the 1950's, the suburban destinations of minorities now constitute a broad patchwork that includes inner suburbs, large suburban cities, office parks, retail centers, even rural territory, demographers say. 
 Some experts think the pattern of suburbanization may also be more complex because of the diverse racial and ethnic minority groups involved. And those dynamics may play out in entirely different ways in the sprawling, less dense sections of the South and West.
The minority population has grown substantially in the nation's suburbs, the 1990 Census showed. From 1980 to 1990, the black population in the suburbs grew by 34.4 percent, the Hispanic population by 69.3 percent and the Asian population by 125.9 percent. By contrast, the white population in the suburbs increased by 9.2 percent.
William H. Frey, a demographer at the University of Michigan who specializes in racial distribution patterns, said, "Minority suburbanization took off in the 1980's both as the black middle class came into its own and as more assimilated Latinos and Asians translated their moves up the socioeconomic ladder into a suburban life style."
Though the actual numbers of minorities in the suburbs are small compared with the overall suburban population, policy makers and urban planners say the suburbanization of minorities has important implications for the inner cities, for national urban policy and for the suburbs.
Members of minority groups, like others who choose to flee the cities, move to the suburbs for many reasons: affordable housing, better schools, lower cost of living and amenities like space and greenery. But most often, they say, they move to escape the violence and incivility associated with cities.
Michael and Verna Frazier of Washington, D.C., recently joined the exodus to the suburbs. Black professionals who reveled in living where the population was predominantly black and middle class, they were committed urban dwellers who had expected to raise their two daughters in the city. Then came a predawn burglary last fall.
"I heard them and they heard me, and so they left," said Mr. Frazier, a professor of political science at Howard University here. "But our physical safety had been jeopardized. That did it for us."
Today, the Fraziers live in nearby Temple Hills, Md.
In New Orleans, Mateo Suarez, a fifth-generation resident of the city's Seventh Ward, a working-class, largely Creole area, is thinking about leaving the city for the first time in his life.
Gone are the evenings when neighbors would sit on their porches and talk into the night, he said. Gone, too, is the community where an adult could correct a child -- and the child would obey. Nights are now punctuated with the sounds of gunfire.
"I was born and raised in this neighborhood," said Mr. Suarez, who was a civil rights activist in the 1960's and today runs the Rainbow and Pre-School Academy with his wife, Beverly Veronica. "But it's lost too much for me, primarily because of the youth and the violence."
Some sociologists contend that the departure of more affluent minorities to the suburbs from inner-city neighborhoods is simply adding to urban deterioration.
"It's a major problem for urban America," said Vincent Lane, chairman of the Chicago Housing Authority. "Suburbanization isn't about race now; it's about class. Nobody wants to be around poor people, because of all the problems that go along with poor people: poor schools, unsafe streets, gangs."
Over the last decade, Washington's population declined by nearly 100,000, to 600,000 today. The loss of blacks from the city was nearly three times as great as for whites -- 17,800 black households, as against 6,200 white.
According to a report issued in April by the Greater Washington Research Center, 57 percent of everyone who left the District headed for Northern Virginia and the near suburbs of Maryland. So heavy has the emigration of middle-class blacks been from Washington that Prince George's County, a 52 percent minority suburb, is something of a mecca for demographers.
"I was looking for safety, new brick construction and a price tag under $200,000," said Janet Lane, a native Washingtonian who recently moved to Mitchellville, in Prince George's County.
"What is going on is not so much black suburbanization as black middle-class suburbanization," Mr. Frey said.
Nor is the move limited to the black middle class. People of Hispanic descent as well as Asian-Americans experienced overall higher rates of suburbanization than did blacks during the same period.
 
The Hispanic Population
 In Washington, the heavily Hispanic neighborhoods of Adams-Morgan and Mount Pleasant are the first step to the heavily Hispanic and Asian suburbs of Northern Virginia and Maryland, a move often made within a single generation.
"For Hispanics, suburban life is the good life," said Jose Sueiro, editor of La Nacion, a weekly Spanish-language paper in Washington. "It's the American dream. First you go where you're comfortable, make a little money, get a little English and then head for the suburbs."
Nationally, from 1980 to 1990, the number of Hispanics living in the suburbs rose to 8.7 million from 5.1 million. The number of Hispanic people living in cities grew to 11.5 million in 1990 from 7.8 million in 1980. During the same 1980-90 period, the suburban Asian population grew by 2 million, to 3.5 million.
Nationally, the suburbs remain mostly white, with minorities constituting 41 percent of the city population and less than 18 percent of the suburban population. About 95 million whites lived in the suburbs in 1990, as against 87 million in 1980, a 9.2 percent increase.
Some analysts think this continuing flight to the suburbs will leave the cities more impoverished than ever, with large numbers of the least able.
But Richard P. Nathan, provost of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State Univeristy of New York at Albany, said the perception that cities are increasingly composed primarily of underclass neighborhoods is incorrect. He noted that of the 24.5 million blacks residing in metropolitan areas in 1990, three-quarters were not living in poverty.
He and a group of scholars are studying minority and ethnic working- and middle-class urban neighborhoods in New York State, including Queens, Brooklyn, Buffalo and Rochester, as well as some suburban neighborhoods in Nassau County. He said they hold "hidden good news for cities." A recent analysis of census data by The New York Times, for example, showed that in middle-class Queens, blacks had passed whites in household income.
For now, however, middle-class blacks continue to follow their white counterparts to the suburbs, particularly in cities like Atlanta, Dallas and Washington, where blacks are prospering.
In Chicago, blacks are leaving the South Side for the nearby south suburbs of Country Club Hill, Chicago Heights, Hazelcrest and Markham. Hispanics are expanding west from the city into Maywood, Hillside, Bellwood. Asians head north to Skokie and Naperville.
In Washington, black middle-class flight to the suburbs has become one of the major issues in the upcoming mayoral race this fall. The city needs a strong middle class for its tax base.
The move by the Fraziers of Temple Hill allowed them not only to find an affordable house in a safe neighborhood but also to send their children to a public magnet school instead of the private school they had attended in Washington.
The move to Maryland, Mr. Frazier said, meant an immediate $1,000-a-month savings on schools.
"Now we have a house that would have cost over $150,000 more in the District," Mr. Frazier said. "When you add up all the plusses versus the minuses, it's worth the 20-minute commute."

HEADLINE: Selling Growth Drug for Children: The Legal and Ethical Questions

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA 

 BODY:
The companies that make and market a genetically engineered drug face charges that they have crossed legal and ethical lines in promoting their product, in the process tainting trusted relationships between doctors and patients, and parents and school systems.
The drug is Protropin, a genetically engineered version of human growth hormone made by Genentech Inc. that can make some short children grow taller than they otherwise would. A Federal grand jury in Minneapolis this month indicted a doctor, David R. Brown of Minneapolis, on charges that he had received $1.1 million in kickbacks to prescribe the drug. 
 The grand jury also indicted Edmon R. Jennings, the vice president for sales and marketing at Genentech, as well as the company that distributes the drug, Caremark Inc., and three of its officials.
A House subcommittee led by Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, is also investigating marketing practices by Genentech and Caremark, including payments for surveys to find short children in schools. This practice may be funneling children to doctors who would treat them with Protropin, Mr. Wyden said.
The drug, which costs $20,000 to $40,000 a year or more, is approved for the treatment of children whose bodies do not make sufficient quantities of human growth hormone and thus are destined to be very short. But once a drug is on the market, doctors can prescribe it for other conditions at their discretion.
Many medical experts say they have long been concerned that children who have a normal amount of human growth hormone and no medical problems but are simply short are being given the drug despite a lack of convincing evidence that it increases their final adult height. It is not know if Dr. Brown prescribed the drug for any children who had the normal amount of the hormone, but he was one of the most frequent prescribers of the drug in the country with 350 patients receiving the treatment.
Fran Price, the executive director of the Human Growth Foundation, a nonprofit group that works with people with growth problems and is financed mainly by the two companies, said a recently published study concluded that 20,000 children were considered medically eligible for the therapy because they have insufficient human growth hormone.
Genentech says about 15,000 children a year take its drug; thousands of other children take Humantrope, a nearly identical drug made by Eli Lilly & Company.
The 51-count indictment says the payments to Dr. Brown were made by Genentech, of South San Francisco, and by Caremark of Northbrook, Ill.
Joseph Duffy, a Chicago lawyer who is representing Dr. Brown, said that Dr. Brown emphatically denied the accusations against him and that the money he had received was for research and consulting. "There was nothing untoward or illegal about it," Mr. Duffy said.
Jim Weiss, a Genentech spokesman, said the company stood behind Mr. Jennings: "Genentech was not named in this indictment. These are allegations. There is not anything proven."
Caremark, in a prepared statement, said it "absolutely denies any wrongdoing and believes it will be vindicated when the facts are evaluated in an unbiased form."
 
Further Inquiry Under Way
 An official at the Department of Health and Human Services, who insisted on anonymity, and Steve Jennings, a staff member for Representative Wyden, say a Federal investigation is under way to determine whether other doctors around the country received money from the companies and if any did, under what circumstances.
Mr. Wyden, chairman of the House subcommittee on regulation and technology, plans to hold hearings on the marketing of the drug within 60 days.
Almost as soon as Protropin was approved for sale in 1985 it became a critical product for Genentech. The drug has sales of $217 million a year, more than a third of the company's total revenue, Mr. Weiss said.
But as the drug's sales took off, some pediatricians and medical ethicists began asking whether it was being overpromoted as a sort of cosmetic endocrinology in attempts to make normal, but short, children grow. So who were the 15,000 children taking the Genentech drug? And why were so many taking Protropin rather than the Eli Lilly version, Humantrope?
The two drugs have the same wholesale price, but Protropin may cost patients substantially more. Its sole distributor is Caremark, which charges a variety of prices, said Robert Campbell, a senior analyst at the Principal Mutual Life Insurance Company in Des Moines. Mr. Campbell, who reviews charges for the drugs, said Protropin cost on average 30 percent more than Humantrope.
In the indictment, the grand jury charged that there was a conspiracy involving Dr. Brown, Caremark and its officials and Mr. Jennings of Genentech to defraud the Federal Medicaid program through a kickback scheme intended to sell Protropin. Dr. Brown's patients included children on Medicaid.
 
What the Indictment Said
 The indictment gave this account:
The conspiracy began when Mr. Jennings of Genentech wrote Dr. Brown a letter dated Feb. 5, 1986, "agreeing to explore Brown's desire to become involved with Genentech 'in a very significant way.' "
In September 1986, Caremark's predecessor, Caremark Home Health Care of America, executed an agreement giving Dr. Brown a grant. On July 9, 1987, a Caremark employee sent a memo to Mr. Jennings stating that Dr. Brown would receive 5 percent of revenues for the Protropin he prescribed and calculating that he was owed, at that time, $103,551. Dr. Brown wrote a letter to Mr. Jennings dated June 9, 1987, saying he wanted to make sales of $2.3 million for 1987 and $1.35 million for 1986 the "bases for our program."
But in early 1988, lawyers for Baxter International Inc., which owned Caremark at the time, said they were uncomfortable with the agreement with Dr. Brown and wanted to restructure it to make the payments as research grants. This was the start of a complicated series of payments to Dr. Brown, through various entities, including a new company that Dr. Brown started in 1991, Applied Biomedical Consultants.
The research grants were paid by Caremark, with contributions from Genentech. But, the indictment says, though Dr. Brown received $409,000 for research between 1988 and 1992, "he hadn't published any research results and his research was not enlightening." He received various other payments from the companies.
Medical experts say the indictment concerning Protropin may have disturbing reverberations.
When told of the indictment, Dr. Alan Garber, an internist and economist at Stanford University, said that while the accusations against Dr. Brown, Genentech and Caremark, if true, were unethical and criminal, there was a larger issue. "One of the most important aspects of the physician-patient relationship is trust," he said. "Even the appearance of a conflict of interest is devastating."
Dr. John Fletcher, a medical ethicist at the University of Virginia, when told about the accusations concerning the marketing of Protropin, said he was also concerned by the apparent conflict of interest that arose when Genentech and Caremark sponsored studies that had identified short children in schools.
The companies, sometimes indirectly, have sponsored such studies in several states, including Georgia and North Carolina. In the case of North Carolina, Genentech paid $10,000 a year to Susan Parker, the wife of a pediatric endocrinologist, Dr. Mark Parker, in Charlotte, N.C., to do a three-year study that would find short children in the schools and refer them to doctors for evaluation. The Mecklenburg Medical Society said Dr. Parker was the only pediatric endocrinologist in Charlotte.
Mrs. Parker, a nonpracticing pediatric nurse, began the study in 1989. With the Board of Education's permission, she had the school nurses measure young children to detect growth defects that might be signs of serious medical problems, like kidney problems or brain tumors.
David Hains, a spokesman for the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system, said the schools sent out letters to the parents of children who were found to have possible abnormal growth rates, suggesting that the parents take their children to a pediatrician and asking the parents to return a form filled out by their doctor.
Mr. Hains now says he feels the study was a mistake because he thinks the schools were being used by Genentech.
Mrs. Parker has not yet published her results. Mr. Weiss of Genentech said: "We gave her an unrestricted grant. We have no access to the data until they are published and we aren't in a position to force her to publish." Mrs. Parker said she intended to publish but wants to get "final measurements on the children this fall and do a questionnaire with the families" to learn what had been the result of the letters sent home.
Dr. Parker said he did not know of any children who came to him for growth hormone treatments as a result of his wife's study, but it would not bother him if some had. He said he had 112 children on human growth hormone, adding, "I have never pressured anybody to take growth hormone." But one family that was referred to him disagrees.
John P. Towle said he was so outraged by his experiences with Dr. Parker that he wrote to Jeremy Rifkin, the director of the Foundation on Economic Trends, which monitors the biotechnology industry and has long campaigned against the sale of human growth hormone to children who have no hormonal disorders.
The Towles were referred to Dr. Parker by their pediatrician because their son, Brodie, was short. Dr. Parker, they said, pressured them to give their son human growth hormone.
Terri Towle said in a telephone interview that neither she, her husband, nor Brodie was concerned by the boy's height, but agreed to see Dr. Parker because they wanted to rule out serious medical problems. At 11 years of age, Brodie is 50 inches tall, which is well below average, she said. But, Mrs. Towle said, she is short and her whole family is short. Brodie's projected height is 5 feet 6 inches, the same as Mrs. Towle's father. Mrs. Towle said Dr. Parker had asked her what she would say to Brodie when he grew up and learned that "he could have been five-ten."
Offended and upset, Mrs. Towle said, she left Dr. Parker's office and changed pediatricians as well. The new pediatrician is perfectly happy with Brodie's growth rate, which is a normal rate, she said.

HEADLINE: A Siberian Railroad, From 'Hero' to Disaster

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KOMSOMOLSK-ON-AMUR, Rus sia

 BODY:
It has been exactly two decades since they came here by the thousands, traveling across Siberia by rail, bus and even on foot to help forge the last great link in the proletarian paradise.
Idealistic young Communists rising one final time to a challenge from the Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, they cast their personal lives aside and dedicated themselves to creating the Baikal-Amur Mainline: the BAM, as it has always been called. 
 "The BAM will cut the primordial taiga," Mr. Brezhnev said in 1971, referring to the permafrost and placing the colossal project's completion among the central goals of Soviet life. "It will bring enormous wealth to the motherland. It will create the biggest industrial region we have ever seen. Cities and towns will grow like flowers."
As a railroad, the BAM would snake through some of the roughest terrain on earth, not only opening the riches of Siberia to a nation that desperately needed its incalculable wealth but also providing a transportation alternative to the Trans-Siberian Railroad that would be far less vulnerable to Chinese attack.
 
A Last Hurrah
 As an idea, what the Soviet leaders called "the Hero Project of the Century," the BAM was an unconscious last hurrah, a grand, idealistic gesture for delivering desperately needed adrenaline to a faltering empire.
"BAM was the world to us," said Aleksandr Y. Manyakin, who was 22 in 1974 when he heard Mr. Brezhnev's plea at that year's conference of the Young Communist League to drop everything and set out for Siberia. Like many of his friends and fellow students, he complied immediately.
"It was all so romantic," Mr. Manyakin, now an unemployed engineer, recalled, his eyes still glistening at the memory. "This was the last great frontier. We were going to build cities for millions and harness the wealth of Russia. It is hard to describe how thrilled we were."
But like the empire itself, the BAM has turned to nothing. There were to be no "cities for millions" on the cruel Siberian soil. The wealth of the region largely remains locked beneath its unforgiving land. The so-called BAM Zone, a total of some 580,000 square miles, or about the size of Alaska, has fewer people living within it now than it did in 1991, when the railroad was officially completed. And in cities like Komsomolsk-on-Amur, where the population has fallen from 350,000 to 305,000 in eight years, people are leaving so fast that city officials have all but stopped planning the future.
Finished at a cost that Western economists say was at least $20 billion, the BAM became one of the century's most expensive public works disasters, in human as well as financial terms.
It was a project conceived on the scale of the Pharaohs. To lay the track, its builders had to blast through seven mountain ranges, erect more than 4,000 bridges and move nearly a billion cubic feet of earth in a climate where metal shatters like glass in the winter and leather falls apart in the summer heat. Far from opening the vastness of Siberia, however, the BAM chewed up the dreams and lives of tens of thousands of dedicated youngsters.
Although it operates on its entire length from Lake Baikal to the Amur River, few train whistles were ever heard along the desolate tracks. In the 1980's, 11 separate ministries pledged money to the project; 130 research institutes studied its engineering problems and its financial and social possibilities. An entire Government agency, Glavbamstroy (the Central BAM Construction Agency) was created to orchestrate the adventure.
Dozens of hastily constructed BAM towns were thrown up along the route, which ran 2,100 miles from Ust-Kut on the Lena River in the West to this Far Eastern city, which was built in the 1930's by an equally devoted and hardy band of Communist pioneers. Most of those towns stand empty now, settlements with half-built railroad stations, a few shoddy homes lacking windows or doors, and almost nothing else.
Fifty miles from here, in a town called DSZ (from the Russian acronym for House Building Factory), where regiments of carpenters were scheduled to live, slabs of concrete lie untouched in the rangy weeds. Water towers stand empty. There are no paved roads, no schools, no stores. The only signs of life are a few wooden shacks that were there long before the railroad.
The most ambitious of the BAM towns -- Tynda, the capital of the BAM Zone and Komsomolsk-on-Amur, its eastern terminus -- are strewn with half-built Soviet apartment blocks and construction cranes that have not moved in nearly a decade.
"Even until last year the Government said they still intended to invest in the BAM," said Aleksandr A. Ivanov, director of the Federal Employment Services office here. "It is clear to me, and to everybody here now, that nobody is going to spend another dollar on it. And that means we have some hard thinking to do."
The entire economy of the region became dependent on the project. And everyone assumed that the BAM, like the Government that created it, would provide for them.
 
Tension and Bitterness
 The tension and disappointment at the results are obvious in Komosmolsk-on-Amur. Bitterness has led to heightened divorce rates, problem drinking even by Russian standards and widespread domestic violence. Desperate to assuage factory workers who have not been paid since March, officials here are struggling to find a way out of their demographic and economic nightmares. For now, they are tripling the average unemployment compensation to workers with families. And they are paying the same amount to those who are working and can show that they need the money.
Most people do. Starting in August, for as long as it will last, many experienced factory workers will receive 300,000 rubles, or about $140. That is a relatively large sum in these parts, where no factory is operating at full power and many are not operating at all. But the alternative, federal officials acknowledge, is an accelerated exodus from a region that can afford no more departures.
"The problem is that the future of the entire area was planned around the BAM," Mr. Ivanov said.
"We have the bricks for a chicken factory sitting five miles away. It was to be a huge supplier of food, to the builders of BAM, and the settlements they were going to create. There was an automobile plant to be constructed. Schools were drawn onto the maps. All that is now forgotten. Our future was tied to the BAM and our past was tied to defense. When a young family comes to me and asks about its prospects, it's hard for me to tell them to stay."
 
Submarine Company in Deep
 The biggest enterprise in the city, the Lenin Shipbuilding Factory, which makes submarines, is in trouble so deep that even its recent shift toward fabricating commercial fishing trawlers cannot begin to help. The city's airplane factory has not finished a plane in a year.
Many people here were angered this year when Yegor T. Gaidar, head of the Russia's Choice political party and a leading advocate of a free market, came to town and said publicly that there simply was not enough work to support the population.
But he was right.
"People here see the future, and it makes them very depressed," said Ina G. Karpovna, a psychologist employed by the city government. "They feel that their Government has forgotten them. They don't see a job that can come in the future, and they live so far from the center of the country that sometimes they feel the don't even belong in it. They don't know what to do."
 
First Arrivals in 1932
 Komsomolsk-on-Amur was founded to connect the ends of the enormous country, not isolate them. Its first settlers arrived in 1932, on a ship called the Columbus, at the order of the leaders of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. They fought their way through frozen rivers, impassable forests and a climate that is loved by no one. Half of the initial delegation of 900 died in the first winter. But those that survived hacked a lovely city out of the woods on the wide banks of the Amur River, and for years Komsomolsk, the City of Youth, had been a leading bulwark in the Soviet eastern defense.
"To me this city is connected to a heroic cause, a great struggle," said Sergei S. Syrnev, 79, one of those who came to build Komsomolsk-on-Amur more than 60 years ago. Mr. Syrnev keeps his BAM Almanacs on a bookcase in his bedroom across from framed pictures of Stalin and Lenin.
"To build this town with my own hands and see the generations of special people come here, it was great," he continued. "I am not one to say we should go back to the old ways, to Communism. We need the future here with us. But the BAM was going to bring us that. And without it I don't know what will."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Press;
The Boston Herald, an aggressive tabloid, sets out to prove
that there is life after ownership by Rupert Murdoch.

BYLINE: By William Glaberson 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
PATRICK J. PURCELL has an idea for his newspaper. "If we're a tabloid," he said, "let's be a real tabloid with a personality and a feistiness that will make people more interested."
Mr. Purcell's ideas are quite influential at The Boston Herald, the tabloid in question, because he owns it. He bought it six months ago from Rupert Murdoch, his old boss. Mr. Purcell, 46, had been publisher of The Herald and of The New York Post and was president of Mr. Murdoch's News America Publishing Inc. 
 So, with a bit of tinkering -- and a lift from a recovering New England economy -- The Boston Herald, one of those big-city papers that always seems to be living on borrowed time, is now testing whether there is life after Murdoch.
The new owner likes to say he has a "Three P's" plan for the paper. It should be, he says, Populist, Passionate and Phunny.
Already, Mr. Purcell's team has the Three P's Religion. The new editor he installed in April, Andrew F. Costello Jr., a longtime Herald man, said the paper had to ease up on one of its old obsessions: competition with The Boston Globe, the much larger and more sober broadsheet.
"In some respects," Mr. Costello said last week, "we became too competitive with The Globe. In competing against them, we became too much like them."
The Globe, owned by The New York Times Company, has a daily circulation of 500,337, down from 504,869 a year earlier, while The Herald has a daily circulation of 312,779, down from 337,543, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations report for the six months that ended March 31.
In the new Herald, Mr. Purcell said, readers will see much less "esoteric" investigative journalism, like a series of articles last year on the state pension plan.
What will they see more of? Mr. Purcell is particularly proud of Herald Heroes, a good-news series he started about ordinary people who make a difference.
Some readers worry that the big splash The Herald gave to a single case of flesh-destroying bacteria on Martha's Vineyard this month was another sign of the paper's new brand of journalism.
The Herald's own media critic, Jon Klarfeld, wrote on Friday that the coverage of the bacteria appeared "overwrought."
Some journalists inside Mr. Purcell's newsroom say they are edgy when a former executive of Mr. Murdoch's empire says he wants more tabloid in his tabloid.
In any event, said Mark Jurkowitz, the media critic for The Boston Phoenix, The Herald has been suffering a brain drain of some of its more experienced journalists that will make the changes Mr. Purcell has in mind harder to accomplish. And even in the best of worlds, Mr. Jurkowitz said, Mr. Purcell's Three P's vision will be difficult to realize. "It's hard to make a newspaper passionate and funny," Mr. Jurkowitz said.
And then, of course, there is a fourth "P" that Mr. Purcell doesn't even need to mention. Without Mr. Murdoch's resources, The Herald needs to be profitable.
"Previously," Mr. Purcell said, referring to the days he ran The Herald for Mr. Murdoch, "I didn't have to walk down the hall to the finance department to find out how much money was in the bank."
In recent years, Mr. Purcell said, the paper has had some profitable and some unprofitable years. The fiscal year that ended in June, he said, was the best in years, with profits nearly double the $1.4 million that was the highest annual profit during the Murdoch years. (Mr. Murdoch bought The Herald in 1982 and Mr. Purcell became its publisher in 1984.) The paper's annual revenue, he said, is about $90 million.
Mr. Purcell, a former advertising salesman who climbed through the ranks of Mr. Murdoch's American publishing company, is experienced in the hardball aspects of newspaper publishing. He was one of Mr. Murdoch's frontmen in some particularly tough battles with newspaper competitors and unions.
He has already sent out signals that he is not about to ease up on any of those fights. One of his early actions after he became the owner on Feb. 14 was a demand for substantial savings from the newsroom budget, including layoffs. He is still in a standoff with the union representing editorial and business employees.
Jeffrey Krasner, a reporter who is vice chairman of The Newspaper Guild at The Herald, said Mr. Purcell learned his lessons well from Mr. Murdoch, who cultivates an image of being tough with newspaper unions.
Mr. Purcell says he hopes to make peace with the guild in a few weeks. But what he mostly wants to talk about are plans to use the better economic times to rebuild the paper.
In September, he will introduce what he calls a new Sunday Herald, adding new style, health, education and home sections, expanded coverage of personal finance and sports and a new full-color television guide.
The investment in the Sunday paper is aimed at strengthening one of The Herald's weakest links. On average, just 207,814 copies were sold each Sunday during the six-month period that ended in March, down from 233,507 in the period a year earlier. The Sunday Globe sold 815,265 copies, up from 811,409 in the comparable 1993 period.
There is one last P: Pugnacious. Even if The Herald will imitate The Globe less than it used to, there is little sign that Mr. Purcell's underdog will cease its continuing efforts to annoy its bigger rival.
This summer on Cape Cod, The Herald sliced its 50-cent cover price in half and ran radio advertising all over the Cape. Mr. Purcell said the campaign brought more than 3,000 new readers to The Herald.
Richard Gulla, a spokesman for The Globe, said the move did not affect The Globe's circulation. The ads did not mention The Globe by name, but they did note that the tabloid Herald doesn't block a reader's tan on the beach, "unlike that large, cumbersome Boston newspaper."

The Economy
The proliferation of desktop publishing has brought a new growth industry, the counterfeiting of virtually undetectable fraudulent checks, and banks and law enforcement officials say the cost to the economy could reach $1 billion this year. Those who carry out this check fraud are using the same inexpensive personal computers that transformed the way millions of businesses produce newsletters and advertising. The criminals feed their computers images of good checks drawn on good accounts. [Page A1.]

HEADLINE: Rising Rates: Jarring Truth

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
The unexpected rises in interest rates in Italy and Sweden last week resulted from special factors in those countries, but they still served as a jarring reminder to West European financial markets that a long period of declining rates is drawing to an end.
Italy's decision on Thursday to push its discount rate up half a point, to 7.5 percent, and Sweden's move earlier that day to raise its benchmark lending rate by half a point, to 8 percent, sent European stock and bond markets tumbling on Friday and threw currency markets into turmoil. 
 With investors betting that the rate increases might slow or reverse Germany's policy of cautious rate reductions, the mark jumped against the dollar, despite expectations of a rate increase soon in the United States. The dollar closed in Europe on Friday at 1.550 marks, down from 1.575 late Thursday.
 
Isolated Cases?
 But economists said that the markets probably overreacted and that what happened in Italy and Sweden, while not devoid of influence on economic and monetary policy in the rest of Europe, should not be seen as a harbinger of similar moves in Germany, the Continent's economic engine, or in other nations.
"What happened in Italy and Sweden is a result of problems that are essentially domestic and specific to those countries," David Kern, the chief economist at National Westminster Bank in London, said.
In Italy, analysts said, the central bank was trying to send a message to political leaders that they must deal aggressively and rapidly with the country's huge and growing budget deficit. Italy's fiscal problems have badly undermined the value of the lira at a time of uncertainty about the coalition Government headed by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.
In Sweden, there are clear signs of resurgent inflation as the country struggles with a large budget deficit and political instability. Only a month before a general election, the Conservative Government of Prime Minister Carl Bildt is trailing its left-wing Social Democratic rivals.
"What you had was two independent central banks sending loud warning shots to Governments that they have to do something on the fiscal side and do it now," Phyllis Reed, an economist at Barclays de Zoette Wedd in London, said.
 
 
Panic Selling of Stocks
 The Swedish and Italian actions were enough to set off a short, sharp wave of panic selling in thinly traded summertime stock markets that have been fixated on interest rate moves. In Frankfurt, the DAX index was down on Friday by 30.6 points, or 1.42 percent, to close at 2,124.68. In Paris, the CAC-40 index in Paris fell 31.98 points, or 1.57 percent, to 2,006.95. Only the London exchange, where investors have been anticipating a British rate increase for months, shrugged off the news, rising 4.1 points on Friday to close at 3,142.3.
"While the specific triggers were domestic, the moves did touch a raw nerve," Mr. Kern said. "They highlight the uncertainty and the unease in the financial markets, particularly the bond market, that we have been seeing since February."
The Federal Reserve's decision to reverse course and begin raising official interest rates in the United States in February set off a swoon in global bond markets that dragged down most equity markets as well.
Led by Germany, European nations had been cutting rates for two years in an attempt to steer their economies out of a deep recession. Of the leading European nations, only Britain is far enough along the recovery path that it is close to tightening monetary policy.
But Britain is not expected to act for at least another month or two, and most analysts had expected that Germany, followed by other nations on the Continent, would cut rates at least once more in the fall and then not begin raising them until their economies picked up next year.
Mr. Kern said the Italian and Swedish rate increases slightly decreased the likelihood that Germany would cut rates again. But Michael O'Hanlon, chief international economist at Kidder Peabody Securities in London, said he still expected the Bundesbank to cut rates half a point in the fall, probably after the national elections in October. Germany's discount rate now stands at 4.5 percent and its Lombard rate at 6 percent.
"We don't expect the moves in Italy and Sweden to have any effect, with the exception of creating a safe-haven move into the D-mark," Mr. O'Hanlon said. "A stronger D-mark improves the inflation profile in our view and gives them more confidence that they can cut rates."
A stronger currency makes exports more expensive, but makes imports cheaper, thereby reducing inflationary pressures.
Ms. Reed said that if the Bank of Italy's rate increase stimulated the Government to produce a credible deficit-cutting program, the central bank might even turn around and reduce rates again.

HEADLINE: Fed Looks At Growth And Risk

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 14

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is a man in the difficult position of trying to tiptoe as close as possible to a line he cannot see and must not cross.
Mr. Greenspan wants the economy to grow as near as possible at the level that economists call its maximum sustainable capacity -- that is, the greatest growth that does not produce inflationary pressure as factories pile on overtime and bid up the prices of raw material. 
 To prevent the economy from crossing that line, even temporarily, the Federal Reserve now seems certain to raise short-term interest rates soon, quite possibly on Tuesday at a meeting of the central bank's rate-setting committee. Seven members of that group expressed concern in separate interviews over the last two weeks that the economy might be growing too quickly.
While a consensus may be forming within the Fed, there is considerable debate outside it, both about the concept of maximum sustainable output and the central bank's sense of its nearness.
 
A Preference for Growth
 There are many Democrats in Congress who see nothing wrong with unlimited output. To them, the notion that the American economy might grow too fast seems appalling on the face of it.
Others in Congress and a few officials in the Clinton Administration reluctantly accept the concept of maximum sustainable growth, but think that the Federal Reserve underestimates how fast the economy can grow without setting off inflation.
They are alarmed by the prospect that the Fed will raise interest rates again, even though the Labor Department reported last week that the Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index both showed only modest increases in July, excluding volatile food and energy prices.
"What's wrong with growth and jobs if it's not being reflected in inflation?" Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, asked.
The answer provided by Mr. Greenspan in testimony last Wednesday, and supported by some of President Clinton's economic advisers, is that Government statistics are so slow to show inflation that by the time the figures clearly show rising prices, it is too late. Once inflation has taken hold, pressure rises on the Federal Reserve to slow the growth of money circulating in the economy by raising interest rates sharply, something than can cause a recession.
"Running over capacity is more like crossing a line than going off a cliff -- nothing abrupt changes," said Alan S. Blinder, the new vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, in an interview a week ago. "The dangers of running over are that you start running into higher rates of inflation."
The problem, as Mr. Greenspan acknowledged on Wednesday is that nobody is able to measure precisely the economy's maximum capacity, or whether the economy is about to cross the line on any given day.
Federal Reserve officials think that the line is very close now. Mr. Blinder said that while the economy might have been three-quarters of a percentage point to one-and-a-half points below full capacity in the spring, most of the gap "has been closed since then, and probably only a little bit remains."
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the Council of Economic Advisers, said in the spring that the economy was operating at 99 percent of capacity, but is reluctant now to say whether the economy has arrived there.
"We're operating in the range of capacity," she said.
The Council of Economic Advisers tried to estimate the maximum capacity during the 1960's and 1970's, but the Reagan Administration abandoned the effort because officials could not decide how to make forecasts on capacity reflect the supply-side effects they predicted from lower taxes. "I just didn't find it terribly useful for the work we were doing," said Murray L. Weidenbaum, who halted the estimates while serving as Mr. Reagan's first chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
Some private analysts using big computer models still try to make estimates. Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers, said that the American economy operated at one-tenth of 1 percent above capacity in the second quarter of this year, crossing the line for the first time since autumn 1990.
Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee last month that he had seen some, but not all, of the early signals that he would expect of an economy reaching full capacity. There were shortages of truck drivers and construction workers. More companies were delivering goods late because of backlogs in orders. And manufacturers were paying more for their raw material, he said.
"As yet, these sorts of indications do not seem to be widespread across the economy," Mr. Greenspan said then. "Nonetheless, we shall need to be particularly alert to these emerging signs in considering further adjustments to policy in the period ahead."
Reaching full capacity does not mean that the economy stops growing. It just means that the economy cannot grow any faster than capacity itself increases, which rises as the labor force expands and as companies learn to produce more with the same equipment and number of employees.
Estimates of annual capacity growth range from 2.4 percent to 2.8 percent. Actual output grew at an annual rate of 3.7 percent in the second quarter. The Clinton Administration assumed in its projection last month that economic growth would slow to 2.6 percent in 1996 and 2.5 percent in subsequent years as the economy reached this natural speed limit.
 
Factory Output as a Gauge
 In trying to estimate the economy's potential to produce goods and services, economists look first at the unemployment rate and at the parts of the economy with readily measurable capacity: factories and mines. Manufacturing accounts for only one-fifth of the nation's output, according to the Commerce Department, but is more easily measured than the output of services -- a wide-ranging category that now makes up three-fifths of the economy and covers everything from haircuts to investment banking.
Mr. Greenspan said last week that he thought the Fed's measurements of factory capacity utilization were among the few accurate economic statistics the Federal Government produces.
The nation's factories operated at 82.9 percent of capacity in the second quarter of this year, the highest level since 1989. On Monday, the Fed is scheduled to issue its estimates of capacity utilization and industrial production for July, the last important indicators it will see before the rate meeting on Tuesday.
Edward W. Kelley Jr., a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, said in a recent interview that Fed officials would also review the unemployment rate on Tuesday. Unemployment stood at 6.1 percent of the work force during July, a rate that most Fed officials see as consistent with an economy at full capacity.
If more workers had currently useful skills, or if businesses were more efficient and could produce more with the employees and equipment they have, then the nation's potential capacity to produce goods and services could increase faster. The Administration contends that its worker-training programs and other initiatives will increase the nation's economic potential.
But Wall Street analysts are gloomy about the prospects of this happening, pointing out that the Administration's programs, potentially effective or not, have been drastically scaled back in the Congressional budget process.
Mr. Sinai of Lehman Brothers remarked, "The policy, starting now, is to slow growth and increase potential -- it's the only way to finesse the business cycle."

HEADLINE: In Boat Races, Dragons Roar and Tradition Lives

 BODY:
Poised at the prow of a Chinese dragon boat, Jack Ribeiro beat the drum yesterday to set the pace for his team. Synchronized by the thundering drumbeats, the 20-member crew paddled furiously in swift, short strokes.
The team members' low grunts were buried by the splashing of foamy white waves on the lake in Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens. Three slim teakwood boats -- decorated with dragon heads at the prow and dragon tails at the stern and painted in the traditional colors of gold, green, blue and red -- roared toward the finish line in the Greater New York Championship Race of the Chinese Dragon Boat Festival. 
 Thirty teams competed in the weekend races, an American version of a 2,000 year-old Chinese tradition that takes place in southern China during the Summer Festival, the season's most important holiday. The four winning teams will compete in the national finals in the Hudson River near Battery Park City on Sunday, with the winner to represent the United States in the 1995 international dragon boat races in Hong Kong.
Dragon-boat racing is gaining momentum as a sport in the United States, said Henry Wan, chairman of the race. Four years ago, in the first year of the New York competition, there were only 10 teams, he said, adding that there were now more than 50 teams competing on the West Coast and in Iowa, Virginia, Boston and Philadelphia.
 
Different From Crew
 Dragon-boat racing is different from western crew racing. The person steering the boat is separate from the guide, who beats a drum and does not paddle, said Kevin Mayberry, captain of a team sponsored by Deloitte & Touche. The paddles of a dragon boat are shorter than crew oars, and their blades are smaller and straight, not curved, he said. This slows down the boat, but speed is made up through quicker strokes, up to 100 a minute, instead of the 32 strokes in crew.
Nearly half of the participants in the race are non-Chinese. Companies like AT&T, Debevoise & Plimpton, Deloitte & Touche and Marine Midland Bank promote the sport because it fosters unity and team spirit, Mr. Wan said. Its eclectic participants also include students, police officers, firefighters and construction workers.
"It feels different," said James Lawless, an associate in the law firm of Battle Fowler and the captain of its team, the Battling Barristers. "It's nice to be a part of something that's not American but very much a part of New York."
But for many Chinese-Americans, the sport has a deeper significance. It gives them an opportunity to reaffirm their identity and to renew their emotional ties with ancestral homeland.
"When I was little, the race was part of my life," said Kenny Cheung, 32, a captain of an AT&T team. "When I came to this country from Hong Kong, I missed it terribly."
 
Helping the Community
 Michael Geoghegan, senior executive vice president of Hong Kong Bank, which sponsored the race, said his company became involved because it wanted to give something back to the Chinese community. "We have 33,000 depositors in Chinatown and Flushing area," he said.
In China the boat races are part of the festivities commemorating the death of a court minister, Qu Yuan, who lived in 400 B.C. and was renowned for his righteousness. This year, the holiday fell on June 23. But cold weather and races in other cities delayed the New York race, said Roger Tam, a spokesman for the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office, which organized the event.
While you do not have to be Chinese to paddle, following Chinese customs can help with winning. Members of The Big Apple team, made up of New York City firefighters and college students, faithfully gorged on tofu stew and buns filled with sweet red bean paste before their race. Michael Levin, a team member who raced in Hong Kong in 1991, went a step further and gobbled down a sweet rice dumpling before the race. His team came in first in its group during the preliminaries, and second overall.

392 pages. A John Macrae Book/Henry Holt & Company. $30.
The cold war was an ideological war, a weapons war and an economic war. It lasted longer than World War I, World War II and the Korean and Vietnam Wars combined. Now that only one of the adversaries remains a superpower, Western historians are warring over several theoretical questions: When did the cold war actually begin? Was the Soviet Union alone responsible or should some of the blame be shared by the United States? Can any American Administration take credit for "winning" the cold war? Was the cold war avoidable or were the United States and the Soviet Union, in the phrase of the disarmament expert Paul C. Warnke, two apes on a treadmill? 
 In a highly readable book, "The Cold War," Martin Walker grapples with most of these questions without necessarily answering them. He examines almost half a century of confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union. His book smites both sides with long-forgotten details about the distrust that caused Washington and Moscow to destroy their wartime alliance the moment Nazi Germany was defeated. He writes from strength: now the United States bureau chief of the London newspaper The Guardian, he also reported from Moscow and wrote "The Waking Giant: Gorbachev and Perestroika."
Mr. Walker begins his fairly evenhanded survey with the 1945 Yalta conference of the Allied leaders to agree on war strategy against Germany and Japan and settle the broad outlines of the peace. He then covers the effect of the dropping of the atomic bombs and the buildup of terrifying nuclear arsenals, satellites in space, the Cuban missile crisis during the Kennedy Presidency, the American loss in Vietnam, the policy of containment, the demise and revival of detente, Mikhail Gorbachev and the end of the cold war.
Throughout "The Cold War," the author delivers telling scenes of conflict in Washington between statesmen who wanted to trust the Soviet Union and those who were opposed to any postwar aid that might sustain the war-battered Communist regime. In the early days of the Truman Presidency, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson wanted to share the atom bomb's secrets with the Russians as a goodwill gesture. And Under Secretary of State Dean Acheson argued: "The advantage of being ahead in such a race is nothing, compared with not having the race." But neither Stimson nor Acheson prevailed.
Recent revisionist historians have shifted some of the fault for the cold war to American rigidity. Yet nothing in the Stalin record -- as exposed by Kremlin leaders themselves after the dictator's death -- offered hope for a renewal of the wartime alliance or democratization in the Soviet Union and its satellites, which were held in line by Russian tanks.
Mr. Walker's book isn't quite revisionist history, yet at times he seems inclined to see the bright, neo-Orwellian, side of the cold war. What I found most startling was his cool emphasis on the positive economic achievements of the cold war for the world.
Writing about the two major shooting wars in Korea and Vietnam during the cold war era, he makes much of the fact that "America's cold war defense budgets also pumped investment into the now-booming economies of the Pacific Rim. Japan's economic miracle can be dated with some precision to the effect of the Korean War, when Japan became the main base for the U.S. war effort." Again, on the Vietnam War, he says that "Japanese Hondas and stereos and radios packed the PX stores on the American bases.
"The hotel boom of Bangkok followed the Thai capital's designation as a main rest-and-recreation center."
This sanguine interpretation neglects the human side of the equation: the millions of military and civilian casualties in both wars, the waste of resources that might have been used to improve living standards instead of sophisticated armaments and the environmental damage caused by chemical weapons and aerial bombing. Korea and Vietnam were not PX-land.
On the tantalizing question of whether the cold war was inevitable, Mr. Walker writes: "It is just possible, had Roosevelt lived, and had there been no stricken Europe between them, no Western European Allies still festooned in embarrassing colonial entanglements, and in a most prickly pride, that the cold war might not have got under way. But Roosevelt was dead, the Americans had the monopoly of the bomb and Europe sprawled between the victors, to be occupied, rescued or fought over."
There are enough ifs here to render even guesswork futile, but the author's speculation is pleasing to contemplate.
Fiction may be considered inappropriate as valid history by nostalgic cold warriors on both sides who are still claiming credit for the end of the cold war. Nevertheless, there's an admirable human quality and perhaps more than a measure of truth in what John le Carre's exemplary intelligence agent, George Smiley, had to say about the cold war in "The Secret Pilgrim":
"It was man who ended the cold war in case you didn't notice. It wasn't weaponry, or technology, or armies, or campaigns. It was just man. Not even Western man either, as it happened, but our sworn enemy in the East, who went into the streets, faced the bullets and the batons and said: 'We've had enough.' "

From India, With Stops On the Way

BYLINE: By NEIL STRAUSS 

 BODY:
XLNC, which performed on Thursday night at S.O.B.'s with the singer Bindu, is probably the first contemporary Indian bhangra band to perform to an integrated audience in New York. It's surprising that it has taken so long, considering that the hybrid called bhangra, a mix of harvest festival music from Punjab in Northern India and reggae, rap, techno and club music, actually comes from England. Like hip-hop, bhangra has become a way for a minority culture -- in this case, Indians born in Britain -- to find identity and empowerment through its own music.
XLNC (pronounced "excellency") is among bhangra's youngest upstarts. On Thursday, its dance music, powered by the adrenaline tempos of the two-headed dholak drum and the larger, congalike dhol drum, insured that the dance floor remained a sea of waving arms and airborne dollar bills the entire night. Harbajan Singh Talwar and Dave Singh sang mostly in Punjabi, but also in Hindi and English, closing almost every song with rousing chants of "Hey!" Mr. Talwar, in particular, had a resonant voice that soared majestically over the band's good-time grooves. Two keyboardists mixed the traditional and the modern, playing everything from repetitive house-music riffs to spiraling flutelike melodies. 
 Because of the economics of touring, Bindu left her own backing band in England and performed with XLNC. Though Bindu's high, pinched voice is ravishing, its marriage to XLNC sounded forced at times. The band tended to outrun and overpower her more ethereal vocals.
It was still refreshing to hear both acts live. On their most recent albums and singles, available on the Multitone label, XLNC and Bindu sound slicker and more produced than Ace of Base, George Michael and the other pop stars they sometimes emulate. In concert, the alienating sheen was absent, replaced by a party atmosphere where mistakes and rawness were allowed, so long as the slap and thud of the dholak and dahl didn't stop.

A First-Place Team Looking for Handout

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: MONTREAL

 BODY:
In the humid confines of what is surely the ugliest stadium in North America, Claude Brochu, the president of the Montreal Expos, ponders the essential contradiction of his team: with the second-lowest payroll it is in first place in the National League East with the best record in baseball.
"We're living a miracle now," Brochu said Thursday, molded into a contoured yellow plastic seat inside empty Olympic Stadium. "But we have no margin for error. If we make mistakes, we can't buy ourselves out." 
 The Expos were in Pittsburgh as Brochu spoke, playing their final game before the players strike, which began after games ended Thursday night.
The strike may wreck Manager Felipe Alou's team's best chance for post-season glory since the strike-shortened season in 1981. Right fielder Moises Alou is hitting .339, with 22 home runs. First baseman Larry Walker is at .322, with 19 homers. Pitcher Ken Hill is 16-5. Pedro Martinez, acquired last fall from the Dodgers, is 11-5.
The Expos are 74-40, three and a half games better than the Yankees.
Their payroll is $18.8 million. Only the Pirates' payroll of $13.5 million is leaner, but their record is 53-61, and they are up for sale.
"We spent too much this year," said Brochu, only slightly tongue-in-cheek. "The payroll should have been $14 million."
The question lingers: If the Expos are so adept at winning on the cheap, why does this so-called small-market team require the revenue-sharing/ salary cap plan demanded by owners and rejected by players?
"Revenue sharing and the cap are inseparable; that's what we've decided," said Brochu, in a voice accented with the sound of a native Quebecer. "We need to reduce the spread between team payrolls. The overriding issue is an element of cost control. The cap is a question of survival."
 
The Free Agent Walk
 Spoken just like Richard Ravitch, the owners' gravel-voiced chief negotiator. Ravitch has held up Montreal as an example of a team that has survived on the financial edge, but will have to rid itself, one by one, of players like Walker, Alou and Marquis Grissom as they become free agents, as the Pirates did, with Barry Bonds, Bobby Bonilla and Doug Drabek.
Walker is in the final year of his deal, Grissom has one more year and Alou cannot turn toward free-agent wealth until 1996. The Expos have a small coterie of millionaires on a team paid mostly in the chintzy low six figures. Walker makes $4.02 million, Grissom $3.56 million, Hill $2.5 million, pitcher John Wetteland $2.25 million and Alou, an extraordinary bargain, at $1.4 million.
"If I keep this team together, it will be a $30 million payroll next year," Brochu said.
Yet through deft scouting that has regularly brought up three or four solid minor leaguers each season, and smart, cost-conscious acquisitions, the Expos have wrung a .649 winning percentage out of its low-level revenues.
"You can't live on miracles forever," Brochu said.
But if Brochu's claims are right, he has been doing well hanging on. The team made $1 million (Canadian) in profits in 1992 and 1993, or about $600,000 in United States dollars. This season, the team was projected to lose about $6 million, in part because of the $7 million downdraft in national television revenues this season.
"Maybe if we'd gone to the end, won the World Series, we'd break even," he said. "But now, the losses will be horrendous."
In the owners' proposed revenue-sharing plan, money would shift from cash-rich teams like the Yankees, Mets and Dodgers to revenue-poor clubs like the Expos, Pirates, Milwaukee Brewers and San Diego Padres. A cap would then be set, and teams would be able to spend from 84 percent to 110 percent of it.
Brochu said revenue sharing -- essentially found money from his richer, recalcitrant brethren -- would let him keep his pricier players, and afford low-paid rising stars like first baseman Cliff Floyd ($109,500), shortstop Wil Cordero ($200,000) and pitcher Gil Heredia ($135,000) when their salaries soar.
 
Competitive Figures
 "If we can spend to 84 percent of the cap," Brochu said, "we can compete better than most other clubs at 120 percent."
But Montreal may be lucky if enough revenue is redistributed to allow it to spend to the minimum on the cap.
"From the plans I've heard, no more than $8 million would be redistributed to the small-market clubs," said Andrew Zimbalist, a Smith College economics professor and baseball finance expert.
So, for example, a $35 million cap would force clubs to spend at least $29.4 million. A transfer of $8 million atop Montreal's current $18.8 million payroll would fall short of the required spending level.
Brochu is a former executive vice president of Joseph E. Seagram & Sons Ltd., whose chairman, Charles Bronfman, owned the Expos from their inception in 1969. But Bronfman grew tired of soaring player salaries and put the team up for sale in 1990. When no local buyers appeared, Brochu assembled a group of local companies and the city of Montreal to purchase the team for $80 million.
"I put everything I own into it," said Brochu, who owns a 7.5 percent stake. Asked why, Brochu said jokingly, "Mr. Bronfman was looking for a bigger fool."
From his partners, Brochu received advice that forces him to be a miser: We're giving you $5 million each, now don't come back for more.
Brochu operates the team from a large ground-floor office at Olympic Stadium. On one wall are several caricatures drawn of him. On a credenza sit two bottles of Le Grand Orange wine, a Chardonnay and a Zinfandel, vintage 1992, courtesy of a former Expos deity, Rusty Staub.
Brochu and his parsimonious partners bought into inherently difficult straits: largely French-speaking Montreal has a deeper devotion to the Canadiens and has never supported the Expos with attendance of more than 2.3 million. Only 25 games are broadcast in English (there are 65 in French), and the market for advertising dollars is small.
"Montreal has the most difficult marketing job in all of baseball," said Peter Bavasi, who competed against the Expos when he ran the Blue Jays. "They have a difficult political environment, with the French separatism, and the split between the French and English-speaking constituencies. You have to be very creative to draw from both communities. It was never hard for the Blue Jays to market across Canada where the rest of the language is English."
Unlike the Blue Jays, the Expos are not a cash machine. Each city is in a large market (Toronto's is 3.8 million, Montreal's is 3.1 million) but the Blue Jays sell out the 50,516 Skydome setas every game. The Expos' average attendance this season has been a mere 24,543, barely half the 46,500 capacity.
 
Just Can't Get a Break
 The Expos' deal with Olympic Stadium, which is owned by the province of Quebec, generates about $3 million-a-year in revenues, "the second worst deal in baseball," Brochu said, and nothing from skybox rentals and parking fees. "We try to get a better deal, but they're not giving us a break," he said.
The sliding value of the Canadian dollar, said Brochu, means that by paying all players in United States dollars, the Expos lose at least $3 million annually on the unfavorable exchange rate.
So if Montreal is not a small market strictly by the standards of its population, it is a small-revenue market without a history of pennant success like the Blue Jays. Brochu bristled at criticism that the Expos are doing so well, operating with harsh financial discipline, and don't need help from revenue-sharing and the salary cap. Or that historically meager fan support proves that Montreal doesn't deserve a team and should move, as George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, said Wednesday.
Brochu's response is part standard owners' rhetoric, part hard reality.
"There's an air of contempt that small markets are mismanaged, that we're not marketing as we should, and we should move," Brochu said. "We have to be allowed to compete, and to do it for more than a snapshot of time."
For now, Brochu is playing ostrich, not thinking about the very real possibility that the owners will fail to enact revenue sharing and a salary cap. Without them, he insists that the Expos will become less valuable, and that he cannot sell out to a local buyer without taking a loss.
"I want a respectable return on my investment," Brochu said. "It shouldn't be like life insurance, where you have to die to get paid back."

HEADLINE: A Breakthrough on Korean Arms?

 BODY:
Nuclear diplomacy between the U.S. and North Korea made promising gains in an accord reached Friday in Geneva. The agreement not only assures that a temporary freeze in the North's nuclear program will remain in place until talks resume in September but also sketches a road map to a lasting solution.
It will take more hard work by negotiators to work out the details and leave Korea nuclear-free. But the agreement is an encouraging sign that North Korea is putting the brakes on its nuclear program even under its new leadership. 
 For two years, international inspectors verify, Pyongyang has kept its pledge not to reprocess spent nuclear fuel and extract plutonium for use in bombs. Now it has gone further.
The objects of immediate concern in Washington were the 8,000 spent fuel rods that the North provocatively removed from its reactor in May. The rods are starting to corrode in the cooling ponds where they are stored. The North will now arrange to put them in dry storage under international inspection. That postpones the need to reprocess them and allows more time to consummate an agreement that would prevent them from ever being used for bomb-making.
Such an agreement may well be foreshadowed by Friday's accord. The North pledged not to refuel the reactor for now, preventing more spent fuel from being generated. It will also halt construction of two larger reactors capable of expanding its output of spent fuel and seal its facility for reprocessing that fuel. These steps, the North has agreed, will all be verifiable by international inspection. In return, the U.S. agreed to end the North's diplomatic and economic isolation. The two sides will exchange liaison offices, a first step toward U.S. diplomatic recognition of North Korea. South Korea's President has now confirmed his promise to build light-water reactors, with Japanese financing, to replace the North's graphite models. These reactors are less liable to be used to generate plutonium usable in bombs than are Korea's current reactors. The U.S. will help meet the North's electricity needs while its reactors are being replaced.
The North has not yet agreed to give up the 8,000 spent fuel rods removed from its reactor at Yongbyon or to forgo refueling its reactor forever. Nor has it allowed special inspections to determine how much spent fuel it may have diverted in 1989. But the North did pledge to remain a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and allow full access to all its nuclear sites as part of a final resolution. That is the key to eventually unlocking its nuclear past. In return, the U.S. would offer security assurances, including a pledge not to redeploy nuclear arms to South Korea.
The new Government in North Korea has defied the pessimists by beginning to turn the temporary freeze of its nuclear program into a permanent one. The promising accord is a rebuff to those in Washington and Seoul who were prepared to undermine the new regime in Pyongyang and risk bringing the nuclear crisis to a boil. It brings credit to the Clinton Administration, which had the courage to reject such hawkish counsel and pursue diplomacy.

Why the Rush?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Democrats accuse Republicans of delaying crime and health bills to make President Clinton look bad. But the truth is Democrats are rushing to judgment to avoid having to heed the voice of the people in an election only 12 weeks away.
The crime bill, temporarily stymied by the gun lobby, is far from dead. That is not merely because a President and a majority leadership can use puissant patronage -- and a reprise of last year's "Don't kill my young Presidency" -- to snatch back the votes of enough of the 58 recalcitrant House Democrats to save the party from gridlockjaw. 
 More to the political point, the crime bill has a good chance of passage because it has been presented as a "tough" measure, with prison-building, death-penalty and cop-subsidy elements emphasized, while its "soft" root-casuistry -- multibillion-dollar social spending on midnight basketball -- has been downplayed. The bill exemplifies heavy-spending conservatism, an oxymoron hard to beat.
The health care push, on the contrary, is now seen by voters for what it is: a return to Great Societyism.
Hillary Clinton anointed elite task forces, working in secret, to concoct a Government takeover of a seventh of the American economy, financed by cigarette smoke and mirrors. Eighteen months later, with her grandiose scheme widely derided and the public calling for sober second thought, her gurus have gone underground and not even her husband espouses the misbegotten "Clinton plan."
The ship of Government health care is now frantically jettisoning baggage to stay afloat in Congress. Democrats in the House are waiting to see how many bags of taxes and coercive controls the Senate will toss overboard.
For George Mitchell, the swan-singing Democratic leader in the Senate, timing has become everything. Never mind waiting for the Congressional Budget Office to cost out the latest bills; forget about serious debate of a Republican alternative, the sensible Dole-Packwood insurance reform.
The reason for his urgency: Mitchell believes the Democrats will lose three or four Senate seats in November. He must get that legislation into harbor before the liberal ship sinks, an event scheduled for Election Day. Massive change must be irreversible before the anticipated reverses.
His own bill, with its employer mandate and 1.75 percent tax on everybody's health insurance premium, is not intended to be passed. Despite White House blather about thus-far-no-further, Mitchell's first fallback position was launched as a bill to set up a compromise with a group headed by Republican Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island.
Chafee has been placed at the head of a bipartisan group that has labeled itself "mainstream," not so subtly suggesting that conservative opposition to Government-dominated medicine is extremist.
Ominously, Chafee is using Mitchell's liberal bill as his lodestar; meanwhile, Bob Dole is having fits because the renegade Republicans refuse to consider the conservative alternative. That signals a Mitchell-Chafee setup.
Beware the likely deal: Chafee's rump group comes up with a modified Mitchell bill, giving the Democrats enough votes to invoke cloture on any filibuster. Then the House would pass a Clintonite bill, pulling the House-Senate conferees back to the left, which Clinton would sign in the Return of the Comeback Kid. (Or, if Chafee's fixes are minor enough, the House would pass the liberal Senate bill.)
To prevent this deal, Chafee's Republican colleagues are telling him: "If we can prove how bad this Mitchell bill is in debate and stop it, we will take control of the Senate and offer health insurance reform in the spring."
If Mitchell and Chafee cannot ram their mainstreamliner through the Senate in a week or so, the House may go home to campaign.
Democratic liberals fear that expression of the popular will. That explains their rush to health judgment. Republicans -- even nonconservatives like Chafee -- should want voters to have a chance to influence the outcome of the most far-reaching legislation since the New Deal.
Democrats deny that the hurry is to make the President look leaderly, and thereby help Democrats avert losses in this fall's election. But their real reason for forcing Congressional action on health care is inescapable: to beat the voters to the punch.

HEADLINE: New Breed of Check Forgers Exploits Desktop Publishing

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
The proliferation of desktop publishing has brought a new growth industry, the counterfeiting of virtually undetectable fraudulent checks, and banks and law enforcement officials say the cost to the economy could reach $1 billion this year.
Perpetrators of this fast-growing kind of check fraud are using the same inexpensive personal computers with sophisticated graphics capabilities that transformed the way millions of legitimate businesses produce newsletters and advertising. 
 But the criminals are feeding their computers images of good checks drawn on good accounts. They change the date, the name of the payee and sometimes the check number, and make dozens of copies of the fake on a laser printer loaded with check paper, which can be bought at most stationery stores.
In a particularly brazen case, a Los Angeles-based gang has been roaming the country cashing fake payroll checks at banks, bank and law enforcement officials say. In the next few weeks, 12 members of the gang will be sentenced in Federal District Court in Charlotte, N.C., for their involvement in passing thousands of bad checks in the Southeast, totaling more than $2 million.
"They have hit all over the country," Jessie Wood, an investigator with the Secret Service in Charlotte, said in an interview recently. "They were in Boston last week with exactly the same kind of scheme."
The American Bankers Association says desktop publishing counterfeits are the No. 1 crime problem facing banks. And payroll check scams are only one of the myriad check fraud schemes plaguing not only banks but retailers. Crooks also commonly counterfeit large corporate checks, deposit them in a bank account -- either an existing one or a new account opened by the crook or by an accomplice -- and then draw on them. And around the country, an increasing number of criminals are cashing counterfeit checks in supermarkets, department stores and other retail establishments.
"We'll cash a payroll check if a customer spends 10 percent of it with us," said Angie Spoto, vice president of treasury operations at Ames Department Stores, a discount department store chain based in Rocky Hill, Conn., with 300 stores in 14 Northeast states. "It generates sales for us."
But it also generates losses. Of its $500 million in sales to people who paid by check in 1991, Ames wrote off 1.8 percent because of fraud. This year, it expects to cut that loss rate by half by installing check-reading devices at all of its 3,200 cash registers, which are linked to a national data base of deadbeats maintained by the Deluxe Corporation, a check printing company.
In California, the center of counterfeiting activity, transactions involving fraudulent checks rose fivefold last year at Wells Fargo Bank alone. In New York State, Chemical Bank reports a 50 percent increase so far this year.
Most check counterfeits operate in gangs, but individual entrepreneurship also abounds. John S. Halleron, a self-employed computer programmer who used to work at a payroll-check processing company, has been accused of passing nearly 100 fake checks he made with a software program for businesses called Create-a-Check. He will be tried as early as next week in Franklin County Court in Columbus, Ohio.
"Everything we see is computer-generated, so the items are a little bit better -- actually quite a bit better -- than they used to be," said Ed Lindsey, a detective in the bunco-forgery division of the Los Angeles Police Department. "It started getting out of hand three years ago and now it's gone beyond that -- it's out of control."
The problem is that commonly available computers can merge images seamlessly, creating seemingly official documents, even ones laden with elaborate decoration and "authenticated" with stamps and signatures. And the corner copy shop now has a machine that can make such a realistic color facsimile of a dollar bill that the Government is changing the currency's design.
 
 
Easier Than Copying Cash
 It is far easier to counterfeit checks than cash. For one thing, there is no standard check design. Indeed, more and more businesses are saving bank check fees by printing their own checks on standard office laser printers. These printers, of course, are also available to crooks, as are inexpensive scanners and graphics software to copy corporate logos and check designs. And with Americans writing 60 billion checks a year, it is relatively easy for crooks to steal one as a template. In some cases, they have accomplices that work in stores or banks. Sometimes they steal insurance payments or other checks out of the mail; sometimes they wait outside check cashing stores offering money to people to copy their paychecks.
"The information on your bank account is as available as every check you write," said Mary E. D'Agostino, a vice president and loss prevention manager for Wells Fargo. "Whoever handles that check -- the friend you write it to, the retail cashier, someone at the bank -- has access to that information."
Mr. Halleron in Columbus, for example, created fake checks with real account numbers that he took from the back of one of his own canceled checks, which had been endorsed with an account number, from a refund check issued him for returned merchandise, and from checks processed by the payroll company where he had worked, prosecutors said.
Once a counterfeit check is minted, the crook still has to turn it into cash. The operation of the Los Angeles gang, pieced together from interviews with Federal and local law enforcement officials, and from the indictments this spring of 27 members of the gang, is instructive.
Law enforcement officials say that the gang has an accomplice in a California bank who makes photocopies of checks from large companies as they pass through the bank's check clearing system. "Mules" pass the checks in return for 20 percent of the take.
Typically, cells of six or seven mules travel to a city with one or two controllers, who buy their tickets and provide the checks to forge. In Charlotte, the mules applied to the state motor vehicle department for nondriver photo identification cards. To arm the mules with second pieces of identification, the gang manufactured fake corporate ID's for the companies whose checks were being counterfeited.
Tellers were glad to cash what appeared to be genuine payroll checks -- drawn for about $800, a little less than the limit that most banks set for such transactions -- on good accounts that typically had millions of dollars on deposit. The gang would drive from branch to branch of the same bank cashing copies of the same check dozens of times a day.
 
 
$18,000 in One Day
 According to the Charlotte indictment, the gang cashed 39 checks in one day on the account of Pay Less Drug Stores, for a total of $26,000; 75 checks from Swiss Dairy for $50,000; 9 checks on the Rolm Company for $6,000 and 25 on Hilton Hotels, bringing in a total of $18,000.
After two or three days in one town, the gang typically moved into a different city, investigators said. The 27 indicted in Charlotte, including the 12 who pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing this month, were charged with cashing bad checks in 15 cities over four months.
The Charlotte banks noticed the problem when high-speed sorting machines spat out the phony checks because the laser-printed copies did not have the account number coded in magnetic ink, as good checks do.
"The girls that process checks called me up and said look at this: 18 checks that had been rejected all drawn on Pay Less drug store," said Bob Hansen, fraud investigator for Nationsbank in Charlotte.
Mr. Hanson immediately notified the Secret Service, which has jurisdiction over bank fraud. As the Federal investigation began, the banks themselves formed a fax network to share tips.
"It got so good we would send out a description of one guy and they would be locked up as they were walking into Wachovia or First Union," Mr. Hansen said, referring to the other large banks in the city.
The Secret Service was able to track down other check passers when they returned home to California because the checks they passed and the identification they used was in their real names. But the gang's masterminds, who continue to duplicate checks and send cells out across the nation to cash them, remain at large.
 
 
Banks Strike Back
 For years, banks played down their losses to check fraud. But as the costs have multiplied -- losses to all kinds of check fraud are estimated by banking experts to range from $5 billion to $10 billion a year -- the industry is fighting back.
Some banks are trying to make their checks harder to copy, putting small holograms on them and using special inks and printing processes that cannot be duplicated by copy machines or scanners. Features like these, however, help only if the clerk who receives a counterfeit check knows to look for them.
Wells Fargo pays tellers if they catch a fraud and hangs wanted posters with pictures of known forgers in its branches offering rewards for turning them in. (The bank has caught 27 of the 50 people for which it has issued posters.)
 Banks are also using computer technology to improve the age-old process of clearing paper checks. Some companies have started sending their banks an electronic list of the numbers and amounts of checks as they are written so the bank will immediately bounce any check that does not match.
Meanwhile, bank check clearing groups are developing electronic data bases of bad accounts to cut the time it takes to notify a bank that a bad check has been deposited. The New York Clearing House, which handles most checks in the New York metropolitan area, will begin such a system in December.
But in the cat-and-mouse game of catching counterfeiters, the banks have to work to stay ahead. Some banks gave tellers scanners to determine if the account number at the bottom of a check is printed with magnetic ink. But many crooks quickly discovered that laser printers that print with magnetic ink are available, making the counterfeit check undetectable even to machines.
Other efforts have been compromised equally quickly.
"We told the banks to put a certain safety feature on the checks, but someone figured out how to get around it," said Detective Lindsey of the Los Angeles police. "Each time we try something different with the banks, it seems to leak out."

HEADLINE: Spinoffs Giving Research Alley Industrial Base

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
Since 1876, when Thomas Edison opened the Menlo Park laboratory where he invented the electric light and the phonograph, the marriage between science and business has found a home in New Jersey.
Color television, the videotape recorder and liquid crystal displays were all invented at RCA's research center, while AT&T Bell Laboratories created everything from the transistor to the laser. Today, what might be called Research Alley -- the Route 1 corridor from New Brunswick to Princeton -- is the core of the nation's greatest concentration of corporate research and development. 
 For all the continuing breakthroughs by the 125,000 scientists and engineers working in the state, though, one question stands out: where are dynamic new enterprises growing up locally to take advantage of the inventions born in New Jersey labs? Experts say they are too few and far between.
More out of necessity than choice, at least one group is at last trying to step into that void. The David Sarnoff Research Center in Princeton -- the former RCA Laboratories -- has recently helped support a handful of new companies in the hope of turning some of the starry-eyed dreams of the institute's 900 employees into money-making ventures. More are on the way.
"We no longer have a single corporate parent, so for us necessity is the mother of invention," said Dr. James E. Carnes, a former RCA executive who is the center's president. "What we realized we needed to do is recreate our own RCA, but the only way to do that today was by building a galaxy of different companies spinning around us. So that's our goal."
Already, one spinoff company, Sensar, is developing a technology that enables computers to recognize moving images almost instantaneously. Another is working on sophisticated chemical and nuclear-energy detection systems. A third, HealthNet, to be unveiled soon, plans to deliver health-care information through an interactive television network.
 
Used in Fiber Optics
 The shift in approach is evident in the experience of Dr. Gregory H. Olsen, who left a secure job at the Sarnoff center, more than a decade ago to start his own business providing a device used in fiber optic systems. (Sarnoff, which became largely self-supporting in 1987 after RCA was sold to General Electric, formally operates as a unit of SRI International, an independent research organization in Palo Alto, Calif.)
"It was pretty much of an academic atmosphere," Dr. Olsen recalled, describing the 9-to-5 life at the center in those days as comfortable, insulated and slow-moving. "I didn't fit in."
But two years ago, after selling his company for $12 million, Dr. Olsen returned to the bucolic 350-acre Sarnoff center campus to give a talk. "I didn't recognize the place," he said. "People were really plugged into the outside world."
Dr. Olsen now runs a new company, Sensors Unlimited, with close ties to the Sarnoff center, named for the longtime RCA chairman. Dr. Olsen markets a special kind of laser developed by scientists and engineers at the Sarnoff center and contracts with the institute to carry out research projects to help him develop new products.
If successful, the Sarnoff effort could provide a road map for scientific centers under intense pressure from their corporate parents to cut back on extraneous research. This could prove particularly important if an expected wave of mergers and acquisitions among communications and pharmaceutical giants makes orphans of other major research centers like Sarnoff.
It might also offer a model to those seeking to cultivate high-tech entrepreneurs in the region instead of seeing some of the extensive scientific know-how in the area left fallow or used mostly to seed new companies elsewhere.
 
Challenging Obstacles
 Entrepreneurs in the research corridor face challenging obstacles. Venture capital has been particularly hard to find. Regulatory impediments, especially for environmental standards, are high. Lately, it is often too expensive to build and operate new manufacturing sites close by.
Of even more importance, perhaps, is that leading industries in the area like communications, chemicals and pharmaceuticals have been dominated by large companies. They have traditions of secrecy and corporate loyalty that long discouraged many employees from leaving the shelter of their companies.
These drawbacks have already proved costly. For example, in biotechnology -- a seemingly natural outgrowth of the convergence of New Jersey's pharmaceutical industry and Manhattan's sophisticated teaching hospitals -- the New York metropolitan region trails well behind California and the Boston area as a company location.
"If you're talking about spinoffs from our research," conceded Robert B. Ford, a spokesman for Bell Labs, "I'd guess you'd have to say that Silicon Valley was invented here. I can't think, though, of too many ones nearby."
One reason is that life was so comfortable inside major industrial research centers like Bell Labs that few researchers were tempted to leave. "They called it the golden womb," said James Hughes, an economist at Rutgers University. "That's why you don't see a whole host of startup companies."
Annalee Saxenian, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, recently wrote "Regional Advantage" (Harvard University Press, 1994), which examines Silicon Valley's success in bouncing back from the adversity of the early 1980's while many of the computer companies around Route 128 near Boston fared so poorly.
"It's not enough simply to build a science park and expect, like a field of dreams, for high-tech firms to come," she said. "What's important is that there has to be a closely knit regional network where companies not only compete intensely with each other but also learn from each other about changing markets and technologies."
Her research suggests why many costly state government programs around the country aimed at creating university-based technology centers and business "incubators" for nurturing newborn companies have been so disappointing.
 
Marketing Research Ideas
 New Jersey alone devoted a substantial share of a $350 million bond issue for higher education in 1988 to expanding an extensive network of advanced technology centers around the state to enhance industrial competitiveness. But William Ayers, president of Electron Transfer Technologies in Princeton, said: "Most of the money ended up being used by the universities. Very little of it got down to small entrepreneurs like us."
By contrast, the Sarnoff undertaking has the advantage of being run by people with experience in commercializing research ideas. The center was also a pioneer in high-definition television and is a leading member of the consortium that is working to define the standards for the coming generation of digital television. And the Sarnoff orbit is likely to contain many companies working with similar technologies.
"This is not an ivory tower," said James H. Clingham, Sarnoff's vice president for corporate affairs. "We're in the research business as a business in its own right. That drives everything we do."
 
Direct Incentives
 Unlike most other corporate and independent research centers, for instance, Sarnoff now provides direct incentives for researchers by offering them a share of the royalties and profits generated from their ideas. Under RCA, inventors received at most a $400 bonus for a patent.
More unusually, the center no longer discourages its inventors from going out on their own. It will even go so far as to help them start companies from within the center itself.
Chuni Ghosh, for example, recently began a venture, Princeton Electronic Systems, out of his lab at Sarnoff. Based on research into laser spectroscopy, he is developing a sophisticated system for detecting chemicals in the environment. It could be used by everyone from companies trying to locate tiny spills of toxic wastes to Pentagon officials keeping track of other countries that might be working on chemical weapons.
Last year, Dr. Ghosh arranged to work in partnership with the center, devoting some of his time to research and other time to his own company. Once there are profits, the Sarnoff center will receive a share.
Today, Dr. Ghosh has eight employees working out of the crowded lab, with plans to move to a separate site by the end of the year. To keep in close touch with developments at the research frontier, he wants to stay within four miles of the center.
"Sarnoff has never done anything like this before," said Dr. Ghosh, who came to the United States from India in 1979 to do advanced research. "I was amazed that Jim Carnes was so enthusiastic. It was much easier to work out an arrangement than I expected."
For his part, Dr. Carnes, the center's president, responds, "There is very little I will say no to these days."

HEADLINE: Whitewater Whistle-Blower Is Put on Leave

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
An investigator at the Treasury Department agency who began the inquiry into a failed Arkansas savings and loan that has erupted into the Whitewater investigation was placed on paid leave today while she undergoes an internal review of her conduct, an agency official said.
The employee, L. Jean Lewis, was suspended along with two other investigators at the Resolution Trust Corporation, which, as the Federal agency managing the savings and loan bailouts, examines whether anyone is legally liable for the collapse of failed financial institutions, said Stephen Katsanos, the agency's spokesman. But the reason behind the move was unclear, and Mr. Katsanos, citing a concern for privacy, said he could not describe the accusations. 
 The suspensions were questioned by Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, who has led Republican efforts in the House to investigate Whitewater. "I'm sure the R.T.C. wouldn't take this step lightly, but this would appear to be a blatant effort to discredit the work product of a criminal investigative unit that has embarrassed the powers that be," Mr. Leach said in an interview with The Associated Press, which first reported the suspensions.
Mr. Katsanos said the paid leaves of absence for the three investigators were intended to allow time for "an internal investigation into some matters that were raised concerning internal rules and procedures."
"This is not punitive," he said.
Mr. Katsanos said the suspensions were expected to last about two weeks but could remain in effect indefinitely. "That's going to depend on how long it takes them to complete their investigation," he said.
Ms. Lewis was a leading figure in the decision by the Kansas City office of the trust corporation to forward to the Justice Department two complaints of possible criminal conduct centering on Madison Guaranty, the failed savings and loan owned by James B. McDougal, who was President Clinton's partner in the Whitewater real estate investment.
Ms. Lewis and her associates sent the first referral in the Madison case to the Justice Department in late summer of 1992. They submitted the second referral in the fall of 1993, after learning to their surprise that the Justice Department had declined to prosecute after getting the first referral.
 
Suspicions Raised
 The second referral included accusations that President Clinton may have benefited from Madison's collapse. Investigators said about $12,000 from Madison Guaranty had been deposited in Mr. Clinton's account at another Arkansas bank for the 1984 gubernatorial campaign.
Concern about the referral's mention of Mr. Clinton and the possibility that the matter might become the subject of news reports prompted a series of meetings between Treasury Department officials and White House aides. Those discussions were the focus of hearings in the House and Senate in recent weeks.
The substance of the referrals is still under investigation, but Robert B. Fiske Jr., the former independent counsel in the case, has found no criminal wrongdoing in the White House contacts with Treasury Department officials. Nevertheless, Kenneth W. Starr, who was recently appointed by a three-judge Federal panel to replace Mr. Fiske, is expected to review the contacts again.
Suspended along with Ms. Lewis were Richard Iorio, Ms. Lewis's immediate supervisor, and their superior, Lee Ausen. All three were involved in the criminal referrals in the Madison case.

HEADLINE: Republicans Meet Their Man;
Pataki Delivers His Bare-Bones Message: I'm Not Cuomo

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: SYRACUSE, Aug. 12

 BODY:
The Republican clambake was a big success, and the reason was the tall man, somehow both elegant and awkward at once, who shook nearly every hand here. He leaned way over to sign his name, in blue marker, to a woman's T-shirt. "With your help, we're going to win," George E. Pataki, the Republican designee for governor, said again and again.
"So he's our man?" one Republican asked a friend. "Is he a sharp guy?" 
 The questions summed up much about this year's race for governor, as Mr. Pataki takes to the road to define himself as the man who would unseat Mario M. Cuomo. He has risen as Mr. Cuomo's chief rival, as a breathing reminder of what polls say is deep dissatisfaction with the Governor. Yet few people, even at die-hard Republican events like this, know him or what he stands for this early in the campaign.
The challenge, party strategists say, is to win the primary next month against Richard M. Rosenbaum, a former party chairman, and translate the discontent with Mr. Cuomo into votes for Mr. Pataki in the general election. So far, his message on the road, in small fund-raisers and meetings mostly with Republican groups, is heavy on the theme of change. He sticks to the basics: enacting the death penalty, cutting taxes and creating jobs.
But most of all he attacks Mr. Cuomo's record, offering in a dozen stops a day only a sprinkling of his own ideas and back-
ground.
"When Mario Cuomo wants to find out why we lead the nation in job losses, I have a simple suggestion: Governor, take a look in the mirror," Mr. Pataki said today at the opening of his regional office here, using a statistic that, like others he uses in speeches and commercials, is inaccurate, but not far off the mark. [Article, B4.]
"It's not simply about replacing a Democrat with a Republican or Cuomo with Pataki," Mr. Pataki said, his hands bobbing in the air before him. "It's about truly changing the direction of this state government."
His oratory on the stump seems aimed solely at becoming the "anybody" in what is widely called the "ABC vote," for "Anybody but Cuomo." In a twist on President Clinton's campaign slogan, ("It's the economy, stupid"), some people at events like this can be heard calling it the "ABCD vote" ("Anybody but Cuomo, dummy").
So far, Mr. Pataki has released only a handful of details of what he would do if elected. Many of these proposals have circulated for years among Republicans and anti-tax groups. He has advocated cutting the personal income tax to a maximum of 7.5 percent from the current 7.875 percent. (The tax had been scheduled to drop to 7.5 percent this year, but the Governor and Legislature decided to keep it at the current rate.) He also supports abolishing the surcharge on the corporate income tax immediately instead of over the next three years, lowering the capital gains tax and slashing state bureaucracy by not filling 30 percent of all vacant jobs.
But he has yet to adopt much of this into his stump speeches. More typical are passages like this, which he delivered last week before a Jewish group in Brooklyn and uses often, in various forms: "Mario Cuomo is a brilliant speaker and he is great at making excuses. He blamed Ronald Reagan. He blamed the Japanese. He blamed the national recession. He blamed international competition. But the fact of the matter is, it's the failed policies of this administration that are driving jobs and opportunity out of this state."
And that message was enough for many of the Republicans, and some Democrats, interviewed at Mr. Pataki's campaign stops last week, from Brooklyn to the Hudson Valley to Syracuse.
"I am very much against Cuomo," Marie Saunders, a Republican from just outside of Syracuse, said at the clambake at Hinerwadel's Grove in North Syracuse. And Mr. Pataki? "I wouldn't care what he did," she said. "He could dig ditches and I would vote for him. I really don't know too much about him."
Her friend Kermie McGrath added: "I think he's our savior. Mario Cuomo has ruined the state. I pray that the Republican Party can do something. Welfare has gotten out of hand. Crime has gotten out of hand. I'm really discouraged with New York State."
Ms. Saunders and Ms. McGrath, like nearly every Republican interviewed at several stops, said Mr. Pataki seemed to be a strong candidate. They said they were impressed with his resume, which he spins as a tale of a farm boy from Putnam County given all the opportunities a once-great state could offer: scholarships to Yale and Columbia Law School, a job at a big law firm in New York City, a 10-year political career in the Legislature.
 
Warm and Gangly
 They said he seemed decent and warm, if a bit stiff at times, endowed with a sort of gangliness his aides like to compare to Jimmy Stewart or Abraham Lincoln. That gangliness seems to extend to his speeches, which are competent and confident but no match for Mr. Cuomo's.
"It's definitely a detriment to George because he is going against a communicator on the level of Ronald Reagan," said Richard O'Beirne, head of a contractor's union in the Hudson Valley who attended a fund-raiser in Rockland County on Thursday that netted $20,000 for Mr. Pataki.
"George doesn't have that level of ability, but I don't know anybody else who does, either," said Mr. O'Beirne, whose union endorsed Mr. Pataki last week.
 
Wanted: A Platform
 But even as they praised Mr. Pataki, some Republicans said they wanted to hear more about his specific plans for governing. And with Democrats far outnumbering Republicans in the state, they said he would need a strong platform to attract dissatisfied Democrats.
"He's got to talk about the issues -- talk about the economy, talk about a lack of jobs," said Robert Giarrusso, the Onondaga County Republican chairman. "He can't just talk about them. He's got to come up with solutions."
Mr. Giarrusso said, however, that the campaign could wait until the primary next month before releasing the bulk of Mr. Pataki's plans.
"You are going to start hearing more about the size of government," he predicted. "You are going to hear more about privatization."
It is a truism that voters do not pay attention to politics until after Labor Day, and Mr. Pataki seems intent mostly on raising money and getting his name out right now. At the clambake, after about half an hour of shaking hands, people began to cry for him to take the microphone.
"I'm not going to speak long because nobody's going to listen," he said to an aide. "This is a party."

HEADLINE: Industrial Production Rises 0.2%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
Despite lower output of motor vehicles and electricity, American industry raised production for the 14th consecutive month in July, Federal Reserve statistics showed today.
Today's report and one due out Tuesday on July housing starts will be the final pieces of national economic data before the Federal Reserve's chief policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, meets to weigh the evidence for further increases in short-term interest rates. 
 Most analysts expect the Fed to increase the Federal funds rate, the overnight rate for loans between banks, by either a quarter-point or a half-point.
 
Little Effect Expected
 The report on industrial production, though a bit stronger than expected, was thought to have made little difference in the Fed's thinking.
"Slack in the economy is limited," said Paul W. Boltz, an economist with T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore investment firm.
Overall production rose two-tenths of 1 percent last month but output at the nation's factories climbed four-tenths of 1 percent, the most since April. Much of the rise was in machinery, industrial instruments, furniture and fixtures.
Declines in motor vehicles and parts have cut into factory gains for five consecutive months, said a report by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates of St. Louis, but "other sectors have taken up the slack."
Output at both mines and utilities fell markedly last month, with electric power and related coal production returning to more normal levels following exceptionally hot June weather, which swelled the use of air-conditioning. Coal is the biggest fuel source for electric plants.
Other restraining forces were a strike at what the Fed described as a leading maker of construction and mining equipment, apparently Caterpillar Inc., and continued weakness in the aircraft industry.
All in all, "production's moving along at a pretty good clip," said Darwin L. Beck, an economist at First Boston and once a Federal Reserve staff member, who said he expected the Fed to raise rates Tuesday for the fifth time this year.
He and others said the size of the increase would apparently depend on the Fed's assessment of the other side of the equation: whether goods would continue to attract buyers, especially consumers already feeling the effects of earlier rounds of rate increases.
Production of construction supplies, for example, has now fallen for two consecutive months because of a decrease in demand for housing. And automotive output fell 1.3 percent in July following even bigger declines in April and May and a negligible uptick in June.
 
Auto Production Drops
 Assembly of cars was at an annual rate of 6 million last month, down from 6.2 million in June, while truck production eased to 5.2 million from 5.3 million, according to the Fed's report.
The nation's industry operated at 83.9 percent of capacity last month, the same as in June. A one-tenth of a point rise in manufacturing -- to the same 83.1 percent level as prevailed in April and May -- was offset by slackened operating rates at mines and utilities.
Utilization in primary processing industries -- the Fed cited textiles, lumber, petroleum products and iron and steel -- remained well above their averages for 1967 to 1993. Industries using advanced processes were generally less stretched.
Categorized by market group, production of consumer goods rose four-tenths of 1 percent despite a 1.3 percent decline in automotive products, with appliances, television sets and other household durables particularly strong. Business equipment rose five-tenths of 1 percent while the decline in construction materials was a minimal one-tenth of 1 percent.
The index of industrial production now stands at 117.2, a level 17.2 percent higher than in 1987 and 5.6 percent higher than in July 1993, the report showed.

HEADLINE: Moonlighting Plus: 3-Job Families on the Rise

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
When Robin Thornburg lost her job as a $25,000-a-year paralegal, she was scared. Her husband, David, an office clerk, made barely enough to cover the groceries and the rent on their $700-a-month apartment in Arlington, Va. So, she is trying to make up the lost income by working two jobs -- as a full-time clerk for a loan company and a part-time bookkeeper for a company that rents out bodyguards.
"It kind of stinks, the two of us having so many jobs," said Mrs. Thornburg, who earns $600 a week, more than matching her former pay, but must work 55 hours to do it. "You argue about money and about hours, and on top of everything, we are both trying to get through college. We go different ways too much." 
 The Thornburgs are not alone. Just as women entered the labor force in huge numbers in the 70's and 80's, giving rise to the two-earner family, in the 90's one of these earners is taking on a second job, giving rise to the three-job marriage.
New Labor Department surveys of multiple jobholders, which this year, for the first time, are being compiled every month, give statistical underpinning to a trend that had been discernible largely through anecdote. Today, seven million Americans, or 6 percent of the work force, occupy 15 million jobs. Most multiple jobholders are married and, increasingly, nearly as many are women as men.
No other industrial nation approaches the United States in multiple jobholders, and the clear implication of such comparative analysis, says Richard Freeman, a Harvard labor economist, is that in other countries, wages from one job are sufficient.
"You would have thought that as women entered the work force, that would have been enough additional income, and dual jobholding would have declined," Mr. Freeman said. "Instead, the opposite has happened. Women going to work have not brought in enough income."
Before this year, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics had counted multiple jobholders only periodically, with the last survey in 1991 and the one before that, in 1989. Until the 1980's, those soundings showed, most dual jobholders were men with full-time employment who moonlighted part time. Now almost as many women are dual jobholders. They, too, usually combine full-time and part-time work, the new monthly surveys show, although women are more likely than men to hold two part-time jobs.
Some of the three-job couples go this route because one spouse wants to break into a new line of work that is more satisfying or better paying. But the biggest portion, more than 40 percent, take the extra work to pay bills, the Labor Department reports.
The Gittings family combines both these reasons. Philip Gittings, who is 45, resigned in late 1993 as minister of a Presbyterian church in Caldwell, N.J., where he had earned more than $90,000 a year. His wife, Margaret, also held one job, as a retail executive at $50,000 a year.
"The situation in my last ministerial post was not as much fun as I wanted it to be," Mr. Gittings said. But he soon found that he was not earning enough in his new, more satisfying job at Executive Career Resource Group in Berwyn, Pa., a company that helps corporations relocate laid-off workers. With salary and commissions, he is on track to earn $40,000 this year, and has already received $14,000. But with a son entering college, that is not enough, even with his wife's income.
So, while still holding down his job at Executive Career Resource, where he works on average more than 30 hours a week, Mr. Gittings set up a consulting firm this spring. He has made $8,000 so far this year as a self-employed personnel consultant.
 
Losing Ground
 In many cases, wage stagnation has played a big role in pushing married people into so much work, economists say. For three decades after World War II, incomes mostly rose, but in the early 1970's, the progress stopped. Since then 80 percent of the nation's households have failed to gain ground, after their incomes -- mostly in wages -- are adjusted for inflation.
For many people, their "raise" has come from taking second and third jobs. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said he had run into the phenomenon in numerous conversations during his travels as a member of the Cabinet. "It is symptomatic of the erosion of relatively well-paying employment," said Mr. Reich, who as a teacher and writer at Harvard had devoted a lot of his attention to wage and job issues.
The Thornburgs are fighting this erosion by holding down four jobs, according to the Labor Department's criteria. David Thornburg, a 250-pound ex-Army sergeant, is not only a $22,000-a-year office assistant at a law firm, but also a professional wrestler. "There is excellent money in professional wrestling and semi-fame, if I can catch on," said Mr. Thornburg, who is 25. So far, the big money has escaped him; his 13 matches this year have yielded $150 a match, and some marital stress.
"When he does wrestling, he is gone two or three days at a time," said Robin Thornburg, 24, who married David in 1988, while he was in the Army. "What he is trying to do is to become a promoter of wrestling and not just a wrestler, and I approve of that. Eventually, we have to get our lives down to two jobs if we are to have children."
Like Mr. Thornburg with his wrestling, Mr. Gittings also seeks a more satisfying career. "I did a lot of soul-searching and decided that my best skills were in consulting," not the ministry, Mr. Gittings said. As a consultant, he conducts personnel seminars at corporations and advises companies on matters like how to calm workers after big layoffs.
If one of his jobs gets his income back to his old level as a minister, will he give up the other? "Who knows what tomorrow will bring," he said. "I think my income at Economic Career Resource will grow, but I won't give up the other work. We are always in transition in life and the sooner we recognize that, the more mature we become."
 
Double-Duty Lawyer
 Like the Gittingses, Nathan M. Gundy 3d, who is 29, and his fiance, Dorva Dowdy, 28, sharing a home in Baltimore, are also embarked on a three-job relationship, seeking both money and, in his case, satisfaction. She is a $35,000-a-year computer specialist at a bank, and he is a corporate lawyer by day while at night musicians and performers make up his clientele.
After getting his law degree in 1988, he was a clerk for a judge and then worked for a year at a prestigious Washington law firm, earning $68,000, but finally leaving to open his own practice, negotiating contracts for entertainers and also booking them. "I had gotten some entertainment clients and I wanted to give this a go before I got too far down the line in my career," Mr. Gundy said.
He says his private practice now brings in $40,000 a year. But with marriage approaching, he decided that he needed more. So, Mr. Gundy has joined another Washington law firm, holding a temporary job at $500 a week that he hopes will become permanent. "I decided that I needed to put a couple of more boats in the water," he said, "for a little more security."
For most of the years since World War II, multiple jobholders constituted 5 percent or less of all working Americans, growing from three million people in the late 1950's to 5.7 million in 1985. But then in the late 1980's, as job creation and the economy grew briskly but incomes did not, multiple jobholding shifted upward, reaching 6 percent of the work force in 1989 and 1991.
 
Not All Are Counted
 That 6 percent level has not fallen back. It shows up today in the new monthly surveys. These findings, still tentative, might undercount dual jobholding, says John F. Stinson Jr., a bureau economist. Military personnel are not surveyed, for example, so an Army corporal moonlighting off base as a bartender or store clerk shows up as holding only one job.
And with the economy growing sufficiently to create four million additional jobs in the last 19 months, the opportunity exists to get the extra work. So does the motivation. While jobs have multiplied, wages have not risen; economic growth has been insufficient to make that happen. Among multiple jobholders who are counted, college professors, public school teachers and police officers are well represented. So are single mothers, divorced women and widows -- among them Barbara Holloway, divorced and in her 50's, who has taught elementary grades in Evanston, Ill., for 32 years.
During the last 10 of those years, Mrs. Holloway has also been a sales clerk at Lord & Taylor, working four nights a week and Sundays until her daughter, Kimberley, finished college in 1992. Since then, she has cut back to two nights and Sunday.
"I had hoped to be able to quit the second job when Kimberley was on her own, as she is now," said Mrs. Holloway, whose public school salary is $60,000. "But I can't; my income has not gone up enough to cover my own expenses."
 
The Biggest Category
 Unlike Ms. Holloway, the majority of the multiple jobholders, 56.5 percent, are married men and women, and many are trying to better their lot.
In Alexandria, Mrs. Thornburg says being laid off as the paralegal at a three-member law firm that had fallen on hard times was doubly frustrating. The paralegal job, if she had held it, would have counted toward a B.A. in legal studies at Marymount College, a degree she now hopes to get next year. Meanwhile, the income of her husband, who studies at a community college, is simply not enough.
"His take-home pay is $1,100 a month and the rent alone is $700," Mrs. Thornburg said. "Then there are credit cards, car payments, student loans, clothing."
Mrs. Thornburg signed up quickly with a temporary-help agency, which has sent her mostly to Athena Resources, a Washington firm that buys and sells bad loans. There, she has earned $10.50 an hour as a clerk, working eight-hour days. She also became a bookkeeper for the ICS Corporation, which provides bodyguards and other protection for executives. That job pays $12 an hour for 15 hours a week, done mostly at home.
Unlike Mr. Gittings, the former minister, Mrs. Thornburg talks of escaping dual jobholding. After she gets her Marymount degree, she will go for a master's in physical therapy. "Experienced paralegals can make $40,000," she said, "while a physical therapist starts at $70,000."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
A study shows that celebrity endorsements of products can help a company's stock price. A little.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
IS signing stars as shills for products worth the often considerable cost and the headaches they sometimes cause? A new study comes to the intriguing conclusion that celebrity endorsements offer tangible, measurable benefits, albeit small, in at least one realm.
The study examined 110 instances of companies signing stars to pitch their wares during a 12-year period, from Paula Abdul for Diet Coke, L.A. Gear and Reebok to Bruce Willis for Seagram's wine coolers. It concluded that celebrity endorsements could improve the performance of the stock of a company that was spending money to hire a star. 
 "We started wondering whether all those millions of dollars were worthwhile," said Wagner A. Kamakura, an associate professor at the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business at the University of Pittsburgh. He is the co-author of the study with Jagdish Agrawal, an assistant professor at the School of Business and Economics at California State University in Hayward, Calif. Both men teach marketing.
"Our main objective was to do a validity check on previous research in this area," Mr. Kamakura added, "which had focused on whether celebrity endorsements influence consumer attitudes.
"The consensus is that yes, they usually lead to some impact on the brand being endorsed, because of the transfer of imagery from celebrity to ad and from ad to brand. And there is anecdotal evidence they lead to increasing sales. But we wanted to do a more thorough study."
The interest of the pair was piqued by the recent surge of media interest in "spokes-stars" whose personal problems have embarrassed their sponsors, like O. J. Simpson (Hertz) and Michael Jackson (Pepsi-Cola International).
The lack of control that a marketer has over a celebrity -- even one it has signed to a lucrative long-term contract -- has emerged as a significant threat to the viability of celebrity endorsements. Indeed, Mr. Willis's affiliation with Seagram ended after reports that he had stopped drinking alcohol as a result of efforts to change his life style.
In some studies, consumers play down the influence of celebrities on their product choices, "because they state they don't believe celebrities are endorsing products for anything but the money," Mr. Kamakura said. "But consumers don't necessarily do what they say."
So to tackle the issue from another direction, Mr. Kamakura and Mr. Agrawal decided to examine the impact, if any, on the prices of shares in companies that announced the signings of celebrity endorsers, corrected for any general market trends.
Their idea was that "the investor reaction to what management has done is a more objective assessment," Mr. Kamakura said, because it might indicate "that investors are persuaded that a company is hiring a celebrity because it is confident about its product" or has a long-term strategy to invest in building brand equity -- and therefore its shares should be worth more.
A search of announcements of celebrity contracts yielded 207 examples from January 1980 through December 1992; 110 remained after excluding companies that were privately held or based overseas and made no stock data available.
Among the companies studied, in addition to those endorsed by Ms. Abdul and Mr. Willis, were the American Express Company (Paul Newman), Bristol-Myers Squibb (Joe Montana), the Gillette Company (Marvin Hagler), Nike Inc. (Jim Courier, Deion Sanders) and the Sara Lee Corporation (Michael Jordan, Phylicia Rashad).
In about 58 percent of the 110 instances, "there were positive increases in the prices of the stocks," Mr. Kamakura said, with the rest either negative or no effect. The average increase in the stock price was 0.44 percent.
"It's not much," he acknowledged, "but when you think about the large number of shares in a particular firm, it might represent a substantial sum."
The study concludes that the average increases in share prices "reflect the market's general belief that the expected incremental gain from celebrity endorsements exceeds the incremental costs of advertising due to such contracts."
Mr. Kamakura said he and Mr. Agrawal hoped their next study would focus on the effects on advertisers when celebrities who endorsed them "do something wrong." For instance, after Mr. Simpson's arrest, Hertz was the subject of widespread attention and considerable criticism, even though Mr. Simpson had not appeared in advertising for the car rental company since 1992.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Sherwin-Williams smoothly improves its performance.

BYLINE: By Leslie Wayne 

 BODY:
WATCHING paint dry, of course, is the classic line about the ultimate in boredom. But at the Sherwin-Williams Company, the nation's largest paint producer, drying paint is a precious sight -- and many on Wall Street agree. They are recommending the stock as one expected to outpace both a sluggish market and a sluggish building supply sector.
Just as the company advertises that its paints are impervious, the stock seems to be as well. The company has had 17 steady years of rising earnings, a balance sheet that is almost debt-fee, and a share price that has increased by 14 percent a year for the last decade -- with no signs of slowing. This translates into low risk but solid returns. 
 "It's an undervalued company," said Jeffrey Zekauskas, an analyst with First Manhattan Securities. "The demand for paint is surprisingly strong in both high and low interest rates environments. The stock is like the company -- very solid, very value-minded and very pro-shareholder."
The Cleveland company, founded in 1866, not only produces a broad array of paint brands, but it also has 2,000 company-owned retail stores to sell them. With a 35 percent share of the paint market, it is one of the few national brands in an industry of many small, privately held regional brands.
In addition to its Sherwin-Williams brand -- the one with the famous "Covers the Earth" symbol of paint pouring over a globe -- the company also makes a number of other well-known paints: Dutch Boy, Kem-Tone, and Martin Senour. These are sold through such superstores as Home Depot and Hechingers. The company also makes private label paints for Kmart and Sears, Roebuck.
"Paint is a growth market without much cyclicality," said Robert Curren, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, who rates the stock "above average." "It's driven by the total number of structures being fixed up," he said. "Every increase in the number of homes, and in home sales, is a house where the paint is often replaced." Sherwin-Williams's fate isn't tied to housing starts. Paint is a cheap fix-up in good times and bad.
When current management took over 17 years ago, Sherwin-Williams was almost bankrupt, couldn't pay its dividend and its shareholders were revolting. But under its chief executive, John G. Breen, who was hired in 1978, a turnaround began that hasn't stopped. In recent years, the company's stores have been remodeled, improving per-store profits. Costs have been cut so that the company is now the industry's low-cost producer. And market share has increased through a cap on price rises. Moreover, as the Federal Government increases environmental restrictions on paint makers, many small, inefficient paint makers have been unable to compete, leading to industry consolidation.
"Between store remodelings and cost controls, margins have improved," said Sean D. Love, an analyst at CS First Boston, who rates the stock a buy. Recently, the stock has traded between $32 and $34 a share and closed yesterday at $32.75, up 12.5 cents. Analysts say that caveats are few: Rising titanium dioxide prices, a main paint component, caused the stock to dip to $30 in May. Environmental problems at a Chicago plant remain outstanding. And, the current stock price leaves room for only modest gains.
Last year, the company earned $1.85 a share, and most analysts expect it to earn $2.10 in 1994 and $2.35 in 1995. This translates into a share price of $37 to $49 within the next two years.
Norman F. Klopp, an analyst at the Roulston Research Corporation in Cleveland, has watched the company for more than 20 years and says investors should "buy carefully" and be "precise with their entry and exit level." He is a buyer at $30 a share, but a holder at $32.
And Lawrence J. Horan, an analyst at Prudential Securities, sees the stock at $37 in 12 months. "That's not a lot of upside," he said. "But in a flat market, to have more than 10 percent gain in a low-risk stock looks pretty attractive to me."

HEADLINE: Pataki's Grim Statistics Collide With the Facts

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

 BODY:
Senator George E. Pataki's campaign against Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is based on the premise that, as he often puts it, Mr. Cuomo "has made us No. 1 in all the wrong categories." In virtually every public appearance, and in a television commercial, Mr. Pataki says: "We are No. 1 in tax burden in America. We are No. 1 in spending in the country. And the inevitable result: we are No. 1 in job losses in America."
But government statistics show that none of those claims is true, although Mr. Cuomo may not take much solace from the facts. 
 Mr. Pataki's claim about taxes reflects a recurring debate in state politics about whether it is fairest to judge Mr. Cuomo's record by examining only state taxes or state and local taxes combined. The Governor argues that he cannot be blamed for local tax increases he did not impose. His opponents maintain that the state has shifted costs to local governments and forced them to raise property taxes to preserve services.
In either case, New York is not first. Census Bureau statistics show that in 1992, the last year for which figures are available, New York's state tax burden, measured as a percentage of personal income, ranked 22d. New York's combined state and local tax burden in 1991, the last year available, ranked second to Alaska, which has very low taxes on individuals but high business taxes .
Even that measurement has stayed almost constant during Mr. Cuomo's tenure. Some taxes, like those levied on businesses, cigarettes and petroleum, have been raised by Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature; others, like personal income taxes, have been cut significantly.
Concerning spending, New York ranks 11th in state spending as a percentage of personal income, and third when spending by the state and its local governments is combined, according to the Census Bureau.
The only way Mr. Pataki can argue that New York ranks first in job losses is by examining the period that Federal economists describe as the length of the national recession, from July 1990 to March 1991. During that period, New York lost more jobs, 272,000, than any other state, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. A fairer measurement that takes into account the state's size, however, looks at job losses as a percentage of a state's job base. New York ranked seventh in that category during the nine-month period.
Because New York did not begin to gain jobs consistently until last fall, a more complete measurement examines changes in the state's job picture from July 1990 to the present. During that period, New York ranked second to California in net job losses and second to Connecticut in the percentage of jobs lost.
Mr. Pataki also argues that job growth in New York trailed the national average in each of Mr. Cuomo's 12 years as Governor. Federal statistics show that this, too, is wrong, although not significantly. New York's job growth was higher than the national average by 13 one-hundredths of a percentage point in 1983, Mr. Cuomo's first year, and by one one-hundredth of a percentage point in 1986, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics figures.
Last, Mr. Pataki's oft-repeated claim that New York lost 300,000 jobs since the national recovery began while the rest of the nation has gained three million jobs is also untrue. The truth, however, may be even more damaging to Mr. Cuomo.
Employment figures adjusted for seasonal variations show that New York lost 150,200 jobs during that period, while the rest of the country gained almost 5.1 million jobs.

HEADLINE: Dow Drops 8.42 Amid Uncertainty on Fed

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The stock market closed mixed yesterday amid unusually high levels of uncertainty as to what the Federal Reserve Board's interest-rate setting committee will do today.
A fifth increase in interest rates by the Fed's Open Market Committee would be sure to slow the economy further, perhaps bolstering bonds and strengthening the weak dollar. But it would also weaken corporate profits and thus hurt stocks, at least for the short run. 
 In the last few weeks, traders have interpreted each new piece of economic data as both encouraging and discouraging the Fed from raising rates.
But unless the Fed does something that the market does not expect, such as raising interest rates more than a half-percentage point or not raising them for a prolonged period, the likelihood is that the financial markets will continue to oscillate in wide trading ranges, some analysts say.
For stocks, that trading range may be 3,600 to 3,800 points for the Dow Jones industrial average. For bonds, it may be a yield of 7.62 percent to 7.25 percent on the 30-year Treasury bond.
Yesterday, while rising nearly 18 points shortly before 2 P.M., the Dow glided downward and looked as if it would close unchanged, but dropped abruptly minutes before the 4 P.M. close. The Standard & Poor's 500 followed a similar pattern.
But the Nasdaq composite index, while largely following the other two major indexes, abruptly shot up before the close, buoyed by technology stocks like Lotus Development.
The Dow fell 8.42 points, to 3,760.29, while the broader S.& P. 500 fell 0.72 point, to 461.23. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index rose 1.28 points, to 732.89.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.25 point, to 254.52, with advancing stocks edging past declining stocks, 1,064 to 1,040. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 0.38 point, to 443.32.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 223.6 million shares, below this year's daily average of 280 million shares, but also below the exchange's even more restrained trading average of 260 million shares since June 1.
Blue chips like International Paper and Aluminum Company of America, oil companies like Mobil and retailers like Wal-Mart Stores fell in price.
 
Technology Stocks Advance
 A group of technology stocks, including those of Intel, Cisco Systems, Oracle Systems and Tele-Communications, helped lift the Nasdaq composite index. But it was Lotus, which rose 2 1/2, to 44 1/2, that gave the index its biggest boost.
A Dean Witter Reynolds analyst said an updated version of Lotus's Notes communication software made Lotus more attractive and he repeated his "buy" recommendation. Notes software is designed to let computer users send video images of each other over telephone lines as well as send document images back and forth.
Of the 30 component stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 17 fell, led by International Paper, which dropped 1 1/4, to 72, on no immediate news. Of the 500 component stocks that make up the S.& P. 500, 250 fell, led by Wal-Mart, which fell 1/4, to 23 3/4, on no immediate news.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Little Changed As Move by Fed Is Awaited

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar was little changed against other leading currencies yesterday as traders waited to see whether the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates today.
Few traders wanted to make big bets on the direction of the dollar. Though most believe the Fed will push up short-term rates, they are not sure by how much. 
 Trading was also slowed by the Assumption Day holiday, which closed some European markets.
"The market doesn't really want to rally as people wait out tomorrow's rate rise," said Simon Fisher, associate director for foreign exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation.
In New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5522 German marks, up from 1.5512 on Friday. At 100.15 yen, it was little changed from the late-Friday quote.
 
Committee to Meet
 The Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee is to meet today, and traders believe the central bank will increase the Federal funds rate by at least a quarter of a point and perhaps by as much as a half. After four increases, starting in February, the rate is now 4.25 percent.
A quarter-point rise would probably have little effect on the dollar, because so many traders expect it. "It feels like it's almost a done deal," said Lynn Tierney, a vice president at Shawmut Bank of Boston N.A.
Ian Spence, managing director at Chemical Bank, said the currency market would be "disappointed in the Fed" if it raised rates only a quarter- point. But a half-point move "would be O.K. for the dollar," he said.
If the Fed raises rates by a half-point the dollar may rise against the German mark by as much as 1.5 pfennigs, Mr. Fisher said.
Higher interest rates make investments denominated in dollars more attractive, often increasing demand for the currency and pushing up its value.
Anticipation of a Fed move muted reaction to economic news yesteray. The Fed reported that capacity utilization at American factories was 83.9 percent in July, better than the 83.8 percent analysts had expected. That, coupled with news that industrial output grew for the 14th straight month, if only by two-tenths of 1 percent, suggested that the economy was growing fast enough to warrant higher interest rates.
The dollar was mixed against most other major currencies, finishing little changed at 5.3265 French francs, 1.3030 Swiss francs and 1,594.50 Italian lire. The British pound was lower at $1.5419, compared with $1.5480 late Friday. The Canadian dollar rose to 72.43 United States cents, from 72.36 on Friday.

HEADLINE: Europe Uniting in Building Arms

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 13

 BODY:
Italy, France and Britain, each needing a new destroyer for its navy, set aside tradition for common sense last month and agreed to build the warships together. They awarded contracts that could run as high as $12 billion to a consortium of shipbuilding, electronics and armaments companies from the three nations.
"It will allow all three countries to benefit from better economies of scale as well as from pooling the technologies of three highly industrialized countries," Italy's Defense Minister, Cesare Previti, explained. 
 The Eurofrigate program, as it is known, is just one indication of how European governments and weapons makers are abandoning their go-it-alone approach to arms programs and moving toward greater collaboration. They are being driven partly by the European Union's attempts at greater coordination in foreign and military policy, and are being encouraged by the experience of Airbus, the multinational commercial jetliner project that has made Europe competitive with the United States in civil aviation.
As they do so, they are giving new impetus to a consolidation of the European arms industry, which despite shedding workers, closing some plants and completing a few mergers, has badly lagged behind its counterpart in the United States in adapting to the harsher business climate of the post-cold war world.
Given the immense costs involved, analysts said, European governments can no longer afford to be developing three new fighter planes as the United States concentrates its efforts on one new fighter, the F-22. No longer does it make sense to build three different tanks, or to keep British or Spanish suppliers, for example, from competing for French contracts.
At stake is not just saving money for taxpayers, but the ability of the European industry to remain a strong competitor to the United States in the shrinking but still vibrant global market for military aircraft, missiles, electronic systems and the other hardware of war.
Without the benefits of size, efficiency and pooled technical expertise, Europe may find it difficult to sell arms outside its own borders, a development that would ultimately lead to further shrinkage in the industry and perhaps the failure of some companies, analysts said.
"If they're going to survive, they have to move rapidly," said Paul Cornish, a military industry analyst at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London. "European industry has realized that if it does not get itself together and pull its socks up, it will lose out to the U.S."
In the United States, military contractors have consolidated with breathtaking speed. Some companies, like the General Dynamics Corporation, are selling themselves chunk by chunk, while others, like the Grumman Corporation, have been sold entirely. And those, like the Lockheed Corporation, that have survived the shakeout have emerged bigger and stronger and more eager than ever to compete for business outside the United States.
 
Tradition of Independence
 For reasons of security, history, pride and jobs, European governments have tended to support national military contracting industries that are as self-contained as possible, even when it might have been cheaper to buy abroad. In many cases, particularly in France, the biggest contractors remain state-owned.
"As far as industry consolidation, it has been much harder for individual companies in Europe than in the U.S.," said Keith Hodgkinson, an analyst at Lehman Brothers in London. "It's hard to merge a government-owned company with a privately owned company. And there are very few governments willing to see elements of their defense industry move into the hands of other nations, even given the trend to a single market."
But with weapons systems becoming more sophisticated and expensive, with budget pressures growing and with international competition for arms sales increasing, neither European arms makers nor their governments can afford to hold themselves apart.
In addition to the Eurofrigate program, two of the biggest collaborative programs are the $50 billion European fighter aircraft project involving Germany, Britain, Italy and Spain, and a proposed military transport plane that would be built in France, Germany, Spain and Britain. France and Germany are to build an armored personnel carrier together, and those two nations plus the Netherlands and Italy are collaborating on developing a military helicopter.
Led by companies like British Aerospace and General Electric of Britain, Aerospatiale and Thomson-CSF of France and Deutsche Aerospace of Germany, the European industry is seeking to cut costs, combine technological strengths and eliminate excess capacity through joint ventures and partnerships, if not outright mergers.
In some cases there has been considerable consolidation within national borders, with the French having pooled much of their shipbuilding business and General Electric of Britain having snapped up a number of other British military electronics companies.
In international efforts, Deutsche Aerospace and Aerospatiale are negotiating joint ventures in missile and satellite development. Matra of France and British Aerospace are negotiating a merger of their missile businesses. The Eurofrigate program has brought together DCN International of France, Finmeccanica/Fincantieri of Italy and a group led by the Marconi Naval Systems division of General Electric of Britain.
For their part, governments are working more closely together and removing many barriers to cross-border deals. France and Germany recently established a joint agency to develop a military transport plane and a satellite observation system, and hope to persuade other Western European countries to join.
Italy and France are moving to privatize state-owned weapons builders. Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland are discussing a cooperation pact on military procurement.
 
Common Policy Is Urged
 "There's a developing realization that Europe must get its act together, but it cannot really happen until governments decide on common requirements, common procurement rules and all the circumstances that surround the acquisition of defense materiel," said Mike Evans, the deputy director general of the Defense Manufacturers Association in Britain. "There's a realization that this should happen, even a willingness for it to happen, but the logistics will take some time to develop."
The quandary for Europe is apparent even in some nations' own military purchasing decisions. Britain, for example, plans to decide by the end of the year on a new military transport plane. The choice is between a plane built by Lockheed of the United States and the proposed European transport plane.
The Lockheed plane, the C-130J, is an updated version of an aircraft that has been in production for years and that Lockheed, with its size, financial power and worldwide market, can afford to offer at a discounted price of less than $40 million each.
 
Alternative to Lockheed Jet
 The European plane is supported by British Aerospace, which would build part of it in Britain and which has promised that it would be more advanced than the C-130J. The European plane would be built in collaboration with British Aerospace's partners in Airbus, Deutsche Aerospace and Aerospatiale.
But, lacking Lockheed's long experience in producing military transports and the American company's much larger order book, the European consortium will have to charge more -- an estimated $60 million a plane -- and could well encounter cost overruns and schedule delays.
Britain's Ministry of Defense said it would make a decision by the end of the year.
Even when they win contracts, pan-European contractor groups face difficulties. A previous attempt to develop a common warship for Europe fell apart in 1990 when the nations involved could not agree on their requirements.
And the biggest cooperative program of all in Europe, the European fighter aircraft being built by British Aerospace, Deutsche Aerospace, Alenia of Italy and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain, has been dogged by disagreements among the Governments over the size and speed of the project.
The Eurofighter flew for the first time this spring, more than two years behind schedule. The German National Audit Office estimated recently that the per-plane cost had swollen to $95 million from the original budget of $65 million, and opposition parties in Germany are calling for the project to be canceled. If it is, some European nations might choose to buy their next generation of fighters from the United States.
To succeed, analysts said, Europe and its arms industry will have to put aside old rivalries and domestic political considerations, particularly about jobs. They will also need to improve coordination of military strategies because they will be unable to develop a common weapons-procurement policy unless they are all interested in the same types of programs.
"Cooperation is never an easy thing," the French Defense Minister, Francois Leotard, said at the signing of the Eurofrigate agreement last month. "Of course you are disappointed here and there."

U.S. Report on Brazil's Frost Lifts Coffee Prices Sharply

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Coffee prices rose sharply yesterday after an Agriculture Department report showing sizable frost damage to Brazil's key crop. The Government estimated that 30 to 40 percent of Brazil's 1995-96 crop, worse than analysts had expected, had been lost.
Coffee for December delivery soared 13.60 cents, to 198.45 cents a pound, on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York, the first substantial turnaround since prices peaked in mid-July at 245 cents. 
 "Today's price gains reflect the fact that the U.S.D.A., whose views are regarded as authoritative, thinks the frost damage to the Brazilian crop really is bad," a trader said. "But their assessment is not the last word on the subject. It will be impossible to know accurately what is happening until after the trees start flowering next month."
 
30 Percent Drop Predicted
 In a report issued after the market closed on Friday, the Agriculture Department predicted that next year's Brazilian crop would total 17 million to 20 million 132-pound bags, a drop of about 30 percent from the 26 million predicted for this season's crop.
Brazil, which produces nearly a quarter of the world's supply, recently forecast a crop next year of only 15 million bags, down from a pre-frost estimate of 26 million. It also said this year's harvest would reach at most 22 million bags.
On Friday, Brazil's Government contested the Agriculture Department's figure, saying the frost damage was more extensive than the department believed.
On other commodity markets, cotton prices again dropped the daily limit, while energy prices ended mixed. The Commodity Research Bureau's index slipped 0.26, to 229.44.
The cotton market is still reeling from the Agriculture Department's projection last week for a surprisingly large American cotton crop. December cotton lost 2 cents, to 66.55 cents a pound, on the New York Cotton Exchange, after falling the 2-cent limit on Friday.
Oil prices ended mixed in what most traders believed was a consolidation after the market's steep drop last week. September crude oil firmed 15 cents, to $18.20 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. September gasoline declined 0.39 cent, to 54.83 cents a gallon, while September heating oil rose 0.53 cent, to 49.10 cents.
Oil prices firmed in late trading following a report that Nigeria's striking oil workers' union would not attend talks tomorrow with the military Government unless political and economic demands were discussed.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
In Strike, Two Sides And Two Sets Of Numbers

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief labor executive, has used the figure so often during the owners' labor dispute with the players that $1.2 million has become indelibly imprinted on the minds of fans, who would rather hear baseball people talk about 61 and .400.
In his comments about the clubs' quest for cost control, Ravitch has used the average salary of $1.2 million to show how well off the players are and how well off they would continue to be under the limit the owners want to place on salary payrolls. 
 But $1.2 million is just what Ravitch says it is -- the average. Closer examination of salaries for the 1994 season casts a different light on what players earn.
*The median salary is $500,000. Of the 746 players on opening-day rosters or on the disabled list, 363 earn less than $500,000, 361 earn more than $500,000 and 22 make precisely that amount.
*The average salary itself is somewhat misleading because 237 players earn more than $1.2 million and 507 earn less (two are right at that figure).
*Just as they disagree on the economic system baseball should have, the two sides view these figures differently. Ravitch said they strengthen the clubs' position that fewer players are making more of the money. Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said the rising median salary shows precisely the opposite.
They made their comments on the fourth day of the strike, when not much else was happening. For the third successive day, the two sides did not meet and did not speak to each other by telephone. They scheduled no meetings.
"I don't know what's in the immediate future," Ravitch said in response to a question, "but in these matters, things can change within the hour. I'm waiting to hear from the Federal mediators about when they want to meet again."
 
Now Canceled: 46 Games
 There were two strike-related developments yesterday.
The league offices announced that games will be canceled on a day-to-day basis "but should not be considered canceled until the day" the games were originally scheduled to be played. Four games were added to the canceled list yesterday, bringing to 46 the number missed. Fourteen games are on today's schedule.
In the other development, the number of players on strike fell from 763 to 762 when the Chicago Cubs belatedly optioned Steve Trachsel, a rookie starting pitcher, to Iowa of the American Association. With a $112,000 salary, $3,000 above the minimum, Trachsel, who compiled a 9-7 record in 22 starts for the Cubs before the strike, is one of the players below the median. On the other hand, Bobby Bonilla of the Mets and Cal Ripken of Baltimore were scheduled to earn more combined than all of the 22 players earning the median salary.
This season's median is up significantly from the median of $397,500 at the end of last season, but both the median and the average drop from opening day to the end because teams generally wind up with more minimum-salaried players on their rosters as the season progresses and they fill in for players on the disabled list.
Asked about the difference between the average and the median this season, Ravitch said: "I think to contrast the two points out very dramatically what is happening in baseball. With each year, fewer and fewer players get a larger percentage of the take. Each tells a story and together they tell a fuller story."
But Orza used the increase in the median salary to dispute Ravitch.
"He has always said the fact that the median is going down is an illustration of the fact that fewer players are making more money," Orza said. "If it's going up, it's counter to the proposition he's trying to espouse. If it's going up, it means we've ceased to see fewer and fewer players getting more and more money. But I don't know if you can compare the medians until we have the final figures in."
Orza added that the players don't care what the median and the average salaries are so long as a free market establishes them.
"Rather than have Ravitch or Orza or Soupy Sales determine the dispersion of salaries, let the market determine it," he said. "The players are willing to live with it. They always have been."
The owners want to change the current free-market system and implement a salary cap. They have proposed giving the players 50 percent of their revenue for all player costs, a formula that would lead to a maximum payroll amount for each team. The players contend that a cap would artificially lower salaries, impede their mobility as free agents and undermine competitive balance because clubs wouldn't have room under the cap to sign free agents to improve themselves.
Ravitch has said a system featuring a cap would result in better pay for younger players, but early returns from the National Football League's initial experience with a salary cap indicate that some players don't view it that way.
"The salary cap makes the rich get richer, the poor get poorer and takes out the middle class completely," Bryan Cox of the Miami Dolphins was quoted as saying recently. Other players have made similar comments, although the head of their union, Gene Upshaw, stoutly defends the system he negotiated.
Baseball's salary experience in recent years supports the likelihood that the development Cox described would happen in baseball, too.
Clubs take care of their star and other best players first, paying them lucrative salaries. By the time they get to the bottom half of the roster, they would not have enough money left to pay veterans worthwhile salaries to be a platooned player or sit on the bench.
Instead of paying Tim Hulett $550,000 to be a reserve infielder, a team more likely would give his spot to a rookie making the minimum.
 
Lots of Money at the Top
 Richard Moss, a longtime agent, said yesterday that the various salary levels have little meaning.
"The median salary for professional baseball players in the United States is probably about $7,000," he said, including minor league players in his estimate. "What's the significance of it? The point is the people at the top make a lot of money. That's what happens in the entertainment business. Everybody doesn't run around the streets yelling that Bill Cosby makes $80 million a year. The average salary of television stars is something less than that. The median salary of television actors is probably about $12,000."
Most people focus on salaries of major league players, but people like Moss, who represent players, point out that they are the best 700 or so people at what they do. Many others labor in the minor leagues for little pay.
In his first professional contract, a minor league player earns $850 a month for five months, or a total of $4,250. The top draft choices receive hefty bonuses, but they can't earn more than $850 a month in salary.
One player who began his minor league career this season at that salary was Michael Jordan. But because Jordan was playing in a Class AA classification, after 30 days, his salary rose to $1,000 a month.

Italian Invasion
For some 500 years, Italians have been discovering and rediscovering America. The latest landing is by three fashion companies eager to expand their global successes to these shores. Marzotto, Maska and Max Mara have had limited distribution in the United States but are now gearing up for major expansion. 
 There are two main reasons for the timing, said Sergio Garretti, the president of the Marzotto (U.S.A.) Corporation.
"The devaluation of the lire gave us an economic reason," he said. "The crisis of traditional European markets caused a major push to find new places for our product. And we are aware of the need to adapt our product to American needs."
Marzotto, a 158-year-old company with annual sales of $1.2 billion, distributes seven men's and three women's wear lines in the United States. The women's lines are Missoni Donna, Studio 000.1 by Gianfranco Ferre and its own Accento. The current emphasis is on adapting the styling and merchandising of Accento and the fit and the delivery schedule of Studio 000.1 so that both lines can be sold in a wider range of stores here.
Maska has been in business since 1967 with a succession of uncredited designers, including Mr. Ferre, Jean-Paul Gaultier and Franco Moschino. The collection has been available in the United States sporadically since 1989, but Adriano Luca Davoli, the vice president and general manager of Maska's United States division, intends to change that. The spring collection is now being shown to store buyers in a new showroom at 650 Fifth Avenue by Travis Winberg, who brought Genny and Byblos to this country a decade ago.
Max Mara, with annual sales of $1 billion, is introducing a new advertising campaign in fashion magazines in September, the same month it is to open its first New York boutique at 813 Madison Avenue (68th Street). There are plans for 15 more boutiques across the country.
Aside from their country of origin, the three companies have other common denominators. Styling is more traditional than high fashion and prices seldom top $1,000 for an outfit.
 
On-Line Fashion
The fashion world is entering the computer age with several on-line services targeted to the industry.
The Fashion Access Network is the Fashion Group International's entry, geared to provide information on jobs, services, events and trends to individuals and to businesses that sign up for membership in the network, as well as to the 6,000 professional women who belong to the group.
"We'd like people in fashion, beauty, home design, retail, manufacturing, real estate, you name it," said Margaret Hayes, the executive director of the Fashion Group.
Renee Palmer, the network's project director, said the service would be updated daily or weekly as required. "It will be menu-driven like a cash machine so it's user friendly," she said.
IPEX Inc. has developed two on-line image databases in cooperation with GE Information Services. One, Ultimate Source, where modeling and advertising agencies can find photographs of aspiring models, will be available in mid-September. The other, Pro Source, where agencies can view portfolios of the work of photographers, illustrators, stylists, models and prop and location providers, will be on line in November.
Fashion On-Line, the brainchild of Ernest Schmatolla, a fashion photographer, is currently available only for PC users with the Windows operating system. Its features include fashion reports, color photographs of runway shows and lists of fashion services.
 
New Bendels Boutique
Henri Bendel has acquired a Latin American accent. Angel Sanchez, 30, a Venezuelan couturier who has been been making periodic visits to the store in the last year to take orders for his glamorous evening dresses, is to get his own boutique on Sept. 19. He will spend two days in the Fifth Avenue store every six weeks for appointments and fittings.
His design trademark, hand-embroidered latticework, often adorned with beads or pearls, gives a distinctive look to his chiffon, silk crepe and velvet dresses with built-in corsets and bras. "I believe in inner construction even if the outside is soft," he said. Prices for the made-to-order dresses are $1,900 to $4,000.

Elusive Truth and a Touchy Subject

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
"Sex, Lies and Harassment" purports to be an investigation into how the famous 1991 Clarence A. Thomas-Anita F. Hill affair changed attitudes and raised perplexities about sexual harassment. But this edition of "American Justice" turns out to be mainly a recapitulation of the front-page charges and denials, not excluding the references to pubic hair on a Coke can, for their own entertaining sake.
If you are willing to settle for that, it's a lively hour. Credit for the peppiness goes to the allies and antagonists of Ms. Hill, who devour the camera. The most voracious is Camille Paglia, scourge of her sister feminists, who calls the treatment of Justice Thomas "obscene," "totalitarian," "a massive injustice." She is seconded by David Brock, author of "The Real Anita Hill," a bible of the pro-Thomas cadre. Catharine MacKinnon, the law professor known for her philosophy that sex is war by other means, and Ellen Bravo of the Association of Working Women maintain that Ms. Hill is a heroine for her time. 
 "Who was telling the truth?" asks the series host, Bill Kurtis. No, he doesn't know. One's answer is likely to depend on where one places the benefit of the doubt. The Thomasites declare that if Ms. Hill was offended by Mr. Thomas, she could have just "got up and walked away from the table." The Hillians reply that a working woman's life is not a liberating one; she can't lightly reject the boss. The Thomasites point out that their man's record regarding harassment was spotless. The Hillians respond that there's always a first time. The Thomasites find inconsistences in Ms. Hill's testimony. The Hillians interpret inconsistency, at least in this instance, as evidence of candor.
You may come away with the feeling that both sides were moved more by ideological preference than by the disputed facts of the case. But, after all, that also seemed to be true of the Senate, which divided pretty much along partisan lines in confirming Mr. Thomas. Whether the question of a person's fitness to sit on the high court should have rested on such an issue remains at least as troubling as what actually passed between accuser and accused.
Tomorrow night's program goes on to note the tendency of the courts in recent years to expand the meaning of sexual harassment. For example, a unanimous Supreme Court (including Justice Thomas) has ruled that psychological injury is not needed for a plaintiff to win damages.
The line, as Mr. Kurtis situates it, "between offensive conduct and romantic misunderstanding" remains ill charted, but business executives are on notice that they had better err on the side of inhibition. The subject, like sex itself, invites both earnest embrace and mere fooling around, but "Sex, Lies and Harassment" settles essentially for old newsreels, an economical way to fill up an hour.
That was true, too, of "Attack at Waco," an episode of "American Justice" shown early this month, which put the clips together effectively but added little new to the much-covered story of the assault on the Branch Davidian compound in Texas. This series is well done as far it goes, but how about going a little further?

HEADLINE: Invading Weed Makes a Bid To Become the New Kudzu

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS 

 BODY:
KUDZU, the Asian vine so fast-growing and invasive that people call it the plant that ate the South, has some saving graces: It controls erosion, for instance, and it provides forage for livestock. Now comes what might be called Son of Kudzu, a nasty and equally aggressive invader from abroad with no apparent redeeming economic or social value.
Known variously as mile-a-minute weed, minute weed and tearthumb (for the backward-bending barbs on its stem), it grows at the rate of perhaps half a foot a day, forms tangled mats 20 to 25 feet high, overwhelms and kills other vegetation in its path and has been spreading rapidly from Pennsylvania into the upper South in the last decade. In some of the parks of Washington, D.C., it has moved into areas where kudzu had been eradicated. 
 Ecologists fear it could eventually spread its noxious carpet all the way to Florida, where the wet, warm climate could turn the weed, an annual known to botanists as Polygonum perfoliatum, into a perennial, making it a major new agent of ecological disaster in a state where exotic species already are creating especially widespread ecological havoc.
The weed poses "a serious threat" to natural ecosystems, cultivated plants and ecological restoration sites, said Dr. J. Douglas Oliver, an ecologist with the Florida Department of Environmental Recreation, who delivered a report on the plant last week at a meeting of the Ecological Society of America in Knoxville, Tenn.
At least 4,500 species of plants and animals from other parts of the world have established free-living populations in the United States, reported a 1993 study by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment. And while some, like soybeans and wheat, are clearly beneficial, the study found that just 79 nonindigenous species caused a total of $97 billionin damage from 1906 to 1991. Kudzu alone accounts for about $50 million annually in lost farm and timber production.
Some confusion could arise between kudzu and the new invader, since kudzu has also sometimes been called mile-a-minute weed. Both plants originated in Asia and both are vines. But there the similarity ends. Kudzu, Pueraria lobata in scientific parlance, is a perennial with large, compound leaves made up of three leaflets. It has deep purple flowers. By sending out runners, it can grow 70 feet in a single summer, or more than a foot a day.
 
Accidental Tourist
 Mile-a-minute weed, on the other hand, is an annual with perfectly triangular leaves, fine and pale green, and iridescent blue fruit. Its elongated stems form dense clusters and it spreads not through runners but by seed dispersal. Birds and rodents eat the fleshy, pendulous fruits in the fall and broadcast the seeds.
And while kudzu was imported and initially planted on purpose in the United States, mile-a-minute weed arrived here by accident. Dr. Oliver's research found that it first appeared in Oregon in a ship's ballast about 1890, but has apparently not been seen in western North America since 1954, where it disappeared for reasons unknown. In the East, Dr. Oliver says, seeds of the plant probably arrived in the rootballs of rhododendrons imported as nursery stock to York County, Pa., from eastern Asia.
As with most weeds, the plant quickly colonizes disturbed ground, like roadsides, edges of woods, nurseries, fallow fields, cleared woodlands and ditches. But it also colonizes undisturbed ecosystems, showing a particular fondness for low, wet ground, stream banks and areas with abundant plant litter like leaves. It prefers sunlight and moist conditions but tolerates shade and dryness, as well.
It outcompetes many native plants, and its dense, tangled thickets and mats climb over shrubbery and small trees, its shade killing grasses and wildflowers. Already, it is becoming an annoyance in parks and gardens, according to Dr. Oliver.
Although mile-a-minute weed appeared in Pennsylvania as early as the 1930's, it apparently did not begin spreading into other states until the last two decades. By 1979, Dr. Oliver reported, it had become established in Maryland; by 1981 in West Virginia; by 1983 in Virginia; by 1986 in the District of Columbia, and by 1992 in southern Delaware.
"In these areas," Dr. Oliver wrote in a recent unpublished paper, "the plant has increased dramatically in a short period of time." For example, he reported, many roadside embankments in Baltimore County are "solid" with the species, possibly because of dispersal by roadside mowers.
 
Threat to Wildlife and Industry
 In any case, he wrote, "this exotic plant has become established and is starting to replace extant vegetation." And although data on the rate of its geographic spread are lacking, he wrote, "the plant is known to be progressing southward quickly, and could soon invade other states."
It might have a particular affinity for his own state, Florida, Dr. Oliver suggested, since in its native Asian range is subtropical to tropical and since it seems to prefer warm habitats.
The weed has no known economic value, Dr. Oliver reported, but it could cause economic damage: It takes over the ground in clear-cut forests, smothering the seedlings of replanted trees and preventing the forest's regeneration. It has appeared in orchards and nurseries, and Dr. Oliver suggested that it could damage the hunting and tourist industries by taking over natural areas and depriving native animals of habitat and food.
Unlike many exotic plants and animals that have natural enemies to keep them under control in their native lands, mile-a-minute weed is reported by some scientists to be a major agricultural pest throughout its large home range, extending around the rim of Asia from Korea to India, where it is common and hard to hold at bay.
There is no known biological control for the weed, Dr. Oliver reported. Although many insects feed on it, they have little apparent effect. Unlike kudzu, it is hard to control through mowing because too many seeds are left behind. Some herbicides, however, including those with the trade names Roundup, Arsenal and Velpar, have been shown to be effective.
If control measures fail, Dr. Oliver says, the plant is expected to continue extending its range southward.
"Whether it will actually take root in Florida is unknown," he said, "but there is a good possibility it will," and perhaps make itself at home in parts of the country outside the South as well.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bill Rates Rise; Trading Dull

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities were mixed and little changed yesterday ahead of today's meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, which will consider another rise in short-term interest rates.
The 30-year bond was unchanged, trading at a price of 9931/32 to yield 7.50 percent, while rates in the shorter bill market were higher as investors moved to the sanctuary of money market funds to await the Fed's next move. Prices and yields move in the opposite direction. 
 Traders and dealers yesterday got a glimpse of another monthly government statistic that the Fed will be studying along with other data issued this month about the state of the economy. The F.O.M.C. meeting begins at 10 A.M.
 
Industrial Output Up
 In July industrial production rose two-tenths of 1 percent, a tad stronger than expected, leaving capacity utilization unchanged at 83.9 percent. Analysts said manufacturing posted a surprisingly solid four-tenths of 1 percent gain for the month, which was only partly offset by the 1.2 percent decline in the utilities output. The stronger data were mildly bearish for the market.
Gerald A. Guild, senior vice president-manager of the taxable-fixed- income department at Advest Inc. said trading on the whole was muted, noting that most of Europe was closed for a religious holiday. He said that yesterday should have been an active session because it was one of those quarterly dates when investors are busy looking to invest cash. "But everything is on hold, as the market waits for the next interest rate hike," he said.
If the Fed raises its discount rate, which is the interest charged on loans to member banks, or the Federal funds rate, which is the rate on overnight loans between banks, or both, most of the selling pressure is likely to be on short-term rates.
But he said that "everyone expects the Fed to act, and for that reason the market has already discounted into prices a 25-to-50-basis-point increase." So, he added, "Now they wait."
If the Fed decides to do nothing today, then long-term rates could spike and cause prices to fall, Mr. Guild said.
Many in the market expect a 50- basis-point increase in the Federal funds rate. And while a tightening announcement could be made early in the morning before the regular intervention time, 11:30 A.M., that does not necessarily mean it will have to happen then, Kim Rupert, an economist with MMS International, said. She noted that at the May 17 F.O.M.C. meeting the Fed did not disclose its intention until 2:30 P.M., when it announced a 50-basis-point increase in the funds and discount rates.
The Fed also announced its 25-basis- point move at the March 22 F.O.M.C. meeting at 2:22 P.M. While the initial rate climb this year on Feb. 4 was announced at 11 A.M., that was on the second day of the the two-day meeting. The only inter-meeting move was on April 18, when the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, announced at 10:02 A.M. a 25-basis-point rise in the funds rate.
In the corporate bond market, where most issuers of corporate debt were absent, Aegon N.V., a large international life insurance and pension management firm with headquarters in the Netherlands, used the opportunity to sell its first public issue in the United States. Underwriters led by Morgan Stanley priced $400 million of 12-year 8 percent subordinated notes at 99.087 to yield 8.12 percent. Rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and AA- by Standard & Poor's, the notes pay interest twice a year.
At the Treasury's weekly bill auction yesterday, average rates rose, with the greatest increase in the three-month bill, up 16 basis points from the previous auction, to 4.59 percent. The average rate for the six-month bills was up 6 basis points, to 4.99 percent yesterday.
The following are the results of the three- and six-month Treasury bill auctions:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	99.840	97.477	Discounted Rate	4.59%	4.99%	Coupon Yield	4.71%	5.19%	High Price	98.845	97.487	Discounted Rate	4.57%	4.97%	Coupon Yield	4.69%	5.17%	Low Price	98.837	97.477	Discounted Rate	4.60%	4.99%	Coupon Yield	4.72%	5.19%	Accepted at low price	33%	70%	Total applied for	$40,742,324	$41,833,182	Accepted	$12,420,317	$12,413,675	Noncompetitive	$1,384,499	$1,220,683	
 
Both issues are dated Aug. 18, 1994. The three-month bills mature on Nov. 17, 1994, and the six-month bills mature on Feb. 16, 1995.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE LOBBYISTS;
Lobbyists Are the Loudest In the Health Care Debate

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
The telephone callers to Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat and an influential voice in the debate over health care, are stacked up like planes over National Airport. "Senator Breaux's office. Can you hold?"
The Senator's phones are ablaze from dawn until well past dark, with the answering machine collecting at least 200 more messages overnight. Clogged phone lines are one price that Mr. Breaux and some of his fellow legislators pay for staking out an independent position on what many say is the most heavily lobbied issue in the nation's history. 
 The Senator and three members of Congress talked recently about their experiences with the health care lobby, painting a picture of special interests overwhelming the decision-making process.
At least 650 groups spent more than $100 million from January 1993 to last March to influence the outcome of health care legislation, according to a recent study by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit Washington group that examines public issues. The spending has only intensified since then.
"There is no issue of public policy in which the sheer strength of those special interests have so overwhelmed the process as in the health care reform debate," the center said.
Most of the money goes to the brigade of lobbyists who buttonhole members of Congress on behalf of their clients; some of the money goes directly into the campaign coffers of senators and representatives whose votes they hope to influence. Most of the clients, including many hospital and doctors' associations, oppose comprehensive changes in the nation's health care system, but others, like the leaders of some labor unions and the American Association of Retired Persons, are pushing for the Democratic leadership's bills.
"This is the biggest-scale lobbying effort that's ever been mounted on any single piece of legislation, both in terms of dollars spent and people engaged," said Ellen Miller, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, another Washington-based nonprofit research group. "It is more fully engaged across the country and at a higher profile inside the Beltway than ever before."
The Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania predicts that by October the amount spent by lobbyists on television advertising alone will exceed $60 million -- more than the $50 million spent on advertising in the 1992 Presidential campaign.
Citizen Action, a consumer group that has examined the campaign contributions made by lobbyists for health and insurance interests over the years, says that in the last 14 years the political action committees representing those interests contributed more than $150 million to Congressional campaigns to "keep health reform off the national agenda."
 
Spending $2 Million a Month
 Citizen Action says these political action committees are spending more than $2 million a month to modify a health care overhaul or kill it outright. They contributed $26.4 million to campaigns from January 1993 to last May, with the biggest donations going to members of committees that produced health care legislation.
For example, Citizen Action said, members of the Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee received, on average, $27,000 more in this session of Congress than in the previous session, while their colleagues who did not serve on health-related committees received an average increase of $3,000 in the same period.
In the Senate, the report said, members of the Finance Committee, which produced a proposal that George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, drew on for his bill, received the biggest contributions, averaging $600,000 since 1979. Four members of Congress received more than $1 million from the health and insurance industry since that time. They were Senators Phil Gramm of Texas, Bob Packwood of Oregon and Dave Durenberger of Minnesota, all Republicans, and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader.
 
'Just Another Trade Association'
 Given the amount of money and the intense competition, "the Oval Office is reduced to just another trade association," said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for Public Integrity.
Mr. Breaux said the lobbying "makes it more difficult to find middle ground." Pressure from unions, political parties, hospital groups, doctors and the Chamber of Commerce had already pushed some members of Congress to make commitments, he added.
One of the most effective groups has been the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 607,000 small-business owners. "The N.F.I.B. has more people on the floor of the House than the White House has," Mr. Lewis said. "They are spending millions because billions are at stake."
Terry Hill, a spokesman for the federation, says the livelihoods of his members are at stake. "This is one of the biggest issues we have ever worked on, and it's the most irate and incensed I've ever seen the membership," he said.
Joshua M. Wiener, a health policy analyst at the Brookings Institution, said the lobbying has been extremely effective. "Back in January 1993, the best that the anti-reform lobbyists might have hoped for is a watered-down Clinton proposal," Mr. Wiener said. "Now there's a good chance we'll end up with nothing at all."
In the bill introduced by Senator Mitchell, the federation has helped stave off any requirement that employers pay their workers' insurance, at least for a few years. On the House side, the small-business lobby has helped rouse opposition to the requirement that employers pay 80 percent of the cost of their workers' insurance, as proposed in the bill offered by Mr. Gephardt.
Big business, which at first applauded President Clinton's efforts to change health care, now generally sees less urgency in change and is pretty much against it.
"With the economy stronger and a temporary slowdown in inflation for health care, many companies believe they don't need a systemwide solution, that they can solve their own problems," Mr. Wiener said.
He added: "This has clearly been startling for the Clinton Administration, which larded up its health care proposal with a lot that was very favorable to big business. But the distrust of government triumphed."
This distrust has undermined efforts by unions lobbying on behalf of health care changes. While union leaders have been pushing for universal coverage and cost controls, Mr. Wiener said, many of their members fear they will suffer if the Government fiddles with the coverage they enjoy now.
The lobbying has become so fierce, fractious and well-financed, said Mr. Lewis of the Center for Public Integrity, that it can "overwhelm the decision-making process." Here are the views of Senator Breaux and three Representatives on health care lobbying:
 
John B. Breaux
A Senator Draws A Lot of Attention
 Senator Breaux says he has been hit on by "everyone from A to Z." This means not just the big, professional interests, but also musical therapists, witch doctors and wart removers, all of whom want their specialties covered.
His office, with its row of colorful football helmets and his case of tennis trophies, is now a must stop on the lobbying circuit. This is partly because Senator Breaux has yet to commit himself to a specific health care plan. It is also because he is one of the mainstream group producing its own set of amendments to the Mitchell bill. Some on Capitol Hill think this bipartisan group may provide the needed heft to get a health care bill through the Senate this session.
"Liberals want to do everything all at once and hope they got it right, and conservatives want to do nothing and take a long time to do it," he said. "I'm trying to take one step at a time and make sure we get it right. When you're in the middle, you get beat up by both sides."
Mr. Breaux, who was elected to the Senate in 1986, is not unfamiliar with the ways of Washington. He came to the House in 1972 as its youngest member -- he was then 28 -- to replace Edwin W. Edwards, on whose staff he had served. (He came from the same small Cajun town as Mr. Edwards, who is now Louisiana's Governor.
At the start of the debate over health care, the Senator said, many of the lobbyists were useful because they provided details on subjects that lawmakers did not have time to delve into on their own. But now things are more intense.
"We've long passed informational lobbying; now we're at break-your-arm lobbying," he said.
Many are callers from orchestrated campaigns who tell him to vote yes or no. "I try to hang up on the ones not from Louisiana," he said. "People will really badger you. People will call up and be really ugly sometimes, and threatening."
"People have been scared," Mr. Breaux continued. "That's a great tactic if you want to get people to be against something. You instill the fear that Congress is going to do something to you rather than for you."
President Clinton's initial proposal "was technically do-able, but politically not do-able," the Senator also said. "It was too much, too soon, too complicated, too bureaucratic, too Washington-oriented."
Reforming health care may be extremely complex, but Senator Breaux has set what may be an even higher goal for himself. "I'm trying to achieve survival," he laughed. "I'll do well if I survive."
 
Bill Brewster
Lone Pharmacist Far From Lonely
 Bill Brewster is the only pharmacist in the House. This makes him particularly sensitive to the pitches of the multifaceted pharmaceutical lobby patrolling Capitol Hill.
But Mr. Brewster, a 52-year-old Democrat who represents a sprawling rural district in southern Oklahoma, is also a small-business owner, a cattleman and a hunter. He is a man of many interests, and many interests have been seeking him out.
"We've heard from more groups than I knew there were in America," he said of the health lobbyists, many of whom represent hospitals, doctors and pharmacists. "There's a lot of different pharmacy groups, and they're all at each other's throats."
The main issue within the pharmaceutical industry, Mr. Brewster said, is drug pricing. "The pharmaceutical manufacturers are on one side, and they've got every lobbyist hired in town," he said. "The ones they haven't hired are working for the National Association of Retail Druggists and pharmaceutical associations."
As a member of Ways and Means, Mr. Brewster said, he was lobbied most heavily from February until late June when the committee passed its proposed bill. "Obviously they worked the members on the committees prior to the committee votes," he said of the lobbyists. Partly because the Gephardt bill has stalled, he said, "I'm having fewer contacts right now."
Mr. Brewster was identified by Citizen Action, the watchdog group, as the ninth top recipient in the House of money from all health and insurance industry political action committees from January 1993 to May 1994. And the Center for Public Integrity identified him as among those who took the most trips sponsored by the health care industry. The top member took 11; Mr. Brewster took 10.
"I figure, anyone who contributes feels like I'm doing a decent job and wants to have good government," he said. "I try to look at an issue first off, how it affects my district."
The economy in his district is based on small businesses, farms and oil and gas interests. He said he was getting "a tremendous amount of pressure" from small-business owners, who oppose any provision to require employers to pay for workers' health insurance. He said he had received numerous letters saying, "I don't have insurance but I do have a job -- please don't mandate insurance coverage that puts my boss out of business and puts me out of a job."
He is unhappy with both the Gephardt bill and a rival plan proposed by Representative Jim Cooper of Tennessee, which has attracted some Republican support, on the grounds that they try to do too much. "If we try to provide a plan that's not intrusive to the 85 percent who have insurance, provide access to preventive care for the 15 percent who don't and went home, the public would be very happy."
Nonetheless, he said, he has it easier than some colleagues. "If you've been on the committee," he said, "you've worked on this for months, you're pretty well cemented in position on whatever issue it may have been because you've already voted on it in committee, you've made speeches for months."
 
Paul McHale
Former Marine Faces New Battles
 Paul McHale of Bethlehem, Pa., has approached the health care debate with the order and determination of the most serious student in the class. A 44-year-old former marine who left the Pennsylvania Legislature to return to active duty for the war in the Persian Gulf, his mission is to conquer every detail and do the right thing.
"To do justice in evaluating any of the pending comprehensive health care plans," said Mr. McHale, a first-term Democrat, "it is absolutely essential for a member of Congress to have done an extensive amount of mind-numbing reading prior to the examination of any individual bill.
"Once you know the basic building blocks, once you know the concepts, you can quickly recognize how they're being fitted together. Now when I'm lobbied -- by ordinary constituents, businessmen and women and professional lobbyists -- when they come in, the dialogue becomes whether or not my position comes close to theirs and whether either of our positions can be found in one of the pending bills."
For the moment, Mr. McHale's cannot. An original backer of the alternative plan discussed by Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee, Mr. McHale said he was disappointed in the plan's final, conservative shape.
He is also unhappy with the Gephardt plan. He opposes making small-business owners pay for their workers' insurance, and he does not like expanding Medicare, which he says would not control costs.
All of which makes him a legislator in search of a bill to support. "The best way to affect my vote is to provide me with information," he said. While all the usual suspects have inundated Mr. McHale with information -- last week alone, he was visited by at least two dozen lobbyists, including representatives of three drug companies, six of the largest businesses in his district, two unions, including the steelworkers, local health care plans, and four hospital associations -- he is still in search of more.
This has left him open to attacks from all sides. "Yesterday a very good friend who is a well-respected leader of organized labor said I was too conservative," he said. "And right after that, the National Federation of Independent Business conducted a press conference back in my district where they criticized my position as too liberal."
"In the final analysis, I'm going to pull back in, find a quiet corner, think about what's good for our country and vote on the issue as if it were a secret ballot," he said.
With that, it is time for a House vote. Mr. McHale checks his watch and steps briskly out the door. "It takes me six minutes and 35 seconds to get there," he said. "I've got this route timed out."
 
Jose E. Serrano
A Caucus Leader Feels the Pressure
 Jose E. Serrano represents the South Bronx, one of the poorest districts in the nation, its striking poverty and vast expanses of rubble made famous by visits by Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. A full 60 percent of the district is Hispanic, which helped catapult this 50-year-old, two-term Democrat to the chairmanship of the 19-member Hispanic caucus in Congress.
Thus Mr. Serrano has not only the interests of his district to worry about but also the interests of his caucus. He said they were generally one and the same. But he also has to worry about the interests of New York City, and that can be cause for angst.
The health care industry in New York provides 300,000 jobs, and it has been one of the fastest-growing sectors of the economy. Mr. Serrano has to worry about those jobs -- many hospital workers are Hispanic -- as well as insure that the hospitals will continue to treat poor patients, regardless of their immigration status.
Another big concern is how New York's teaching hospitals, among the nation's most eminent, will fare. The bill offered by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, proposes a limit on the number of medical residents at such hospitals; Mr. Serrano wants to make sure that Hispanic residents are fairly represented.
Mr. Serrano said the caucus was worried about preventive care and about whether a national health insurance system would require people to carry identification cards and what uses those cards might be put to. But it has supported the most controversial provision of the Gephardt bill, the requirement that employers pay 80 percent of the cost of their workers' health insurance.
Mr. Serrano hears most often not from insurance companies or other giants of the health care debate, but from fellow caucus members and strictly local interests, particularly the teaching hospitals.
Mr. Serrano is sympathetic to some of the hospitals' concerns, but he wants them to admit more local residents into their training programs. "Maybe it's time for me to do a little lobbying," he said, clearing his throat, pinching his collar and straightening his tie.
In his office, which features portraits of Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mr. Serrano said, "Not all the lobbying is done right here. Anywhere you are, you get lobbied."
He reached for a piece of paper. "This is the White House lobbying," he said. "They ran off a beautiful computer thing that singles out your district. It gives me information I didn't have, that there are people in my district who are not covered by Medicaid and Medicare and who need universal coverage."
The analysis said that 94,000 people, including 36,000 children, in Mr. Serrano's district had no health coverage.
The grass-roots groups, he said, "remind you of what it is they do and their value to society and why we have to be careful not to hurt them."
He said insurance companies were the "toughest" lobbyists "because they're very negative in their approach."
"They say, 'Everything is O.K. Why don't we leave things the way they are?' It's hard to negotiate with someone who believes no change is needed."
 The chart also failed to mention that three of the House members listed -- Mr. Cooper, Michael A. Andrews and Jon Kyl -- are engaged in or were engaged in Senate races; as a result, their contribution totals were inflated. The total listed for Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson was also inflated because it included gifts from her campaign in a special election in 1993 as well as gifts this year.

 CORRECTION:
A chart on Tuesday about health care lobbying described campaign contributions received by the listed members of Congress incorrectly. In addition to health and insurance industry political action committees, the totals included large gifts from individual donors. One Congressman listed, Representative Jim Cooper, said he does not accept contributions from political action committees.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
TOYS 'R' US INC. (TOY,N)

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Toys "R" Us Inc. said yesterday that its net earnings for the second quarter increased by less than 1 percent, to $38 million, from $35.5 million in the comparable period a year ago.
The company reported earnings of 13 cents a share in the quarter, compared with 12 cents a share for the second quarter of last year. The company's second quarter ended July 30. 
 The chief executive of Toys "R" Us, Michael Goldstein, said the company's international stores had been "adversely impacted by local economic conditions, and therefore had comparable store sales decreases."
A spokesman for the company, Louis Lipschitz, said Toys "R" Us had opened 67 international stores last year, and had expected to lose money on those stores in the first half of the year.
"We warned everyone that the first half of the year would be very tough," Mr. Lipschitz said. "And the economic situation in Europe is also bad."
Mr. Lipschitz said the company expected the international stores to perform better in the latter half of the year, and the company planned to open about 60 stores abroad this year, including its first stores in Denmark, Luxembourg and Sweden.
The company also plans to open 40 more stores in the United States this year.
Net earnings in the first half of the year increased six-hundredths of 1 percent, to $75.6 million, or 26 cents a share, from $70.9 million, or 24 cents a share, in the comparable period a year ago.
Toys "R" Us reported an increase of 10 percent in sales, to $1.45 billion, from $1.32 billion last year.
Toys "R" Us, based in Rochelle Park, N.J., is the largest toy specialty retailing chain in the world. It operates 581 toy stores in the United States, 238 international toy stores and 201 Kids "R" Us children's clothing stores.

HEADLINE: Clinton Wants to Strengthen Global Pact on Air Pollution

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 15

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has concluded that the 1992 treaty to reduce the threat of global warming needs to be strengthened and that in any case the United States may already be doing too little to comply with it.
While that first conclusion pleases many environmentalists who are worried about possible changes in the world's climate, both it and its corollary are also likely to put pressure on the Government to take stronger steps to reduce emissions of certain gases, particularly those from gasoline combustion in automobiles. 
 International negotiators will meet next week in Switzerland to re-examine the treaty, which was signed during the Bush Administration and calls for reduction of gases like carbon dioxide and methane that many scientists say act like a global blanket to trap the sun's energy in a greenhouse effect and create global warming.
At the Geneva negotations Clinton Administration officials will support European nations like Germany and the Netherlands in calling for tougher long-term steps to curtail such greenhouse gases in the next century.
"Virtually all nations are in agreement that current efforts are not adequate to the task at hand," Timothy E. Wirth, the Under Secretary of State for global affairs, said at a recent briefing on the negotiations.
But so far there is no sign that the Administration is willing to take a step favored by many environmentalists: raising the Federal requirement for fuel efficiency in automobiles.
And some Administration officials worry that even the current short-term plan to control carbon dioxide, methane and greenhouse gases will not meet the emissions targets set for the year 2000.
 
Troubling Forecasts
 New forecasts, they said, suggested that the United States would be producing more carbon dioxide in the next few years than was assumed when the short-term plan was put together and adopted last October.
Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary said in an interview that lower-than-expected oil prices had encouraged higher consumption, and other officials pointed to the increased use of coal in power plants rather than natural gas and to strong economic growth generally, which has increased industry's energy use.
Mrs. O'Leary said officials from several Federal agencies were already drafting "further steps" to cut emissions of greenhouse gases from their fastest-growing source, automobiles.
"My clear leaning is to put a lot more emphasis on all alternative-fuel vehicles and to get electric vehicles out of the closet," Mrs. O'Leary said.
The Administration's October plan, adopted as a first step toward meeting the United States' treaty commitments, relies heavily on voluntary measures by industry to reduce gases like carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. Many scientists believe that the greenhouse effect caused by these gases affects many climatic trends, not just how hot the planet becomes.
Among those praising the Administration's new, tougher stance is Daniel F. Becker, Washington director of the global warming and energy program at the Sierra Club. "We applaud the Administration for recognizing that the problem is terribly serious," Mr. Becker said. "But they need an action plan that has got real action, not just jawboning for industry. They need to do much more about transportation, and the major thing they need to do is raise automobile fuel efficiency standards."
But John Shlaes, executive director of the Global Climate Coalition, a group that represents more than 50 business trade associations and companies, said his group was "disturbed by the implication that the President's voluntary climate action plan, which is just getting under way, will be inadequate and that more stringent measures may be needed domestically."
In a draft report that the State Department circulated among industries and environmentalists early this month, the Administration warned that new controls on emissions of greenhouse gases could become necessary, particularly steps to cut gasoline consumption.
The report cited a previously unpublished Government forecast of United States energy use indicating that "trends of emissions are significantly above the levels used in developing the October 1993 action plan."
"The new data suggest there may be a need to modify the action plan should these trends persist," it said.
The report, which is the Government's official description of American policies to prevent global warming, will be given to other nations under terms of the climate treaty.
The treaty, one of two major environmental pacts drafted in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, calls for the signers, especially the industrialized countries, to move quickly to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases.
Because the science of climate change is so new, the signers realized that they would have to re-examine the treaty's goals every few years. The first full conference of the signers is scheduled to occur in Berlin next spring, and preliminary negotiations are under way.
On Aug. 22, negotiators will gather in Geneva for two weeks to discuss, among other things, whether it is enough for the industrial nations to return their emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The conference in Berlin must decide that issue.
 
'Inevitable Next Steps'
 On Aug. 3 at a State Department meeting of environmentalists, industry groups and other interested parties, Mr. Wirth called on the audience to "prepare together for the inevitable next steps under the climate treaty."
"As a first priority for the future, we need to set an aim that can guide our efforts for the initial period after the year 2000," he said.
During his campaign for the Presidency, Bill Clinton promised to set higher standards for automotive fuel efficiency, but his Administration has instead favored a largely voluntary approach, which has done little to reduce automotive pollution.
Budget cuts are also making it hard for the Administration to meet its goal for reducing greenhouse gases. The House and Senate are negotiating a compromise spending bill that could cut the Energy Department's conservation programs by $150 million to $233 million in 1995, depending on which house's version prevails.
Mrs. O'Leary has testified that a cut of just $120 million would put the target for lower emissions "at substantial risk" and that a greater budget cut would make the target "virtually impossible to meet."

HEADLINE: Experts in U.S. Call Plutonium Not Arms-Level

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
Federal weapon experts say that the plutonium seized in Germany and suspected of coming from Russia is not of the purity found in military stocks and that the Russians may be right in asserting that the security fences around their sprawling military establishment remain unbreached.
However, the experts also say the material, though probably intended as fuel for a nuclear-power reactor, was still potent enough to help make a nuclear bomb, though a crude one by most standards. They view non-weapons establishments in Russia as the most likely source of the leaks, although they say this remains to be proved. 
 And they warn that the large amount of such material appearing on the black market should be seen as a global wake-up call.
German authorities have made another seizure of weapon-grade nuclear materials, a prosecutor in the northern city of Bremen said yesterday. [Page A13.]
"All of us should be worried," said Dr. Terry Hawkins, a senior official in the international security division of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, the birthplace of the bomb.
"The fact that the Russian military says all the military plutonium is under control should not send us to bed for a rest," he said. "The fact that significant amounts, approaching weapon quantities of plutonium, seem to be showing up in this criminal channel should cause us great concern."
Los Alamos is participating in the Federal effort to analyze the German data and has been working closely with the Russians for several months to help them strengthen their nuclear security and safeguards.
The seized plutonium, according to Dr. Hawkins and many other Federal and private experts, was a mix of plutonium and uranium oxides known as Mox, or mixed-oxide fuel. Mox is made to fuel nuclear reactors that produce electrical power. It has been used or made in such places as Japan, France, Belgium and Germany. In Russia its use is still in the experimental stage.
That exact composition of the seized Mox is being closely studied around the world and is one of a host of potential clues that could help pinpoint the material's origin.
Weapon experts say that in principle it is possible to gather enough evidence to identify positively who made nearly any kind of nuclear-weapon fuel. But in practice, they add, the detective work can be frustrated by information gaps and mix-ups.
 
Fingerprints of a Weapon
 "There's no question that nuclear fuel, whether plutonium or uranium, has characteristic fingerprints," said Dr. Ray E. Ridder, a former weapon designer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. "The problem is that we don't always have a complete fingerprint file to match them against, so we may not be able to identify the criminal."
Dr. Hawkins of Los Alamos said positive identifications were also hindered with each passing year because so many nuclear materials, including ones from Russia, are being recycled within producing countries and are being extensively mixed with ones originally made elsewhere.
"In theory," he said in a telephone interview, "you might be able to make a pretty definitive statement. But because these materials are exchanged between all the players in the international market, it's hard to say for sure that it came from a particular country or a particular reactor" used for making weapon-grade plutonium.
The issue is at the heart of a growing dispute between Germany and Russia, which are at odds over Germany's suspicion that plutonium recently seized in Munich was made in Russia. Federal officials in Washington say they are still learning the details of the German-Russian dispute, which they say may take weeks of analysis to resolve.
 
Arrest in Germany
 German authorities recently revealed that they apprehended a suspected smuggler who flew from Moscow to Munich with 300 to 350 grams, or 10.6 to 12.3 ounces, of plutonium 239, one of the main nuclear-weapon fuels. The material was said to be the first part of larger shipment amounting to four kilograms, or 8.8 pounds, apparently close to what it takes to build a bomb.
The German authorities said that the material was still being analyzed, but that it clearly was of military origin, probably Russian, and that in time the analysis would pinpoint the Russian installations that produced it. The Russian Atomic Energy Ministry has repeatedly denied that any weapon-grade material is missing from Russia.
Dr. Hawkins of Los Alamos said the plutonium in the seized Mox had an isotopic composition of 87 percent plutonium 239, the principal isotope used in making bombs. Isotopes are different forms of the same element.
This 87-percent level is short of the 93-percent-or-higher level normally used by nuclear powers for making bombs, and by definition makes the material fuel-grade, or suitable for fueling a nuclear reactor.
 
Origin in Civilian Plant
 The material, said Dr. Hawkins, "was not produced in a reactor for military weapons," adding that it undoubtedly came from one that was part of a civilian power industry, probably in Russia.
"It's probably true that the Russian military material is under control," he said. "But that does not extend to other sectors, to research and civil power. That's where they have the problems."
Some experts noted that Mox usually has far less plutonium 239, raising the suspicion that it had come somewhere close to military sources, perhaps from Russia's emerging efforts to commercialize its huge inventory of weapon-grade materials. But Dr. Hawkins said other countries had also experimented with such higher levels.
The danger in all this is considerable, weapon experts said, since it is widely known that even relatively low concentrations of the plutonium 239 isotope, including the kind in the seized Mox, can be used to make a bomb.
 
U.S. Test in 1962
 In June, Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary revealed details of how the United States conducted a successful nuclear blast in the Nevada desert in 1962 that used reactor-grade plutonium, rather than weapon grade.
"The test confirmed that reactor-grade plutonium could be used to make a nuclear explosive," the Energy Department said in a statement in June.
Dr. Alexander De Volpi, a physicist at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, said that the clues being searched for in Germany probably fell into three broad categories -- chemical, metallurgical and isotopic. The latter evidence concerns the mix of the different possible forms of a particular element, or its isotopes.
For instance, he said, the main kind of plutonium made in nuclear reactors for weapons is rich in the 239 isotope. But the process can also produce a range of other plutonium isotopes, including plutonium 240, 241 and 242, and the mix of these isotopes can differ radically from one reactor and one country to another.
"The fractions of these isotopes depend on the radiation history and the type of reactor," he said. "These ratios are traceable features."
The problem, he added, is that such tracing "is possible provided one knows enough about the characteristics of a particular country's materials" and that such data is often top-secret.

HEADLINE: Concern Rising On U.S. Shores As Cubans Flee

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: KEY WEST, Fla., Aug. 16

 BODY:
By the hundreds, the Cubans stream through the refugee center's doors, some clad only in their underwear and Coast Guard-issue gauze jumpsuits, eager for a shower, a meal and a new life.
Sunburned and gaunt, they have been arriving in United States waters in increasing numbers recently -- 868 since Friday alone, Federal officials say. It is the largest five-day total since the Mariel boat lift in 1980, when 125,000 Cubans arrived in Florida over five months. On Monday, 282 refugees were rescued by the Coast Guard, and by 9 o'clock tonight at least 215 more were picked up. 
 The influx of refugees, about 6,000 so far this year, is a matter of growing concern for state and local officials and for the Clinton Administration, which has signaled President Fidel Castro of Cuba that the United States will not tolerate a replay of Mariel. The Government has also warned people in this country that it would prosecute those who smuggle aliens from Cuba.
The Coast Guard has begun distributing leaflets at marinas from Miami to Key West, warning against bringing aliens into the country. Those who do so will have their boats seized and face Federal smuggling charges. If convicted, they could face prison terms of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000.
With countless small boats in the straits between Florida and Cuba, however, the Coast Guard is also asking boat operators to do all they can to pick up Cubans in sinking vessels or to notify the authorities of those who are in distress, said a Coast Guard spokesman in Key West, Petty Officer Adam Wine.
Mr. Castro has paid particular attention to the mounting number of Cubans trying to flee. On Monday, he visited the village of La Boca in Mariel Harbor, 25 miles west of Havana, where more than 700 Cubans had taken over a docked oil tanker, registered in Malta, according to foreign wire service reports from Cuba. Cuban navy ships blocked the tanker from departing, and by Monday night the Cubans had left the ship.
Under United States immigration policy, nearly all Cubans refugees are admitted because they come from a Communist country. Mr. Castro has said that the policy is encouraging Cubans to flee. Many of the refugees have said, however, that they left their country because of its crippled economy.
Haunted by memories of Mariel, local officials like Emery Major, a Key West City Commissioner, worry that the refugee influx will overwhelm Key West, a resort island that is two miles wide, four miles long and home to 28,000 people.
"It's going to be a boom," Mr. Major said of the growing number of Cubans. The problem, he said, is that few local contingency plans have been made since the flood of refugees in 1980. "It shouldn't have taken 14 years to be caught with our pants down," he said.
Dozens of volunteers are working round the clock at the Transit Home for Cuban Refugees on Stock Island, cooking meals, handing out new clothes, washing linens and calling Miami to track down relatives of the new arrivals.
 
Memorial to the Missing
 In the two years since it opened, the Transit Home has become a kind of privately run Ellis Island. In one room, where new arrivals are interviewed and their paperwork processed, the walls are covered with more than 1,700 squares of note paper bearing names, each representing a boatload of Cubans who left the island but never arrived.
To the Transit Home staff, they are "walls of sorrow for the Cuban Holocaust," for the staff members believe that thousands of men, women and children have died as they attempted the 90-mile crossing.
"You understand the idea of fatherland or death?" asked Arturo Cobo, the Transit Center's founder, referring to Cuba's long-time national motto. "Now it's liberty or death."
Mr. Cobo, who fought Mr. Castro's army in the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, runs the Transit Home. In two years, about 9,000 Cuban refugees have come through the center, fleeing a economy that has crumbled since the loss of Soviet financial and political support.
Although the scene is always hectic, the 30 or so volunteers and the small paid staff keep things going -- always cooking, always looking for clothes that fit the new arrivals and always trying to make room for the next boatload.
The first stop for the refugees is the Coast Guard base at Key West, where agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service interview them before turning them over to the Transit Center.
"Our key is buses," Mr. Cobo said. "When we have 100 people we give them food, medical attention, moral support, and we put them on the buses to Miami."
Once in Miami, about 75 percent of the immigrants find family members who take them in, Mr. Cobo said. The others are handed over to Church World Services or to the Catholic Conference, both federally financed private groups that house the new arrivals in Miami motels until they can be resettled in other American cities, Mr. Cobo said.
 
Taste of a New Life
 But it is during the stay at the Transit Home, normally for less than a day, that the refugees get their first taste of a new life. For 17-year-old Dennis Rondon, it meant a meal of rice, beans and a concoction of potatoes and hot dogs that was simmering in a huge skillet.
"I can't remember the last time I had meat," Dennis said, guessing it had been two or three months.
Dennis, who arrived this morning with his mother and 9-year-old brother on a raft made of foam, was covered with a blistering sunburn from four days at sea. "My hope is to have a new life and prosper, to work hard and fight to live well -- and to never go back," said Dennis, who described himself as a New York Yankees fan.
For all the joy of arrival, there is abundant sorrow as well. On Monday an 8-year-old boy arrived after a storm capsized his boat; his parents were believed drowned. The boy, Daniel Bussot, wearing the vessel's only life jacket, clung to a floating plank until another small refugee boat came by and rescued him. "A child has been orphaned searching for liberty," said Mr. Cobo, who called the boy's parents martyrs. "This has to be told to the world."
Mr. Castro heightened fears of another Mariel two weeks ago when, angered by the hijackings of Government boats, he warned that he might allow anyone who wanted to leave the island to do so.
Mr. Cobo said Mr. Castro was beginning to make good on his threat. New arrivals have told him, he said, that while some fleeing Cubans have been detained, others have been pointed north by the crews of Cuban gun boats and wished a good day.

HEADLINE: Vote Against Crime Bill Is Lesson on Clout

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Representative Lee H. Hamilton carries the look and the sound of small-town America with him. He uses the phrase "visit with" to mean "talk to," he still wears his hair cut short and he has the same soft Hoosier manner that once made Herb Shriner a popular humorist.
But Mr. Hamilton, an Indiana Democrat, has spent 30 years on the Potomac, and he is now a major player on Capitol Hill as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He is invited to the big-time parties in Georgetown and at the White House (he was there for dinner recently with the Emperor and Empress of Japan). He regularly gets approval ratings in the 70's and 80's from most liberal groups and ratings in the 30's from most conservative organizations. 
 Mr. Hamilton is admired for his intellect. President Clinton, it is said, considered him last year for Secretary of State and has thought of him, along with Walter F. Mondale, as a candidate to succeed Warren Christopher in that position. In short, he is someone the Democratic establishment considers one of its own.
So perhaps the most surprising element of last week's surprising defeat of the crime bill on a procedural motion was Lee Hamilton's "no" vote. It is understandable only in terms of the two worlds he inhabits and which one exerts the stronger influence in today's politics.
"It doesn't give me any joy to cast a vote against President Clinton or any other President, for that matter," he said today. "Would I like to see him get a victory when he obviously needs one? Yes. Do I make that my first or my second priority? No.
"The basic nature of American politics has changed. I don't get elected because of what Bill Clinton thinks or what the House leadership thinks. The electorate makes up its own mind. That inevitably means that Presidents have a lot less clout with Congress than they used to have. All Presidents, I mean.
"It's also true, of course, that when a President is riding high his influence goes up, and when a President is in the dumps, the way Clinton is, his influence declines."
Mr. Hamilton lives in Nashville, Brown County, Ind. (population 873), and represents most of southeastern Indiana, an 18-county region whose biggest town is Jeffersonville, across the Ohio River from Louisville, Ky. In the 1980's he came to national attention as the co-chairman of the special Congressional committee investigating the Iran-contra affair.
People in his district tend to be conservative Democrats; many trace their roots back to the "Butternut" Democrats from the South who settled in the area. And they are much more suspicious of government spending and gun control and social engineering than people in Washington or, for that matter, Indianapolis.
"They elect Lee Hamilton," an old friend said, "because they know that deep down, there's a wide streak of Scottish conservatism in there."
Mr. Hamilton certainly sounded conservative as he discussed his vote in an interview this morning. He said he liked some things in the bill, such as the provisions for more police officers and more prisons, but he argued that Congress "can do better" and that no bill was preferable to one he considered deeply flawed.
How? Well, the Congressman said, he found the financing of the new programs "very shaky," in fact "largely phony," because they would be paid for by savings within the Federal bureaucracy that would never be made. There was "a lot of stuff that doesn't belong in a crime bill," he added, like $300 million for economic development, and "another job training program, when we already have about 20 and the Vice President has been running around saying we need to consolidate them."
 
Threat or Security Device?
 But he spoke with special emphasis about the ban on assault weapons, which he voted against when it first passed the House, although he had voted in favor of the Brady law, which requires a five-day waiting period before handguns can be purchased. Such laws are far more popular in cities, he conceded, than in the small towns and rural communities he represents; "in Indianapolis a gun is a threat, but in DuBois or Spencer County it's a security device."
"This is an exceedingly divisive issue," Mr. Hamilton said, "but no one has shown me any evidence that a ban would cut the crime rate."
He pictured his vote as a matter of principle, but at the White House, it was seen as a cave-in to political pressure. Asked why Mr. Hamilton had voted as he did, a senior adviser to Mr. Clinton answered:
"Guns. That's all it is."
In fact, Mr. Hamilton appears to be under no great pressure from anyone. Despite widespread talk of stripping him of his chairmanship as a disciplinary measure, something that would have been almost automatic 20 or 30 years ago, he said he had received no threats from House colleagues and no calls from the White House since the vote. (Beforehand, he was called by Vice President Al Gore, whom he told that he had already publicly pledged to vote "no.")
 
Overwhelming Concern? No
 His hold on his district appears solid. He took 69 percent of the vote in 1992 and 70 in 1994, and his opponent this year, State Senator Jean Leising, is given little chance.
There has been no burst of editorial comment on his vote, and John Gilkey, managing editor of The Evening News in Jeffersonville, said that even the assault-gun ban "is not really an overwhelming concern to people here." The main complaints have come from local police chiefs. Dean Marble, the chief in Clark County, said he was "really disappointed" because additional officers were "desperately needed in the county" and money was not available.
As for Mr. Hamilton, he spent the weekend at church picnics in his district and got "a lot of praise and a lot of criticism." But when he was able to describe the bill in detail, he reported, "most people expressed amazement at what was in there, asked for assurance that we would get some sort of crime bill, which I gave them, then nodded their heads in agreement."
Mr. Hamilton has broken with the President in the past. Although generally supportive of Mr. Clinton's foreign policy -- "I carry a lot of water for him up here," he said -- he has also pungently criticized the Administration for its constant changes of direction. On one occasion, he said of the President: "We don't know what the policy is, but we know what kind of underwear he wears."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
A family-run public relations firm in transition keeps its place near the top of the industry heap.

BYLINE: By Barnaby J. Feder 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
FOR the last year, Edelman Public Relations Worldwide has been trumpeting its ranking as the top public relations firm in the nation by Inside PR, a leading trade publication. But when results of the magazine's 1994 survey of overall performance and reputation were published last week, Edelman had slipped to fourth place, changing places with Porter/Novelli, a unit of the Omnicom Group, which has risen to first place from fourth.
Still, Edelman is enjoying a run of success that most of its competitors can only envy. Though revenue growth slowed last year to 5.9 percent, 1993 was a year in which many other large public relations agencies suffered declines. 
 This year, Edelman's has returned to double-digit growth; the company, which is family owned, expects fees to top $70 million, compared with $63.4 million last year.
"There are three or four firms at the top of the heap right now and Edelman is clearly one of them," Paul A. Holmes, editor of Inside PR in New York, said.
One reason Mr. Holmes cited was Edelman's New York office, which has been headed since 1979 by Richard Edelman, the son of the founder, Daniel J. Edelman, 74. The New York office had 10 employees and $1 million in fees when Richard arrived with a degree from the Harvard Business School and a lifetime of exposure to his father's skills as a creative promoter of consumer products. By the late 1980's, New York had overtaken the company's original office, in Chicago, and now generates about $20 million in fees with 170 employees.
Given that record, no one was surprised when Mr. Edelman promoted Richard, who was president and chief operating officer, to co-chief executive on June 15, his son's 40th birthday. Daniel Edelman, who is co-chairman and chief executive, and his wife, Ruth, still own a majority of the company, and Mr. Edelman senior will continue to focus on his recent passion of expanding the company's Asian business.
Outsiders, though, are watching closely to see whether Richard can broaden the company's image and clout.
"It's going to be a very interesting transition," said John Graham, chief executive of Fleischman-Hillard, the public relations agency in St. Louis that is the only independent agency larger than Edelman. Mr. Graham said that although Edelman had achieved notable success in several specialty sectors, particularly health care, it remained best known for campaigns that draw media attention to consumer products.
Some former employees and industry experts say that Richard Edelman's aggressive emphasis on financial goals and growth has its drawbacks, resulting in employee turnover they deem to be excessive and inadequate servicing of some clients.
As Inside PR put it delicately last year in listing Edelman as the top-ranked firm, it is not the best-loved public relations agency in the country.
If Richard Edelman has his way, the company will become known as a must for those who want to use compact disks, computer networks and the other trappings of the information highway to get their messages out, regardless of whether those messages deal with consumer products.
"I hope that public relations will develop an advantage over advertisers in computers if not in television," Mr. Edelman said. He cited a campaign he has been developing for "a major New York bank" to make its economic analyses of foreign countries and similar reports available to journalists and opinion influencers over the Internet.
In June, Edelman moved to use the Internet as an advertising medium for itself by joining the Digital Equipment Corporation, Ogilvy & Mather Direct and Dun & Bradstreet as a founding supporter of Mecklerweb, a commercial service. Edelman will handle public relations work for Mecklerweb, which will make information about Edelman's services and client list available to millions of computer users around the world. Edelman's office in Mountain View, Calif., developed the arrangement.
"We had a meeting last December in which we told all our office managers to get up to date on the information highway and to get clients involved," Mr. Edelman said. "We're bringing everyone together next month to see what they've accomplished."
Edelman's other focus for future growth is, like its major competitors, overseas expansion. It has hardly been a smooth path.
A bumpy first effort in Hong Kong in the early 1980's has left the company battling with a former partner over who can use the firm's name there. And the London office, opened in 1967, has fallen on hard times. But international revenue has risen from less than 20 percent of total revenue to more than 35 percent in the last five years.
Richard Edelman is also keeping a close watch on the firm's bottom line. He is pushing hard to develop public affairs and financial assignments as accounts for the agency, because they are more profitable than marketing campaigns. Among the most recent: advising Viacom in its takeover wars with Paramount and Blockbuster Entertainment.
"Our pretax earnings were just 3 or 4 percent," he said of his early days with the firm, while declining to be specific. "It's much better than that now."

HEADLINE: U.S., Japan In Accord On Patents

BYLINE: By TERESA RIORDAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
The United States and Japan signed an agreement today that would make major changes in the patent policies in both countries, providing what is being hailed as greater protection for American inventors.
The accord, while covering contentious issues, is just one arena in broader, and essentially stalled, trade negotiations with Tokyo. It is the first accord the two nations have signed in more than a year of often trying talks. 
 "From our point of view it's quite historic," said Assistant Secretary of Commerce Bruce A. Lehman, the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks. "We're getting provisions we've been seeking a long time. This will have a big market-opening effect."
 
Wide-Ranging Effect Sought
 The accord is not likely to bring about the resolution of disputes involving insurance, automobiles and government procurement, more crucial issues in the broader "framework talks" between Washington and Tokyo, it is expected to have benefits for industries in both countries.
Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown, who signed the agreement with Japan's Ambasador here, Takakazu Kuriyama, expressed pleasure and a degree of hope about its effects. "I'm not sure if it has a direct impact on the rest of the trade framework," Mr. Brown said. "Obviously we're pleased with any success. This certainly was a major success. It moves us closer to the goal of harmonization of intellectual-property laws. It dramatically speeds the ability of American companies to get patents."
And Kiyohiko Nanao, top economics specialist at the Japanese Embassy, said: "Patent policy relates to all fields. It covers everything, not just a single industry like telecommunications or shipping. In that sense, the agreement is important."
 
Shorter Decision Times
 Secretary Brown and Ambassador Kuriyama, in the letters of agreement signed today, committed Japan to reduce the time now required for determination on patent requests, allowing applications to be decided in a maximum of three years. Currently, the average review time is five years.
Japan also said it would do away with a provision that allows patents to be legally challenged before they have been issued, as well as a requirement for compulsory licensing of patents in some instances.
The accord includes an important change that had been announced in an agreement made public in January: Tokyo will allow foreign inventors to file their initial applications in English. Such applications must now be filed in Japanese, and inaccuracies in translation have made it hard for many American companies to defend their patents in court.
The areas covered by the agreement were cited in a report by the General Accounting Office last year as impediments to the granting of patents with "timely exclusivity" to American inventors.
For its part, the United States agreed to substantial policy changes that had been sought by American corporations but challenged by independent inventors and universities.
Some specialists in intellectual property gave the American negotiators high marks. "Lehman gave up nothing to the Japanese that wasn't already in our domestic interests," said Harold C. Wegner, a professor of law at George Washington University and a leading authority on international patent law. "He got something for nothing. It's a brilliant trade."
Among the changes being made by the United States is a provision that patent applications will be published 18 months after they are filed, whether or not the patent has been issued. Unlike most countries, the United States does not now make public a patent application until the patent has been granted.
Another element of the accord, also agreed to in January, speeds a requirement under the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that American patents be granted for a period of 20 years after the date of application, rather than 17 years after the date of issuance.
This provision, in conjunction with the 18-month publication rule, is expected to eliminate the ability of inventors to pursue "submarine patents," those that sit for decades at the Patent Office until a technology becomes widely used. As it stands now, companies could potentially infringe on the as-yet unissued patent by developing or using similar technology without knowing about such patents.
 
Disadvantage for Foreigners
 In the past, the most contentious intellectual-property argument between the United States and other countries, including Japan, has been whether Washington should move to a "first-to-file" system, which awards a patent to the first party to log its paperwork. The United States now awards patents to Americans, but not to foreigners, who can document that they were first to think of an invention. Many believe, however, that the recent GATT accord rendered the first-to-invent issue irrelevant. The agreement would eliminate a provision of American law that foreign inventors be awarded patents based on their date of application rather than their date of invention.
Another change agreed to by the United States had been sought by the domestic software industry. It expands the rights of a company to challenge patents once they have been issued. Under Mr. Lehman, the Patent Office has moved to revoke two software patents, one issued to Compton's New Media, a subsidiary of Tribune Publishing, and one issued to the Software Advertising Corporation of Rancho La Costa, Calif.
The Patent Office has acknowledged that in the short term, it is ill equipped to adequately examine software applications, which have doubled in recent years. Mr. Lehman said that the provision, along with 18-month publication, would allow industry to weed out inappropriate patents early and cut down on litigation.
The changes in the accord require legislative action in both countries. Although legislation have been introduced covering each of the proposed American changes, it is by no means certain that Congress will write these provisions into law.
Critics of the agreement include independent inventors, who argue that they will be hurt by the provision for 20-year patents dating from the application, because the Patent Office often takes a long time to grant pioneering patents.
With an 18-month publication rule, these inventors say, they will have to disclose their secrets to competitors without any assurance that they will ultimately be granted a patent -- in essence, a guarantee of the exclusive right to develop an invention.
"Frankly, I'm shocked that a treaty of this nature should be signed without any warning," said Paul C. Heckel, a software designer in the Silicon Valley who heads a loose coalition of independent inventors.
Another group, backed by Jerome H. Lemelson, who holds more patents than any other living inventor, has recently taken out full-page advertisements in The Washington Post objecting to the 20-year term.
Commissioner Lehman, who in the past has been receptive to the concerns of independent inventors, seemed today to have lost patience. "There's been a major campaign by people who have an ax to grind," he said. "They claim they are representing small inventors" But he said the inventors were being misled, as they are "unsophisticated and don't have access to the right information."
Just over two weeks ago, the Clinton Administration had formally accused Japan of discriminating against American companies in awarding government contracts for medical and telecommunications equipment. It set in motion a 60-day timetable for imposing sanctions against the Japanese, taking action a few days after the broader trade talks had reached an impasse. Today's signing, therefore, was a marked change of mood.
Yet even with the progress in the patent agreement, other talks on intellectual property are likely to continue. American officials want an accord protecting copyrights, a provision preventing forced disclosure of trade secrets in Japanese courts, and agreement on the period under which trademarks can be protected.

HEADLINE: A Master Builder for Asia's Future

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Conventional wisdom, and the lucre of those in the business, suggest that the biggest game in town here is property, lots of it, pumping its value to levels beyond even Tokyo's galactic heights, building office and apartment towers with a frenzy. But Gordon Wu, from his office 64 floors above a skyline of mirrored stalagmites, dismisses the way of his fellow tycoons here.
"That's for every Tom, Dick, Harry and Trump," he said. "I want to go into infrastructure." 
 Mr. Wu has been hugely successful in property and buildings, although like many developers he had a nasty scare when the market disintegrated in the early 1980's. But for the last decade he has concentrated on long-term projects, building superhighways and power plants throughout Asia.
"There's no doubt we'll become probably the world's largest independent power producer," Mr. Wu declared, his verbal swagger more off-handed than boastful.
He has four power projects up and running, one in China, and three in the Philippines. Two more are under construction, one in China and another in the Philippines, and negotiations are under way for power projects in China, Indonesia and Pakistan.
Last month, Mr. Wu opened China's first superhighway, a $1.1 billion, six-lane toll road running 77 miles from the border of Hong Kong to Guangzhou, the commercial hub of southern China. Work on a second highway, from the Portuguese colony of Macao to Guangzhou, starts in October, and Mr. Wu hopes to finish a 400-mile highway stretching from Guangzhou to Changsha, the capital of Hunan province in central China, before the end of the century.
"I'll explain the logic of this," Mr. Wu said, unfurling a map of China on the mahogany conference table in his office. "I want Hong Kong to be really successful. If you look at the history of America, you have Boston. You have Philadelphia. You have Baltimore, Savannah. How come all of these ports were not No. 1? How come New York was No. 1? It was because of the Hudson River, the Erie Canal, the Great Lakes. If you want Hong Kong to be on the map, the only way to do it is to put this road into the center of China."
With such plans, Mr. Wu and his main company, Hopewell Holdings, have won a reputation for boldness that sets him apart from many of his fellow hongs, or large conglomerates. "The company," a Credit Lyonnais Securities report put it, "has acquired something of a reputation for becoming involved in visionary and often risky projects in locations where other investors feared to tread."
Mr. Wu, now 58 years old, was born in the Wanchai district here, about half a mile from the glittery central business district where the round, dirty-white Hopewell Office tower sits. His father started as a taxi driver and assembled a fleet of 378 taxis before he turned to building one of Hong Kong's larger property and construction concerns. After a rigorous education provided by Irish Jesuits, the younger Mr. Wu studied engineering at Princeton University. He returned to Hong Kong to earn his certification as an architect.
 
Over the Doorstep to China
 Like many other Hong Kong developers, Mr. Wu flourished during the 1970's as property prices began their steep upward spiral. When China cracked open the door to outside investment in 1979, Mr. Wu was one of the first over the threshold, moving from property developer to a career in Asian infrastructure.
Most analysts of Mr. Wu's empire, a dizzying tangle of companies including hotels, construction, power plant management, engineering, finance and highway concerns, admire his vision but confess to having difficulty figuring it all out. Last December, Hopewell Holdings, which showed profits of $267 million last year, up 25 percent over 1992, spun off a subsidiary, Consolidated Electric Power Asia, as a publicly listed company to manage power projects, while retaining 44.5 percent.
"It's very difficult to value the company because the projects are very complex," said John Pinkel, an analyst at HG Asia. "It is very difficult to get a hold on the complex subsidiaries and the cash flow and the financing situation. But he does have a vision. You have to like the concept of building roads and power plants. The concept is very sound. They need roads, and they need power plants in Asia. But the mechanics of doing it are very, very difficult."
 
American Competitors
 Mr. Wu has no competitors among the major hongs here across the range of his infrastructure projects. It is the big American power development companies active in Asia's booming power sector, like Mission, AES Transpower Inc. and the Enron Power Development Corporation, that jockey with him for power projects. No one else has tried to muscle into highway building in China. In Thailand, where Mr. Wu won his contract for a road, rail and retail system in 1990, his problems lie more with the Thai Government bureaucracy than with rival developers.
When Mr. Wu began talking about his highway to Guangzhou more than a decade ago, not many people in Hong Kong thought he could do it. China was, and remains, a difficult place to do business, but Mr. Wu, like some analysts, is convinced the struggle is paying off.
"I've got no doubt that the road will be exceptionally profitable," said Paul Deayton, an analyst at Lehman Brothers Asia. "Despite problems with toll collection," -- it costs about $13 to drive the highway -- "he's been developing shopping malls under the road. Within three years, the road will be contributing about $1 billion a year," in Hong Kong dollars, or about $131 million in American money, he added.
 
'Right Place at the Right Time'
 Similarly, Mr. Wu's power projects, while slow in gestation, are now seen as prescient. "He's been in the right place at the right time to exploit an industry that is in a massive growth phase," Mr. Deayton said. "The Chinese want to add 17,000 megawatts per year over the next 10 years. Their installed capacity is 175,000 megawatts, so they want to increase 10 percent per year for the next 10 years."
Mr. Wu explained, "We see the opportunity in power generation for the simple fact that in this part of the world they need a lot of power."
Later this month Mr. Wu will take an exploratory trip to India, which has an acute shortage of power. He has already signed a letter of intent to build eight 660-megawatt power plants in Pakistan.
Mr. Wu says he has become accustomed to long delays in projects. "I'm getting now to be very philosophical about bureaucracy," he said.
 
Delays in Thailand
 His project to build a highway, elevated light rail and retail system through downtown Bangkok has been on the books for several years, and some analysts suggest it may have to be written off.
"It really is the Thai Government that is holding things up," Mr. Deayton said. "I don't think the political will is there."
But Mr. Wu, conditioned to skeptics, is pushing on. "The struggle is nearly over," he said. "I was finally able to convince the Thai Cabinet don't go underground. 'For Pete's sake,' I told them, 'we all have to go underground. Why hurry it?' We're on the threshold."
While there have been legions of skeptics, bankers have not been among them. With little effort, Hopewell raised a total of nearly $1 billion during 1991 and 1992.
"In my 36 years of work, I can honestly say I've never had to stop a project for lack of money," Mr. Wu said. "There's lots of bankers out there ready to find me money, for a fee of course."
 
The Chinese Connection
 With China consuming about 60 percent of his companies' time and resources, Mr. Wu protested last month when Prime Minister Li Peng declared a 12 percent cap on profits for foreign-financed power projects in China. That cap was raised to 15 percent, which Mr. Wu finds still too low, but in the end, manageable.
Many analysts admire Mr. Wu's deftness, and connections, in China. Before the Tiananmen massacre in June 1989, Mr. Wu was close to then- Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang, who was deposed for opposing military action against the student protesters. Mr. Wu quickly renewed his relationship with his successor, Li Peng, whom he knew from his first power project in China, and the man many Chinese hold responsible for the bloodshed at Tiananmen.
"Zhao gave me support not because of a personal friendship but rather because what I do is what China needs," Mr. Wu said. "So in a way I get the support of everybody; 1989 is five years ago, and I'm still doing new things."
Similarly, Mr. Wu dismisses as irrelevant a prospect that concerns some investors, the resumption of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.
"I know exactly what will happen after 1997 -- 1998," he said. "China has tried every possible economic policy since 1949, the Great Leap Forward, central planning, the Cultural Revolution, you name it, private plots, communes, all sorts of things. And finally they tried this little pitch called open door and reform. Now look at the refrigerators and color TV's. I don't think they want to change. And actually, it is that reason I have so much confidence."

HEADLINE: Israel to Tax Stock Gains

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Aug. 16

 BODY:
Finance Minister Avraham Shohat, in a reversal of Israeli policy, said today that he wanted to impose a 10 percent capital-gains tax on the Tel Aviv stock market.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin quickly embraced the proposal to impose the 10 percent tax, starting Jan. 1, on real profits from stock investments. Officials said it would reduce the burden of other taxes. 
 The announcement came at the close of trading in Israel. Prices of Israeli stocks traded on United States markets finished lower.
The American depository receipts of Teva Pharmaceutical fell $1.44, to $26.50, in heavy Nasdaq trading. Scitex lost 62.5 cents to close at $18.6250, also on the Nasdaq, and Tadiran Ltd. sank $1.625, to $17, on the New York Stock Exchange. The closed-end First Israel Fund was down $1, to $13.125, also on the Big Board.

HEADLINE: FEDERAL RESERVE RAISES KEY RATES TO COOL ECONOMY

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 16

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve raised the interest rates it controls today, hoping to prevent the economy's continuing strength from leading to inflation but making it more expensive for Americans to borrow money.
The central bank raised two short-term rates by half a percentage point each, more than most analysts had expected. The moves produced rallies in stock and bond markets, as investors acted on their beliefs that inflation would stay low and long-term rates would not keep rising. 
 The rate increases also prompted banks across the country to raise their prime rate, the rate that determines the cost of home equity loans, small-business loans and credit card balances.
Congressional Democrats and business groups reacted angrily, saying the Federal Reserve action risked a drastic slowdown of the economy. But the public response of the White House was calm, with officials emphasizing the Federal Reserve's independence and predicting continued economic growth.
High White House officials had signaled in recent days that they could accept an increase of a quarter of a percentage point. But a few officials, like Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, who among President Clinton's campaign advisers was most enthusiastic about a Government role to stimulate the economy, said they thought inflation was not a threat.
An official who insisted on anonymity said the Administration began anticipating an increase of half a percentage point this morning, after the Commerce Department reported that builders had started 4.7 percent more houses and apartments in July than they had in June, despite higher mortgage rates.
Today's action makes further rate increases less likely during the autumn Congressional campaign, the official said, a position that the Federal Reserve's announcement early this afternoon appeared to support.
The rate increases today will translate immediately into higher interest rates for small-business loans and home-equity loans. Rates for adjustable-rate mortgages and credit card balances will rise more slowly over the coming months and years, as lenders wait for regularly scheduled reviews of the terms of those loans. Fixed-rate mortgages may actually become a little cheaper, mirroring today's drop in interest rates on 30-year Treasury bonds as lenders worry less that inflation will erode their returns.
Higher rates could hurt Democrat ic efforts to contain the losses the party is widely expected to suffer in the November elections for the House and Senate, and could further depress President Clinton's political standing.
"I think it's bad for the economy, and if it's bad for the economy, then it's bad for elected officials," SenatorPaul S. Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat up for re-election, said in a telephone interview.
Today's increase was the fifth move this year by the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's policy-making body, met this morning and voted to raise the Federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for overnight loans, to 4.75 percent from 4.25 percent. The Federal Reserve Board also voted to lift the discount rate, the rate the Fed charges for its own loans to banks, to 4 percent from 3.5 percent.
The Federal Reserve controls the Federal funds rate by buying and selling government securities.
 
Wall Street Reacts
 In the markets today, the interest rate on 30-year Treasury bonds fell to 7.37 percent from 7.50 percent on Monday, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.28 points, to 3,784.57. John Lipsky, an economist at Salomon Brothers in New York, said the Federal Reserve's actions made the economy seem less likely to overheat and inflation less likely to erode the returns on long-term investments. So investors are more willing to invest in stocks and accept lower interest rates on bonds.
"There are a lot of investors who would like to believe the Goldilocks view of the economy -- not too hot, not too cold, but just right," Mr. Lipsky said.
With factories near full use, unemployment low and commodity prices rising, concerns about higher inflation in the months ahead led the Federal Reserve to act today, analysts agreed. The economy grew at an annual rate of 3.7 percent during the second quarter, a level many experts say is greater than the maximum that is sustainable without igniting inflation.
"These measures were taken against the background of evidence of continuing strength in the economic expansion and high levels of resource utilization," the Federal Reserve said in a statement about today's rate increases. "The actions are intended to keep inflationary pressures contained, and thereby foster sustainable economic growth."
Over the last 12 months, consumer prices have risen 2.8 percent, with the July rise put at three-tenths of 1 percent.
In looking for signs of future inflation, Federal Reserve officials try to gauge whether enough resources like unemployed labor, unused factory capacity and commodities are available to allow further economic growth. Unemployment stood at 6.1 percent in July, factories are running at the highest level in five years and commodity prices have been rising.
These signs have convinced a growing number of Federal Reserve officials that the economy is now operating at close to its full potential and may soon exceed that level if factories add overtime and compete for scarce materials. When the economy has operated above full capacity, notably in the late 1970's and to a lesser extent in the late 1980's, inflation has tended to rise.
"The dangers of running over are that you start running into higher rates of inflation," said Alan Blinder, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, in an interview at the beginning of last week.
 
Eye on the Elections
 The announcement today also offered a hint that the Federal Reserve may wait before raising rates again, possibly until after the Congressional elections on Nov. 8. "The Federal Reserve will continue to monitor economic and financial developments to gauge the appropriate stance of policy," the Fed's statement said. "But these actions are expected to be sufficient, at least for a time, to meet the objective of sustained, noninflationary growth."
Eugene J. Sherman, director of research at M. A. Schapiro & Company, a New York brokerage firm, said that with today's move, "I would expect the Fed to step aside now, with the next likely move at the November meeting, on Nov. 15."
The other rate increases this year came on Feb. 4, March 22 and April 18, with the Federal Reserve raising the Federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point each time, and on May 17, when the discount and Federal funds rates were raised half a point.
In Congressional testimony in July, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who is often called the second-most-powerful man in the country and the most powerful when it comes to the economy, said that it would be better to raise rates too much than too little.
"If we fail to recognize emerging inflationary forces, remedying that will be far more difficult and far more of a problem for the long-term stability of the economy in 1995 and beyond," he said.
Only a few Administration officials strongly disagree. Mr. Reich, who has sharply criticized the view that inflation is a risk, without actually criticizing the Federal Reserve by name, said in a recent interview that American workers produce more now in an hour than they did a year ago but their wages have not risen proportionately. So recent wage increases only begin to close that gap and do not threaten inflation, he said.
 
Varied Viewpoints
 But elsewhere in the Administration, notably at the White House and the Treasury Department, there have been much stronger worries that the economy might overheat, feeding inflation and provoking the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates drastically. Much higher rates could produce a recession that would hurt President Clinton's re-election prospects if the downturn lasted through the 1996 election, these officials warn.
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of the Council of Economic Advisers, has taken a particularly conciliatory approach to the Federal Reserve. For several weeks, she has said repeatedly that another quarter-point rate increase by the Fed would be consistent with the Administration's forecast in mid-July that the rate on three-month Treasury bills would average 4 percent.
But simple arithmetic shows that given this year's rises in interest rates, any further rate increase by the Fed, including today's, produces a full-year average of more than 4 percent. During an interview on Friday, Ms. Tyson acknowledged that this might be a problem for her forecast. She said that she still expected her forecast of 3 percent growth this year to be accurate but that interest rates might be higher because so much of the economic growth has come early in the year, putting pressure on the Fed to raise rates.

HEADLINE: THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: ECONOMISTS' VIEWS;
The Compromise Plan: A Last Hope, or a Hoax?

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Is the Mitchell plan, the Senate Democratic leadership's compromise on health care reform, the last best hope for achieving universal health insurance? Or is it a shell game, an exercise in deception that would waste tens of billions of dollars and discourage work efforts by the poor?
The answer, say health economists -- some with resignation, some with disgust -- is both. 
 "We're into camouflage," concludes Uwe Reinhardt of Princeton University, who nonetheless hopes Congress will seize the moment and pass the legislation. Martin Feldstein of Harvard, who would much prefer to tinker at the edges of the current system than go for broke, argues, "People ought to understand what it's about and what it costs."
In the early stages of the debate, the White House focused on what was then seen as the political imperative driving health care reform: containment of exploding costs. But as business interests began to assess the bottom line and Republicans pounded away at their theme of no new taxes, most eyes turned to the issue of who would pay for broader coverage.
 
Health Insurance Mine Field
 The Clinton Administration's bill put much of the financial burden on employers -- and thus indirectly on their workers, where it already is. But what had initially seemed to be the path of least political resistance proved to be a mine field sewn by small-business lobbies that wanted no part of an insurance mandate.
So Senator George J. Mitchell, the majority leader, expanded on an alternative independently drafted by Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee. His compromise would free employers of the obligation to provide insurance, provided that 19 out of 20 Americans receive it as a fringe from employers or buy it themselves with a little help from Uncle Sam.
The bill, which is now being debated in the Senate, postpones the day of reckoning on employer mandates until the year 2002. And it imposes only very modest new taxes. A tobacco levy would raise $7 billion in 2002, while taxes on insurance premiums would add another $21 billion -- small change on a national health care budget expected to exceed $1.9 trillion just eight years from now.
If that sounds too good to be true, Professor Feldstein would be happy to seat you at the head of the class. The shuffle of cash needed to finance vastly extended coverage, he says, is largely hidden in the fine print.
Mr. Feldstein, who was a member of President Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, calculates that a big indirect tax is buried in the requirement that insurance companies assume part of the cost of services for poor people now covered by Medicaid.
 
Overbilling the Insured
 Their benefits are more generous than those offered in the bill's standard package, but their premiums would be the same; presumably, the insurance companies would pass the extra cost on to their entire pool of customers. Mr. Feldstein estimates that would add $30 billion to everyone else's premiums, much the way hospitals now overbill the insured to cover the uninsured.
Senator Mitchell is not impressed by this back-of-the-envelope calculation. "They're one person's made-up numbers," he says, and they contradict the conclusions of the Office of Management and Budget, a White House agency. Transferring responsibilities for Medicaid to private businesses will generate substantial savings, he argues, perhaps even obviating the need for more burden-sharing by insurers' paying customers.
Mr. Reinhardt has little patience with this political dance. "One way or another," he says, "universal coverage requires a redistribution of $80 billion from the top to the bottom." The real issue is how to accomplish the transfer with minimal side effects. And here Mr. Feldstein's criticisms ring truer to many economists.
For one thing, the subsidies offered to low- income workers would distort incentives to organize production efficiently. Businesses would "sort" workers, concentrating low-wage workers in companies that did not provide insurance as a fringe to take maximum advantage of the Government's offer to subsidize the insurance of low-income families not otherwise covered.
Arguably most distressing, the sliding scale of subsidies intended to make insurance affordable for the working poor and struggling middle class would be a powerful disincentive to work.
As low-income workers earn more, they gradually lose eligibility to Government benefits ranging from food stamps to income tax credits -- a problem that is already widely blamed for keeping unskilled workers on welfare.
Yet, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the graduated withdrawal of the health insurance subsidies under the Mitchell plan would take another 30 to 55 cents more from an extra dollar in wages. "In the end," the budget office concludes, "some low-wage workers would keep as little as 15 cents of every additional dollar they earned."
These problems are not unique to the Mitchell draft. "Every ambitious reform proposal before Congress has significant economic flaws," says Robert Reischauer, head of the Congressional Budget Office.
Mr. Reinhardt is more pointed, saying, "The approach favored by Senator Dole, who is leading the opposition, is no better than the Mitchell plan."
But as a technical matter, these problems are not intractable. Indeed, there is broad agreement, if not consensus, among economists on the outlines of a simple financing structure that would avoid the pitfalls of employer or individual mandates.
Some basic level of care could be financed from a national sales tax or some other broad-based tax that would have a relatively small impact on incentives to work or save. Everyone, rich or poor, would receive a voucher that could be used to buy insurance through employer-organized groups or directly from the market.
To assure that the voucher bought adequate coverage for people with varying degrees of health risk, its redemption value to a private insurer or umbrella health care provider would be linked to the age, health and other vital statistics of the insured. Those who wanted to buy richer benefits could do so at their own expense.
This is the approach used in many industrialized countries, notably Germany.
But this generic approach to financing health care is about the only one lacking political champions outside the ivory tower. Nor is it likely to win many, since it would create the image -- though not the reality -- of much bigger government.
 
Radical vs. Gradual Change
 Thus, the $64 question in health care finance today is whether any broad reform plan that could clear the political hurdles is worth the trouble. Or, as Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution, sees it, whether it makes sense to pass some variation on the Mitchell bill now and vow to fix it up later, or simply try to patch up the existing system.
Mr. Reinhardt favors radical change, even flawed change. Both Medicaid and Medicare were riddled with perverse economic incentives when they were created, he notes, but have since been whipped into shape. And once several million more low-income Americans have access to health insurance at subsidized rates, he says, the politics will again focus on the core issues of deciding what benefits to deliver and how to deliver them for the least money.
Mr. Feldstein prefers evolutionary change, at least in part because he thinks there is no true health care crisis. "Most people are adequately insured now, and the rest have access to decent care when they are very ill," he says.
Professor Feldstein would abandon the goal of universal coverage and work instead to fix the most pressing problems in the current system: the inability of workers to take their insurance when they change jobs, and the failure of Medicaid to cover all Americans living in poverty.
All this saddens Mr. Bosworth, who, as a trustee of Blue Cross in Maryland, has viewed the growing problems of the health insurance system from the inside. What started as a high-minded quest to curb costs and extend coverage, he says, "is turning into a nightmare."

HEADLINE: Tailhook Accuser Participated in Leg-Shaving, Court Is Told

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev., Aug. 16

 BODY:
Court documents assert that Paula Coughlin, the woman considered the whistle-blower in the Tailhook scandal, participated in a leg-shaving episode on the night before she says she was assaulted by drunken aviators.
Ms. Coughlin has always insisted that she had not participated in raucous partying on the evening before she was assaulted.
In a memorandum filed in Federal District Court here, one defendant, the Las Vegas Hilton, says that Lieut. Rolando Diaz of the Navy testified in a sworn deposition that he shaved Ms. Coughlin's legs on Friday, Sept. 6, 1991, while she was dressed in her Navy uniform. 
 The Hilton memorandum said Lieutenant Diaz testified in a deposition on June 20, 1994, that Ms. Coughlin, at the time a Navy lieutenant, returned to a party later that night wearing a mini skirt and tank top, at which time she was "plastered."
Ms. Coughlin has asserted in depositions that she did not attend the party.
Ms. Coughlin and several other women have filed civil lawsuits against the Hilton and the San Diego-based Tailhook Association, maintaining that they were sexually assaulted at the 1991 gathering of Navy and Marine aviators. Ms. Coughlin's lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial on Sept. 12 in Federal court here.
Lieutenant Diaz said in his deposition that Ms. Coughlin "paid" for his services by signing his "Leg Shave '91" poster on a hotel suite wall. Hotel lawyers want a handwriting expert to determine if the message, "You made me see God. The PA Coughlin." was written by Ms. Coughlin.
A Reno lawyer, Eugene Wait, argued in a memorandum filed on Monday that Lieutenant Diaz's testimony contradicts Ms. Coughlin's statement that she had not felt well and had spent Friday night sleeping in her hotel room.
Ms. Coughlin's lawyer, Nancy Stagg, has said previously that the only event Ms. Coughlin attended was on Saturday night, when she says she was attacked by a group of drunken aviators.
Ms. Stagg was unavailable for comment when a call was placed to her office today.
Ms. Stagg is seeking to reopen depositions of two women, one of whom said that Ms. Coughlin attended Tailhook parties on Friday night. In Defense Department interviews, the woman initially said she knew that Ms. Coughlin was not present but apparently changed her statements when questioned by lawyers.
Ms. Coughlin, 32, was an admiral's aide when she filed claims that she had been sexually harassed while attending the 1991 Tailhook convention at the Hilton. More than 80 women subsequently made similar assertions, with a handful following Ms. Coughlin's lead and filing civil lawsuits. The women said they had been groped and fondled as they were forced down a gantlet of drunken revelers.
The Navy and Marine Corps pursued 140 harassment cases, but none led to a court-martial.
Ms. Coughlin resigned from the Navy in February, saying "covert attacks" had made it impossible for her to serve. She asserts that she is now unemployable because her skills as a helicopter pilot and maintenance officer cannot transfer to the private sector.

HEADLINE: Many Faces of Harlem's Main Street;
A Day in the Life of 125th: From Bustling to Restless to Cool

BYLINE: By MICHEL MARRIOTT 

 BODY:
It's 2 A.M. on Saturday and the Uptown Comedy Club at 125th Street and Fifth Avenue is literally shaking with the recorded thunder of rappers Warren G & Nate Dogg, playing a seemingly endless variation on the gangster-chic theme that dominates the street.
Much of 125th Street, Harlem's main commercial thoroughfare, surges with black youth on foot, on bicycles, on motorcycles, in automobiles, Jeeps and even a stretch limousine or two. A summer weekend ritual of see-and-be-seen, set to Harlem's hip-hop rhythms and sensibilities, has evolved on the street of Hughes, Divine, Powell and Malcolm X. 
 It is a place where thousands of the self-described cool, "def" and "dope" hang out while a slightly older set gathers in shadowy hole-in-the-wall bars.
It is also a place in which old tensions can ignite quickly. Earlier this month, the police, after reports of gunfire, clashed with 1,000 young people for almost an hour near the McDonald's restaurant at 125th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard. There were arrests and injuries. "These are good kids, no different than any other kids," said William Morange, the commander of Harlem's 28th Precinct, who stood in front of the Apollo Theater for much of last Friday night and early Saturday. "I don't know what happened."
Nighttime on 125th can be like that: fast, edgy, sometimes inexplicable.
But this is a stretch of Harlem with many guises. In the first hours of sunlight, it takes on the more measured cadence of work and worry, struggle and responsibility, and often pain. Even with its recurring promises of redevelopment, too few jobs and too much crime, violence and drugs, 125th Street is full of enterprise: storefronts, restaurants, churches, vendors' stands, theaters, banks and bars -- many decked in decors that range from the eccentric to the Afro-centric.
From the East River to the Hudson, the restless street only permits itself a fretful nap in the couple of hours just before daybreak. For the remaining 22, it becomes a street theater, offering scenes of the dramatic, comic, tragic, erotic, absurd and inspirational.
Herewith, a day in the life of 125th Street, the artery running through the heart of Harlem.
5:30 A.M., FRIDAY Clarence and Cleo Kenney seem to simply materialize beside their gleaming newsstand near the corner of Malcolm X Boulevard and 125th Street. The retired schoolteachers hurriedly stock and straighten bins of newspapers, magazines and comic books, most with black themes.
A few feet away, a 54-year-old homeless man wearing an eyepatch shuffles behind a shopping cart. For much of the day he will mine the mounds of curbside garbage rich in deposits of redeemable bottles and cans. Across the street men and women, many with signs of slumber clinging to their faces, stop by a coffee-and-doughnut stand before climbing like sleepwalkers into buses and subway cars: workbound.
As the predawn darkness begins its daily retreat, 125th Street begins to pulse with life. As sure as the morning, Joe Knight, a 50-year-old unemployed bookbinder, makes his way to 125th Street.
Once there, Mr. Knight works the street for "any change you can spare," approaching cars and trucks stopped by the traffic light at Malcolm X Boulevard. Police officers usually order him to move along, he says.
"They are trying to make this the new AK-47," Mr. Knight says, comparing the bottle of window spray hanging from his belt to an assault rifle. Mr. Knight, who says he is a Vietnam veteran, says the Giuliani administration's move against quality-of-life nuisances is making his pursuit of an "honest dollar" a crime.
He says he has been out of work for 22 months, his unemployment benefits ran out last year and he supports his three children through welfare benefits. For much of the morning, Mr. Knight, well-groomed in work pants, a light jacket and wide bent-brimmed hat, politely approaches drivers and asks them to help him make ends meet.
For hours he trots along the center line of 125th Street, asking for a handout. "It's my job," he says.
7 A.M. Anna Bates, a 61-year-old clerk at Woolworth's, is waiting patiently for the doors to open. She is respectfully referred to as "Big Moms" by generations of youngsters who have worked and grown up in the old five-and-dime store. She says she has worked there for the last 36 years. Next year, according to her plans, will be her last.
"It's about time to retire," she says with a self-satisfied chuckle.
7:30 A.M. Merchants are beginning to sweep and hose off their sidewalks; the frequency of buses growling along the street starts to increase, forming caravans of people arriving and leaving Harlem.
The first of the metal gates that are pulled down over storefronts at night like corrugated eyelids are unlocked and rattle loudly as they are hoisted.
Woolworth's gates, like many along the street, are painted in a carnival style that depicts black heroes and urban dreamscapes.
Before disappearing inside, Ms. Bates scans her street as it rustles with mounting activities.
"It has changed a lot," she says, remembering the early 1960's, when Jackie Wilson played the Apollo Theater and the street dressed its aspirations in a suit and tie rather than outsized T-shirts and sagging jeans.
NOON The street is fully transformed into its workday incarnation. There are few vacant storefronts. At Sister's African Hair Braiding Center, a score of customers line the walls, two or three deep. The stylists, mostly from West Africa, ply the ancient art of hair braiding from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M., seven days a week.
Many of the hair styles take four to five hours to complete, costing an average of $50, says Aminata Dia, the shop's manager, who is a native of Senegal.
"It's very nice and friendly here," says Bernice Nicks, 57, a woman in a wheelchair whose home attendant suggested getting her hair braided. Finger-length braids frame her face. "It's my first time and I think it looks nice."
2 P.M. Along several blocks on the west side of the street, starting at Malcolm X Boulevard, the sidewalks are crammed with vendors' stands, many stretched end to end. They sell almost anything that can fit on folding tables or hang from chain-link fences, from T-shirts to bean pies to bootleg videotapes of movies as new as "The Mask" and "The Lion King."
Many merchants are West African and much of their wares are from their homelands: beads, wooden jewelry, sandals, art objects, musical instruments, kente and mud cloth by the bolt or fashioned into suits and shirts and dresses. The vendors lend a touch of charm and chaos to 125th Street, though they have been a source of considerable irritation to rent-paying merchants who have been lobbying to get them off the street. Despite all city efforts, they remain.
Even some of the vendors consider the situation out of control.
"I'm not happy," says Jimmy Lee, who has been a street vendor for 35 years in Harlem. He sells handmade pillows on the southeast corner of 125th Street and African Square. "If their country is so great why are they coming here?"
Mr. Lee, 50, who says his father is from Africa, says American-born black vendors are being squeezed off 125th Street by an influx of African vendors who the police have chased away from selling in Brooklyn and the Bronx.
8 P.M. Vendors and merchants begin to leave 125th Street. Some say the absence of a heavy police presence makes it dangerous to do business at night.
9 P.M. The first tides of teen-agers and young adults begin to flood 125th. Now it belongs to entrepreneurs like Antonio Gloss and Rodney Hunter.
Mr. Gloss, 28, equipped with his own air compressor, airbrushes T-shirts to order -- $15 and up -- right on the street like a contemporary Impressionist. In the glow of the Apollo marquee, he creates colorful fantasies of street scenes and characters, each signed with his logo: Harlem 125th Street.
Mr. Hunter, 26, is one of several photographers who for $6 will take a Polaroid picture of anyone who wants to pose against wall-sized paintings of favorite rap artists.
MIDNIGHT Scores of people want to document their night memories of 125th Street with Mr. Hunter and Mr. Gloss.
"People like taking pictures," Mr. Hunter says. "They want it to last forever."
2 A.M., SATURDAY There are polished cars and buffed bodies moving to their own midtempo, bass-heavy sound tracks. It's a virtual block party as far as the eye can see, complete with malt liquor and marijuana, soda and potato chips.
The party is still pounding the old pavement of 125th Street until 3:30 A.M., providing the opportunity for Mychele Boykin, 18, of Jamaica, Queens, and Steven Wright, 19, of the Bronx, to meet and exchange telephone numbers.
"He just came up to me and said, 'What's your name?' " Ms. Boykin said of their not-so-chance meeting on the street.
Dewayne Shelton, a 25-year-old telephone cable splicer, rode his 10-speed mountain bike to 125th Street from the Bronx to observe the street scene. "This is our village," he said.

GRAPHIC: Photos: The artery from which life springs in Harlem is 125th Street. Nearly always awake, its moods vary with the hour. In the daytime, it is center for enterprise. Starting at Malcolm X Boulevard, vendors cram the sidewalks with their wares. (Ozier Muhammad/The New York Times); Nighttime on 125th Street has its moments of tension and excitement, but most of all it is a time to meet people.

HEADLINE: On Economics, the Teacher May Need Homework

BYLINE: By SUSAN ANTILLA 

 BODY:
The educational video opens with a scene of high school seniors boasting about graduation gifts from their parents: a trip to Europe for one, a convertible sports car for another. After hearing what her friends received, a student named Jen goes home to get the bad news. Her parents are giving her a mutual fund.
"I don't even know what it does," says Jen, disappointed with such a boring gift. 
 Chances are, neither do her teachers. High school teachers instructing the growing number of business and economics classes are often patching together a curriculum that includes handouts from self-interested corporations and lectures by local business people, who may seize the opportunity to pitch their wares to a captive audience.
High school business teachers have a lot to learn, said Sue Duncan of the Investment Company Institute in Washington, a mutual fund trade group that produced the 11-minute "Mutual Fundamentals" video. Indeed, the video "was produced as much for teachers as it was for students," she said.
In workshops for business and economics teachers in five cities this year, Ms. Duncan found that 22 percent of the teachers had "little or no knowledge" of mutual funds, the nation's most popular investment vehicle. "They were uncomfortable enough with the topic to tell us we would be wasting our time and money if we produced materials for students without giving teacher training," said Ms. Duncan, who directs the institute's education foundation.
William B. Walstad, director of the University of Nebraska's National Center for Research in Economic Education in Lincoln, Neb., acknowledged that "many practicing teachers have never had an economics course, yet they're teaching it."
The reasons are several. Business and economics are frequently taught under the umbrella of a school's social studies department, and many social studies teachers are trained in history, not economics. "A lot of history teachers shied away from economics because it might have been harder than that course in political science," Mr. Walstad said.
Ms. Duncan discovered early that one of the great challenges was finding business and economics teachers in the first place. They are scattered among high school departments of history, social studies, civics, mathematics and consumer education, among others. "It's all over the place," she said. "We couldn't even find a standardized economic text" that might offer clues as to what students were being taught.
In one of the institute's taped sessions with groups of high school economics teachers, one participant admitted that "you get to be a real good scavenger" when you teach business or economics, gathering handouts from banks, insurance companies, brokerage firms and Federal agencies. To keep up the pace -- and to introduce some expertise -- the teachers frequently called in local stockbrokers, insurance salesmen or bankers to teach a class.
But professional participation has its price, said David Earl, the vice president of curriculum at Junior Achievement, a national nonprofit group in Colorado Springs that helps educate students on business and the economy. "Every now and again, you've got to be careful with a volunteer handing out business cards and saying, 'If your folks need insurance, call me.' "
To be sure, progress has been made from the days when business education in high schools consisted of a smattering of lectures squeezed into the accounting course offered to students in vocational education. Only 16 percent of high school students took a course in economics in 1961, Mr. Walstad said. That rose to 29 percent by 1988 and 44 percent by 1990.
But from Mr. Walstad's glass-is-half-empty perspective, the reality is that "a good portion of high school students never get instruction in economics." Those who do, he said, will be shortchanged if their teachers cannot explain the basics.
And many are shortchanged, according to a national survey of 1,005 high school seniors, college seniors and the public, conducted in 1992 by the National Center for Research in Economic Education and the Gallup Organization. The high school seniors who were surveyed answered correctly only 35 percent of the basic questions about the economy. The public did almost as badly, answering 39 percent of the questions correctly -- a result that suggests that virtually everything Americans know about the subject, they learned by 12th grade.
College seniors did somewhat better. They answered correctly 51 percent of the questions about unemployment, profits and supply and demand. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points for the public's responses and 6 percentage points for the students' responses.
To many educators, the addition of business and the economy as an area of emphasis no doubt sounds like one more luxury that they can ill afford when reading and math scores remain weak.
 
Economics as a Basic
 But Mr. Walstad contends that an understanding of economics is no luxury. "You and I can choose to deal with the world of the arts or music," he said. "But we deal with economics in our careers, as consumers and as voters. You can't escape it, and in that sense I see it as critically important as math, reading and the sciences."
Several institutions are trying to fill this educational void, among them Junior Achievement and the University of Nebraska's National Center for Research in Economics Education. And where new teaching jobs are opening up, more people qualified to teach economics and business are slowly filling them, a response in part to the struggling economy of recent years.
"An increasing number of people with bachelor's degrees in business administration are coming back to school to get a teacher certification," said Janet Treichel, director of the National Business Education Association. "A lot of people went into the business world and were affected by the ups and downs of the economy once they got there."
It is also a "quality of life issue," she said, noting that the prospect of having summers off and shorter work days as teachers appeals to many business people with uncertain futures at large corporations.
Ms. Treichel noted, too, that colleges are trying to strengthen teachers' preparation and expertise in their core subjects, like economics, by mandating that the undergraduate degree be taken in one of those subjects; the teaching certificate is treated like a breed apart. "It used to be without exception that you got your teaching credentials in the course of your four-year degree," Ms. Treichel said. "But now, increasingly, the teaching credential is in a fifth year program."

HEADLINE: Challenger Assails G.O.P. Front-Runner

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEWINGTON, Conn., Aug. 16

 BODY:
Far ahead in the race for Governor, according to polls, John Rowland was attacked by a challenger within his own Republican Party this week for his conduct as a Representative and former Representative.
While representing the Waterbury area for six years during the 80's, Mr. Rowland wrote 108 overdraft checks on his account in the House bank, his challenger, Secretary of the State Pauline Kezer, said in her first radio advertisement, broadcast on Monday, and repeated in their first debate today. 
 After losing the three-way race for Governor in 1990, the advertisement also said, Mr. Rowland then "peddled his influence as a lobbyist, making almost a million dollars in two years from the companies that laid off thousands of Connecticut workers."
The advertisement was immediately protested by Mr. Rowland and by the Republican State Chairman, John A. Mastropietro, who called on Mrs. Kezer to withdraw it. Mr. Mastropietro said Mrs. Kezer, who qualified for a primary by only a three-vote margin at the party's convention, had broken a pledge to delegates and party officials to wage a primary based on the issues.
Personal attacks, Mr. Mastropietro warned, could damage the candidates so much that the party would be unable to unite for the fall campaign, where many Republicans think Mr. Rowland can capture the Governor's office for the party for the first time since 1970.
Mrs. Kezer's attacks on Mr. Rowland are almost certainly a preview of what he would face in the general election. It will again be a three-way race, with Lieut. Gov. Eunice Groark seeking to succeed Lowell P. Weicker Jr. under the banner of A Connecticut Party, and the winner of a Democratic primary between State Senator John Larson and State Comptroller William Curry.
On Monday, Mrs. Groark called a news conference to complain about Mr. Rowland's broadsides on the state government, which he accuses of discouraging businesses while coddling criminals. Mrs. Groark said he was distorting the Weicker administration's record, and she called him childish and "not able to color within the lines."
Mr. Rowland, in the debate today with Mrs. Kezer on radio station WPOP, said: "There are 54 reasons why Pauline has launched this negative, nasty ad. The 54 reasons are that I'm 54 percent ahead in the polls."
He has acknowledged his overdrafts on the House bank, a common practice among many House members that led some to defeat in 1992 after voters learned of the taxpayer-supported courtesy. He noted that he, like other members, always covered the overdrafts with subsequent deposits.
He said Mrs. Kezer had distorted his business record. He was a consultant, he said, not a lobbyist, for large Connecticut military contractors, including United Technologies and Electric Boat. And his total income for 1992 and 1993, he said, was not a million dollars, but $754,149.
But Mr. Rowland's main response to Mrs. Kezer's attacks today was that voters are interested only in positive discussions of the issues facing them now.
 
Not Withdrawing Ad
 "When I'm out talking to people," he said, "people are talking about jobs. They're talking about the economy, they're talking about the income tax, they're talking about people leaving the state, they're talking about spending, they're talking about welfare reform, they're talking about education.
"They're not talking about something that went on five years ago in Washington."
Mrs. Kezer, seated across a table from Mr. Rowland during the debate, said she would not withdraw the advertisement. She was comparing his experience with hers, she said: his was as a lawmaker in Washington and then as a consultant in Washington, while hers was in state government here in Connecticut.
"What I am simply trying to do," she said, "is talk about the last four years and what I have done, and the last four years when John has been in D.C. working for large companies in Connecticut that have unfortunately been laying off a lot of people."
Today's debate featured familiar themes, with Mr. Rowland repeating his pledge to repeal the state's income tax within five years, and Mrs. Kezer saying it could be scaled back but not eliminated.
Mr. Rowland said he wanted to focus the state's economic development efforts on small businesses, while Mrs. Kezer said the efforts should be focused on businesses, large or small, in industries identified as especially promising for the state.

Rate Move Buoys Price Of Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose sharply yesterday, after the Federal Reserve announced its fifth interest rate increase of the year.
The price of the 30-year bond climbed 120/32 , to 10118/32 , for a yield of 7.37 percent, down from 7.50 percent on Monday. The yield was the lowest in nearly two weeks. Before the Fed began raising interest rates, starting with an increase in the funds rate on Feb. 4, the yield was 6.35 percent. 
 The drop of 13 basis points in the yield on the 30-year bond nearly matched the drop of 18 basis points on May 17, when the Fed increased short-term rates by half a percentage point. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
A technical analyst with Salomon Brothers, Alex Saitta, said that in the last 25 times the Fed had raised its target for the Federal funds rate, the 30-year bond had rallied 12 times and fallen 13.
The Fed announced the increase in the discount rate to 4 percent, from 3.50 percent, and the increase in its target for the Federal funds rate to 4.75 percent, from 4.25 percent, at an early afternoon news conference. The discount rate is the interest charged on loans to member banks. The Federal funds rate is the interest on overnight loans between banks.
 
Evidence of Expansion
 The Fed said it had made the moves based upon a background of evidence of continuing strength in the economic expansion and high levels of resource utilization.
The increase in the discount rate and Federal funds target rate "are expected to be sufficient, at least for a time, to meet the objective of sustained, noninflationary growth," the Fed said in a release.
But some economists said the statement could be a signal that another rate increase was unlikely when the Fed's policy making Federal Open Market Committee meets again in September. The situation could change, they said, by the next meeting -- after the Congressional elections -- in November.
Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Securities, said "that this move clearly demonstrates the Fed's determination to avoid inflationary pressures, and in fact was somewhat stronger than many had expected."
"The economy may be slowing somewhat," he added, "but the Fed thinks current economic growth still exceeds what it believes is the economy's noninflationary long-run growth path."
Mr. Fine said he thought the Fed believed that a growth rate of 2.5 percent was noninflationary, and until that rate was achieved, the Fed would lean toward further tightening. So, if the economy and capacity utilization continue to rise, there could be another move before the end of year.
 
Limiting Risk
 Before the interest rate increase yesterday, many market participants had said that bonds would rally only if the Fed made a move of half a percentage point. Some analysts had said the Fed would only make a quarter-point move, not wanting to risk slowing the economy too much.
The analysts who had leaned toward a half-point increase said that anything less would be regarded as too small to contain the higher inflation that would result if the economy kept growing. The market, they said, may also have interpreted a smaller move to mean that the Fed was not being aggressive enough with inflation, which erodes fixed income investments.
Joseph V. Battipaglia, managing director of Sterling Advisors, said yesterday's move by the Fed was probably the most widely anticipated of the five rate increases this year. And, he said, if the Fed had not acted, it would have raised questions about what it was up to.
"Now, it leaves no doubt," he said. "We're getting the proper response in bonds, with the short end up and long end coming off."
Concern about how much the Fed planned to raise interest rates overshadowed the impact of a report yesterday that showed construction of new houses rose 4.7 percent in July, which was more than expected, to an annualized rate of 1.415 million. The consensus among many analysts was for an increase of 2.1 percent, and an annualized rate of 1.379 million.
Elliott Platt, chief economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said that while housing starts for July were slightly stronger than expected, the increase had not tempered his belief that residential construction activity would no longer be a significant stimulative force for the economy.

3 Big Retailers Post Strong Earnings

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Three giant retailers -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the Dayton Hudson Corporation and the J. C. Penney Company -- reported strong earnings today for the latest quarter, a sign that consumers were still spending freely.
Wal-Mart, the nation's biggest retailer, said its earnings climbed 13.9 percent on record sales. The company, based in Bentonville, Ark., said it earned $564.8 million, or 25 cents a share, in its second quarter ended on July 31, compared with $495.9 million, or 22 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier. Sales climbed 23.2 percent, to a record $20.2 billion from $16.4 billion. 
 "We are pleased with our success in the second quarter, particularly in the discount store and Supercenter divisions, said David Glass, the chief executive officer.
"Our sales performance was very good in the food, electronics, basics, and seasonal categories."
He said the company had completed conversion of 35 former Woolco stores in Canada into the retail giant's format during the quarter. The balance of the 122 Woolco stores in Canada are expected to be converted into Wal-Mart stores during the third quarter, Wal-Mart said.
It also opened its first store in Hawaii and announced expansion into Brazil and Argentina.
Dayton Hudson, based in Minneapolis, said its second-quarter earnings soared 104 percent, to $49 million, from $24 million a year ago, because of better-than-expected results at some of its stores.
The company said the earnings were equal to 61 cents a share, up sharply from 28 cents a share a year earlier. Sales totaled $4.8 billion, up 14 percent, compared with $4.3 billion.
The profits exceeded Wall Street estimates.
"It was a strong quarter driven in part by substantial markdown performance improvement in all three divisions," said Bob Ulrich, chairman and chief executive officer of Dayton Hudson, the nation's fourth-largest retailer. The company said operating profits at its Mervyn's stores improved significantly over last year's weak performance.
Mervyn's has been a stubborn problem for the parent company as the unit suffered because of California's weak economy and an inventory control problem.
"Mervyn's is really where you expect them to show operating profit improvement" going forward, said Dean Ramos of Dain Bosworth Inc. in Minneapolis. "This shows how much leverage there is in the company."
Sales at the Target division of Dayton Hudson rose to $3.10 billion in the quarter from $2.61 billion a year ago. Its same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, rose 9 percent.
Mervyn's sales rose to $1.05 billion, from $1.02 billion last year. Same-store sales at Mervyn's dropped 1 percent, the company said.
J. C. Penney, based in Plano, Tex., said earnings for the quarter rose 17.9 percent, to $132 million, from $112 million a year ago. Sales rose 5 percent, to $4.2 billion from $4.0 billion.
The company said its per-share earnings increased 21 percent, to 51 cents, from 42 cents a year ago, when there were more shares outstanding.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Long-term enthusiasm for Sony, despite a dull near-term outlook.

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez 

 BODY:
THE news will not be good for the Sony Corporation when it reports its first-quarter earnings tomorrow. Analysts expect a replay close to the 33 percent drop in fourth-quarter earnings it reported in May.
The yen remains near post-World War II highs, and Japan's continuing trade surplus with the United States keeps it there. Moreover, Japan and Europe are only slowly emerging from recession, and that means fewer cash registers jingling for Walkmen, compact disks and tickets to movies from Sony's Columbia Studios. 
 So why does Sony's stock price continue to perform at levels not far below its 52-week high of $62.875 in July? One major reason is spelled "Last Action Hero," Columbia Studios' costly 1993 flop. The absence of a similar box office disaster this year, as well as the prospect of an economic recovery in Japan and Europe, is bound to improve Sony's prospects, analysts say. Buyers of Sony stock foresee a more profitable 1995.
If an American investor had bought $1,000 worth of Sony American depository receipts a year ago, the holding would be worth $1,381 today. In the same period, the Dow Jones industrial average gained only 6 percent, and the Nikkei 225 index was down half a percent.
Sony gained 37.5 cents yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange to close at $59.125 per A.D.R., which represents one ordinary share in Japan.
"We believe the long-term outlook for the company is very good, although the short-term outlook is likely to be dismal," said Barry Dargan, a technology analyst for S. G. Warburg Securities in Tokyo , who recommends the stock.
Zacks Investment's survey of Sony analysts put the median estimate for the June 30 quarter that will be reported tomorrow at 15 cents a share, down from 19 cents a share a year earlier.
But the analysts expect Sony's earnings for the year ending March 31, 1995, to be 94 cents a share, more than double the 41 cents a share of the 1994 fiscal year. That came on profit of $148.5 million on revenue of $36.2 billion.
Mr. Dargan of S. G. Warburg said the absence of a big-budget catastrophe like Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Last Action Hero" was sure to improve profit from its movie business. (Mr. Schwarzenegger's current hit, "True Lies," was made at 20th Century Fox and will not benefit Sony.)
While Sony did not put a figure on its write-off on "Last Action Hero," Takatoshi Yamamoto, an analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company in Tokyo, has estimated the operating loss for Columbia and other studios in Sony's movie group at 15 billion to 20 billion yen, or $150 million to $200 million.
Mr. Dargan says that all Sony has to do is return to historical levels of profit margins, a likely trend, and it will be earning substantially more money. Fiscal year 1994 profit margins for music and movies were only 3.1 percent, he said, less than half the 1993 levels of 7.2 percent.
Sony's hardware -- camcorders and the like as opposed to the "software" of movies and music -- might languish for years at 1994's profit margin of 2.9 percent (up from 2.5 percent in 1993), and Sony can still profit, Mr. Dargan said. But even in hardware, Sony is likely to come out a winner, said Eriko Yatabe, a credit analyst at Moody's Investors Service in New York.
The consumer electronics industry has struggled with few new blockbuster products (the last one was the camcorder years ago), a strong yen and price cutting. A major industry consolidation is likely, Ms. Yatabe says, and Sony is sure to be an unbowed survivor that posts increased sales and earnings. As one of the largest players in consumer electronics, Sony can spend billions of dollars on research and development to create new products that will make it more competitive.
By mid-1995, predicts Jeffrey L. Pittsburg of Goldis-Pittsburg Institutional Services in Garden City, L.I., Sony stock could reach the low 70's from its current below-$60 range. "Sony's not cheap," Mr. Pittsburg said. "But it's quite a reasonable stock that ought to be bought on weakness, and it's weak now."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Crude Oil Prices Plummet On Interest Rate Concerns

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices fell to their lowest point in nearly three months yesterday amid concerns that higher interest rates will slow economic growth and the demand for industrial fuel.
Prices tumbled late in the session, after the Federal Reserve pushed up short-term interest rates by half a percentage point. 
 "As you slow down the economy, it translates into less of a need for energy," said Tom Curtis, director of energy research for Pegasus Econometric Group in New York.
At the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for September delivery fell 47 cents, to $17.73 a barrel, the lowest daily settlement for the near-term futures contract since May 25.
Oil traders ignored developments in Nigeria, despite reports that labor unions were considering expanded strikes to win the release of Moshood K. O. Abiola, who was arrested and jailed by the military Government after apparently winning a June presidential election.
Nigerian oil workers have been on strike since July 4, damaging the nation's most important industry.
"It looks like the market is discounting Nigeria, and there's enough crude to go around, regardless of what happens in Nigeria," said Tom Bentz, director of energy trading for Quantum Financial Services in New York.
The American Petroleum Institute said in a weekly report released after the close of trading that United States crude oil stocks rose by 3.67 million barrels last week. The increase was at the high end of expectations, and could prompt further selling of crude oil futures today, analysts said.
Other energy contracts were mixed. September heating oil fell 0.56 cent, to 48.54 cents a gallon, while September unleaded gasoline rose 0.09 cent, to 54.92 cents a gallon.
On other commodity markets, livestock and coffee futures weakened. The Commodity Research Bureau's index fell 0.27 point, to 229.17.
Cattle futures fell amid signs that meatpackers and retailers had concluded their buying for the Labor Day weekend, which marks the end of backyard barbecuing in much of the country.
Live cattle for August delivery fell 1.13 cents, to 68.87 cents a pound, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while August feeder cattle fell 0.33 cent, to 78.37 cents a pound.
Green arabica coffee beans for September delivery fell 2.05 cents on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange on perceptions that a surge of 12.9 cents on Monday was overdone.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Advances Modestly After Fed's Rate Increases

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended only modestly higher against other leading currencies in volatile trading yesterday, despite strong rallies in the bond and stock markets after the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates.
The dollar plunged in early trading on fears that the widely anticipated increase would not come. It surged when the Fed announced an increase of one-half percentage point at midday, but the currency's strength faded later in the afternoon. 
 The currency market had already priced the Fed's inflation-fighting move into the dollar's value against the Japanese yen and German mark, analysts said. Dealers remain skeptical that rallies in dollar assets will be sustained long enough to increase demand significantly for the currency.
In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 100.50 yen, from 100.15 yen on Monday. The dollar also gained against the mark, rising to 1.5585 marks, from 1.5522 on Monday.
Yesterday, the Fed increased its target for the Federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other on overnight loans, to 4.75 percent. It also raised the discount rate, which the central bank charges on its own loans, to 4 percent.
The moves are expected to narrow the gap between interest rates in the United States and rates in Europe, particularly Germany, bolstering the dollar. Higher interest rates also benefit the dollar because they increase returns on dollar-denominated invesments.
Fed officials had hinted at a rate increase following data that suggested the economy was strenghening to the point where inflation could accelerate.
"I do not see it having a lasting impact on the dollar because it was so widely expected," said David Durst, a vice president at Bear, Stearns & Company.
But some market participants were surprised that the surge in Treasury prices after the Fed raised rates failed to lift the dollar further.
"A stronger bond market brings foreign buyers who have to pay for securities in dollars," said Tom Benfer, a director of foreign exchange for the Bank of Montreal in New York. "The capital markets have been driving the dollar all year."
In other currency trading in New York yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 1.3080 Swiss francs, up from 1.3030; at 5.3450 French francs, up from 5.3265, and at 1,588 Italian lire, down from 1,594.
The British pound fell to $1.5390 from $1.5420. The Canadian dollar rose to 72.55 United States cents from 72.40 cents

Defining the Choices That Add Up to Identity

BYLINE: By MARGO JEFFERSON 

 BODY:

I'm Not Stiller
 By Max Frisch
 Translated by Michael Bullock. 383 pages. Harcourt Brace. $12.95.
It's been a long time since the earth moved when we read pronouncements like "Man dies; and he is unhappy," or "Hell is other people," or "There are times, alone in my cell, when I have the feeling that I have only dreamed all this; that at any moment I could stand up, take my hands away from my face and look round in freedom, as though the prison were only within me." This is the way serious European writers expressed themselves in the 1940's and 50's: words like freedom, death and self blazed through the novels and plays of Sartre, Camus, Duerrenmatt and Max Frisch as sin and lust blazed through the film epics of Cecil B. DeMille. 
 And yet if you reread some of these works, which are as crucial to making sense of the cold war era as film noir, political witch hunts and rock-and-roll, you can find yourself swept away by the ardor the writers brought to questions of identity and morality, and by the resources they brought to the craft of fiction.
Take "I'm Not Stiller," by the Swiss writer Max Frisch, who died in 1991. First published in an abridged English version in 1958, it was republished in its entirety in Britain 12 years ago and has finally appeared in the United States. It exudes postwar high seriousness; it cannot wait to show off its many layers of meaning. First, "A Note to the Reader" informs us that we are being permitted to study "The strange history of Anatol Ludwig Stiller, sculptor, husband, lover . . . prisoner": the notebooks he wrote while in prison and his prosecutor's postscript. Then come several august lines from Kirkegaard on man's passion for freedom: the need to "choose oneself," rule out every possibility of becoming something else and, in that difficult choice, find happiness. Then comes the voice of Stiller himself: treacherous, evasive and compelling as an Edgar Allan Poe murderer or a Raymond Chandler detective.
"I'm not Stiller! -- Day after day, ever since I was put into this prison, which I shall describe in a minute, I have been saying it, swearing it, asking for whisky and refusing to make any other statement. For experience has taught me that without whisky I'm not myself, I'm open to all sorts of good influences and liable to play the part they want me to play, although it's not me at all." He is a prisoner in Switzerland (a country "so clean one can hardly breathe for hygiene") and the Swiss officers who arrest him are convinced he is a certain Anatol Stiller, who disappeared six years ago, leaving behind a wife, a mistress, a moderately successful career and a few minor political scandals. But he insists he is Jim White, an American with a past that includes Mexican peasants, Texas cowboys, the docks and back alleys of Northern California, and three murders, as yet untraced. What he wants is a life out of B. Traven and Dashiell Hammett, as filmed by John Huston.
And here he is instead, in pallid, prosperous Switzerland with a lawyer who presumes to consider him a sensible, law-abiding citizen. His response is to maintain "an almost insulting silence and stare out of the window at the old chestnut trees with my hands in my pockets, simply because in the long run I can't stand people of his sort -- people who can't imagine committing murder themselves, and therefore can't imagine that I could commit murder either."
Murders are committed, as it turns out, but as Stiller is brought face to face with the woman who says she is his wife and with the prosecutor who says Stiller has had an affair with his wife, it becomes clear that the murders in question are emotional, metaphorical and discreetly bourgeois. What binds Stiller and his strong-willed but long-suffering wife, Julika? A vacuum: the fact that they have never felt happy together or complete apart. What sets his dream of being another man in motion? A failure of nerve while fighting the Fascists in the Spanish Civil War. And his homeland, economically secure, politically neutral Switzerland is "incapable of suffering in any way over a spiritual compromise," he says. "They make things easier for themselves by simply outlawing the need for greatness."
Mr. Frisch is not really a novelist of ideas; he's a dramatist of ideas. We live out our ideas through our daily lives, after all, and he grasps every nuance of those daily habits and compulsions. It is the tension between these details and the larger ambitions -- so grandly imagined, so absurdly lived out -- that makes the novel work. Emily Dickinson wrote:
Our lives are Swiss --
So still -- so Cool
Till some odd afternoon
The Alps neglect their Curtains
And we look farther on!
When the curtain comes down one last time on the life of Anatol Ludwig Stiller, it is truly harrowing: it is a spiritual blackout.
